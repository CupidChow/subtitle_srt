1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Eating

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,060
Drinking

3
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,940
Naturally I had a都有

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,300
both youtube,

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,100
faFone,

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,400
remote

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And look at the items.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Look at the people who are sweet.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's a time to play with items.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let them fight each other.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If you throw them away, you will be punished.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You have to be a victim.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What are you doing?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Come out!

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Come out!

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Come out!

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The sun is setting.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The sun is setting.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Bang, eat one.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And I'm getting tired on that day.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Bang, Bang, Bang.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Bang, Bang.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Bang, you're so cute.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Bang, oh my god.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Bang, oh my god.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Bang, Bang, Bang.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Bang, Bang, Bang.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Bang, Bang, Bang.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Bang, Bang, Bang.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Bang, Bang, Bang.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Bang, Bang, Bang.

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What's your name?

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'll name it for you.

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
From now on, you will be called a ghost.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So that people will love you.

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Come on, stand up.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I wish you a good child.

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I wish you a good child.

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I wish you a happy and blessed day.

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm dead.

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm dead.

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm dead.

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Bang, Bang, Bang.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I told you, you're not a bad kid.

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're so beautiful.

46
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Bang, Bang, Bang.

47
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Come on, Tam.

48
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Come on, Tam.

49
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Come on.

50
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You're the best.

51
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You're so brave.

52
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
People know who's going to protect you.

53
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll hit you in the head.

54
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
No need.

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Let's go home.

56
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's go.

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let's go home.

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Take a break and have some water.

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's play.

60
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Thank you.

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Bang, water.

62
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Why do you get hit by a hurricane?

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
A sky-high sky.

64
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Are you okay?

65
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm fine.

66
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What's wrong?

67
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Come here.

68
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Come here.

69
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Come here.

70
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Come here.

71
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Let's go.

72
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Hurry up.

73
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Stop.

74
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Stop.

75
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What happened?

76
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't know.

77
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hurry and take me to the hospital.

78
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Stop.

79
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Help.

80
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Go.

81
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Go.

82
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Thank you.

83
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Here's your money.

84
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Thank you.

85
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll give you a lot.

86
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Here you go.

87
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Thank you.

88
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I think you should make more snacks for me.

89
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'll help you sell them.

90
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay.

91
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's too much.

92
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I don't do anything every day.

93
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I just let you study.

94
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're so smart this year.

95
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What do you want to study?

96
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I want to be a teacher.

97
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Good.

98
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I think you can study.

99
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'll study hard.

100
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'll go first.

101
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.

102
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Go.

103
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Go.

104
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Go.

105
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Go.

106
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Go.

107
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Go.

108
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Go.

109
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Go.

110
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm going to be a teacher.

111
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't want to be a teacher.

112
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'll be a teacher.

113
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll be a teacher.

114
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You're so annoying.

115
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Here, it's done.

116
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'll get the rest of the food.

117
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh, Pano.

118
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Uncle, here's my friend.

119
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Hey,

120
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
can you take a picture with me?

121
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Oh, why don't you smile?

122
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Here, here, here.

123
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Here, here, here.

124
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Come here.

125
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay, are you ready?

126
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Smile.

127
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Smile.

128
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
One, two, three.

129
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Where are you going?

130
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Hey, hey, hey.

131
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm so tired.

132
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm going to sleep.

133
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
This is just a box.

134
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You should take the box and throw it away.

135
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Be careful.

136
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Hey.

137
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Uncle.

138
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Where are you going?

139
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Uncle.

140
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Uncle.

141
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Uncle.

142
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Uncle.

143
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Uncle.

144
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Uncle.

145
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Uncle.

146
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Uncle.

147
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Don't you dare to talk to me.

148
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Are you going to kill me?

149
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Kill me.

150
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Just like you killed my mom.

151
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Uncle.

152
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Hey, why are you here?

153
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
P'Ak is here.

154
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I brought the bag.

155
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I told you not to mess with my son.

156
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You son of a bitch.

157
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Go.

158
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Uncle.

159
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Hey, brother.

160
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Brother.

161
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Brother.

162
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What are you doing?

163
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Mom.

164
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You son of a bitch.

165
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You are my wife.

166
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Mom, I'm fine.

167
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You hate me.

168
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You are afraid of me, right?

169
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Mom, I'm not afraid.

170
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Who is afraid?

171
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Whoever thinks, let them think.

172
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm lucky to die.

173
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm your friend and mother.

174
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Brother.

175
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I saw P'Ak was kicked and it didn't fit.

176
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
P'Ak is playing with things?

177
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Here.

178
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I don't eat.

179
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
P'Ak is here.

180
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
P'Ak.

181
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
P'Ak.

182
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
P'Ak is here.

183
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'll go with my son.

184
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What are you doing?

185
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Mom, don't do this.

186
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Look at the crying.

187
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Let me go.

188
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Let me go.

189
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Let me go.

190
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
P'Ak.

191
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
P'Ak.

192
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
P'Ak.

193
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
P'Ak.

194
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
This is Tos, a wild animal.

195
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
He has been selling fish since he was a kid.

196
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
He doesn't need to drink water.

197
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What do you want to know?

198
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I ate with him last night.

199
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But before, he told me he would go to find a fish.

200
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
A fish?

201
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Yes.

202
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Come here.

203
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Sawasdee.

204
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Sawasdee.

205
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Look at this.

206
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I think Tos will definitely do something like this.

207
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I think so.

208
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
P'Pan.

209
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Are you my husband?

210
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
P'Pan.

211
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
P'Pan.

212
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You're my husband.

213
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm your husband.

214
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
P'Pan.

215
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
P'Pan.

216
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You're my husband.

217
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
P'Pan.

218
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Sit down.

219
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
This is crazy.

220
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
How can you be so nice to me?

221
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That man died because of a real thing.

222
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Did you know anything?

223
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Tell me.

224
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I dreamt that I followed that man to the temple.

225
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
He has a lot of animals like that.

226
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Do you see that man's face?

227
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
No.

228
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But I remember the animals.

229
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Can you take a look at them?

230
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Let's go to the temple.

231
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
If you want to see anything, just let me know.

232
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Let's go.

233
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Let's go.

234
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
What's wrong?

235
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Why is it so heavy?

236
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Is it normal to be so painful?

237
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I've never been like this before.

238
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
What?

239
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's your first month?

240
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Thank you.

241
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Do you want to try?

242
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Try it.

243
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Are you still feeling pain?

244
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
No.

245
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Do you need to use the toilet?

246
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'll buy you medicine.

247
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Please go to the doctor.

248
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Why are you here?

249
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Go.

250
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's not about the man.

251
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Go.

252
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
How did you get here?

253
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You're a girl.

254
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Taew.

255
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
What are you doing here?

256
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Talk to your father.

257
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Okay.

258
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Excuse me.

259
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:44,360
Ram Klaυen

262
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
No

263
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,140
Are you alright?

264
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,220
We don't have anything.

265
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Zao! Zao!

266
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Zao! Zao!

267
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Zao! Zao!

268
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Zao! Zao!

269
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Zao!

270
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Zao!

271
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Zao!

272
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Zao!

273
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Zao!

274
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Zao!

275
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
What are you doing?

276
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
What are you doing?

277
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
No!

278
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
No!

279
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Let go of me!

280
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Let go!

281
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Don't let me go!

282
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Nawan, don't move!

283
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Go!

284
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Nuan!

285
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Help!

286
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Help!

287
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Help!

288
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Help!

289
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
What is the cause of death?

290
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
The girl has been suffering from blood loss for a long time.

291
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
The patient has a wide range of blood vessels.

292
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Since the accident, she has been suffering from food,

293
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
food,

294
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
and blood.

295
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So,

296
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
did you find anything that happened?

297
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I only found the girl who was sleeping,

298
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
who was holding my son's neck.

299
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And what kind of wound did you have?

300
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Chicken

301
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Ok, then.

302
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I didn't kill you, Teow.

303
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm trying to help you.

304
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Get out of here before I change my mind.

305
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Why do you think it's so easy to let him go?

306
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
We don't have evidence to blame that kid.

307
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
If I'm right, I won't take it.

308
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
You come here.

309
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I sent you to school to prove it to me.

310
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
You're so bad.

311
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I didn't kill you.

312
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
The one who has a hundred is the one who killed me.

313
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Don't mess with anyone.

314
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
If you don't want to see anyone die.

315
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Mom.

316
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Mom.

317
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Mom, let me go.

318
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I'll send you back to school so that you won't bother anything from Grandma's voice.

319
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Go find her.

320
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I'm scared.

321
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Grandma.

322
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I don't know what's going on.

323
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,400
What are you doing?

324
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Episode 1

325
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Do you know about the cat?

326
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,500
Yes.

327
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,000
It's so bright.

328
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's like the whole plan is full of it.

329
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's so dark.

330
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I can't even see it.

331
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Are you crazy?

332
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Let's go.

333
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I'm sorry.

334
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Don't worry, Tew.

335
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
No matter who they are,

336
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
we will pull their neck out.

337
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Episode 1

338
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You don't have to do it anymore.

339
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Don't you know that the boys are so sweet?

340
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
They can be as sweet as anyone.

341
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Can you help me?

342
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Sure.

343
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
What can I help you with?

344
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I heard that there used to be a temple in the past.

345
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I looked for it and found it everywhere.

346
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It's here.

347
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Episode 1

348
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I haven't cleaned it.

349
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Someone is still in here.

350
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Zip, thank you for trusting me.

351
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
You really love me.

352
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You're talking to E-Phano.

353
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Do you like him?

354
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
No.

355
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Why do you like him?

356
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm a fighter.

357
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Episode 1

358
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I've made a promise.

359
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Don't forget to tell me that you have a family.

360
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I will.

361
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Come here.

362
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Let go of me.

363
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Come here.

364
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Come here.

365
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Come here.

366
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Let go of me.

367
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Come here.

368
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Come here.

369
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Come here.

370
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
What's wrong with you?

371
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Don't do that.

372
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
You're so strong.

373
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Come here.

374
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
What's wrong with you?

375
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Come here.

376
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Are you okay?

377
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Pong.

378
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Pong.

379
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I promise that I will not go anywhere.

380
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
If I do,

381
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
will you talk to E-Phano?

382
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
That's enough.

383
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
No.

384
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Why do you like him?

385
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
We can't let them get away with it.

386
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
If they don't want to get away with it, they have to do it so nobody can mess with us.

387
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
No!

388
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
No!

389
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
No!

390
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
No!

391
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
No!

392
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
No!

393
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I hurt the student.

394
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I tried.

395
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But I couldn't control myself.

396
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You didn't do anything much. You're a fool.

397
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Please let them go.

398
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I ordered this time to be your wife.

399
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I'm sorry.

400
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I'm sorry.

401
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I'm sorry.

404
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I'm sorry.

405
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I'm sorry.

406
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I'm sorry.

407
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I'm sorry.

408
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I'm sorry.

409
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I'm sorry.

410
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I'm sorry.

411
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
No!

412
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Noom Tray.

413
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Noom Tray.

414
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Noom Tray!

415
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
What are you waiting for?

416
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I told you, I'm taking care of you.

417
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I don't want to do this.

418
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Dad!

419
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I told you, I don't want to do this.

420
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Dad!

421
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Why are you hurting me?

422
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Your mother?

423
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
She didn't think she was your mother.

424
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
She just accepted your offer.

425
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Dad!

426
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
You're in front of your father.

427
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
You can go wherever you want.

428
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Go!

429
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Mom!

430
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Mom!

431
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
You have to do this for your mother.

432
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
You've wasted 18 years.

433
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Let me go!

434
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
You're the one who killed me.

435
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
You're the one who killed me.

436
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Let's go, mom.

437
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Let's go.

438
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
What's wrong?

439
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I'm going to ask you now.

440
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Kano, get off!

441
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Kano!

442
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Kano!

443
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Kano!

444
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Kano!

445
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Help me, Kano!

446
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Mom!

447
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Kano!

448
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Kano!

449
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Kano!

450
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Mom!

451
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Please, help me.

452
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Mom!

453
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Please, help me.

454
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Help me.

455
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Help me.

456
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Hey, P'Pie, why are you here?

457
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Why are you here?

458
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I'm here to get my money.

459
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
What?

460
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Now that the money is all gone,

461
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
the father is dead.

462
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And the kid named Chippu-Woy-Wai

463
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
asked for something from him.

464
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Yes, sir.

465
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Please, help me.

466
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Yes, sir.

467
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Sir, what's in the room?

468
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Number 2.

469
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Sir, please.

470
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Here.

471
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
What's this?

472
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Yes, sir.

473
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Hey!

474
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Why are you here?

475
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
He said

476
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
that you accept my money.

477
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
What do you mean?

478
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,180
It's fine.

479
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,400
You sassy girl.

480
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,660
It's not prime, producer.

481
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:45,260
What's the meaning of this?

482
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:48,260
We were from home, we wanted to move to Bangkok

483
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:52,260
to pursue their dream until one day,

484
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,260
we met with those officials.

485
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,260
They paid the money to the big bank

486
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:04,260
to pay the money to one of the children.

487
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,260
Pull the tiger!

488
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,260
There's only one tiger物.

489
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:34,660
Is my proud will empty.

490
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:35,660
Not to be attacked.

491
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,420
What happens to them

492
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:42,100
to train them against their future spirit…

493
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:50,780
to stop its body and animals when a suitable64

494
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:54,380
along with the spirit.

495
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:01,060
Now I want my own view.

496
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,060
You read it yourself.

497
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,060
My life is over.

498
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:35,060
Children who want to die from hunger

499
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,060
can't go anywhere.

500
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:42,060
I'll raise another child to have a child.

501
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,060
What should I do?

502
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:48,060
Since that bad guy was born,

503
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:51,060
my life has been through a lot.

504
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:57,060
He was born to destroy my life.

505
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,060
I hate him.

506
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:03,060
I never thought he was a child.

507
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:09,060
But do you know how bad I am to him?

508
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:13,060
He never blames me.

509
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:15,060
He loves me.

510
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:17,060
He never left me.

511
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:25,060
Every time I see him trying to study,

512
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,060
I feel guilty for him.

513
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:35,060
Do you know how bad he must be?

514
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,060
I did this to him.

515
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:43,060
I should hate him or love him.

516
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:51,060
I'm sorry.

517
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:03,060
I'm sorry.

518
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:15,060
What are you doing?

519
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,060
Wait for me.

520
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:19,060
Wait for me.

521
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,060
Wait for me.

522
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,060
Wait for me.

523
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:04,060
Wait for me.

524
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:07,060
They are taking our stuff.

525
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:09,060
Wait for me.

526
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:26,060
Let him go.

527
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,060
Wait for me.

528
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:33,060
Wait for me.

529
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:38,060
Don't fight with me.

530
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,060
Let him go.

531
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:47,060
Don't do this.

532
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,060
Help me.

533
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:51,060
Please, help me.

534
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,060
Help me.

535
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:01,060
I can help you.

536
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:04,060
You have to use the knife to get inside.

537
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:06,060
Remember.

538
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:09,060
I'll stab you until you die.

539
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,060
I know.

540
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:16,060
I'm a little bit.

541
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:20,060
I'm a little bit.

542
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:23,060
I can't kill you.

543
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:28,060
Beat him to death.

544
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:30,060
Beat him to death.

545
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,060
Beat him to death.

546
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,060
I'll kill you.

547
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:38,060
Beat him to death.

548
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,060
I have to go to the police.

549
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,060
I'm going to the police.

550
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,060
No!

551
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:08,060
Yvanna!

552
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:20,060
Father, what is it that you are doing with me?

553
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:26,060
The Buddha can take away things from others and put them in his body.

554
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:31,060
When he knows that he can do it, he always helps his father.

555
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:38,060
The day that your mother died, the Buddha truly tried to help his mother.

556
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:49,060
Father, do you know that every time the Buddha took things from others,

557
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:55,060
he kept them in his body, no matter how painful it is, he never told anyone?

558
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,060
Yvanna!

559
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,060
Mother!

560
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:05,060
Father, I really don't know how dangerous it is that I have to do it.

561
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:07,060
Mother.

562
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:09,060
How can I live with mother?

563
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:11,060
He is a murderer.

564
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,060
Why didn't you tell me?

565
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:16,060
Because I don't dare.

566
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:23,060
Father, I'm sorry.

567
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:24,060
Thank you, son.

568
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:38,060
Thank you.

569
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,060
Don't you understand that I'm good to you?

570
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:44,060
The one who can take care of you is only me.

571
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:55,060
Where are you going?

572
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:00,060
I'm going to the temple.

573
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,060
It's too far away.

574
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,060
It's open to the public.

575
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:10,060
Before, he didn't know how to use it.

576
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:14,060
I won't give up the thing that we asked for.

577
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:16,060
No need.

578
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,060
You are waiting for me here.

579
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,060
I'll go with you.

580
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,060
You are waiting for me here.

581
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:26,060
Now, that kid, his stuff is all over the place.

582
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:30,060
It won't be long before he comes back to you.

583
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:54,060
Someone's captured by the truck.

584
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:06,620
Please accept my congratulations for the recognition

585
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:10,060
and giving me a proof that I was able to convince you of me

586
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:15,060
and a whole new generation.

587
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:21,060
I'm sorry.

588
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:32,060
Can you stay still?

589
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:35,060
I'll be back soon.

590
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,060
Don't go back early.

591
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:38,060
I'm sorry.

592
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:51,060
Why are you quiet?

593
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:55,060
You miss Panoi already?

594
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:00,060
I miss him so much.

595
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:06,060
I told you that I didn't like him.

596
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:08,060
I know.

597
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:16,060
Don't think too much.

598
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,060
Okay?

599
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:26,060
Bong.

600
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,060
Yes?

601
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:28,060
Have you heard of the news?

602
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:31,060
That it's a fight between the two mothers.

603
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:33,060
They fight until they get out of the house.

604
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:35,060
If it's true.

605
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:37,060
Why?

606
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:39,060
You miss him?

607
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:40,060
Are you crazy?

608
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:43,060
It's good that you can go miss him.

609
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:47,060
If he comes back, you'll be happy.

610
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,060
Aren't you afraid of him?

611
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,060
He's playing with things.

612
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:56,060
I'm not afraid.

613
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:58,060
I have good things.

614
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:07,060
I'm sorry.

615
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:12,060
Black dog blood.

616
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:14,060
Wash your hands.

617
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:16,060
I'm not playing with things.

618
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:19,060
Let's go.

619
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:20,060
I'm going home.

620
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:37,060
I'll be back.

621
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:39,060
I'll be back soon.

622
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,060
Panoi.

623
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:56,060
You miss me so much, right?

624
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:59,060
I'm here.

625
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:06,060
presentation

626
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:08,060
drawing

627
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:25,060
street

628
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,060
take care of family

629
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,060
live

630
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:37,060
Just like the sound of a ghost.

631
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:54,060
What are you afraid of?

632
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:57,060
Your hair is not your hair.

633
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:10,060
I'm afraid that I might fall.

634
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:23,060
You're not enough.

635
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,060
You're a new student.

636
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:30,060
You're so beautiful.

637
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,060
How can I let you go?

638
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:34,060
You're a good student.

639
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,060
I'm a good student.

640
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:45,060
I'm a good student.

641
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:47,060
I'm a good student.

642
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:52,060
You're so beautiful.

643
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:55,060
You're the best student in the university.

644
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:57,060
But you're a little bit more expensive.

645
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:00,060
I can't eat.

646
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:07,060
I'm afraid that I might fall.

647
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:27,060
Die.

648
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,060
Be careful.

649
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:03,060
Die.

650
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:13,060
You're a good student.

651
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,060
You're a good student.

652
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:19,060
But you're afraid that I might fall.

653
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:33,060
Die.

654
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:09,060
You dare to play with my son?

655
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:13,060
I'm afraid that I might fall.

656
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:15,060
I'm afraid that I might fall.

657
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:16,060
I'm afraid that I might fall.

658
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,060
You're a good student.

659
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:33,060
Die.

660
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:34,060
Die.

661
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:35,060
Die.

662
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:02,060
You're using your body with me?

663
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:03,060
You're a good student.

664
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:04,060
Die.

665
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:29,060
Madam.

666
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:31,060
You're a good student.

667
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:35,060
Die.

668
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:05,060
Die.

669
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:12,060
You've been doing this for a long time, right?

670
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:25,060
Who is this kid?

671
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:28,060
Your father.

672
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:30,060
He gave you a chance to play with you.

673
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:35,060
Father.

674
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:39,060
You're making me a bad student.

675
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:04,060
Die.

676
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:21,060
Pong.

677
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:29,060
I love you.

678
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:31,060
Don't leave me.

679
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:33,060
Don't leave me.

680
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:39,060
Let go of me.

681
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:40,060
Let go of me.

682
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:41,060
Let go of me.

683
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:44,060
Get out of here.

684
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:49,060
Madam.

685
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:51,060
I'm sorry.

686
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:52,060
Madam.

687
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:53,060
Madam.

688
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:54,060
I'm sorry.

689
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:57,060
Calm down.

690
01:17:57,060 --> 01:17:59,060
You're a good student.

691
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:00,060
You're a good student.

692
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:02,060
What are you doing?

693
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:03,060
Calm down.

694
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:04,060
Calm down.

695
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:05,060
Calm down.

696
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:08,060
If you don't find the girl or the girl who disappeared,

697
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:09,060
you'll be punished.

698
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:11,060
What are you doing?

699
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,060
You're a good student.

700
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,060
What happened?

701
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:15,060
Calm down.

702
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,060
The girl disappeared.

703
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:31,060
Madam.

704
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:33,060
Let me go.

705
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:34,060
Madam.

706
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:35,060
I'm not trying to be serious.

707
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:38,060
The girl ordered me to come here.

708
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:39,060
The girl ordered me to come here.

709
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:41,060
Really, Madam.

710
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:47,060
I'm sorry.

711
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:49,060
Let me go.

712
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:50,060
Madam.

713
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,060
Please.

714
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,060
Please.

715
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:54,060
I'm sorry.

716
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:57,060
Let me go.

717
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:58,060
Let me go.

718
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:01,060
I think

719
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,060
I don't have to use it anymore.

720
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:05,060
No.

721
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:06,060
No.

722
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:07,060
No.

723
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:08,060
Madam.

724
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:09,060
Madam.

725
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:10,060
Madam.

726
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:11,060
Madam.

727
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,060
No.

728
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:13,060
Don't touch me.

729
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:14,060
Madam, don't do anything to me.

730
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:15,060
Madam.

731
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:16,060
Madam.

732
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:26,060
Madam.

733
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:31,060
Madam.

734
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:37,060
Madam.

735
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:38,060
Madam.

736
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:39,060
Madam.

737
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:54,060
I'll take a picture of you.

738
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:04,060
One, two, three.

739
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:30,060
No.

740
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,060
Stop it.

741
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:51,060
When you take a picture of a couple,

742
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:53,060
you'll never get it.

743
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:01,060
You're so good at it.

744
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:07,060
Smile.

745
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:10,060
One, two, three.

746
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:12,060
That's enough.

747
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:13,060
It's a big deal.

748
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:18,060
I'll make a deal for you tomorrow.

749
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:19,060
You can change it.

750
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:21,060
Okay.

751
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:22,060
What's that?

752
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:24,060
What are you doing?

753
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:27,060
You didn't leave the paper?

754
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:28,060
You left it in the fridge?

755
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:30,060
I left it in the fridge.

756
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:32,060
I don't know what it is.

757
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:34,060
Where did you get it from?

758
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:38,060
Open it for me.

759
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,060
Okay.

760
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:45,060
It's in the fridge.

761
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:47,060
Did you forget?

762
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:51,060
I forgot.

763
01:21:58,060 --> 01:21:59,060
Madam.

764
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:00,060
Madam.

765
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:01,060
Madam.

766
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:02,060
Madam.

767
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:03,060
Madam.

768
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:04,060
Yes.

769
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:12,060
I'm afraid of the cold.

770
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,060
I'm afraid of the cold.

771
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,060
I'm afraid of the cold.

772
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:19,060
I'm afraid of the cold.

773
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:26,060
What are you doing here?

774
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:28,060
Yes.

775
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:30,060
I have three men with me.

776
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:33,060
Yes.

777
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:34,060
The police is here.

778
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:35,060
That's all.

779
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:36,060
The police.

780
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:38,060
The students are dead.

781
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:39,060
Okay.

782
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:40,060
Okay.

783
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:41,060
Let's go to the school.

784
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:42,060
Yes.

785
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:43,060
Let's go.

786
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:50,060
Yes.

787
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:51,060
Come with me.

788
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:52,060
Yes.

789
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:58,060
Yes.

790
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:28,060
Please come in.

791
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:29,060
Okay.

792
01:23:29,060 --> 01:23:30,060
Yes.

793
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:31,060
What's wrong?

794
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:32,060
Where is the monitor?

795
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:36,060
The students who have the monitor died at the school.

796
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:41,060
Hello.

797
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:42,060
Hello.

798
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:43,060
Hello.

799
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:44,060
Hello.

800
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:45,060
Hello.

801
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:46,060
Hello.

802
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:47,060
Hello.

803
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:48,060
Hello.

804
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:49,060
Hello.

805
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,060
Hello.

806
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:51,060
Hello.

807
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:52,060
Hello.

808
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:53,060
Hello.

809
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:54,060
Hello.

810
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:55,060
Hello.

811
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:56,060
Hello.

812
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:57,060
Hello.

813
01:23:57,060 --> 01:23:58,060
Hello.

814
01:23:58,060 --> 01:23:59,060
What's happening?

815
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:28,060
Hello.

816
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:29,060
Hello.

817
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:43,060
Hello.

818
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,060
Hello.

819
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:57,060
Sawat! Sawat! I found the picture that you might have hidden.

820
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:01,060
This is a trap.

821
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,060
Who is this boy?

822
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:11,060
Why are they looking at him like this?

823
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:18,060
I can say that these children must be killed because of the body of the prince.

824
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:22,060
But Naitri must be another reason.

825
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:27,060
I didn't kill you.

826
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:30,060
I'm trying to help you.

827
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:34,060
I think this way, you will be punished for doing things for sure.

828
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:37,060
Before going back, he said he would find a fish in this house.

829
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:42,060
I told Sawat that these children and his mother like to play with things.

830
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:47,060
If they play with things like this, there will be a way to protect their body.

831
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:52,060
So that the children who came here can be punished for their crimes.

832
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:57,060
I think this picture should be related to the prince.

833
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:28,060
Thank you.

834
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:38,060
You are so strong this year.

835
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:41,060
Take care of yourself.

836
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:47,060
Sawat, are you sure that P'Nor will come here?

837
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:50,060
Next person.

838
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:52,060
All the villagers are here today.

839
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:56,060
I believe that P'Nor will come to find the fish that has been hidden today.

840
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:59,060
How will we know who is who?

841
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:01,060
There are so many people.

842
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:03,060
The prince is here.

843
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:04,060
He's here.

844
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:06,060
Sawasdee krub.

845
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:07,060
Sawasdee krub.

846
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:08,060
Sawasdee krub.

847
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:09,060
How is it?

848
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:25,060
The fish is cooked.

849
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:26,060
It's cooked.

850
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:29,060
I think this dish is very delicious.

851
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:31,060
If you don't hurry, I will give it to you.

852
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:33,060
Thank you very much.

853
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:35,060
Let's eat together.

854
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:43,060
I think I should try one dish first.

855
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:44,060
I like it.

856
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:07,060
I believe that the prince will come to find the fish.

857
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:10,060
I'm so happy that I can't live without you.

858
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:34,060
What's going on?

859
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:35,060
I don't know too.

860
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,060
We are coming out from here.

861
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:39,060
This way, people will come to find the fish.

862
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:44,060
P'Nor is working hard.

863
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:46,060
You have to stop him.

864
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:48,060
Don't let him go in the middle of the road.

865
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:49,060
Let's go.

866
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:51,060
Sawasdee krub.

867
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:53,060
You should have asked him.

868
01:28:56,060 --> 01:29:02,060
You have to stop him. Don't let him get away with it.

869
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:16,060
What are you doing?

870
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:19,060
Stop!

871
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:23,060
Stop!

872
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:29,060
Stop!

873
01:29:51,060 --> 01:30:03,680
Thank you very much

874
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:09,760
Stop.

875
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:23,060
I will take you out of here.

876
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:25,060
I will take you out of here.

877
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:41,060
I will take you out of here.

878
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:44,060
Nong, stop it.

879
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:47,060
You're dead.

880
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:56,060
The one I took is the one who hurt you since the beginning.

881
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:59,060
He deserves to die.

882
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:02,060
Don't hurt anyone more than this, bro.

883
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:22,060
Nong.

884
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:30,060
Nong.

885
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:31,060
Nong.

886
01:31:43,060 --> 01:31:44,060
Nong.

887
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:53,060
Stop it.

888
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:01,060
Go with me.

889
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:05,060
I will keep this baby alive.

890
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:07,060
Nampai.

891
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:12,060
Don't.

892
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:13,060
Don't.

893
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:15,060
What do you say?

894
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:16,060
Don't.

895
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:19,060
Don't.

896
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:21,060
Don't.

897
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:29,060
I'm done.

898
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:32,060
I'm done.

899
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:34,060
Go away.

900
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:37,060
Nong.

901
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:42,060
Go away.

902
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:52,060
I will keep this baby alive.

903
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:54,060
Stop.

904
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:55,060
Don't come in.

905
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:05,060
Hey, where are you going?

906
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:07,060
No.

907
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:09,060
Come on.

908
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:19,060
I'm sorry.

909
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:21,060
No, I'm not going.

910
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:24,060
Don't give me your baby.

911
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:27,060
Whoever kills me is dead.

912
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:29,060
I'm telling you we cannot do this anymore.

913
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:32,060
Just answer me the reason why you said goodbye.

914
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:36,060
Let's go get my baby.

915
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:37,580
Come here.

916
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:38,400
Through me!

917
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:39,260
Please!

918
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,360
Get off!

919
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:43,960
Get away!

920
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:45,320
Where are they?

921
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:49,180
Moreover our commander was murdered.

922
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:50,000
Let's go.

923
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:51,680
Forest man!

924
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:53,440
Forest man!

925
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:57,040
Itís all right, its all right.

926
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:21,080
I want to take but I want to be strong, strong and angry!

927
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:36,200
I want to take but I want to be strong, strong and angry!

928
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:38,200
I'm not a fool.

929
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:40,200
I'm not a fool.

930
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:43,200
I'm a fool.

931
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:12,200
Don't be afraid.

932
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:18,200
I promise that no one will hurt you again.

933
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:24,200
In 9 months, you will take care of us well.

934
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,200
With love.

935
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:28,200
Love?

936
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,200
Yes.

937
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,200
You're my father.

938
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,200
I'm a teacher.

939
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:38,200
You will take care of me.

940
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:44,200
You, you're from the world.

941
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:46,200
You will take care of me.

942
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:49,200
Don't think like that, Panao.

943
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:55,200
I sent strength to the teachers.

944
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:58,200
I will leave this world.

945
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:05,200
And this child will be the father of everyone.

946
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:09,200
Take care of my child well.

947
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:16,200
I see women have the power to teach the teachers

948
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:19,200
of the people of the world.

949
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:26,200
Because I'm the king of the world.

950
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:28,200
I'm dead.

951
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,200
I'm not going to die.

952
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:38,200
No.

953
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,200
No.

954
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,200
No.

955
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,200
No.

956
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,200
No.

957
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,200
No.

958
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:57,200
No.

959
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:04,200

978
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:13,200
There's a black magic in this sand.

979
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:17,200
It's a trick to cure the cancer.

980
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:20,200
Eat.

1003
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,200
It's coming out.

1004
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:48,200
Where did it go?

1005
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:50,200
It's coming out.

1006
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:52,200
It's coming out.

Piak.

1013
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:09,200
What are you doing?

1014
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:11,200
Piak.

1015
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:12,200
What are you doing?

01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:13,200
I'm going to help you.

1017
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,200
Piak.

1018
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:15,200
Where are you going?

1019
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:18,200
Piak.

1020
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:24,200

01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:45,200
Piak.

1025
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:47,200
I'm gonna kill you!

1026
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,200
I'm gonna kill you!

1027
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:58,200
I'm gonna kill you!

1028
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:05,200
Stop!

1029
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:06,200
Watch out!

1030
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:07,200
Stop!

1031
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:35,200
What the hell is this?

1032
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:37,200
What the hell is this?

1033
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:02,200
I'm gonna kill you!

1034
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:09,200
Don't think you can survive.

1035
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:12,200
I'm gonna kill you tonight.

1036
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,200
And then you'll die.

1037
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:38,200
I'm gonna kill you tonight.

1038
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:03,200
You're dead!

1039
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:04,200
You're dead!

1040
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:05,200
You're dead!

1041
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:35,200
You're dead!

1042
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:54,200
You're dead!

1043
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:55,200
You're dead!

1044
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:57,200
You're dead!

1045
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:01,200
Are you okay?

1046
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:02,200
Are you okay?

1047
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:04,200
Are you okay?

1048
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:19,200
What the hell is this?

1049
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,200
I'm gonna leave this place.

1050
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:41,200
You're dead!

1051
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:47,200
Take this thing out for everyone.

1052
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:49,200
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

1053
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,200
Don't!

1054
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:53,200
Don't!

1055
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:57,200
Don't!

1056
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:05,200
Don't!

1057
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:07,200
Don't!

1058
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:24,200
I'm gonna kill you tonight.

1059
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:26,200
I'm gonna kill you tonight.

1060
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:31,200
I'm gonna kill you tonight.

1061
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,200
Don't!

1062
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:37,200
Don't leave me.

1063
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:41,200
I'm gonna kill you tonight.

1064
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:43,200
I can't leave you.

1065
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:52,200
Trust me.

1066
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:54,200
Hurry!

1067
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:05,200
Don't!

1068
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:13,200
Don't!

1069
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:19,200
Don't!

1070
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:25,200
I can help you.

1071
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:30,200
But I don't have a day to die.

1072
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:35,200
Don't!

1073
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:05,200
Don't!

1074
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:08,200
I'm gonna kill you tonight.

1075
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:09,200
Don't!

1076
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:29,200
Don't!

1077
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:35,200
Don't!

1078
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:04,200
Don't!

1079
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:35,200
What are you doing?

1080
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:04,200
Don't!

1081
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:20,200
I'm gonna die tonight.

1082
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:35,200
I'm gonna kill you tonight.

1083
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:36,200
Don't!

1084
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:39,200
Don't!

1085
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,200
Don't!

1086
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,200
Don't!

1087
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:42,200
Don't!

1088
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:43,200
Don't!

1089
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:44,200
Don't!

1090
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:45,200
Don't!

1091
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:50,200
Don't!

1092
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:04,200
Don't!

1093
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:14,200
Luckily, you didn't get a shot.

1094
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:18,200
I think you can go home now.

1095
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:22,200
Thank you very much.

1096
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:26,200
The villagers have been fighting for a long time.

1097
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:30,200
They have been living in the village.

1098
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:33,200
Nobody knows that they are fighting for a long time.

1099
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:40,200
So, you mean that you were taken care of by the villagers.

1100
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:42,200
Yes.

1101
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:46,200
You mean that you were taken care of by the villagers.

1102
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:48,200
Yes.

1103
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:50,200
So, you were taken care of by the villagers, right?

1104
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:51,200
Yes.

1105
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:55,200
The villagers don't need to have a temple or temple here.

1106
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:58,200
They use the food to find the villagers.

1107
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:02,200
They are waiting for the villagers to be connected to Mr. Sai.

1108
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:14,200
Uncle.

1109
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:17,200
How is your uncle?

1110
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:31,200
He looks like the light that was born in darkness.

1111
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:34,200
Is that right, Uncle?

1112
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:39,200
You must know that what he did to the villagers

1113
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:45,200
and the villagers helped him to get rid of the villagers' family.

1114
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:52,200
What about the villagers?

1115
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:15,200
How is your uncle's condition?

1116
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:22,200
He is very tired.

1117
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:24,200
He must have a reason to do that.

1118
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:26,200
Please let him go.

1119
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:40,200
Uncle.

1120
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:10,200
Uncle.

1121
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:12,200
How is your uncle?

1122
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:14,200
Is he okay?

1123
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:36,200
Uncle.

1124
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:37,200
Uncle.

1125
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:55,200
Where is he?

1126
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:02,200
Who are you?

1127
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:07,200
Uncle.

1128
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:37,200
Uncle.

1129
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:07,200
Uncle.

1130
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:37,200
Uncle.

1131
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:07,200
Uncle.

1132
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:37,200
Uncle.

1133
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:07,200
Uncle.

1134
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:37,200
Uncle.

1135
01:57:45,200 --> 01:57:47,200
Hey, it's not a kid anymore.

1136
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:50,200
What are you playing? Stop it.

1137
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:53,200
We are going to play a game today.

1138
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:08,200
Hey, you.

1139
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:09,200
You are standing here.

1140
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:10,200
Be brave.

1141
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:16,200
Remember, we are here to teach others.

1142
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:18,200
If you still act like you are old,

1143
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:20,200
how can we teach others?

1144
01:58:21,200 --> 01:58:23,200
Next, let's see the children.

1145
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:26,200
From this day on.

1146
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:29,200
Please, Nung.

1147
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:33,200
You guys are so annoying.
