"Amazing"?

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,490
Katori, did Osaka teach you how to be smooth?

187
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,350

No, not at all. I'm in love with my job!

191

197
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,050
Hey, are you drunk?

198
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,990
No, I am not.

199
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,830
You're an adult.

200
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,790
Don't go wandering the night streets.

201
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,500
Also, let me know if you're going to be late.

202
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,640

- Why is that our caretaker's business?

205
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,960
That is that; this is-

206
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,180
I never asked you to wait for me.

207
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,210

218
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,560
And it's pork!

219
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,820
It's due to the budget.

220
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,390

221
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,530

- Yes.
- I thought

259
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,790
we had a chance with "Admiral Detergent."

260
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,880
We just had bad luck this time around.

261
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,470
But we had such good reviews.

262
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,160
Do you know why we lost?

263
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,570
The reason is right here.

264
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,300
It's Kazuki Beer's "Juntaku."

265
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,930
Excuse me?

266
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,710
The judges chose the designer of their site.

267
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,460
It helped that "Juntaku" sold really well. They're a reputable company.

268
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,850

Two years ago,

296
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,290
a friend of mine took on a job for Kazuki Beer.

<i>The main page of your website...</i>

298
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,880
<i>Since this was the first big project she was ever assigned,</i>

299
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,120
<i>she presented her ideas to the client with confidence.</i>

300
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,510
<i>Beer should be enticing to the youth-</i>

301
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,290
<i>This proposal</i>

302
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,500
<i>is simply your own ideal, right?</i>

303
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:09,870
<i>It does not align with our vision.</i>

304
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,880
<i>My apologies, Sir.</i>

305
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,710
<i>No matter how many times her client rejected her offers,</i>

306
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,420
<i>she made edit after edit, without fail.</i>

307
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,540
<i>However...</i>

308
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,810
<i>This is exactly the same as your last proposal.</i>

309
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:37,660
<i>In conclusion, we will be going with another company's design.</i>

310
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,920

311
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,580

<i>From that moment on,</i>

319
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:49,850
she decided to dedicate everything to her job in order to get back at her client.

320
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:54,780
<i>She even moved closer to her office to cut down on her commute.</i>

321

Recently, I heard she happened to run into that client.

322
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,280
Those events from two years ago remain unforgotten,

323
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,520
and she simply can't forgive the client.

324
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,750
As I see it, this friend of yours

325
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:17,150
didn't have the ability to meet the client's needs, right?

326
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,120
And yet...

327
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,450
the reason she can't forget is because of the effort she put in.

328
