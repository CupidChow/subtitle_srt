2
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,860
Thank you for waiting.

3
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,510
This suits you.

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,630
As expected of Shitara.

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,520
Just drink and get the hell out of here.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,870
Hey, will you stop degrading my bar?

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,600
Didn't someone ask me to help out at the bar because her part-timer took time off?

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,870
But I'm paying your salary, right?

9
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,500
I'm sorry, Tsucchii.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,930
The fact that I get to drink with Shitara after all this time makes me happy!

11
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,960
So, what were you talking about?

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,980
It was about the instructor at the gym I go to.

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,090
Tsucchii's favorite, Nana Sensei, right?

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,650
Yes, that's right.

15
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,580
While training, she encourages me by saying, "Do your best, Tsuchiya-san."

16
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,390
There is also subtle physical contact.

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,650
- It makes my heart flutter.
- "Physical contact"?

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,610
And when I see her talking to other guys,

19
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,800
it makes this part of me restless.

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,860
"Restless..."

21
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,730
That means

22
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,650
- you're in love.
- <i>In love?</i>

23
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,960
Do you think so, too?

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,220
Hey, am I in love?

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,840
<i>Am I in love with that sloven woman, Nishijima Itsuka?</i>

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,890
<i>No way. This is a sense of anxiety stemming from</i>

27
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,830
<i>the unknown world of being a boardinghouse caretaker.</i>

28
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,480
<i>So, I'm sure...</i>

29
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,140
This can't be true!

30
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,220
Shitara,

31
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,940
are you all right?

32
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,030
Are you still upset about not getting the job at Pegasus Beer?

33
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,260
Not at all.

34
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,260
Welcome.

35
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,660
Good evening.

36
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,590
Why are you here?

37
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,150
When I went to visit Nishijima the other day,

38
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,120
Nao-san gave me this.

39
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,630
Katori-kun, you really came. Thank you.

40
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,510
I'll serve you a free drink.

41
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,400
Oh, you are still staying in a business hotel?

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,390
I just got back from Osaka,

43
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,140
and I'm looking for a place to stay.

44
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,060
I know a nice place.

47
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,870

<i>[Unexpected - Love Story in Maison Ginseiso]</i>

52
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,990
I got these for everyone.

53
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,100
- Here you go.
- What is it?

54
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,010
- Have some tea.
- This is for you.

55
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,900
Oh, it's hand cream.

56
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,960
Moreover, it's organic.

57
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,980
- I feel so bad. You are so considerate.
- This is a gift from me for moving in here.

58
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,740
I foresee that this will sell well.

59
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,010
You don't have to give me one.

60
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,390
Oh.

61
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,750
I've prepared one for Mr. Caretaker, too.

62
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,330
I didn't hear that you were moving in today, though.

63
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,700
Oh.

64
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,120
It's a phone call from Suenaga-kun.

65
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,010
Please excuse me.

66
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,460
Yes, hello.

67
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,850
Katori-kun, don't hesitate to tell me about any problems you're having.

68
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,490
As a landlord, I'll take responsibility and make improvements.

69
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,420
Well, about my room...

70
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,030
- Do you not like the second floor?
- No.

71
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,600
I just wish I was next to Nishijima.

72
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,460
He's shamelessly asserting his own desires.

73
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,650
That...

74
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,710
was a joke!

75
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,050
You can switch rooms with me.

76
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:20,270
It's okay. We can see each other at work too.

77
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,330
Really?

78
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,090
"We"?

79
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,880
What an attractive word.

80
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,260
Katori, it looks like the moving truck is here.

81
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,320
Got it.

82
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,440
I'll go get the boxes.

83
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,630
- I'll help you.
- Thank you.

84
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,320
"Thank you."

85
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,710
By the way,

86
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,120
I thought all of you didn't allow men in the house?

87
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,020
It depends on who it is.

88
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,430
I agreed to it.

89
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,670
I wanted to observe Katori-san as a research subject.

90
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,760
"Research"?

91
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,260
Katori-san likes Itsuka-san.

92
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,380
However, I'm not sure how Itsuka-san feels.

93
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,600
Even though he's moved here and is courting her passionately, right?

94
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,980
Don't you think so, Kou-chan? I wonder how Itsuka-chan feels?

95
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,010
How would I know?

96
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,010
<i>I'm the one who most wants to know</i>

Are the leeks ready?

99
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,660

101
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,080
- I'm putting it in.
- Thank you.

102
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,780
<i>Oh... it tastes too good.</i>

103
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,240
It's delicious!

104
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,460
It's been a while since I've cooked, so I was worried.

105
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,400
You made a variety of Japanese, Western, and Chinese dishes so quickly.

106
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,520
It is professional level.

107
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,280
Katori, you're amazing.

108
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,560
Everything you made is delicious.

109
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,690
I cut the leeks for the Chinese-style fried chickenー

110
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,210
I can't believe that the star of the party volunteered to cook for us.

111
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,330
I really appreciate that you came here.

112
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,240
Likewise, thank you.

113
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,590
Can you get some small plates?

114
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,050
- Okay.
- Okay. I'll get them.

115
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,070
- It's fine, I'll get them.
- No, Mr. Caretaker,

116
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,730
you should relax once in a while.

117
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,520
Whenever I go out for a drink with Katori, it's always like this.

118
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,990
Really?

119
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,290
Only when I'm with Nishijima.

120
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,990
Only when he is with Nishijima?

121
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,920
Please wash these too, thank you.

122
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,430
You seem happy.

123
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,490
I am happy.

124
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,650
Katori is a good cook,

125
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,350
and I can consult with him about work.

126
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,620
We have a man under one roof, you know?

127
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,310
Well, I've been thinking about this for a while.

You are an old man, aren't you?

129
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,940
You know, the way you think.

130
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,000
I have a responsibility to consider the risk

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,440
just in case a mistake happens in this house.

132
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,950

<i>That was the first time I'd ever cried in front of someone.</i>

147
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,540
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

148
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,250
That hurts!

<i>There's nothing I can do but agonize over it.</i>

150
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,730
<i>I have to ask her directly.</i>

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,010
<i>It might be better to clarify the social networking tactics</i>

153
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,290
I see.

<i>Maybe we can experiment and be more daring.</i>

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,990
Forget about it.

181
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,340
You're living with Katori?

182
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,990
Yes. He moved into the house yesterday.

183
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,140
Then?

184
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,660
<i>What do you think?</i>

185
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,680
<i>The house is closer to the office,</i>

186
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,410
<i>so the commute would be shorter. It's not bad.</i>

187
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,190
<i>I'm not asking about the house's convenience!</i>

188
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,880
<i>I'm asking what you think about Katori.</i>

189
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,530
I was a little surprised

190
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,050
to see him move in.

191
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,950
I'm trying to be as normal as possible.

192
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,520
Poor Katori, I want to cry for him.

193
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,880
He doesn't know how you feel.

194
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,670
What's wrong with such a marvelous co-worker from the same group?

195
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,300
There's nothing wrong.

196
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,330
It's just that I can't see him as a love interest.

197
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,410
You don't mean that the caretaker looks more like one, do you?

198
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,470
What?

199
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:29,180
You forced him down, but the next moment you were nice to him, right?

200
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,230
That was...

201
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,430
How should I say it?

202
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,950
I haven't quite forgiven him for what he did two years ago...

203
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,570
So troublesome.

204
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,010
Hey.

205
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,010
Is that what you're bothered about?

206
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,070
I know that very well.

207
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,860
When you start to wonder about a man who is difficult to forgive,

208
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,850
you're already...

209
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,920
"Already"?

210
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,760
At the entrance to the swamp called "love."

211
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,060
What?

212
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,380
<i>I can't take it anymore.</i>

213
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,380
<i>I want to know what Nishijima Itsuka truly feels!</i>

214
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,610
<i>Most of all, I don't want to be pushed around more than I already am.</i>

215
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,100
I'll deduct the cost of the glass from your paycheck.

216
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,590
All done!

217
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,480
All of the client's requests have been met,

218
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,460
and we're going in the right direction.

219
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,050
Let's submit this to Kazuki Beer.

220
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,370
Yes.

221
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,660
Now I can redeem myself from two years ago.

222
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,820
I will definitely win.

223
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,570
The one who rejected your proposal last time at Kazuki Beer

224
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,790
is our caretaker, right?

225
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,310
What?

226
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,780
I knew it.

227
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,500

229
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,460
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,100
I'm sorry that I missed the timing to tell you.

231
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,860
I'm worried.

232
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,650
I'm worried about you getting hurt again because of him.

233
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,920
Don't worry. Haven't I said it before?

234
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,200
I've gotten over it.

235
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,010
Are you sure you're not pushing yourself too hard?

236
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,650
I'm not.

237
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,440
If I were, I would've moved out long ago.

238
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,960
I see.

239
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,690
Oh, well.

240
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,520
I'm hungry.

241
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,920
Oh, yes...

242
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,440
It's delicious.

243
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,890
Why did you two come all the way here?

244
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,230
We wanted to contribute to the bar's revenue.

245
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,130
How nice of you two.

246
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,350
I'm going to take out the trash.

247
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,360
Welcome.

248
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,120
- Welcomeー
- Are you sure it's here?

249
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,320
Maybe you've got the wrong guy.

250
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,510
But yesterday, the girl from Public Relations said she saw him.

251
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,990
<i>Why this method? Surely there must be something more efficient!</i>

252
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,740
<i>The directors thought you were merely showing off.</i>

253
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,260
It's too funny that an elite like Shitara-san is being employed as a waiter.

254
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,850
I really want to see it.

255
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,980
Kou-chan, hide yourself.

256
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,890
Sorry about this.

257
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,970
That Shitara-san was such a self-centered guy.

258
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,970
He ignored almost all of our opinions

259
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,060
and decided everything by himself.

260
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,890
He said market research is more important than data,

261
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:46,090
so he had me observe in the supermarket's liquor department for six hours.

262
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,180
Isn't he too much?

263
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,540
But didn't the executive director give him a hard time

264
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,370
because he forcibly acquired the manufacturing factory?

265
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,780
It was all for Juntaku.

266
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,820
Well, that might have been bad luck for him,

267
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,130
but he abandoned Juntaku that took years to develop.

268
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,110
He also abandoned those of us who had worked with him.

269
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,160
He eventually quit out of sheer stubbornness.

270
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,590
That kind of crappy pride really doesn't mean anything, does it?

271
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:15,140
But, Takeda, you succeeded Shitara-san as team leader, right?

272
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,840
I didn't want to be his replacement.

273
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,930

<i>The most important thing is the real data.</i>

279
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,050
<i>I taught him how to do his job from the beginning.</i>

280
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,860
<i>- But he...
- That's what market research is for.</i>

281
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,810
He said I had crappy pride.

I was at the bar earlier

301
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,640

I put my life on the line to develop Juntaku.
