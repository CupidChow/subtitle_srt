00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,870
So please give me the chance to negotiate our terms.

182
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,180
Will you be able to make a living?

183
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,240
If you're worried about income, I've thought it over.

184
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,640
My plan is to take on another job.

185
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,100
In other words, having a "side hustle."

186
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,260
There are people out there who depend on my skills and experience.

187
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,790
While working as the caretaker,

188
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,650
I plan to be a consultant for various businesses, while helping them with management.

189
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,600
Oh!

190
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,360
<i>Even if others ask for help, I'm useless as I am now.
[Sen no Sazanami]</i>

191
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,970
The sake company?

192
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,430
Exactly.

193
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,790
Mother...

194
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,850
now that I've set my mind to it, I'll become a professional caretaker!

195
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,570
To be honest,

196
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,430
I first thought this job was absurd.

197
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,160
<i>Scrub every inch.</i>

198
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,500
<i>I questioned how I had fallen to such a low.</i>

199
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,990
<i>When will we eat a decent meal?</i>

200
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,800
However, as I kept at my job...

201
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,140
<i>Not bad.</i>

202
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,470
<i>They tasted all right, despite the misshapen look.</i>

203
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,810
<i>It's warm.</i>

204
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,930
I got to see how satisfied people were with my work every day.

205
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:56,720
As a man of ambition, this was the first time I'd felt a sense of accomplishment

206
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,770
from something other than promotions, numbers, and such.

207
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,800
That might be the reason...

208
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,880
I think... I've become a more decent human being.

209
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,750
As I am now,

210
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,950
I can wholeheartedly accept myself when I'm weak

211
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,330
and incompetent.

212
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:28,070
<i>I'm sorry for the trouble I caused you. I am really sorry.</i>

213
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,240
<i>I want to give you a proper apology.</i>

214
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,020
I'm sure my current self is a disappointment to you,

215
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,160
but I don't need the happiness of many.

216
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,980
I'm satisfied if even one person around me is happy.

217
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,620
That's...

218
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,350
who I am now.

219
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,580
Let's see, the ground beef is...

220
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,900
nowhere to be seen.

221
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,130
It can't be helped. We'll have to mince this pork instead.

222
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,670
And the skins...

223
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,320
will have to be made from scratch as well.

224
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,960
Dumplings...

225
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,390
You'll continue to be in these people's care, right?

226
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,620
Then they deserve at least another dish.

227
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:06,090
That's too much filling. Keep balance in mind.

228
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,450
<i>Looking good.</i>

229
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,960
<i>Like this?</i>

230
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,900
<i>Kou-chan, that looks wonderful!</i>

231
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,990
- Really?
- Yes, keep it up.

232
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,560
All I had to do was watch you.

233
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,230
- Perhaps old habits kicked in.
- True.

234
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,370
Yes, you're getting the hang of it!

235
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,180
Well then... take care.

236
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,910
I took a glance at your notes.

237
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,410
My notes?

238
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,310
<i>[Caretaker Notes]</i>

239
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,310
<i>When I first began working,</i>

240
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,460
I did the very same.

241
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,200
Actually, those were a copy of yours.

242
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,150
Mother, you're the businessperson I respect most of all.

243
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,000
Now that your mind is set,

244
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,570
take the top spot, you hear?

245
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:21,590

Your shoelaces are untied.

254
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,510
Please tie them.

255
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,910
What?

256
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,880
That's not a caretaker's job.

257
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,110
This is your punishment for wavering over Shanghai.

258
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,330
It's my fault.

259
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:18,240
Are you sure you won't regret staying at the boardinghouse?

260
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,700
Who knows?

261
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:27,320
Still, you treasure your life there.

262
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,220
I wanted to treasure what you,

263
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,310
Nishijima Itsuka,

264
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,910
treasure so dearly.

265
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,460
You make me angry.

266
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,330
Pardon?

267
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,700
You irritate me.

268
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,410
Hey, watch it!

269
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,820
From now on, don't let just anyone kick you around.

270
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,950
Make sure that it is my privilege.

Right, then.

286

I will come visit this weekend with an excellent designer.

Nishijima-san, you're heading to Toyama this weekend, right?

292

I wish I could've joined.

293
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,680
I'm going to Toyama alone with the caretaker.

294
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,710
Do you think it'll be a day trip

295
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,240
or an overnight one?

296
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,380
Who cares?

No. No way.
