To think our caretaker hailed from the infamous Shitara Group

Her son is equally high-achieving and only works here to make ends meet,

seeing as it is both temporary and unpaid.

181
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,820
I wonder if he will eventually leave this boardinghouse

182
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,000

187

Pardon me.

188
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,860
Right this way.

189
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,780
Mother.

190
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,330
Please have seat.

191
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,610
Allow me to be frank.

192
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,260
Shitara Kouichi-san,

193
00:13:54,710 --> 00:14:00,340
the Shitara Group would like to hire you.

194
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,860
What?

195
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,080
This document explains our conditions of employment.

196
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,760
The terms should be in your favor.

197
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,580
<i>[Conditions of Employment]</i>

198
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,520
Mother, what sort of joke is this?

199
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,210
Entering my parent's company at my age?

200
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,040
I'll keep relying on myself-

201
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,400
The public eye is ever so strict

202
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,570
toward those who will succeed their parents.

203
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,810
I'm sure you are well aware of this.

204
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,480
Simply put, you are attempting to escape reality.

205
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,710
I'm not "escaping" from anything.

206
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,860
I just have other work to do.

207
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,020
- Like aiding your residents as caretaker?
- Exactly.

208
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,230
Despite the lack of salary?

209
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,330
Yes.

210
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,500
Then why did you not take pride in your profession

211
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,610
and tell me you were working as a caretaker?

212
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,930
Despite being in your prime, you are not working

213
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,790
nor earning a living.

214
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:05,860
You, more than anyone else, must be most dissatisfied with yourself, right?

215
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,740
We, the Shitara Group,

216
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,080
soon plan to branch out into the overseas market.

217
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,480
Thus, as our pioneer,

218
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,690
I'd like to leave the Shanghai branch to you.

219
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,940
Sh-Shanghai?

220
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,820
Entrust yourself to a challenge

221
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,970
and rebuild your career.

222
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,790
<i>Let's save this for when you're certain about your feelings for me.</i>

223
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,750
<i>Why?</i>

224
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:50,890
<i>Why can't I take the plunge when he gives me the choice?</i>

225
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,810
Nishijima,

226
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,240
is work giving you trouble?

227
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,810
No, not really.

228
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,540
Thanks.

229
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,470
Then...

230
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,760
is this about Shitara-san?

231
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,170
What?

232
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,070
He wants you to be certain, right?

233
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,420
In that case, how do you feel?

234
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:27,170
Well, I want to approach him,

235
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,240
but I end up getting competitive and defensive.

236
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:37,660
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't still bothered by the past.

237
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,580
I know things can't remain as they are.

238
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,880
And yet...

239
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,580
Nishijima,

240
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,160
you're just protecting yourself

241
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,230
because you don't want to get hurt.

242
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,800
What?

243
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,880
That's why you want to avoid

244
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,330
falling in love with Shitara-san.

245
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,050
That's how I see it.

246
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,180
You're always honest.

247
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:21,750
That sincerity of yours is exactly what captured my heart.

248
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,500
So answer me honestly.

249
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:33,800
Do you want Shitara-san to leave you?

250
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,740
I think... that's a "no."

251
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,390
What if he suddenly told you, "This is goodbye"?

252
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,360
I'd feel... really lonely.

253
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,440
Then don't be afraid.

254
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,470
You have to convey your feelings

255
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,810
to someone you want at your side.

256
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,740
Thank you, Katori.

257
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,090
Such wonderful words of encouragement.

258
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,530
No piece of fiction can compare.

259
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,740
Do you want to join me at Dolce?

260
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,560
<i>I was terrified of admitting my feelings for him.</i>

261
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,540
<i>I wanted the leeway of an escape route</i>

262
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,940

263
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,050

264
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,080
