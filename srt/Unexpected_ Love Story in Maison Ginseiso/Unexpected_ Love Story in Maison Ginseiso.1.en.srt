Fine. I'll be direct instead.

176
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:57,280
I can't... make love to you!

177
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,940
Being a boarding-house caretaker?

178
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,940
Then what was that about a "Lover's Contract"?

179
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,070
Oh my gosh, I was obviously joking!

180
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,300
That woman punched me!

181
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,070
Not even my parents have...

182
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,640
My aunt's the usual caretaker here,

183
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,490
but she was hospitalized last week after getting hurt.

184
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,320
That's when I remembered your predicament.

185
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,110
Why me? Oh!

186
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,820
Oh, Suzu-chan,

187
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,480
welcome back. How was the Comiket?
<i>(T/N: Convention where artists sell self-published goods and books)</i>

188
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,210
I bought as much as my budget allowed. The crop was plentiful.

189
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:56,600
Oh, him? He's our new caretaker.

190
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,510
Nao-san's ex-achiever, divorced, jobless, childhood friend?

191
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,710
Hey!

192
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,200
Incompetent as I am, I shall be in your care.

193
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,760
Wait, I haven't agreed yet...

194
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,390
Our residents are three women.

195
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,990
If you cook breakfast and dinner and also clean,

196
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,730
then your rent, meals, and utilities are all free of charge.

197
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,010
Do I have to do the chores in an all-girl house?

198
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,890
Are you really going to complain?

199
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,680
A jobless man should be grateful for the free benefits.

200
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,310
There's no need to rub it in.

201
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:34,010
Well then, one of my part-timers needs me. See you.

202
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,960
Hold on, I haven't agreed.

203
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960

204
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,740

205

Come, I'll give you the grand tour.

208
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,300
<i>Does it include... nightly tasks as well?</i>

209
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,960
<i>Of course. It's all part of the job.</i>

210
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:18,040

214
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,710
Apparently, this is where the caretaker lives.

215

<i>I-It's cramped!</i>

216
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,330
Our rules aren't any different from other boarding houses:

217
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,330
don't bring in outsiders,

218
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,590
don't barge into other's rooms, and so on.

219
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,460
By the way, none of the rooms have locks.

220
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,260
No locks?

221
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,660
Isn't that dangerous?

222
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,060
Not at all. Nao-san, Suzu-chan and I all trust each other.

223
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,850
But...

224
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,780
I wouldn't even want to.

225
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:16,680
This kitchen can be used by any resident.

226
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,090
When placing something in the fridge,

227
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,350
always mark it with your name.

228
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,850
That's...

229
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,190
This? Nao-san loves it.

230
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,540
Apparently, it's really popular at the moment.

One of these doesn't belong on a caretaker's-

248
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,630
It's what our residents have requested.

249
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,450
Four kilos of rice, toilet paper, detergent, and so on.

250
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,250
The rest are written on this shopping list.

251
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:49,170
One more thing. I'd like some fried meat skewers for dinner tonight.

252
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,790
"Fried meat skewers"?

253
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,210
Buy them yourself. I'm no servant.

260
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,350
These aren't crispy at all.

261
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,490
Either the ingredients weren't dried,

262
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,510
or the water vapor has condensed.

263
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,810

Originally, I was relieved we found a new caretaker. However...

266
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,320
I promise, he's useful for carrying groceries,
