I'm sorry, Katori.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,900
My feelings don't match yours yet.

11
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,040
I'm the one who should apologize.

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,060
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,890
Let's go.

14
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,600
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,020
I can't go back to that,

16
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,820
to the "me" I was before, the "me" you want.

17
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,260
That's not true!

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,550
Natsumi...

19
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,310
I'm not going to give up!

20
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,070
Wait, that's my room!

21
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,230
This is why I can't stand you.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,240
What?

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,170
I despise men like you.

24
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,270
A man who makes both Nishijima and his ex-wife feel insecure.

25
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,380
What is it you actually want?

00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,210

Natsumi!

44
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:13,910
So it was a full-blown "trick me out of my cave" tactic, right?

45
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,020
<i>I can hear you.</i>

46
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:23,360
To tell you the truth, I've never liked housework at all.

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,770
<i>But I reminded myself it was for you, and I did it.</i>

But I didn't really ask...

50
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,310
You didn't ask me to do it?

51
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,500
But you never actually did anything, did you, Kouichi,

52
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,700
even though I was working, too?

53
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,060
And now what?

54
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,680
You're diligently doing housework for complete strangers.

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,060
<i>You can't go back to how things were? You must be kidding!</i>

<i>Natsumi, please!</i>

62
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,640
It sounds like things are tough.

63
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,260
It's a form of non-violent resistance started by Mahatma Gandhi:
<i>(T/N: Indian activist)</i>

64
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,410
the hunger strike.

65
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,660
I feel her extraordinary resolve.

66
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,820
I'm at a disadvantage and can't find a path to victory.

67
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,380
It sounds like things are tough for...

68
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,110
Itsuka-san and Katori-san, too.

69
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,270
What?

70
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,580
They both left at different times today without eating breakfast.

71
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,160
This would be fine, but...

72
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,690
maybe this one would be better.

73
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,450
I'll go with that one!

74
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,820
Nishijima?

75
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,060
Are we having the meeting for Kazuki Beer today?

76
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,120
The presentation and introduction to the officers is at 1:00 p.m., right?

77
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,070
The officers, yes, but the one we want to impress...

78
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,300
is Katou, the Executive Director.

79
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,880
He has full authority over advertising.

80
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,340
I'm very sorry!

81
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,010
Yes.

82
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,510
Excuse me.

83
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,010
Everyone, wasn't the introduction for Kazuki Beer's officers at 11:00 a.m.?

84
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,950
At 11:00 a.m.?

85
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,760
But he contacted us, saying he wanted it at 1:00 p.m.

86
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,240
I'm sorry!

87
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,940
I was told 11:00 a.m.,

88
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,220
but they said 1:00 p.m.

89
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,050
I'll go ask if they can reschedule!

90
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,710
Of course they can't!

91
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,860
We were presenting to the officers to get Director Katou's approval in person!

92
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,740
I'll go talk things over with them face-to-face!

93
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,280
I'll go too!

94
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,300
Excuse me, Director Katou!

95
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,020
What is it?

96
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,300
I'm Katori, from Cosmo Index.

97
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,130
And my name is Nishijima.

98
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,680
We were scheduled to visit today to introduce Fragrant ZERO.

99
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,610
Oh!

100
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,170
We're incredibly sorry!

101
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,190
Could we possibly have another chance to present to you?

102
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,950
I appreciate that you took the trouble to come here.

103
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,050
However, this just wasn't meant to be.

104
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,250
If you'll excuse me.

105
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,190
I didn't get a final confirmation from them.

106
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,000
This was my mistake.

107
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,650
I'm really sorry this happened.

108
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,880
You have nothing to apologize for.

109
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,810
"I don't need dinner today"?

110
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,680
"I don't need it, either"?

111
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,260
Both of them?

112
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,070
<i>Katori and I are coming home late, so don't wait up for us.</i>

113
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:02,300
<i>"Katori and I"?</i>

114
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,860
<i>It sounds like things are tough for Itsuka-san and Katori-san, too.</i>

115
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,700
Things are tough for them... in that way?

116
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,100
Mr. Caretaker?

117
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,900
Mr. Caretaker!

118
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,090
Did I oversleep?

119
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,460
What is wrong this early?

120
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,420
Isn't today my day off?

121
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,690
Could you tell me...

122
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,490
where Director Katou from Kazuki Beer lives?

123
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,330
What?

124
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:43,580
So you're going to ask him for another presentation in person?

125
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,410
I won't cause any trouble.

126
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,660
Please!

127
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,800
Director Katou...

128
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,580
<i>You forcibly acquired the Kanto manufacturing factory, didn't you?</i>

129
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,650
<i>That sent Executive Director Katou into a frenzy.</i>

130
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,820
If you anger the directors, there's nothing else you can do,

131
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,690
especially for Director Katou. He'll hold a grudge for life.

132
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,170
Even so, I don't want this proposal to be a waste.

133
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,580
<i>[Kazuki Beer New Product: Fragrant ZERO]</i>

134
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,340
Nishijima was betting on this presentation.

135
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,010
You also saw how hard she worked, didn't you?

136
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,820
Please!

137
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,840
Right now, I'll do everything I possibly can!

138
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,040
Please!

139
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,550
Pardon?

140
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,210
You're asking for the address of the director you upset? What are you going to do?

141
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,490
Never mind, just tell me! Text it, it's urgent!

142
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,210
Hold it, hold it!

143
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,050
So your ex-wife, Natsumi-san...

144
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,670
Oh! Did you talk about me?

145
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,310
She quit the investment bank she was working at, didn't she?

146
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,980
What? She quit?

147
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,850
I heard it from an acquaintance of an acquaintance.

148
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,000
They've been having a lot of layoffs recently, you know?

149
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,750
<i>What a cruel world!</i>

150
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,950
<i>Natsumi got laid off, too?</i>

151
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,930
<i>I want us to remarry.</i>

152
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,780
<i>I need you.</i>

153
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,730
<i>That's why she came here?</i>

154
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,820
What? Katori did that?

155
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,880
He said he'd do everything he possibly could for you.

156
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,250
What?

157
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,030
He's a good guy, that one.

158
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,080
Is he?

159
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:40,010
Katori's not one of those "any woman will do" type of guys.

160
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,110
That's true.

161
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:53,870
What are you going to do about your ex-wife?

162
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,780
I think Natsumi feels desperate and can't accept her current situation.

163
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:10,550
<i>She can't see a future. She's lost confidence in herself, just like me.</i>

164
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:22,200
So I'm just going to do what I can for her right now and give it my all.

165
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,720
Please!

166
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,360
Could you please somehow give us another chance?

167
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,890
I'm begging you!

168
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,290
Please leave.

169
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,820
I absolutely understand that I'm being rude,

170
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,970
but give us one more chance!

171
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,430
It troubles me when you do things like this.

172
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:50,250
Now I'll reconsider ever doing business with your company at all.

173
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,410
Natsumi, you're seriously going to hurt yourself with this!

174
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,700
Natsumi?

175
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:18,240
The "me" back then was really not a good guy, right?

176
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,000
<i>Why this method? Surely, there must be something more efficient!</i>

177
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:30,190
Back then, getting results at work was everything to me.

178
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,100
So... I'm sure I made you feel lonely.

179
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,100
I'm sorry.

180
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:46,030
<i>If only Kazuki Beer hadn't been downsized...</i>

181
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,380
If only you hadn't left...

182
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,050
<i>To be honest, I think about it.</i>

183
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:57,600
But... what happened wasn't anyone's fault.

184
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,080
<i>All of it is my responsibility.</i>

185
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:09,090
I may just be an inadequate man right now,

186
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,650
but what will I do from here?

187
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,860
I want to find that answer on my own.

188
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,170
<i>That's why...</i>

189
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,280
I can't go back to the "me" I was before, when we were together.

190
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,480
I'm kind of hungry now.

191
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,800
I want something sweet.

192
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,880
Got it.

193
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,740
I wasn't eavesdropping. I just heard without asking.

194
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,350
I don't care which it is.

195
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,000
It's him.
<i>[Katori Shun]</i>

196
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:14,210
What? You lost him at North Niporu?

197
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:17,270
I told you so!

198
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,450
What did Katori say?

199
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,230
Director Katou went out. He followed him but lost him.

200
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,710
He asked if I knew of places he might go.

201
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,270
I'll go look for him too!

202
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,000
It's no use!

203
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,630
The director will never reverse a decision.

204
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,280
But Katori hasn't given up,

205
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,640
so I don't want to give up either!

206
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,870
I'll go!

207
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,560
I have another request for you.

208
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,130
<i>Even though I can't go back to the way I was before...</i>

209
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:16,840
<i>I want you to be infuriatingly confident.</i>

210
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,730
<i>I want to change!</i>

211
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,020
<i>So I don't want to give up either!</i>

212
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:26,020
<i>I want to become someone that Nishijima Itsuka can approve of one day!</i>

213
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,660
Hey!

214
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,380
Mr. Caretaker!

215
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,200
Over there!

216
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,300
What?

217
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,850
I bought you something sweet.

218
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,820
I didn't ask you.

219
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,650
Where is Kouichi?

220
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,650
He went to Katori.

221
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,120
What is that?

222
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,520
It's dango.
<i>(T/N: sweet rice dumpling)</i>

223
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,540
He insisted you would only eat this when you got hungry.

224
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,890
He remembered.

225
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,420
When we first started dating,

226
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:28,770
things were hard at work. I'd mutter to myself, "I want something sweet."

227
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:33,060
Then Kouichi would run and go buy me...

228
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,080
dango.
<i>[Heartbreaking Dango]</i>

229
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,090
Mr. Caretaker was worried.

230
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,480
He says you're the same as he is now,

231
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,740
so he's going to give his all and do what he can.

232
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,090
Excuse me!

233
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,920
You came all the way here!

234
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,870
It's beyond insane!

235
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,430
I brought him.

236
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,670
You like saunas, don't you, Director?

237
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,900
You?

238
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,530
I have a favor to ask.

239
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:31,490
Could you please give them another chance to present?

240
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,170
Please!

241
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,680
You made me angry,

242
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,850
then you quit without even apologizing.

243
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:48,150
Can someone like you, who refused to apologize for your blunder,

244
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,370
bow your head for a complete stranger?

245
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,060
It's true that I was overbearing.

246
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,280
I acted on my own without consulting all parties,

247
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,520
and that caused you trouble.

248
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,700
I'm very sorry.

249
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:11,190
But even now, I don't have any regrets.

250
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,930
Then why are you bowing your head? You can't benefit from this.

251
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,470
I'm doing it for Kazuki Beer.

252
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,720
<i>Their proposal is very elaborate.</i>

253
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,150
I know it will benefit Kazuki Beer if you implement it!

254
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,110
Please!

255
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,350
On Monday at 11:00 a.m., you have 30 minutes.

256
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,660
Yes, Sir!

257
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,350
Juntaku is a good beer.

258
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,100
Thank you, Sir!

259
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,870
Mr. Caretaker?

260
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,130
Mr. Caretaker! H-Hello?

261
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,790
<i>Why is your right hand hurt?</i>

262
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,750
I bumped it when I collapsed in the sauna.

263
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,450
Oh, it's swollen.

264
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,750
Natsumi?

265
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,820
I'm going to leave.

266
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,350
What?

267
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,500
I hope you find the answer you're looking for, Kouichi.

268
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:41,840
You're a really capable person, Natsumi.

269
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,330
It might be weird for me to say this,

270
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,010
I wouldn't worry even though you were laid off.

271
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,580
"Laid off"?

272
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,500
You quit the investment bank, didn't you?

273
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,020
Yes, because I got headhunted (recruited to new job).

274
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,280
Th-That's why?

275
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,240
I'm going to work in Singapore.

276
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,200
What the heck?

277
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,640
So that's it.

278
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,700
What's with that disappointed reaction?

279
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,510
It's not...

280
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,850
Congratulations.

281
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,400
You've been working hard for so long, haven't you?

282
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,480
You're really amazing.

283
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,700
Kouichi, you've changed.

284
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,520
What?

285
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,610
Even without me, it seems you'll be okay.

286
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,870
Well... take care!

287
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,330

That's good, isn't it?

290
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,450
You're valued for things other than sex.

291
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,580
Don't sneak up and look!

292
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,730
I'm going to take a bath.

293
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,350
I'll take... a bath with you.

294
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,450
