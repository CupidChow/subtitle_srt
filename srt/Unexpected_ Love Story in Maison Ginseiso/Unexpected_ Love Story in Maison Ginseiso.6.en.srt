I can totally make love to you.

What?

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,680
What do you mean by that?

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,810
What's going on?

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,410
Well, it's...

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,340
Good evening.

8
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,750
N-Natsumi?

9
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,150
Why are you here?

10
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,300
I'm moving in here today. Please take care of me.

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,980

Wow.

14
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,460
So this is what a boardinghouse is like.

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,180
Mr. Caretaker,

16
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,890
who is this?

17
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,910
How do you do? I'm Natsumi, Shitara's wife.

18
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,910
- What?
- What?

19
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,300
"Wife"?

20
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,030
Former wife!

21
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,090
Right.

22
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,050
Nice to meet you all.

23
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,810
Why are you moving in?

24
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,800
Because I saw the real estate posting.

25
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,350
Okay. Talk to you later.

26
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,800
Sorry, Kou-chan, my aunt signed her up unknowingly.

27
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,510
Really?

28
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,890
All right, but why here of all places?

29
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,610
You see, the managers of our apartment called

30
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,930
to ask about your security deposit.

31
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,500
When I called your office to ask, I was shocked to hear you had quit.

32
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,950
<i>Oh, Shitara?</i>

33
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,980
<i>Yes, he's working as a boardinghouse caretaker right now.</i>

34
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,900
<i>The real surprise is that he gets no salary!</i>

35
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,910
<i>This is Kazuki Beer's former star, Shitara Kouichi, we're talking about.</i>

36
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,130
<i>Really, can you believe it?</i>

37
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,800
That jerk!

38
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,170
That's when I decided to fix our relationship.

39
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,440
How will you fix it?

40
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,750
You're the one who left the divorce papers behind.

41
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,920
I was really overwhelmed with work and stress at the time.

42
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,130
It was an impulsive decision.

43
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,250
Seriously?

44
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,800
Apparently, she's the fund manager of an investment bank.

45
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,820
Oh my!

46
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,570
It was a tempting decision at that time, okay?

47
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,310
One that was too selfish.

48
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,130
Besides, that note you left was uncalled for.

49
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,870
What note?

50
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,060
The one about how your only merit was sex?

51
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,640
<i>What?</i>

52
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,940
Hey!

53
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,020
<i>"Our sex may have been the only thing I liked about you."</i>

54
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,320
But it's true.

55
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,890
Speaking of, he did say something about making love to Nishijima.

56
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,470
O-Oh, I meant...

57
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,670
Wow.

58
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,000
Did he really?

59
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,230
I'm quite put off.

60
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,900
So am I.

61
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,980

00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,200
<i>That wasn't the right move!</i>

66
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,130
Truly, what a problematic statement.

67
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,090
You're making yourself look worse.

68
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,130
Itsuka-chan, would you like to let Kou-chan have a go?

69
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,980
No need.

70
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,600
I don't care about this.

71
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,260
Enough about me. What do you want to do?

72
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,610
He changed topics.

73
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,870
Me?

74
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,490
I want us to remarry.

75
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,960
What?

76
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,730
I mean, you only turned in those divorce forms

77
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,210
as a way to get back at me and your job, right?

78
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,090
Well...

79
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,220
Anyway, I'm staying until you feel like getting remarried.

80
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,530

What?

92

When did you get so good at cooking?

93
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,070
I made those dishes.

94
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,950
Kouichi only brewed the coffee.

95
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,010
It was a collaborative effort. No,

96
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,500
- this is the power of a wife.
- True.

Yes, I also cook. It adds a nice fluff.

Mr. Caretaker, please get me some jam.

Sure.

109
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,460

All right.

- Okay.

Evidently, she wants to remarry him.

What is she like?

120
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,360
She's a real businesswoman

In other words, she's a high-achieving lady who has it all.

124
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,280
Apparently, she's trying to use up her paid leave,

125
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,180
so she's at the house all day and night. I can't relax at all.

126
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,680
Your house is a nest of chaos.

127

I don't even know how it happened.

128
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,480
So what do you want your caretaker to do?

129
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,430
Do you want him to remarry or not?

<i>I... I can totally make love to you!</i>

132
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,410
I don't want him to lead me on

133
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,730
and leave me unnecessarily confused.

134
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:55,110
That will be solved if they get remarried.

135
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,670
But still...

136
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,610
is that really okay with you?

137
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,830
What?

138
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,830
Excuse me.

00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:24,100
<i>But for now, I want to know why Natsumi came here.</i>

144
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,490
What is it?

145
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,690
Natsumi, is something wrong?

146
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,400
What? Why do you suddenly ask?

147
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,170
I just... had a hunch.

148
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,950
No, everything is fine.

149
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,880

do you want to take a bath together tonight?

153
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,790
Of course not!

154
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,900
No need to be embarrassed after all this time.

155
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,420
<i>I don't need dinner tonight since I'm working overtime.</i>

156
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,230
<i>First things first, I want to clear up any misunderstandings.</i>

157
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,720
Talk?
<i>[When you get back, let's talk.]</i>

158
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,050
<i>I'm home.</i>

Mr. Caretaker?

160
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,530
I'm coming in, okay?

161
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,510
Welcome back.

162
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,720
I hope your late shift isn't taking a toll on you.

163
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,870
Not at all.

164
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,450
Kouichi's always been particular about organizing.

165
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,870
He's so meticulous. I mean, look!

166
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,860
Anyway, did you need him? I'll be sure to pass it on.

167
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,760
No, but thank you.

168
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Hold on.

169
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,720
What is Kouichi like around here?

170
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,990
What is he like?

171
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,060
I think he's doing the best job he can.

172
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,340
Although he's both serious and capable,

173
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:52,690
his skills shouldn't be put to use in a place like this.

174
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,740
I'm sure you wouldn't get it since you haven't known him for long.

175
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,790
There are things I know, even if I haven't known him for long.

176

Pardon?

177
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,820
My apologies for bothering you. Good night.

178
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,180

00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,930
Wh-What are you doing in here?

185
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,870
Am I not allowed to visit?

186
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,080
No, not necessarily.

187
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,960
But you're one of our tenants now.

188
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,900
Speaking of tenants, a certain Nishijima-san came by earlier.

189
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,070
What?

190
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,980
She said she just came by to visit.

191
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,010
Seriously?

192
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,870
Did you have business with her?

193
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,040
Oh, well... sort of.

194
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:10,370
Kouichi, don't tell me you made moves on one of the girls here?

195
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,260
What?

196
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,680
I'm kidding.

197
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,450
I know you're a serious guy, despite how you look.

198
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:21,200
Besides, even if you were interested, you're probably in a tough spot.

199
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,460
What does that mean?

200
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,870
I wouldn't belittle you if you were still at Kazuki Beer,

201
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,220
but right now, you're just an unemployed guy.

202
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,070
Oh, right! Do you want to see how Monaka is doing?

203
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,980
She's being absolutely pampered at my parents' place.

204
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,020
<i>Our target demographic for "Fragrant ZERO,"</i>

205
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,530
the younger generation, is greatly influenced

206
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,930
by marketing on social media.

207
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:57,500
Thus, we believe the company must capitalize on how suitable this product is for social media advertising.

208
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,030
It will be pertinent to advertise both the taste

209
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,250
and how best to enjoy this beer.

210
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,480
This concludes our proposal.

211
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,580
We thank you for listening to our presentation today.

212
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,250
Thank you.

213
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,240
Welcome back, how did your presentation-

214
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,890
Good evening.

215
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:26,980
You must be Shitara Kouichi, the caretaker, yes?

216
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,500
That's me.

217
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,660
You really surprised us with the sudden visit.

218
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,230
Is something up, Tomobe?

219
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,890
Actually, I need to ask you both something urgently.

220
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,080
Itsuka.

221
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,780
Katori.

222
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,170
This is the biggest favor I'll ever ask of you two.

223
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,380
Please... get married!

224
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,060
Pardon?

225
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,880
Excuse me?

226
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,910
What?

227
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,650
Not for real, though.

228
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,320
A fake one will do.

229
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,510
- Could you be clearer with your request?
- Right.

230
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,670
You know how my team is working for

231
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,840
Fraisier Wedding?

232
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,690
- The planning company?
- Exactly.

233
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,540
See, we're filming for their website tomorrow,

234
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,080
but our bridal model caught a cold.

235
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,090
That sounds bad. Is there more to it?

236
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,660
Well, now they've told us the groom is sick, too.

237
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,850
Really?

238
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:29,940
We're already on a low budget, so we can't hire anyone new.

239
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,900
That's why I'm wondering if you two can fill in.

240
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,540
Did your client approve?

241
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,100
They had no complaints about your visuals.

242
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,800
In that case, we have no choice, do we?

243
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,230
Yes, the situation calls for it.

244
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,030
That sounds so wonderful!

245
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,860
By the way,

246
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,820
is she the former wife?

247
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,410
Yes.

248
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,790
Do you get to wear a wedding dress? Lucky!

249
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,470
I'd love to see you two dressed up.

250
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,180
May I go watch?

251
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,810
Wouldn't you love to join, Kouichi?

252
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,910
N-No, I'm not really interested.

253
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,100
Then would you like to act as the witness?

254
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,640
"The witness"? Of course!

255
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,300
And he'll be joining!

256
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,980
<i>Please wait over here while we make our final adjustments.</i>

257
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,780
- Will do.
- Thank you.

258
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,810
Yes, a suit fits you best, Kouichi.

259
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,080
Do you think so?

260
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,810
The bride is now ready.

Do I?

266
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,450

I'd say the witnesses seem to have chemistry as well.

270
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,980
We're actually married.

271
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,430
We used to be.

272
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,820
Are you two married?

273
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,830
In that case, may I make a suggestion?

Why am I getting dressed up, too?

279
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,520

You look wonderful.

284
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,440
Thank you.

285
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,930
Though, this is my second time.

286
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,170
Kouichi, how do I look?

287
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,330
W-Well...

288
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,990
it's not bad.

289
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,960
Oh, are you getting embarrassed?

290
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,850
Of course not.

291
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,440
Hey!

292
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,960
I said, "Hey!"

293
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,690
Why are you running?

294
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,590
Because I don't want to be mistaken as your bride.

295
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,100
I never asked to be dressed up.

296
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,520
Really?

297
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,330
Your smirk says otherwise.

298
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,700
I was born with it. Besides, you're grinning, too.

299
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,080
That's because I'm working,

300
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,570
despite it being the weekend after my big presentation.

301
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,090
Right, how did that go?

302
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,960
I did all I could.

303
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,940
I promise I will win.

304
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,970
Rather than worry about me,

305
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,810
what about yourself?

306
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:10,720
What?

307
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,680
You sent me a text.

308
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,700
Wasn't there something you wanted to tell me?

309
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,920
<i>Talk?
[When you get back, let's talk.]</i>

310
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,280
I hope it's nothing silly

311
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,630
like "making love to any woman."

312
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,610
N-No, I can't make love

313
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,760
to just anyone.

314
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,090
Pardon?

315
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,860
I...

316
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,610
I think you're...

317
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,650
<i>Right now, you're just an unemployed guy.</i>

318
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,940
Never mind.

319
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,720
Hey!

320
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,570
There are our newlyweds.

321
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,210
Let us begin our photoshoot.

322
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,770
This man isn't my groom.

323
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,560
And this woman isn't my bride.

324

<i>[Unexpected - Love Story in Maison Ginseiso]</i>

325
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,690
They're so innocent.

326
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,050
Is there any need to go this far?

327
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,540
<i>We shall now begin our shoot.</i>

328
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,610
<i>Please do.</i>

329
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,050
Do you, Shitara Kouichi,

330
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,860
take Sawabe Natsumi

331
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,180
as your wife, in sickness and in health,

332
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,930

333
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,190
and do you vow to love

334
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,980
and cherish her?

335
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,940
Yes, I do.

336
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,330
<i>Do you, Sawabe Natsumi,</i>

337
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,270

341
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,040
Yes, I do.

Thank you.

345
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,800
I thought back to our wedding today.

346
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,690
During our ceremony three years ago,

347
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,160
you were uncharacteristically nervous

348
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,040
and made mistake after mistake, remember?

349
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,820
That's what I get for a once-in-a-lifetime event.

350
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,880
I was truly happy to be by your side.

351
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,060
My happiness didn't end there, you know?

352
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,420
It lasted throughout our marriage.

Natsumi...

358
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:21,250
I was a fool. It was never your fault.

359
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,040
And yet,

360
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,840
why are you here when you sparkled so brightly?

361
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,470

00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,710
<i>The old me?</i>

366
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,900
Today was so mentally taxing.

367
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,280
It must be because I went out of my comfort zone.

368
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,450
Right, I'm sorry.

369
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,400
You're probably more tired than me.

370
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,190
♫ <i>Seems like your defenseless behavior is intentional</i> ♫

371
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,920
It's because you saw the caretaker and his bride.

372
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,340
Nishijima,

373
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,900
I know you like our caretaker.

374
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,550
I really don't.

375
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,010
This isn't love-

376
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,560
I can tell.

377
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,620
After all, I've always been watching you from afar.

378
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,610
♫ <i>When we meet by chance next time, I'll do something about it</i> ♫

379
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,590
Still...

380
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,230
♫ <i>If we could rather look into each other's eyes</i> ♫

381
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,730
I don't mind.

382
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,980
♫ <i>This is love! Is this love?</i> ♫

383
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,760
I finally realized after we parted

384
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:40,820
that I need you, just as you need me.

385
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,360
Kouichi,

386
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,540
let's start over again.

387
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:54,220
♫ <i>If we could rather look into each other's eyes, embrace and say it's love</i> ♫

388
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,220
♫ <i>This is love! Is this love?</i> ♫

389
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,130
Nishijima, come to my side.

390
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,360
♫ <i>If only those two could be more honest</i> ♫

391
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,960
♫ <i>Surely then they'll cherish</i> ♫

392
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,200
♫ <i>Whatever tomorrow brings</i> ♫

393
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,430
♫ <i>This is my life</i> ♫

394
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,750
<i>[Preview]
Natsumi!
[The former wife moves into the caretakers room?]</i>

395
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,750
<i>Give me
[The former wife moves into the caretaker's room?]</i>

396
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,150
<i>- those three years back!
- I'm very sorry!</i>

397
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,400
<i>I'll do everything I possibly can!
[Katori is in a major pinch at work!]</i>

398
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,250
<i>I brought him.
[Reunited with his boss...]</i>

399
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,220
<i>It's beyond insane!
[Reunited with his boss...]</i>

400
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,210
Please!

401
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:25,120
<i>I want to become the "me" that Nishijima Itsuka can approve of one day!
[An adult's love never stops!]</i>

402
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,550
<i>The only person I want to force down is you, Mr. Caretaker.
[An adult's love never stops!]</i>
