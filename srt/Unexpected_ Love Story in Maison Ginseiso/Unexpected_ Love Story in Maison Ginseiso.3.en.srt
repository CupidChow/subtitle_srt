- Quiet!

- Girl, your desires came through.
- "Desires"?

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,570
You're beginning to see the caretaker as a man.

No way.

That's exactly why my own actions confuse me.

Our caretaker is that client from Kazuki Beer, remember?

42
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,880
If anything, I hate him.

43
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,910
An act of passion fueled by hate is even crazier.

373
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,760
Nishijima has been pushing herself lately.

374
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,180
She's always had this habit of working too hard.

375
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,920
Boyfriend or not,

376
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,580
you should head home soon.

377
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,580
I'm not her boyfriend.

378
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,450
I'm just a co-worker.

379
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,640
What?

380
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,330
Her co-worker?

381
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,610
Did you feel a sense of relief?

382
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,490
Certainly not. Why would I?

383
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,440
