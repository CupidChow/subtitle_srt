The only person I want to force down...

00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,510
is you, Mr. Caretaker.

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,130

Are you aware of what you're doing right now?

14
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:00,560
I'm... forcing you down.

15
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,170
Does this mean... you like me?

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,030
Like you?

17
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,310
Probably.

18
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,940
"Probably"?

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,050
Well, I'm still uncertain about it myself.

20
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,210
"Uncertain"?

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,130
That's why I wanted to confirm something.

22
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,480
Confirm what?

23
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,410
Why I wanted to force you down, even if I don't like you.

24
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,760
Y-You don't like me?

25
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,020
First things first.

26
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,120
Let's have a talk.

27
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,220

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,140
Thank you.

32
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,130
I've never experienced a more awkward morning.

33
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,480
You're presenting to the Kazuki Beer executives today, right?

34
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,050
G-G-Good lu-

35
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,230
Morning, everyone.

36
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,490
Oh, that's Itsuka-chan's mug.

37
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,480
What?

38
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,640
My...

39
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,420
My bad.

40
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,020
It's fine.

41
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,500
Thank you for the meal.

42
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,840
Katori, are you ready to go?

43
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,230
Yes.

44
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,320
- See you all later.
- Thanks for the meal.

45
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,390
- See you.
- Have a good day.

46
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,750
That was as suffocating as running out of air.

47
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,620
Did something happen between you two last night?

48
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,480
- That's─
- Kou-chan,

49
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,420
the caretaker has to maintain our harmony.

50
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,770
If there's an issue, solve it as soon as possible.

51
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,740
Wait, is this my fault?

52
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:38,540
<i>No, it's not my fault that this morning was so awkward.</i>

53
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,260
<i>Okay, let's discuss our... earlier incident.
[The conversation last night]</i>

54
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,540
<i>Why exactly did you do all that to me?</i>

55
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,050
<i>Honestly, I don't even know if this is "love."</i>

56
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,300
<i>But still...</i>

57
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,370
<i>I felt the urge to touch you, so I did.</i>

58
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,320
<i>You acted on an urge?</i>

59
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,270
<i>Th-Then,</i>

60
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,450
<i>do you have any desire to date me?</i>

61
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,450
<i>I haven't thought that far ahead yet.</i>

62
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,810
<i>Seriously?</i>

63
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,560
<i>What am I, a trial run?</i>

64
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,110
<i>Are all people obligated to date after a kiss?</i>

65
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,010
<i>Well, would you make moves on someone you don't like?</i>

66
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,930
<i>I don't get it.</i>

67
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,070
<i>You're making no sense!</i>

68
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,720
<i>Maybe you're the one who's not picky about partners!</i>

69
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,750
<i>Talk about acting childish.</i>

70
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,400
<i>However...</i>

71
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,080
<i>Honestly, I don't even know if this is "love."</i>

72
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,630
<i>Nishijima Itsuka's answer wasn't what I hoped to hear.</i>

73
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,950
<i>In short, she hurt me.</i>

74
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,240
<i>We'll now begin our proposal,</i>

75
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,330
presented on behalf of our company.
<i>[Designing a Website for "Fragrant ZERO"]</i>

76
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,320
First, please take a look at the documents provided.

77
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,960
That was a wonderful presentation.

78
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,750
We look forward to hearing from you further.

79
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,730
<i>Thank you, Sir.</i>

80
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,980
Still, I was shocked.

81
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:29,020
I never thought he would bow for someone else.

82
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:35,720
Perhaps our company lost big time by letting him go.

83
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,560
Regardless, he'll be inheriting his mother's business in due time.

84
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,330
Director Katou, your next appointment awaits.

85
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,280
Please give Shitara-kun my regards.

86
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,100
If you'll excuse me.

87
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,580
Shall we?

88
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,370
You're the one

89
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,720
who changed Shitara-san, right?

90
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,080
Pardon?

91
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,310
I stand no chance against someone

92
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,480
who ignores their pride for another's sake.

93
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,040
Katori... you see...

94
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,900
It's fine.

95
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,710
I already know.

96
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,040
But I want to tell you how I sincerely feel.

97
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,180
Katori, you've always prioritized my feelings.

98
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,730
You were always honest with me.

99
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,770
I...

100
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:56,110
took your kindness... for granted.

101
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,520
Even so...

102
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,880
I can't reciprocate your feelings.

103
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,610
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,790
Despite knowing your answer

105
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,150
and this being my second rejection,

106
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,710
it still gets to me.

107
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,850
Sorry.

108
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,810
Don't apologize.

109
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,920
Thank you for being clear with me.

110
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,940
I'm glad...

111
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,270
I fell in love with you.

112
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,610
All right, then.

113
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,590
Let's see here...

114
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,920
This one.

115
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,120
<i>Please let me treat you to dinner tonight.</i>

116
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,230
Dinner with him?

117
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,360
<i>[Dolce Bar]</i>

118
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,420
Thank you.

119
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,770
Oh, welcome in.

120
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,550
Good evening!

121
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,520
What now? Food won't bribe me.

122
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,980
We succeeded in partnering with Kazuki Beer.

123
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,250
Really?

124
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,290
- You did it. Congratulations!
- Thank you!

125
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,420
Please let me thank you again regarding our presentation.

126
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,640
You even went so far as to bow with me.

127
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,620
Well, that wasn't entirely to help you both.

128
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,540
It was partially for my own sake as well.

129
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,390
How can you be so cool?

130
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,710
Seriously? Are you drunk already?

131
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,970
I will work harder and further improve myself.

132
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:24,380
My goal is to one day become like you.

133
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,050
Excuse me?

134
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,300
Look, I'm only a freeloading caretaker, though.

135
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,680
Regardless of your job, make sure you treasure Nishijima.

136
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,550
Treasure her...

137
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,700
Nishijima... rejected me.

138
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,690
I didn't stand a chance.

139
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,880
I see.

140
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,860
With this presentation, I think she's finally gotten over

141
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,030
the Kazuki Beer incident from two years ago.

142
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,130
What?

143
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,850
I like you too, Shitara-san.

144
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,530
Pardon?

145
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,480
Anyway, I'll continue to be in your care!

146
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,900
Oh, hey!

147
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,440
- I'm looking forward to it!
- Hey!

148
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,740
All right, I get it already!

149
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,670
What are you two doing?

150
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,620
<i>[Juntaku]</i>

151
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:41,080
<i>With this presentation, I think she's finally gotten over the Kazuki Beer incident from two years ago.</i>

152
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,220
Two years ago...

153
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,640
<i>Recently, I heard she happened to run into that client.
[Juntaku]</i>

154
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,240
<i>Those events from two years ago remain unforgotten,</i>

155
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,400
<i>and she simply can't forgive the client.</i>

156
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,170
Shitara-san?

157
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,220
Sorry, could you look up something for me?

158
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,070
Two years ago?

159
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,020
If I remember correctly,

160
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,350
that was when we were designing Juntaku's website.

161
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,170
Anyway, thanks in advance.

162
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,910
<i>I have a bad feeling about this.</i>

163
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,680
<i>If, hypothetically, Nishijima Itsuka met me in the past...</i>

164
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,080
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>

165
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,660
<i>Why hasn't she said a word about it?</i>

166
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,310
What is it?

167
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,150
Nothing.

168
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,830
Are you going somewhere?

169
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,340
I'm going to Hamamatsu this evening.

170
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,980
It's a two-day, one-night business trip.

171
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,960
As such, I don't need dinner tonight or breakfast tomorrow.

172
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,650
I see.

173
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,700
Oh, I should mention the Kazuki Beer thing.

174
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,150
Your assistance made our negotiations a success.

175
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,840
Thank you.

176
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,480
Sure.

177
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,250
Oh, right.

178
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,920
Does your mother run a company?

179
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,180
Pardon?

180
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,560
Director Katou mentioned that you were to inherit her company.

181
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,820
