1
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:11,315
Sir.

2
00:02:11,502 --> 00:02:12,712
Is this Cabcab?

3
00:02:12,712 --> 00:02:13,712
Yes, right here.

4
00:02:14,547 --> 00:02:15,756
Can I ask for help?

5
00:02:15,756 --> 00:02:16,756
Yes.

6
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:18,055
Thank you.

7
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:44,826
Claire?

8
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:46,746
Are you Claire?

9
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:49,402
Where did you come from?

10
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:51,584
From Manila.

11
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:52,693
Manila?

12
00:02:54,628 --> 00:02:56,756
They say life is good in Manila.

13
00:02:56,756 --> 00:02:59,425
But you came to the province.

14
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:01,540
Not really.

15
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:03,642
It's chaotic in Manila now.

16
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:05,056
- Ah...
- It only looks fun,

17
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,702
but it's exhausting.

18
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:09,305
Unlike here in the province.

19
00:03:09,727 --> 00:03:10,811
Peaceful,

20
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:11,836
quiet.

21
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:14,068
You're just saying that.

22
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:16,760
A lot of people from here

23
00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:18,449
want to go to Manila.

24
00:03:18,986 --> 00:03:21,775
That’s why they sold their land.

25
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:23,435
They aren't into
farming anymore.

26
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:26,209
Some of them sold it to Titan.

27
00:03:26,494 --> 00:03:28,291
Next time you come here,

28
00:03:28,784 --> 00:03:31,066
there’ll be lots of subdivisions.

29
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,946
You might not get
used to this place.

30
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:36,270
Not really.

31
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:37,463
I actually came
from the province

32
00:03:37,463 --> 00:03:39,224
before I went to Manila.

33
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:40,834
- Ah.
- In Isabela.

34
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:42,259
- Ah.
- Yes.

35
00:03:42,284 --> 00:03:43,494
Alright, come in.

36
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:50,559
I studied agriculture management

37
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:53,254
at North East Luzon State University.

38
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:56,367
Why did you end
up here in Capcap?

39
00:03:58,167 --> 00:03:59,543
Because I got burned out

40
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:01,195
as a call center agent.

41
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,430
It really wasn’t for me.

42
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:06,664
I wanted to return
to my passion.

43
00:04:07,154 --> 00:04:09,250
That’s why I came here.

44
00:04:09,407 --> 00:04:11,616
Hoping I’d find a job.

45
00:04:12,103 --> 00:04:14,034
Salaries aren't that big here,

46
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,086
unlike in Manila.

47
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,667
It’s okay.

48
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:18,963
I understand.

49
00:04:19,016 --> 00:04:20,995
Do you have a place to stay?

50
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:23,092
Actually, I don't.

51
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,136
I’m still looking for one.

52
00:04:25,517 --> 00:04:27,433
You can stay here.

53
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:29,677
There’s a room in the office.

54
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,965
You can sleep there.

55
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,357
Really?

56
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:33,435
Thank you.

57
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:34,879
Don’t worry.

58
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:37,237
You won’t regret hiring me.

59
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:40,602
Boss, we’ve unloaded the stuff...

60
00:04:41,152 --> 00:04:42,560
New delivery, Boss.

61
00:04:43,671 --> 00:04:44,755
This is Caloy.

62
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,781
He works for me.

63
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:47,391
He’s really good at his job.

64
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,535
Caloy.

65
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:53,759
Claire.

66
00:04:55,457 --> 00:04:56,457
Oh.

67
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:58,499
That’s enough.

68
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:01,703
- Is it all set?
- All good, Boss.

69
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:02,832
Boss, I’ll help her out.

70
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:04,530
It’s really like that here.

71
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:06,720
People are hardworking.

72
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,680
Take it to her room.

73
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:30,492
- Come here first.
- Let me grind first.

74
00:05:30,517 --> 00:05:32,145
I'll be the one to
grind on you first.

75
00:07:54,342 --> 00:07:56,386
These are the people
who work for me.

76
00:07:56,652 --> 00:07:59,697
These are the things
that are milled here.

77
00:07:59,722 --> 00:08:01,772
There’s a lot.
All on different dates.

78
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:02,811
It's quite busy now.

79
00:08:02,836 --> 00:08:04,438
Sometimes there's
a lot after harvest.

80
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:05,631
Andres!

81
00:08:06,923 --> 00:08:07,923
Andres!

82
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:09,494
[background chatter]

83
00:08:09,545 --> 00:08:10,546
Andres!

84
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:17,283
All good?

85
00:08:17,941 --> 00:08:19,418
Boss, who is she?

86
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:22,414
She's Claire. She’s the one
replacing Marites.

87
00:08:24,082 --> 00:08:25,405
Andres, by the way.

88
00:08:26,335 --> 00:08:27,335
Claire.

89
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:29,099
And this is my wife,

90
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:30,380
Nora.

91
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,839
Hello.

92
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:35,260
If you need help,

93
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:37,579
or have any questions
about the mill.

94
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:39,503
Don’t hesitate to
ask me, or Nora.

95
00:08:39,598 --> 00:08:41,141
- Right, Nors?
- Yes.

96
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,509
Sure. I’ll definitely ask you.

97
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:46,772
I’m sure you’ll be
a big help to me.

98
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:48,649
What happened here?

99
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:51,101
There’s so much
scattered rice, huh?

100
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
Andres!

101
00:08:53,383 --> 00:08:54,383
Look.

102
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,385
Your machine’s acting up again.

103
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:58,818
It suddenly starts
throwing out rice.

104
00:08:59,176 --> 00:09:00,177
I already told you,

105
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:01,801
you should have
this mill checked.

106
00:09:01,912 --> 00:09:02,955
Later on,

107
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,523
it might break down badly.

108
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:07,612
No, it’s still fine!

109
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:08,794
Maybe,

110
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:11,029
you guys aren’t
watching it closely.

111
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,108
- You're busy doing something else.
- Come here.

112
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:15,117
- Let them argue.
- No, sir.

113
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:16,319
We’ve been watching over it.

114
00:09:16,343 --> 00:09:17,866
Why is the rice scattered then?

115
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:19,822
We’ll just handle it carefully.

116
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,618
- Yes, boss!
- A lot of those who come to mill here...

117
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,683
There's nothing left to eat.

118
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:26,030
They're farmers from Cabcab.

119
00:09:26,828 --> 00:09:28,856
Even from nearby towns like

120
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:30,757
Alvarez and Gerona.

121
00:09:31,498 --> 00:09:32,509
Ah,

122
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,511
boss told me
about that earlier.

123
00:09:36,595 --> 00:09:37,595
Sorry.

124
00:09:38,782 --> 00:09:39,782
For what?

125
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:41,109
Because,

126
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:42,302
I spoke ahead of you.

127
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:44,798
I don't mean to
offend you, Nora.

128
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,166
I'm just a bit frank.
And also,

129
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,863
I don’t like being fake.

130
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:51,628
You don’t have to say sorry

131
00:09:51,653 --> 00:09:53,280
if that’s really how you are.

132
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:57,133
By the way,

133
00:09:57,526 --> 00:10:00,934
are we really the only two women
working here in the mill?

134
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:03,797
Yes. The work here
is pretty heavy too.

135
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,635
Lots of lifting.

136
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:07,828
We’re the only
two women here.

137
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:08,973
Yeah, I noticed.

138
00:10:09,163 --> 00:10:12,192
Good thing my job
here is just bookkeeping.

139
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:14,446
What about you?

140
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:16,084
Have you been here long?

141
00:10:16,393 --> 00:10:17,602
Just a year.

142
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:20,856
Andres talked to
the boss for me

143
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,925
if I could work here.

144
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:25,120
Andres didn’t want me

145
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:27,331
to keep working in the fields.

146
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,570
You know,

147
00:10:28,771 --> 00:10:29,771
he’s right.

148
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:32,597
Good thing you’re
working here now.

149
00:10:33,312 --> 00:10:34,438
It’s easy to get haggard

150
00:10:34,463 --> 00:10:36,162
working in the fields.

151
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:42,029
Don’t worry,

152
00:10:42,054 --> 00:10:43,219
you’re beautiful.

153
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:45,143
Of all the women I’ve seen,

154
00:10:45,168 --> 00:10:47,156
even on TV from the provinces,

155
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:49,508
you’re the most beautiful.

156
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:55,240
Do you notice Claire?

157
00:10:55,442 --> 00:10:56,680
She’s amazing, isn’t she?

158
00:10:56,953 --> 00:10:58,452
Manila is really something else.

159
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:00,208
I bet you,

160
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:01,516
I’ll be the first one.

161
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,056
Huh? I was actually
the first one who met her.

162
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:05,348
You?

163
00:11:05,694 --> 00:11:06,934
With your looks?

164
00:11:07,268 --> 00:11:08,948
She wouldn’t even
give you the time of day.

165
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,374
What she’s looking
for in a man,

166
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,679
is someone who suits her.

167
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:13,042
And that's you?

168
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:15,587
Well, who else
is handsome here?

169
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:17,258
Who do you think looks good?

170
00:11:18,695 --> 00:11:19,822
Be satisfied already, Andres.

171
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,873
You already got Nora,
and now Claire too?

172
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:23,378
Stop arguing.

173
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:25,097
I bet,

174
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:26,748
Chua will be the first.

175
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,684
And let’s see if Chua’s
dick still stands up.

176
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:38,192
Here.

177
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:40,361
This one’s for you.

178
00:11:42,123 --> 00:11:44,626
Don’t open the door for
someone you don’t know.

179
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:46,534
Yes, sir.

180
00:11:47,148 --> 00:11:48,898
Alright, I’m leaving now.

181
00:11:49,788 --> 00:11:50,788
Take care.

182
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:31,843
What are you doing here?

183
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:33,747
Aren’t you supposed
to be home already?

184
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:35,584
Um, I came back...

185
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:36,785
Because maybe...

186
00:12:37,628 --> 00:12:39,047
You need

187
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:40,115
help.

188
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,173
Cleaning here.

189
00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:42,806
I don’t need any help.

190
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:44,091
Go home already.

191
00:12:45,302 --> 00:12:46,553
What a snob.

192
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:48,258
Maybe...

193
00:12:49,462 --> 00:12:50,537
I can...

194
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,021
Sleep here?

195
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:53,089
You know,

196
00:12:53,114 --> 00:12:54,394
there are lots of rats here.

197
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:55,474
And also,

198
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:56,785
their bites hurt.

199
00:12:57,852 --> 00:12:58,852
But I’m...

200
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:00,967
gentle.

201
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:02,904
Damn you!

202
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,862
You’re an asshole.
Go home already.

203
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:07,181
- Come on! Just a moment.
- Go ahead!

204
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,710
Go ahead, keep going.

205
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:11,324
I won’t hesitate
to kill you!

206
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:13,533
Enough! Enough!

207
00:13:14,272 --> 00:13:15,482
I’m just joking.

208
00:13:15,507 --> 00:13:16,507
And,

209
00:13:17,684 --> 00:13:18,706
I’m drunk.

210
00:13:19,148 --> 00:13:21,150
You might end
up like the devil.

211
00:13:21,464 --> 00:13:23,412
Wait a minute. Stop that!

212
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:25,890
You're drunk? Yeah, right!

213
00:13:26,257 --> 00:13:27,257
Maybe you want me...

214
00:13:27,296 --> 00:13:28,512
to cut off your dick!

215
00:13:28,537 --> 00:13:30,043
You idiot!

216
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:31,463
- Hey!
- Get out of here!

217
00:13:31,488 --> 00:13:34,215
Yeah! Okay, okay!
I’m leaving! Yeah!

218
00:13:36,122 --> 00:13:37,122
Out!

219
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:46,546
Get out of here, you bastard.

220
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:48,025
Or else, I'll make
you pay for this.

221
00:13:48,657 --> 00:13:49,657
You beast!

222
00:13:49,702 --> 00:13:50,720
Sir Carmelo.

223
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
Huh?

224
00:13:51,903 --> 00:13:53,701
Just think about it.

225
00:13:53,932 --> 00:13:57,474
The one million I’m
offering you is a lot

226
00:13:57,499 --> 00:13:58,770
for your land.

227
00:13:59,126 --> 00:14:01,048
I don’t need your money!

228
00:14:01,561 --> 00:14:02,897
I won’t allow you
to turn this land

229
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:04,005
the one that gave me life

230
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,616
- into a subdivision.
- Dad!

231
00:14:05,641 --> 00:14:07,323
- All of that is yours!
- Dad!

232
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,480
Get out of here.

233
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:09,821
- Why should I stay here?
- Dad! Dad!

234
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:10,921
- What!
- Enough, dad!

235
00:14:10,946 --> 00:14:11,964
- You bastard!
- Acting tough, huh?

236
00:14:11,988 --> 00:14:12,990
Brave my ass—

237
00:14:13,015 --> 00:14:14,021
- I really am brave.
- Dad! Please, no—

238
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:15,201
- I hope it won’t come to violence!
- Sorry.

239
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:17,783
- Please.
- We might convince Sir Oliver.

240
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:19,989
- Your father is an asshole!
- I’ve talked to him many times already,

241
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:21,042
calmly even.

242
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:22,749
What did he do?
Kept coming back!

243
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:25,318
- Why, huh?
- I’m just working, okay?

244
00:14:26,002 --> 00:14:27,921
Our project keeps
getting delayed

245
00:14:27,946 --> 00:14:29,775
because you won’t
sell your land!

246
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,273
All your neighbors,

247
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:33,552
they already sold their land to me!

248
00:14:33,577 --> 00:14:35,554
You’re the only one
who’s not selling!

249
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,180
Their houses have improved!

250
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:38,857
Their lives have improved!

251
00:14:38,882 --> 00:14:40,402
Do you think you
can improve your life?

252
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,562
I don’t care!

253
00:14:42,587 --> 00:14:44,146
- You idiot!
- Dad!

254
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:46,228
- Get out of here!
- You’re stingy! If you want,

255
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,858
let’s just burn this
whole house down!

256
00:14:47,883 --> 00:14:48,925
You really are brave!

257
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,951
- Hey!
- Go ahead!

258
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:52,325
- Dad, wait a moment!
- Oh! Go ahead!

259
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:53,810
- Sir!
- As if!

260
00:14:55,108 --> 00:14:56,108
Enough, let’s stop!

261
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,518
Stop. Sir Oliver! Please! Sorry!

262
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,234
Please! Sir Oliver!

263
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,525
Please leave!

264
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:04,899
Here.

265
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:09,262
In case your crazy dad
will change his mind...

266
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:10,971
Here! Call me!

267
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:13,824
Damn bastard.

268
00:15:13,903 --> 00:15:15,743
- Calm down.
- Crazy! Son of a bitch!

269
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:21,050
Idiot!

270
00:15:23,477 --> 00:15:24,477
Give it to me.

271
00:15:25,497 --> 00:15:26,749
All you do is nonsense!

272
00:15:42,061 --> 00:15:43,729
Dad, please drink water first.

273
00:15:43,754 --> 00:15:45,194
You already have
high blood pressure.

274
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:56,051
That Titanland agent
will not stop bothering me,

275
00:15:56,076 --> 00:15:58,567
until they still haven't
gotten this land.

276
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:02,513
Please don’t threaten
people that you'll stab them.

277
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:04,598
They might come
back for you later.

278
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:06,810
Or they might pin it on you.

279
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:08,172
Maybe later,

280
00:16:08,213 --> 00:16:09,798
you’ll lose your anger,

281
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,420
you might kill Oliver,

282
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:12,804
you’ll go to jail.

283
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:15,971
I don’t care.

284
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:18,361
If I go to jail,

285
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:20,141
whether it’s death or not,

286
00:16:20,141 --> 00:16:22,248
I won’t sell this land.

287
00:16:22,508 --> 00:16:23,593
Remember that!

288
00:16:25,172 --> 00:16:26,609
If you get jailed,

289
00:16:27,065 --> 00:16:28,250
that will be a problem.

290
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,523
We won’t allow
you to rot in jail.

291
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:33,296
And where will
we get a lawyer?

292
00:16:33,323 --> 00:16:35,242
In the end,
we might sell this land.

293
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:37,183
What? What did you say? Huh?

294
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:38,251
What did you say?

295
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,185
- Blood will be shed first, you idiot!
- Dad!

296
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:42,648
Andres didn't say anything bad.

297
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:45,599
What do you mean he
didn't say anything bad?

298
00:16:45,623 --> 00:16:47,115
Didn't you hear what he said?

299
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,508
He'll sell our land!

300
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,264
If you don’t want it to happen,

301
00:16:58,523 --> 00:17:00,473
it will happen
because of your anger.

302
00:17:06,313 --> 00:17:07,313
You,

303
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,481
You, Nora.

304
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:11,008
Listen. Listen carefully to me.

305
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:14,432
No matter what happens,

306
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,291
never ever sell our land.

307
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:21,515
Even if I kill,

308
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,856
go to jail,

309
00:17:23,785 --> 00:17:24,869
or die.

310
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:30,273
I have nothing
else to give you,

311
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,533
and your future children

312
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:34,811
from your useless husband.

313
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:36,926
Except this land.

314
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,888
So think hard, think hard.

315
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,377
This is the only
inheritance I have for you.

316
00:17:42,456 --> 00:17:43,624
Remember that.

317
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:47,891
And that Andres,
don’t listen to him.

318
00:17:48,475 --> 00:17:50,186
Because only you,

319
00:17:50,732 --> 00:17:54,938
only you can decide.

320
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:02,994
Do we understand each other?

321
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,333
Answer!

322
00:18:28,937 --> 00:18:30,580
Fifty kilos.

323
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:33,146
Okay, Andres.
Please get this, okay?

324
00:18:33,219 --> 00:18:35,151
Later, Ma'am Valdez will take it.

325
00:18:35,178 --> 00:18:37,483
So, that’s 50 sacks
in total, alright?

326
00:18:37,508 --> 00:18:38,511
Thanks!

327
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:42,839
Lover’s quarrel with Andres?

328
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:43,989
Is there a problem?

329
00:18:46,255 --> 00:18:47,255
Hey!

330
00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:52,419
You can talk to me.

331
00:18:52,444 --> 00:18:53,688
I’m ready to listen.

332
00:18:55,714 --> 00:18:58,081
Well, maybe you
won’t understand us.

333
00:18:58,795 --> 00:19:00,255
You’re from Manila.

334
00:19:01,194 --> 00:19:02,487
Just because I’m from Manila,

335
00:19:02,512 --> 00:19:04,388
doesn’t mean I won’t
understand you.

336
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:06,767
Nora, we’re both women.

337
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:08,867
We’re going through
the same things.

338
00:19:09,597 --> 00:19:12,227
Maybe what you’ve
going through,

339
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:14,936
I’ve been through it too.

340
00:19:15,223 --> 00:19:16,891
I have a lot of experience.

341
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:22,535
It's about Andres

342
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:24,141
and Dad.

343
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:26,296
- And?
- They got into a fight last night.

344
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:27,801
Huh?

345
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,374
Someone wants to buy our land.

346
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,391
My Dad told me.

347
00:19:35,803 --> 00:19:37,785
No matter what
happens to him,

348
00:19:38,505 --> 00:19:40,244
I should never sell it.

349
00:19:44,085 --> 00:19:46,197
Will you follow what
your Dad wants?

350
00:19:47,557 --> 00:19:48,557
Yes.

351
00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:50,459
That’s my Dad.

352
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:52,103
And I know

353
00:19:52,128 --> 00:19:54,604
how much that land
means to him.

354
00:19:55,398 --> 00:19:56,446
But,

355
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,126
Andres...

356
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,320
He can’t see

357
00:20:00,345 --> 00:20:02,183
his place here in Cabcab.

358
00:20:02,864 --> 00:20:05,325
You’re really going
through a hard time.

359
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:07,987
But if I were you, Nora.

360
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:09,964
My husband and I would talk,

361
00:20:10,722 --> 00:20:12,766
we’d weigh the situation.

362
00:20:12,983 --> 00:20:15,736
What would be
best for our family?

363
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:18,585
What would be best for us?

364
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:22,331
You need to think
about your future.

365
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:24,715
Not just what you
have right now.

366
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:27,705
[background chatter]

367
00:20:27,874 --> 00:20:30,545
Here’s the noodles for you,

368
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,355
and here’s the beer for us.

369
00:20:33,682 --> 00:20:37,500
You live longer,

370
00:20:37,901 --> 00:20:41,321
and we’ll get drunk.

371
00:20:43,195 --> 00:20:46,866
And when we’re drunk,

372
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:48,838
we’ll be the ones

373
00:20:48,863 --> 00:20:51,955
- to make love.
- Ah, cheers!

374
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,054
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

375
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,503
Yes!

376
00:20:59,576 --> 00:21:00,576
[exhales]

377
00:21:01,954 --> 00:21:02,954
Caloy!

378
00:21:03,238 --> 00:21:04,499
You seem out of it.

379
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,260
It's nothing.

380
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:07,508
[sighs]

381
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:09,920
You know, Claire?

382
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:12,047
The new secretary of ours.

383
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:15,016
Why?
Got rejected?

384
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:17,318
No. You know dude...

385
00:21:18,147 --> 00:21:19,171
She's weird.

386
00:21:19,524 --> 00:21:21,080
Like she’s crazy.

387
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:22,926
[scoffs] Geez!

388
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:24,905
You’re just saying that.

389
00:21:25,321 --> 00:21:26,685
Because you can’t show off.

390
00:21:28,232 --> 00:21:30,760
Hey! Looks like
you’re having fun!

391
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:32,027
Whose birthday is it?

392
00:21:32,052 --> 00:21:33,136
Oh, Claire!

393
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,126
What's his problem?

394
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,220
Ah, no. Don’t mind that.

395
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:40,608
Have a seat here.

396
00:21:42,932 --> 00:21:44,869
Come here! Sit next to me!

397
00:21:44,894 --> 00:21:46,466
- I'll stay here.
- Sit here!

398
00:21:46,693 --> 00:21:48,820
- I'm fine.
- It’s Temyong’s birthday.

399
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:50,627
Oh, here’s some noodles.

400
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:52,319
- Thanks.
- Try some.

401
00:21:54,886 --> 00:21:56,540
- Eat up.
- It’s delicious!

402
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,261
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

403
00:21:58,286 --> 00:21:59,286
Cheers!

404
00:22:02,816 --> 00:22:04,770
We're going home now, Claire!

405
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,460
- Stay here for a while, bro.
- Okay, bro!

406
00:22:07,508 --> 00:22:08,508
Alright, alright!

407
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:10,550
Sir, take care, okay?
Happy birthday again!

408
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:12,695
- I'll take care of this.
- Thank you very much! Okay!

409
00:22:15,288 --> 00:22:16,309
- I'll do it.
- No, I'll do it.

410
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,029
- I'll do it!
- I can do this!

411
00:22:18,054 --> 00:22:19,481
- I said, I'll do it!
- I'll do it!

412
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:20,506
Ouch!

413
00:22:20,987 --> 00:22:22,154
You're so annoying!

414
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:23,597
I told you, I'll do it!

415
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:26,317
- That hurts!
- We're the ones who invited you over.

416
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,770
Okay!

417
00:22:29,427 --> 00:22:31,012
Caloy said,

418
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:32,604
that you're crazy.

419
00:22:38,144 --> 00:22:39,187
Is that true?

420
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:42,074
Do you believe him?

421
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,038
No. I'm not gullible.

422
00:22:46,461 --> 00:22:47,604
Unless I see it for myself.

423
00:22:56,371 --> 00:22:57,497
Why?

424
00:22:59,706 --> 00:23:00,724
There!

425
00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:02,501
Do you believe Caloy now?

426
00:23:04,045 --> 00:23:05,048
Yes.

427
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:26,067
Why?

428
00:23:31,698 --> 00:23:32,704
Nothing really.

429
00:23:33,238 --> 00:23:35,437
The people from Manila
really taste good.

430
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,035
Damn!

431
00:25:29,313 --> 00:25:31,083
The girls from Manila
really taste good.

432
00:25:32,957 --> 00:25:35,192
What’s the difference between
the pussy of someone here,

433
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:36,551
and someone from Manila?

434
00:25:38,254 --> 00:25:40,606
I’m fed up with the
pussy from the province.

435
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:42,794
They all taste the same.

436
00:25:43,474 --> 00:25:44,558
Stale.

437
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,470
Like that.

438
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:48,404
But you,

439
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:50,950
taste like melon.

440
00:25:52,138 --> 00:25:53,258
Idiot!

441
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,073
You only tasted
my feminine wash.

442
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:57,559
That’s all.

443
00:25:57,686 --> 00:25:58,728
And also...

444
00:25:58,813 --> 00:26:00,179
Don’t think it’s the fresh taste

445
00:26:00,204 --> 00:26:02,409
of the pussy from Manila.

446
00:26:02,904 --> 00:26:04,072
There are others that...

447
00:26:04,143 --> 00:26:05,510
taste of pollution,

448
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,150
taste of sewage.

449
00:26:08,012 --> 00:26:10,501
Others even taste
like spoiled bread.

450
00:26:10,864 --> 00:26:13,128
But there’s also some who
taste like toasted rice flakes.

451
00:26:15,514 --> 00:26:17,624
Why? You know a lot.

452
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:20,764
Have you ever
tasted a pussy before?

453
00:26:22,052 --> 00:26:23,052
You’re crazy!

454
00:26:23,192 --> 00:26:24,318
It is studied

455
00:26:24,343 --> 00:26:26,047
in reproductive health.

456
00:26:26,271 --> 00:26:27,623
And it depends on

457
00:26:27,648 --> 00:26:29,910
a woman’s lifestyle
and hygiene.

458
00:26:33,189 --> 00:26:34,482
Sorry...

459
00:26:35,948 --> 00:26:37,581
I only finished high school.

460
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:42,469
But damn.

461
00:26:43,282 --> 00:26:45,493
When I finally get to Manila,

462
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:48,186
I’ll really get to taste different

463
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:50,491
kinds of pussy from Manila girls.

464
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,030
Damn!

465
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:56,320
Is that the only reason
you want to go to Manila?

466
00:26:57,622 --> 00:26:59,082
Of course not.

467
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,515
I’m just joking.

468
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,585
I’m just tired of my life here.

469
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:10,210
Have you talked
to Nora about that?

470
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:12,494
Oh no!

471
00:27:12,574 --> 00:27:13,867
If she had to choose,

472
00:27:13,892 --> 00:27:15,468
between her dad or me,

473
00:27:17,018 --> 00:27:18,797
she’d choose her dad.

474
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:21,708
Even if her dad’s
already dead.

475
00:27:23,203 --> 00:27:24,880
She’d still pick her dad.

476
00:28:03,511 --> 00:28:04,576
Hey!

477
00:28:04,905 --> 00:28:06,073
I’m tired!

478
00:28:19,277 --> 00:28:20,277
Hey!

479
00:28:22,444 --> 00:28:23,444
[sighs]

480
00:28:25,866 --> 00:28:26,866
What the!

481
00:28:55,556 --> 00:28:56,682
What the heck!

482
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,333
Hey!

483
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:18,701
How are you? Huh?

484
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,035
Come down!

485
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:21,421
Let’s talk!

486
00:29:22,006 --> 00:29:23,932
Okay! Come down!

487
00:29:25,813 --> 00:29:26,813
Is that okay?

488
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:30,161
Um...

489
00:29:31,932 --> 00:29:33,601
Thank you for

490
00:29:34,532 --> 00:29:35,783
facing me.

491
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:37,690
It seems

492
00:29:37,915 --> 00:29:43,154
you’re more reasonable
to talk to than Sir Carmelo.

493
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:46,503
I’ll be honest with you, okay?

494
00:29:47,107 --> 00:29:48,359
Since

495
00:29:48,391 --> 00:29:51,873
your father firmly said

496
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:55,103
not to sell the land to us,

497
00:29:55,831 --> 00:29:57,840
a lot of

498
00:29:58,593 --> 00:30:01,587
investors have
already backed out.

499
00:30:02,063 --> 00:30:05,066
Our company will lose a lot

500
00:30:05,091 --> 00:30:06,467
if that happens.

501
00:30:08,495 --> 00:30:10,122
That’s not our problem.

502
00:30:10,763 --> 00:30:11,797
Nora,

503
00:30:12,317 --> 00:30:14,241
let’s first listen to Sir Oliver.

504
00:30:15,727 --> 00:30:18,554
2.5 million.

505
00:30:20,496 --> 00:30:23,260
That’s my final

506
00:30:23,401 --> 00:30:24,693
offer to you.

507
00:30:25,444 --> 00:30:26,980
I’ll add another

508
00:30:27,352 --> 00:30:28,559
twenty percent.

509
00:30:29,172 --> 00:30:32,353
For convincing your father

510
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,783
to sell us your land.

511
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:38,142
Nora,

512
00:30:38,223 --> 00:30:39,320
did you hear that?

513
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:40,935
Two million.

514
00:30:41,742 --> 00:30:43,559
Our lives can change with that.

515
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:48,074
But Dad will be mad.

516
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,648
If we force him
to sell the land.

517
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:53,389
Think about
our future family.

518
00:30:54,087 --> 00:30:55,451
What if you get pregnant?

519
00:30:55,943 --> 00:30:57,176
What about the child?

520
00:30:57,796 --> 00:30:59,423
We need the money.

521
00:31:03,173 --> 00:31:04,749
Try to think about it too.

522
00:31:04,773 --> 00:31:10,489
The money I'm offering you
is a big amount.

523
00:31:11,615 --> 00:31:12,615
Yes.

524
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,784
They are offering us
a huge sum.

525
00:31:15,411 --> 00:31:18,254
But I shouldn’t disobey Dad.

526
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,957
You know,

527
00:31:23,297 --> 00:31:25,749
your father is
too sentimental.

528
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,882
In this day and age, Nora.

529
00:31:27,907 --> 00:31:29,975
We need to be practical.

530
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:32,169
Only once in our lives

531
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:34,651
will someone offer
more than two million.

532
00:31:35,872 --> 00:31:37,457
Two million!

533
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:39,214
Nora!

534
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:41,353
No matter how hard we work,

535
00:31:41,378 --> 00:31:44,131
we can’t save that much.

536
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,287
So please,

537
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:47,480
think it over.

538
00:31:52,352 --> 00:31:53,812
Ouch! Ouch!

539
00:31:53,837 --> 00:31:55,719
- Hey!
- My back is really itchy.

540
00:31:55,744 --> 00:31:56,952
Can you scratch it for me?

541
00:31:57,212 --> 00:31:58,212
It’s so itchy!

542
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:00,681
- It’s painful!
- Wait!

543
00:32:00,826 --> 00:32:02,883
- Can you take off your clothes?
- What?

544
00:32:03,036 --> 00:32:04,704
Take off your clothes!

545
00:32:40,649 --> 00:32:41,709
Here?

546
00:32:45,084 --> 00:32:46,252
I'll take it off, okay?

547
00:32:55,177 --> 00:32:56,177
Still itchy?

548
00:32:59,765 --> 00:33:00,765
It hurts.

549
00:33:30,713 --> 00:33:32,131
It’s so itchy!

550
00:33:32,381 --> 00:33:33,757
There’s so much of it.

551
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:27,144
I’ll help you.

552
00:38:14,094 --> 00:38:15,141
Hello, boss.

553
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:19,165
Alright, sir. Okay.

554
00:38:58,707 --> 00:38:59,707
Idiot!

555
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:01,883
Damn it!

556
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,210
What the heck!

557
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:05,887
I just want to ask you,

558
00:39:06,004 --> 00:39:08,904
how’s that job I
asked you to do?

559
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:12,341
I'm working on it.

560
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:13,979
The man,

561
00:39:14,204 --> 00:39:15,204
Andres.

562
00:39:15,805 --> 00:39:17,056
I’ve gained his trust.

563
00:39:18,557 --> 00:39:19,622
You can easily

564
00:39:19,647 --> 00:39:21,107
convince him.

565
00:39:21,914 --> 00:39:23,124
He’s ambitious.

566
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:24,905
But,

567
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:27,317
his family won’t listen to him.

568
00:39:28,691 --> 00:39:30,213
The woman,

569
00:39:30,864 --> 00:39:33,033
Sir Carmelo’s daughter.

570
00:39:33,442 --> 00:39:34,818
She’s the one you

571
00:39:34,843 --> 00:39:36,517
need to gain trust from.

572
00:39:37,245 --> 00:39:38,288
She is the one

573
00:39:38,313 --> 00:39:42,426
who will convince her father
to sell the land to us.

574
00:39:46,463 --> 00:39:47,552
Don’t worry.

575
00:39:47,756 --> 00:39:49,675
I’ll gain her trust, too.

576
00:39:51,218 --> 00:39:52,772
When? Huh?

577
00:39:53,094 --> 00:39:54,721
Our bosses are already

578
00:39:54,746 --> 00:39:56,042
angry with us.

579
00:39:56,886 --> 00:39:57,886
So?

580
00:39:58,533 --> 00:39:59,868
I even paid you

581
00:39:59,893 --> 00:40:01,103
for that, you know.

582
00:40:02,178 --> 00:40:03,455
Do you still want

583
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,732
to stay here longer?

584
00:40:05,941 --> 00:40:06,941
No.

585
00:40:07,526 --> 00:40:08,925
I want to leave already.

586
00:40:09,778 --> 00:40:11,405
I miss Manila.

587
00:40:12,155 --> 00:40:13,532
Then do it!

588
00:40:13,782 --> 00:40:14,782
Do it!

589
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:19,185
Give me some time.

590
00:40:20,636 --> 00:40:22,263
Give me some time, okay?

591
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:23,808
Are you sure?

592
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:25,270
Huh?

593
00:40:25,377 --> 00:40:26,416
Yes.

594
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,170
What the heck!

595
00:40:30,766 --> 00:40:31,766
Shh!

596
00:40:31,823 --> 00:40:33,344
- What the heck!
- Shh!

597
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:35,177
Hey! No one's here.

598
00:40:37,021 --> 00:40:40,434
Don’t you want an
adventure? Come on!

599
00:40:40,434 --> 00:40:41,794
- Damn it!
- Just let me have this.

600
00:40:41,868 --> 00:40:43,654
Are you stupid?
Stop it, okay?

601
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:44,758
That wasn’t in the deal.

602
00:40:44,783 --> 00:40:46,406
Fine then! We’ll talk about it.

603
00:40:46,431 --> 00:40:48,346
Okay? Come on!

604
00:40:48,468 --> 00:40:51,385
[groans] What the heck!
Damn you!

605
00:40:51,963 --> 00:40:53,497
Idiot! Shit!

606
00:40:56,223 --> 00:40:57,259
Son of a bitch.

607
00:40:57,804 --> 00:40:58,804
Idiot!

608
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:00,357
Crazy!

609
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:02,356
Damn idiot!

610
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:06,835
Shit! Son of a bitch!

611
00:41:07,352 --> 00:41:08,404
Shit!

612
00:41:08,429 --> 00:41:09,681
Damn it!

613
00:41:10,456 --> 00:41:11,729
This...

614
00:41:11,754 --> 00:41:12,838
It's already dry.

615
00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:14,479
So fast.

616
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:15,658
You know,

617
00:41:16,055 --> 00:41:18,016
this is my first time
to hang clothes like this.

618
00:41:18,868 --> 00:41:20,475
Because in Manila,

619
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,522
I usually send
them to the laundry.

620
00:41:23,221 --> 00:41:24,650
It’s windy here.

621
00:41:24,675 --> 00:41:25,718
And sunny.

622
00:41:26,524 --> 00:41:27,735
Clothes dry quickly.

623
00:41:29,846 --> 00:41:30,889
Be careful.

624
00:41:31,665 --> 00:41:32,781
Ah.

625
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,559
So that’s why your
land here is like this.

626
00:41:36,682 --> 00:41:37,806
Really dry.

627
00:41:38,779 --> 00:41:39,811
Like you,

628
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:41,571
really dry.

629
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:43,618
You’re too much.

630
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,355
Hey, that’s just a joke, okay?

631
00:41:48,233 --> 00:41:49,301
But...

632
00:41:49,514 --> 00:41:51,020
I feel like even you,

633
00:41:51,152 --> 00:41:52,234
are really dry.

634
00:41:53,474 --> 00:41:54,811
What did you say?

635
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:01,628
Like your lips,

636
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:02,875
really dry.

637
00:48:13,879 --> 00:48:14,879
Nora!

638
00:48:15,407 --> 00:48:16,655
Wait for me!

639
00:48:17,213 --> 00:48:18,255
Hurry up.

640
00:48:18,827 --> 00:48:19,827
Wait a moment.

641
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,728
Where have you been?

642
00:48:27,066 --> 00:48:28,494
We just did the laundry, dad.

643
00:48:28,899 --> 00:48:29,899
Hmm.

644
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:32,174
Who is she?

645
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:33,419
She’s Claire, dad.

646
00:48:33,444 --> 00:48:34,824
My new friend.

647
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:36,976
- Hmm...
- We work together at the mill.

648
00:48:37,836 --> 00:48:38,836
Hmm...

649
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:40,749
Good day, Sir.

650
00:48:40,991 --> 00:48:41,991
Okay.

651
00:48:42,344 --> 00:48:44,337
Alright, Nora. I’ll go ahead.

652
00:48:44,641 --> 00:48:46,729
Thanks for helping
with the laundry, okay?

653
00:48:46,754 --> 00:48:47,901
Thank you.

654
00:48:51,649 --> 00:48:53,044
- Dad.
- Hmm?

655
00:48:53,131 --> 00:48:54,272
Let’s go inside now.

656
00:48:54,297 --> 00:48:55,507
Ah, I’ll have coffee first.

657
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:56,699
- You go ahead.
- Okay.

658
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:19,555
Claire! Claire! Come here.

659
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:21,530
Hey...

660
00:49:23,781 --> 00:49:25,084
Are you avoiding me?

661
00:49:26,137 --> 00:49:27,198
Andres, come on.

662
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:29,231
Your wife might see us.

663
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:30,912
So what?

664
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:34,185
I can just say we’re
just talking about work.

665
00:49:35,204 --> 00:49:37,695
I really can’t forget what
happened between us that night.

666
00:49:38,317 --> 00:49:40,377
Can I ask you
to be with me again?

667
00:49:41,746 --> 00:49:42,935
Are you crazy?

668
00:49:44,215 --> 00:49:45,264
That was only once,

669
00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:46,948
and it won’t happen again.

670
00:49:52,731 --> 00:49:54,441
I’ll talk to Dad.

671
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,936
I’ll convince him to sell the land.

672
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,370
Really?

673
00:50:01,145 --> 00:50:03,111
Yes, it'd be a waste
not to accept the money.

674
00:50:03,405 --> 00:50:05,096
It’s also for our family.

675
00:50:05,154 --> 00:50:06,781
And for the baby, too.

676
00:50:08,163 --> 00:50:09,832
Good think you thought of that.

677
00:50:12,731 --> 00:50:13,857
Just make sure

678
00:50:14,507 --> 00:50:15,985
you’ll support me.

679
00:50:16,204 --> 00:50:17,832
When I talk to him.

680
00:50:19,551 --> 00:50:20,551
Yes, love.

681
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,349
I will support you.

682
00:54:34,342 --> 00:54:35,814
What's wrong?

683
00:54:44,787 --> 00:54:46,325
You feel so good.

684
00:56:03,138 --> 00:56:04,338
Yes, like that!

685
00:56:56,926 --> 00:56:58,219
Eat well.

686
00:56:58,473 --> 00:56:59,496
- Eat a lot.
- We still have

687
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,152
a lot to do in the field.

688
00:57:10,001 --> 00:57:11,022
Is there...

689
00:57:11,517 --> 00:57:12,638
something you want to say?

690
00:57:15,211 --> 00:57:18,005
Dad, we talked to Sir Oliver.

691
00:57:19,393 --> 00:57:21,594
You’re talking to that demon?

692
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:23,305
What did you say to him?

693
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,335
Dad,

694
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:29,456
- they offered us 2.5 million—
- Don’t get involved.

695
00:57:29,844 --> 00:57:31,138
Don’t get involved!

696
00:57:31,218 --> 00:57:32,221
I’m still alive!

697
00:57:32,246 --> 00:57:33,766
You're already wanting
to sell my land!

698
00:57:33,881 --> 00:57:36,921
Dad, Andres is only thinking
about the future of our family!

699
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,242
You don’t need to worry

700
00:57:38,267 --> 00:57:40,195
because this land is here!

701
00:57:40,382 --> 00:57:42,614
I inherited this land
from my ancestors.

702
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,203
But dad,

703
00:57:44,228 --> 00:57:46,996
we won’t be slaves
to this land forever.

704
00:57:47,532 --> 00:57:49,377
I have no intention of
dying just as a farmer!

705
00:57:49,402 --> 00:57:51,129
- You’re really stupid!
- Dad!

706
00:57:51,972 --> 00:57:54,053
- Dad!
- Ah, enough!

707
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,797
Dad!

708
00:57:56,522 --> 00:57:57,522
Dad!

709
00:57:59,006 --> 00:58:00,007
- Dad!
- You damn--

710
00:58:00,032 --> 00:58:01,160
- You bastard!
- Dad!

711
00:58:01,185 --> 00:58:02,882
- Dad, stop it!
- Dad!

712
00:58:02,907 --> 00:58:03,907
Dad!

713
00:58:04,077 --> 00:58:06,068
- Dad!
- Ah, enough!

714
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,858
- You bastard! I will kill you.
- Dad!

715
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:11,877
- Enough already!
- You better kick your husband out!

716
00:58:11,902 --> 00:58:13,574
I don’t want to see his face!

717
00:58:13,671 --> 00:58:14,700
Dad!

718
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:16,497
If you kick Andres out,

719
00:58:16,655 --> 00:58:18,032
I’ll go with him!

720
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:21,206
Is that so?

721
00:58:21,563 --> 00:58:22,563
Fine.

722
00:58:23,796 --> 00:58:24,890
Then go ahead!

723
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:26,211
But when I come back,

724
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:28,070
I don’t want to see
your faces here, okay?

725
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:30,386
I don’t want to see
you in my house!

726
00:58:48,479 --> 00:58:49,603
Any news?

727
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:51,045
Don’t worry!

728
00:58:51,485 --> 00:58:52,692
I can handle Nora now!

729
00:58:53,059 --> 00:58:54,102
Can you?

730
00:58:54,127 --> 00:58:55,336
You’re all talk!

731
00:58:55,754 --> 00:58:57,255
We're running out of time!

732
00:58:57,545 --> 00:59:00,733
Nothing is happening
with all the plans we made!

733
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,235
Nora is close to
convincing her father!

734
00:59:04,153 --> 00:59:06,217
We don’t have
any more time!

735
00:59:06,693 --> 00:59:07,867
You keep making promises!

736
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:09,707
I've given you enough time!

737
00:59:10,417 --> 00:59:12,108
- You know?
- She’s about to get the land.

738
00:59:12,134 --> 00:59:13,174
You...

739
00:59:13,462 --> 00:59:14,777
Beasts!

740
00:59:15,213 --> 00:59:19,280
- Sir Carmelo?
- You’re poisoning my daughter's mind.

741
00:59:21,278 --> 00:59:23,108
Sir Carmelo,
wait a moment!

742
00:59:23,336 --> 00:59:25,189
- You misunderstood.
- Misunderstood?

743
00:59:25,777 --> 00:59:27,612
Really? I heard you clearly!

744
00:59:27,637 --> 00:59:28,797
I heard it loud and clear!

745
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:32,022
You’re the one
convincing my daughter!

746
00:59:32,273 --> 00:59:33,759
I thought you were her friend?

747
00:59:34,078 --> 00:59:36,482
You even teamed up
with this demon here?

748
00:59:37,175 --> 00:59:38,175
Well...

749
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:39,784
Hold hands!

750
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:40,869
Straight to hell!

751
00:59:40,894 --> 00:59:42,898
I’ll kill you, you sons of bitches!

752
00:59:55,616 --> 00:59:57,159
Why did you kill him?

753
00:59:57,895 --> 01:00:00,314
Why did you kill Nora’s father?

754
01:00:00,339 --> 01:00:02,253
Good thing that...
I was the one who killed him!

755
01:00:02,278 --> 01:00:03,998
Better than you being
the one killed by him!

756
01:00:06,297 --> 01:00:07,645
What are we going to do?

757
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,192
Come on!
Let’s get out of here!

758
01:00:09,275 --> 01:00:12,142
Someone might see us here!

759
01:00:12,265 --> 01:00:13,593
So, come on!

760
01:00:20,928 --> 01:00:22,121
Come on!

761
01:00:22,206 --> 01:00:24,325
In case someone
still sees us here!

762
01:00:24,623 --> 01:00:26,192
Son of a bitch!

763
01:00:26,663 --> 01:00:27,663
Come on!

764
01:00:31,986 --> 01:00:32,986
Andres!

765
01:00:33,745 --> 01:00:34,746
Andres!

766
01:00:34,771 --> 01:00:35,772
Nora!

767
01:00:39,964 --> 01:00:41,006
Caloy, what is it?

768
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,080
Bro.

769
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:44,559
Nora.

770
01:00:46,566 --> 01:00:47,650
Sir Carmelo...

771
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:50,045
Don’t be shocked.

772
01:00:50,624 --> 01:00:51,985
Nora, your father is dead.

773
01:01:48,075 --> 01:01:49,075
No...

774
01:01:49,335 --> 01:01:50,335
No...

775
01:02:36,064 --> 01:02:38,108
I already talked to Sarge earlier.

776
01:02:39,668 --> 01:02:42,100
There’s still no suspect
in your father’s death.

777
01:02:43,446 --> 01:02:44,446
I know.

778
01:02:45,309 --> 01:02:46,852
My father will be angry

779
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:49,555
if we leave this house.

780
01:02:59,292 --> 01:03:00,939
If we stay here...

781
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:05,319
You’ll just keep remembering
your father’s death.

782
01:03:07,001 --> 01:03:08,635
Let’s move to Manila.

783
01:03:09,964 --> 01:03:11,215
We’ll start over there.

784
01:04:00,577 --> 01:04:01,578
Here.

785
01:04:03,243 --> 01:04:04,661
That’s five hundred thousand.

786
01:04:05,554 --> 01:04:07,410
Just like we talked about.

787
01:04:10,629 --> 01:04:12,052
Did Nora already agree

788
01:04:12,636 --> 01:04:13,779
to sell the land?

789
01:04:13,903 --> 01:04:15,296
I told you.

790
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:17,653
What happened was a blessing.

791
01:04:18,774 --> 01:04:19,774
So?

792
01:04:20,569 --> 01:04:21,723
Are you ready

793
01:04:22,017 --> 01:04:23,798
to go back to Manila?

794
01:04:24,807 --> 01:04:26,100
As long as...

795
01:04:26,455 --> 01:04:27,895
Yo don't forget what
we talked about.

796
01:04:28,466 --> 01:04:32,092
Nobody has to know
about what happened.

797
01:04:32,563 --> 01:04:33,563
Okay?

798
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:36,863
- Hmm?
- Stop it.

799
01:04:37,245 --> 01:04:38,245
Just a little...

800
01:04:38,762 --> 01:04:39,763
Just a kiss.

801
01:04:40,055 --> 01:04:41,060
Stop it!

802
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:42,220
What the...

803
01:04:42,498 --> 01:04:43,498
Here.

804
01:04:44,618 --> 01:04:45,623
Here.

805
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:46,733
I’ll add more.

806
01:04:54,846 --> 01:04:56,014
This bitch!

807
01:04:57,036 --> 01:04:58,288
Are you leaving?

808
01:05:00,538 --> 01:05:01,538
Why?

809
01:05:01,994 --> 01:05:02,994
Yes.

810
01:05:03,648 --> 01:05:05,782
I really don’t belong here.

811
01:05:06,628 --> 01:05:08,490
I already miss Manila.

812
01:05:09,224 --> 01:05:10,479
I told you so.

813
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:13,454
You won’t last here.

814
01:05:14,763 --> 01:05:17,241
The province is just
an adventure for you.

815
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:19,566
What can I do?

816
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:22,392
Then I’ll find someone
to replace you.

817
01:05:26,018 --> 01:05:27,120
Sorry about that.

818
01:05:43,214 --> 01:05:44,214
Nora.

819
01:05:46,596 --> 01:05:47,722
Sorry for not going

820
01:05:47,747 --> 01:05:50,005
to your father’s wake.

821
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:56,039
It’s okay.

822
01:06:00,619 --> 01:06:01,643
About what happened

823
01:06:01,668 --> 01:06:03,169
between us.

824
01:06:04,364 --> 01:06:06,730
Is it okay if we forget it?

825
01:06:07,462 --> 01:06:08,880
I’m leaving too.

826
01:06:09,731 --> 01:06:11,325
I already said
goodbye to Chua.

827
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:16,689
You’re going to sell your land?

828
01:06:17,899 --> 01:06:19,319
There’s nothing I can do.

829
01:06:20,535 --> 01:06:22,412
That’s what Andres wants.

830
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:24,615
And you?

831
01:06:25,533 --> 01:06:26,872
Is that what you want too?

832
01:06:33,046 --> 01:06:34,099
To be honest...

833
01:06:35,811 --> 01:06:37,149
I’m scared.

834
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,697
That’s a new world for us.

835
01:06:42,597 --> 01:06:44,300
But if there’s one
thing I want to do

836
01:06:44,582 --> 01:06:46,024
before we leave,

837
01:06:47,781 --> 01:06:50,660
it’s to bring justice
to my father.

838
01:06:54,433 --> 01:06:56,014
I want to hold accountable

839
01:06:59,204 --> 01:07:01,594
whoever did this to him.

840
01:07:05,061 --> 01:07:07,730
I love my father very much.

841
01:07:11,234 --> 01:07:14,126
And he should not
have died like that.

842
01:07:19,588 --> 01:07:21,291
It’s like he’s a dog

843
01:07:22,822 --> 01:07:24,824
who was just shot

844
01:07:24,868 --> 01:07:26,400
on his own land.

845
01:07:31,918 --> 01:07:34,545
I will never forgive

846
01:07:35,237 --> 01:07:37,495
whoever did this to him.

847
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,193
And whoever planned this.

848
01:09:28,756 --> 01:09:31,805
Sign it now, Nora! Okay?

849
01:09:32,136 --> 01:09:35,709
So the processing of

850
01:09:36,055 --> 01:09:38,495
our purchase of
your land will be faster.

851
01:09:39,338 --> 01:09:40,464
Go ahead, love.

852
01:09:41,266 --> 01:09:42,389
Sign it now.

853
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:45,537
So we can be paid by Sir Oliver.

854
01:10:23,221 --> 01:10:24,223
Okay.

855
01:10:24,674 --> 01:10:26,894
I’ll have this notarized right away.

856
01:10:27,314 --> 01:10:28,620
So the transfer of

857
01:10:28,843 --> 01:10:31,221
your land to us
will be more legal.

858
01:10:31,532 --> 01:10:32,532
Okay?

859
01:10:32,883 --> 01:10:34,710
The payment?

860
01:10:35,017 --> 01:10:36,916
[laughs]

861
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,594
You think,
I'm going to deceive you!

862
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:40,820
Huh?

863
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:41,862
Here.

864
01:10:44,379 --> 01:10:45,379
Here.

865
01:10:46,499 --> 01:10:47,499
There.

866
01:10:48,841 --> 01:10:50,509
That’s 2.5 million.

867
01:10:50,969 --> 01:10:52,522
I also included

868
01:10:52,882 --> 01:10:56,729
your commission for
convincing the old man to

869
01:10:57,318 --> 01:10:58,710
sell the land to us.

870
01:10:59,209 --> 01:11:00,418
Deal.

871
01:11:00,443 --> 01:11:01,782
That’s three million.

872
01:11:02,251 --> 01:11:03,251
Look, dear.

873
01:11:03,964 --> 01:11:05,111
This is three million.

874
01:11:06,342 --> 01:11:07,552
We’re rich now.

875
01:11:09,175 --> 01:11:10,814
We can do so much here.

876
01:11:10,839 --> 01:11:12,264
This should

877
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:13,857
be removed here.

878
01:11:13,882 --> 01:11:14,882
Right?

879
01:11:15,513 --> 01:11:18,475
There’s a cow’s head!

880
01:11:18,628 --> 01:11:20,343
We’ll tear this down!

881
01:11:20,778 --> 01:11:21,778
Alright?

882
01:11:22,828 --> 01:11:25,011
Pack all your things!

883
01:11:26,451 --> 01:11:28,231
You all are leaving here!

884
01:11:32,785 --> 01:11:33,785
So...

885
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,043
Alright then.

886
01:11:35,944 --> 01:11:37,237
I’ll go ahead of you.

887
01:11:39,781 --> 01:11:40,781
Alright.

888
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:42,339
Thank you, sir.

889
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:44,337
Thank you very much.

890
01:11:49,401 --> 01:11:50,592
Use the...

891
01:11:50,903 --> 01:11:53,030
money wisely.

892
01:12:25,803 --> 01:12:27,262
Ah, Oliver Sanchez?

893
01:12:30,353 --> 01:12:31,359
Why?

894
01:12:31,583 --> 01:12:33,153
We received a tip

895
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:36,365
that you killed
Carmelo Panganiban.

896
01:12:39,551 --> 01:12:41,762
Here is our arrest warrant.

897
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:44,138
You may not speak,

898
01:12:44,163 --> 01:12:46,129
you may call a lawyer,

899
01:12:46,414 --> 01:12:47,624
but for now,

900
01:12:47,714 --> 01:12:49,069
come with us.

901
01:12:49,966 --> 01:12:50,966
Alright.

902
01:12:52,587 --> 01:12:53,587
Well...

903
01:12:54,216 --> 01:12:55,216
Hey!
