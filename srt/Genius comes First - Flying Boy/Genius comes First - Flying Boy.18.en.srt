(Immediate End)

43
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,120
Have you got the key points I just said?

44
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,760
Okay.

45
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,360
Let me sum it up.

46
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,040
Our primary focus here is innovation.

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
One-shot take.

48
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,200
Whatever happens,

49
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,680
the camera must not stop.

50
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,480
Wait.

51
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,400
With just us,

52
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,040
is it possible to shoot this way?

53
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,120
Definitely possible.

54
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,760
Isn't it just keeping shooting?

55
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,400
Easy.

56
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,760
What's easy here?

57
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,480
I think it's hard.

58
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,040
I've never heard of anyone who could

59
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,640
make it without rehearsal.

60
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,760
Why rehearse?

61
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,920
We want surprise.

62
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,760
What's that again?

63
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,400
Innovation.

64
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,360
Innovation!

65
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,760
Are you confident?

66
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,280
If every one of us

67
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,120
can do our part well,

68
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,560
it should be okay.

69
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,760
You have the hardest part.

70
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,120
Rest well today.

71
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:39,480
Alright.

72
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,120
That's it for today.

73
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,560
We all go back

74
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,760
and get well prepared.

75
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,840
At seven o'clock tomorrow,

76
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,480
let's meet at the entrance
of the teaching building.

77
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,120
Dismiss.

78
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,640
Stop pressing me down.

79
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,000
My neck is almost bent.

80
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,560
How dare you grumble?

81
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,480
Where are you going?

82
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,400
I'd like to go over the route

83
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,280
once more.

84
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,760
Make sure everything's okay.

85
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,400
Do you think we can do it

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,920
as it's so complicated?

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,400
I believe everyone in the team.

88
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,360
No problem.

89
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,240
I also believe everyone on our team.

90
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,400
It's just... thirteen kilometers.

91
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,280
I somewhat don't believe myself.

92
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,840
Why looking at me like that?

93
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,080
Worried about me?

94
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,960
Right?

95
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,680
I'm just joking.

96
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,840
Just thirteen kilometers.

97
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,680
I'm totally fine.

98
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,360
How about this?
We'll walk through it again.

99
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,400
Get familiar with the route, okay?

100
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,280
Fine, but only one time.

101
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,640
You need a good rest tonight.

102
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:52,840
Let's go.

103
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,240
Haven't fixed you for two days.

104
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,400
Your temper grows, huh?

105
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,280
I'm talking to you.

106
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Being pressed that way,

107
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
the neck hurts.

108
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,560
Seriously? Just a little press.

109
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,680
You, such a big guy,
are even weaker than me?

110
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,120
Who you say is weaker?

111
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,800
Let's compete.

112
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,240
The loser should apologize.

113
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,840
Fine with me.

114
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,280
What's it?

115
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,680
Nothing.

116
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,640
First time being the heroine.

117
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,240
Nervous?

118
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,840
With you here,

119
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,360
I'm not nervous.

120
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,800
That's good then.

121
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,800
But frankly, I'm a little anxious.

122
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,960
After all, it's my first shot.

123
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,840
Also in this format.

124
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,520
Luckily, I have you guys.

125
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,920
Don't worry.

126
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,760
You will nail it.

127
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,760
Right.

128
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,480
Ren Ze will paint there tomorrow.

129
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,200
You go up to him.

130
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,840
Just show your most real reaction.

131
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,920
The way I am right now

132
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,760
is my most real reaction, isn't it?

133
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
Just be as comfortable

134
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,400
and real as you are.

135
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,960
My most comfortable
and real reaction is...

136
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,640
Surrender?

137
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,120
No.

138
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,280
Another round then.

139
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,760
Fine.

140
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,280
Is it really that hard
to surrender and apologize?

141
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
Why should I surrender?

142
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,200
Why should I apologize?

143
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,480
I didn't lose.

144
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,560
Then let's continue.

145
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,040
Until you surrender.

146
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,040
Kid.

147
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,360
Here's your ball.

148
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,120
Keep practicing.

149
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,920
Don't be like me.

150
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,960
Can't even beat a girl.

151
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,840
Where are you going?

152
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,480
How will we shoot?

153
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,800
My idea is

154
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,120
that on this bridge,

155
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,800
you can strike a pose.

156
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,760
I'll be behind you.

157
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,040
Pose? What kind of pose?

158
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,800
Aren't you a dance student?

159
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,520
Just a dance pose.

160
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,080
Mainly to express love for the ocean.

161
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,280
Yearning for the ocean?

162
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
Yes, that's right.

163
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,480
How about this one?

164
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,080
Wait, let me see.

165
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,280
More poses. Got any others?

166
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,960
Other choices?

167
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,680
Okay, how about this?

168
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,200
Right, go on, more poses.

169
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,280
Then, I'll just kick.

170
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,920
Slow. Slow.

171
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,760
Are you okay?

172
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,400
Let's go over there.

173
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,640
On one foot.

174
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,160
Does this hurt?

175
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,720
It hurts.

176
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,240
Let me rub it for you. Bear with it.

177
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,240
You okay?

178
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,040
Are you done?

179
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,920
I was faking it.

180
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,040
I'm fine.

181
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,920
You really scared me.

182
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,720
Please, no jokes like that.

183
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,920
Then keep rubbing.

184
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,920
Not my concern.

185
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,480
You. Wait.

186
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,600
I was just joking.

187
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,040
How could you take it seriously?

188
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,560
I didn't.

189
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,240
Glad you're fine, truly.

190
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,040
You really are a fool.

191
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,480
Where are we going next?

192
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,560
See that lighthouse?

193
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,720
That's where we are going.

194
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,040
Our last shot is right there.

195
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,440
So, will you come with me?

196
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,120
I can't.

197
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,600
I need to take a panorama down there.

198
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,000
That won't do.

199
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,560
You've got to take close-ups for me.

200
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,360
And get closer and closer to me.

201
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,040
I can't.

202
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
My design

203
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,560
is about the campus, the city,

204
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,720
and the sea.

205
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,120
So the last shot

206
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,320
must fall on the sea.

207
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,880
This makes it meaningful.

208
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,320
It can also break the confinement
of the previous shooting mindset.

209
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,040
Alright, you call the shot.

210
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,120
You're the director.

211
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,040
Trust me.

212
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,480
It's gonna be fantastic.

213
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,560
I trust you.

214
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,880
We'll shoot it like this.

215
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,040
And then pan over.

216
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,160
Right, just like that.

217
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,320
And then up.

218
00:11:12,192 --> 00:11:14,336
(Fried potatoes, grilled oysters,
marinated chicken feet)

219
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,480
What do you mean, Xiao Rang?

220
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,560
Speak up! Lost your voice?

221
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,600
Nothing.

222
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,360
Look at you now.

223
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,600
I say you're not manly. Am I wrong?

224
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
Besides, I was just joking.

225
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,560
- You were jo...
- Well.

226
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,920
If you take it seriously,

227
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,920
I'm kind of looking down on you.

228
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,800
If so, then stay away from me.

229
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,920
Stop right there.

230
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,040
What do you mean?

231
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,240
What do I mean?

232
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,560
I do want a relationship.

233
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,800
But just a normal relationship.

234
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,240
Since we met,

235
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,360
all you care about is weightlifting.

236
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,240
No me.

237
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,920
To you, I'm not a boyfriend.

238
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,120
But a human punching bag.

239
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,720
You beat me up in boxing or basketball.

240
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,480
I can't even bench press as much as you.

241
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,240
I feel stifled with you.

242
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
I'm just a loser.

243
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,800
Frustrated.

244
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,240
What do you mean?

245
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
I don't mean anything.

246
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,920
I feel like I'm not good enough for you.

247
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,480
Fine, we are officially over now.

248
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,480
Don't worry.

249
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,360
I'll still go to tomorrow's shoot.

250
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,120
I joined it because of you.

251
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,240
But now, I just want to get it done.

252
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,040
That's all.

253
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,040
Here you are.

254
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,560
Have a good rest tonight.

255
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,360
Tomorrow, you'll run
over ten kilometers.

256
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
Aren't you with me?

257
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,120
Hard for you as well.

258
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,560
I'm fine.

259
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,360
I'll certainly persist and give my all.

260
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,680
After you go back,

261
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,480
I'll do another review of the route

262
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
we will take tomorrow.

263
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
Then go and check

264
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,040
the shooting equipment again.

265
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,920
Make sure everything is perfect.

266
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,040
I'll stay with you.

267
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,040
No need. You just go to rest.

268
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,360
Li Yanhao, promise me.

269
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,040
You must succeed tomorrow.

270
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,360
Alright, let's give our all tomorrow.

271
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,480
Then, how about a victory hug first?

272
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,800
Not appropriate?

273
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,680
What's with you, a big guy,
acting all shy.

274
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,480
Come here.

275
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,920
What are you doing?

276
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,680
It's you.

277
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,920
And you as well.

278
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,560
It's so late now.

279
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,360
What are you two sneaking around here?

280
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,120
We...

281
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,680
First of all,
we are not sneaking around.

282
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,360
Second,

283
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,920
how come you're out
from the girls' dormitory?

284
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,160
I...

285
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,120
I was here exchanging work experience

286
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,800
with the matron of the girls' dormitory.

287
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,560
Exchanging work experience?

288
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,240
Why not during the day?

289
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,040
And coming out from the back door
of the girls' dormitory?

290
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,800
None of your business!

291
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,600
Listen.

292

293
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,120
get away with anything on vacation.

294

As long as you are on campus,

295
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,920
and stay in the dormitory,

296
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,240
you'll be under our supervision.

297
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,480
I... I'm going to lock the door.

298
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,240
He's always like that.

299
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,480
I don't really mind.

300
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,480
I've suffered quite a bit
in his hands before.

301
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,360
Today is a revenge!

302
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,240
He's locking up. What about you?

303
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,040
No problem. I have my way.

304
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,920
Alright, go back and rest.

305
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,800
Have a good rest.

306
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,800
Then, I'm off.

307
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,040
I'm really leaving.

308
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,480
See you.

You dare say that.

320
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,560
Where's the two hundred you should pay?

321
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm being generous already.

322
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
Right, I haven't paid yet.

323
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,480
But how can I use a broken reflector?

324
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,920
Not my issue.

325
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,000

326
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,240
