00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,000
What? You scared me!

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,760
Why not keep watch

00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,400
as I told you?

00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Keep watch for what?

43
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,440
No one is here right now.

44
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,000
Keep it down.

45
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,520
Bro, there's one right next to you.

46
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,920
Why are you tearing that?

47
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,680
I'll take that one too.

48
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,360
Just hurry up.

49
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Don't touch it.

50
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,000
This poster has her autograph.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,920
Don't damage it.

52
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,280

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,280
we are bad guys.

55
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,120
Li Jiatong just cleared our names.

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,280
We were called "harassers" before.

57
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
Now, if others see us,

58
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,720
they'll think we're thieves.

59
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
Well, Li Yanhao,
I'll take a photo of you.

60
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,280
Come on. See it for yourself.

61
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,200
What do you look like?

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,240
Be useful.

63
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,400
Shine the flashlight for me.

64
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Let's make it quick.

65
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,600
We can leave once we're done.

66
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,840
Don't let others see us.

67
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,280
What are you doing?

68
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,360
Quickly.

69
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,680
Who are you?

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,760
Stop. Don't run.

71
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,560
Stop.

72
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,480
Stop.

73
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,000
Stop.

74
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,400
Stop. Stop.

75
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,600
Stop. Stop.

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,280
Stop. Stop.

77
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,800
Stop.

78
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,600
Throw the poster away quickly.

79
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,040
No, I have to keep at least one.

80
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,880
Stop.

81
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,800
I can't do this.

82
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,800
Hurry.

83
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
I can't do this anymore.

84
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,440
Undress.

85
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,160
Undress.

86
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,040
Hold it.

87
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,560
Sir.

88
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,160
What are you two doing here?

89
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
He drank too much and threw up.

90
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,360
Right.

91
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,800
How much did he drink?

92
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,080
Did you see two weirdos run past?

93
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,240
One of them was carrying a big poster?

94
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,240
That's right.

95
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,160
He ran that way.

96
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,720
What would those two weirdos

97
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,240
steal that thing?

98
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,080
If I were any younger,

99
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,440
I'd run them ragged.

100
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
I'm telling you.

101
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,360
I used to run very fast
when I was young.

102
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,440
In our area,

103
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,240
people can't catch me no matter what.

104
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,160
If it weren't for my retirement...

105
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
Alright.

106
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,360
You should hurry back now.

107
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,000
Or I'll have to report to the school.

108
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,520
Okay.

109
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,600
It's killing me.

110
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,992
(All should be seen)

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,240
Zhang Haizhe,

112
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,800
give Yu Lan back to me.

113
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:41,536
=Episode 03=
(What Should I Do for You?)

114
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,560
Isn't it just a poster?

115
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,480
Is this necessary?

116
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,520
It's not just any poster.

117
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,240
(Yu Lan)
It's a poster signed by Yu Lan.

118
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,040
Fine, Yu Lan.

119
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,520
Your childhood goddess.

120
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,520
Hold it steady.

121
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,800
Don't shake it. I can't see.

122
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Shine her face. Here.

123
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,360
You couldn't acknowledge each other

124
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,200
with Yu Lan
because of your bad name online.

125
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,360
Li Jiatong has now vindicated us.

126
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,360
Now many people see you as a hero

127
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,640
and the light of the city.

128
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,680
So what?

129
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,960
What do you mean?

130
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,240
Why not tell her who you are?

131
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,760
We haven't been in contact
for so many years.

132
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,520
I feel a bit embarrassed.

133
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,760
Look at you. Coward.

134
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,040
If you want her to know who you are,

135
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,480
there are actually many ways.

136
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,760
What ways?

137
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,360
You've watched so many movies
and TV shows.

138
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,640
Just take some inspiration.

139
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,920
Be the hero and "save" her.

140
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,200
Critical moments

141
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,920
can best reveal the genuine heartbeat.

142
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,080
Look at all the heroes

143
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,360
and their slow motions.

144
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,640
Given those, I...

145
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,800
In movies, this kind of shot
is called a close-up.

146
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,240
It can express emotions.

147
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,080
But no one can do that in real life.

148
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,680
How about this?

149
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,840
Try that thing from the idol dramas.

150
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,800
Overbearing CEO falls for me.

151
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,960
Awaken that kind of desire
to be protected

152
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,800
in the girl's heart.

153
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,240
I've always wondered

154
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,360
whether such a man
would get beaten up in real life.

155
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,080
Moreover, from this angle,

156
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,240
wouldn't Yu Lan see nothing
but my nose hair?

157
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,400
And given our heights,

158
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,080
I can't do it.

159
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,800
Wait a minute.

160
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,760
There won't be so much nose hair.

161
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,400
How about this?

162
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
Be a sunny and warm gentleman.

163
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,960
It may work.

164
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
But does Yu Lan not have hands?

165
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,960
Do I really have to feed her like that?

166
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,080
You don't know romance at all.

167
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,080
Time to sleep.

168
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,240
Let's continue tomorrow.

169
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,360
Again?

170
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,080
Again.

171
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,520
Wait a moment.

172
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,480
Let me prepare mentally.

173
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,040
That hurts too much.

174
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,480
Your skin is fair and smooth.

175
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,080
You don't have such worries.

176
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,520
Hand off.

177
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,520
Everyone knows
you study well and receive

178
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,360
a first-class scholarship every year.

179
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,680
But no one knows

180
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,040
how much effort you've put in
behind the scenes.

181
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,680
Do you know? Many boys

182
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,480
think of you as an unattainable girl.

183
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,040
And they like you but dare not
tell you about their feelings.

184
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,480
That's for the best.

185
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,040
I need to spend the limited time
and energy

186
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,240
on useful people and things.

187
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,800
Renting a place with a scholarship
means comfort.

188
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,040
No need to stay in the dorm.

189
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,880
By the way,

190
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,920
what are your summer vacation plans?

191
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,680
How about we go traveling together?

192
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,560
The summer is still a month away.

193
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,360
I won't be able to go away
due to the film festival.

194
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Yu Lan,

195
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,800
I really admire you.

196
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,240
You push yourself too hard.

197
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,680
Apply some body lotion after the waxing.

198
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,040
You really are something.

199
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,800
You ignore me
after the clarification video.

200
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,240
You didn't send a message.

201
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,360
No messages, huh?

202
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,720
Then I won't message you either.

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,920
You fool.

204
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,480
Who are you chatting with? You look mad.

205
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,120
I'm not chatting with anyone.

206
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,800
Which guy?

207
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,920
There is no guy.

208
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,000
Since when did you become so gossipy?

209
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,160
And you two?

210
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,680
We're waiting for you to ask.

211
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,240
What are you doing, Jiatong?

212
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
I've been ready for a long time.

213
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,240
Come on.

214
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,160
Come on.

215
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Let's start.

216
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,040
What's the fuss?

217
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
What are you up to

218
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,000
so late at night?

219
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,680
Today, we'll focus on studying...

220
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,560
You're something.

221
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,360
You did well in using the internet
to clear your name.

222
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,040
How did you turn from a harasser

223
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,800
to the light of the city?

224
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,480
How did you two force the victim

225
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
into a perjury?

226
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,480
Are you insane?

227
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
Am I getting in your way?

228
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,000
Get back to studying.

229
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,040
Doing scientific and rational induction
and summarization

230
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,240
is of great significance

231
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,920
to the library science
management system's

232
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,480
scientific construction.

233
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,800
It summarizes and reflects
the key research

234
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,120
of library science.

235
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,360
The structural system
of library science is...

236
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,240
- Let's go somewhere after class.
- No.

237
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
It's regarding Yu Lan.

238
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,120
The library science system
is interdependent...

239
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,440
Are you trying to fool me?

240
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,880
I'm fooling you?

241
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,680
You really don't know
who is good to you.

242
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,360
I'm telling you. To get you this chance,

243
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,240
I've promised them three lunches.

244
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,440
If you miss it, you miss it for good.

245
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,360
It's up to you.

246
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,800
Why do you chicken out
every time it's about Yu Lan?

247
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,360
Who's chickening out?

248
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,040
I'm not chickening out.

249
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,880
Then let's go.

250
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,560
Okay. Right after class.

251
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Class is dismissed.

252
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,080
Let's go.

253
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,360
Li Yanhao, Xiao Rang,
you two come here.

254
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,560
Ms. Jiang,

255
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,800
what do you need?

256
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,480
Just give us the order.

257
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,560
We'd go through everything.

258
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,240
As long as I say it,

259
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
you two can do it?

260
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,920
Absolutely.

261
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,360
Attend classes on time. No dozing.

262
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,320
Full marks on the exam.

263
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:01,480
Ms. Jiang,

264
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,880
full marks on the exam?
Isn't this asking too much of me?

265
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,440
Right.

266
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,120
You're asking

267
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,880
too much of him.

268
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:07,880
Besides,

269
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,680
although I can do all the rest,

270
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,680
he can't get full marks.

271
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,120
What? You can get full marks?

272
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,560
Alright. Stop arguing.

273
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
Pass the exam at least.

274
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,240
My subject is a major course.

275
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,120
The school has rules.

276
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,240
Freshmen failing a major course
will be asked

277
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,680
to withdraw from school.

278
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,040
That can't happen.

279
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,560
Or I won't be able to face Yu Lan.

280
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,440
What?

281
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,880
I said "strive for progress"

282
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,480
is my life motto.

283
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,120
Right.

284
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,560
Ready for the makeup exam?

285
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,440
Don't worry.

286
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,040
I'll get 85 points for sure.

287
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,440
I'll trust you this time. Go.

288
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,320
Okay. Bye.

289
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,320
Wait.

290
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,320
I've seen
the clarification video online.

291
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,120
It's not bad.

292
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:45,440
Bye.

293
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,040
Bye.

294
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,680
Why brought me here?

295
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,560
As far as I know,

296
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,680
Yu Lan is alone in the office right now.

297
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,560
So what?

298
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,040
So what?

299
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,320
Are you silly or what?

300
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,120
It's a good opportunity
for you to meet alone.

301
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,440
Forget it.

302
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,320
I haven't figured out
what to say to her yet.

303
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,040
Maybe next time.

304
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:05,040
What's there to figure out?

305
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,560
You'll know if you go in.

306
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,000
Y-You are?

307
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,120
Li Yanhao!

308
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,360
No, the harasser.

309
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Stop that.

310
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,360
His name has already been cleared.

311
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,320
Now he's the light of the city.

312
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,120
What are you doing at the student union?

313
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,880
I...

314
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,680
I see.

315
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,120
You must have entered the wrong door.

316
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,360
Right. I took the wrong door.

317
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,040
Sorry.

318
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,800
That's not right.

319
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,120
You are so smart.

320
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,240
How could you?

321
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,560
Are you here for someone?

322
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,360
Are you here to pick something up?

323
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,480
It's over there.

324
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,360
Yes, I'm here to get something.

325
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,320
Won't you open the parcel to check it?

326
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,680
I will.

327
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,560
What is this?

328
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,240
Nothing.

329
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,920
How did it go? Did it work?

330
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,680
Did it go smoothly?

331
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,600
What the heck is this?

332
00:14:35,712 --> 00:14:36,416
(Binhai University Film Festival
Will Start Soon)

333
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,240
I'd be foolish to heed you again.

334
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,920
There's an unexpected gain.

335
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,440
Can you stop laughing?

336
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,360
Well,

337
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,416
I think Yu Lan is a great girl.

338
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,040
Look.

339
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,880
She gave you

340
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,720
such an intimate gift
on your first meeting.

341
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,920
It means she's interested in you.

342
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,600
So?

343
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,800
Are you angry now?

344
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,360
And you want to die?

345
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,800
I want to kill you now.

346
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,240
Don't be so cranky.

347
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,880
I've been so good to you.

348
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,000
To soothe your emotions,

349
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,560
I've ordered you all these good dishes.

350
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,040
Sir,

351
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,480
spicy, garlic, and thirteen-spice ones.

352
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,320
One of each, please.

353
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,160
The large size.

354
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,480
Sir, not for now.

355
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,000
Not for now. We'll eat these first.

356
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,000
That's too much, alright?

357
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,160
You said you were treating.

358
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,680
Yeah, I said that.

359
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,560
But I didn't

360
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,680
mean to bankrupt myself.

361
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,320
I don't care.

362
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,248
Wait a moment.

363
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,680
Let me take a photo.

364
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,920
You're posting these on the Moments?

365
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,440
Impressive.

366
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,120
You're quite smart now.

367
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,120
How come you act foolish
as soon as you see Yu Lan?

368
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,920
You should think of it this way.

369
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,120
Today marks your mutual recognition.

370
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,160
Although it didn't go very smoothly,

371
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,560
you've seen her in person.

372
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,320
It's better than looking at her photo.

373
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,680
Can't you contribute to the air quality

374
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,680
by keeping your mouth shut?

375
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,880
Gentlemen,

376
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,320
need crayfish peeled?

377
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,800
I peel them well and quickly
with the meat intact.

378
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,120
Gentlemen, do you want the service?

379
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,240
It's one yuan per crayfish

380
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,560
and 58 yuan for the whole set.

381
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,680
There's a discount for you,

382
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,720
totaling 99 yuan.

383
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,360
It seems like you don't like me.

384
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,480
Guys,

385
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,920
I've come from afar, across the ocean.

386
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,880
My service is one of a kind.

387
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,680
I can peel crayfish

388
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,560
and feed them into your mouths.

389
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
What's with him?

390
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,720
We really don't need any service.

391
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,160
Thank you.

392
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,000
I just said a few extra words

393
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,800
and annoyed you into disliking me.

394
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,800
I'm so, so sad.

395
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,680
Please reconsider it.

396
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,920
We really don't need it.

397
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,360
Thanks. No need.

398
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,040
Thank you.

399
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,880
Gentlemen,

400
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,240
I have whatever you want.

401
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,480
Marilyn Monroe,

402
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,920
Britney Spears,

403
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,440
and various beauties from all times
all over the world.

404
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,680
And lastly, Michael Jackson.

405
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,800
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

406
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,720
It's so good.

407
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,080
What's with this?

408
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,320
You're playing a tree.

409
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,560
How can you move?

410
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,200
Exactly.

411
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,320
How does that saying go?

412
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,720
There are no small parts,
only small actors.

413
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,840
If you give it your all,

414
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,800
everywhere is a stage.

415
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,720
It has been long.

416
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,960
You've eaten for hours.

417
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
Can you hurry up?

418
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,560
What thing is talking?

419
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,600
It can't be a person.

420
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,440
But it isn't a thing either.

421
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,720
Things don't talk.

422
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,800
I quit.

423
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
Don't.

424
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,240
Do you think it's easy being an actor?

425
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,120
It's not easy.

426
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,680
Actors earn hard-earned money.

427
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,720
When filming starts,

428
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,800
they go days without sleep.

429
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,240
They're paid to wait.

430
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Your words won't work.

431
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,560
I-I quit. Settle my pay.

432
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,480
I will serve until you are satisfied.

433
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,960
It'll be free if you aren't.

434
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,200
Freeloading is shameful.

435
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,320
I've remembered you two.

436
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,120
You just wait.

437
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,200
It'll be free if you aren't.

438
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,040
What does he look like?

439
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,920
I didn't see.

440
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,040
Xu Xiangdong?

441
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,440
How come this idiot
hasn't sent any messages at all?

442
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,440
It looks like
I need to give him a way out.

443
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:53,960
Xiao Rang,

444
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,560
d-do you know Leo?

445
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,840
I know lion's head meatballs.

446
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,720
I know braised pork.

447
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,560
I mean, do you know

448
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,600
what kind of boys

449
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,200
girls who are Leos generally like?

450
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,040
How would I know that?

451
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,440
I'm not a Leo.

452
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,320
Nor have I ever dated a girl
who is a Leo.

453
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,920
You're something.

454
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,320
You're of no help at all

455
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,440
at the critical moment.

456
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,040
Ouch. That's harsh.

457
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,040
You can

458
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,440
go ask a girl yourself.

459
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,800
With the spirit you had
when trolling online,

460
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,080
you'll achieve anything.

461
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,800
Where do I go to find a girl?

462
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,600
How about this?

463
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,680
I'll ask someone from the student union

464
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,320
to see what kind of boys Yu Lan likes.

465
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,440
Forget that.

466
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,440
Don't startle her.

467
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
I'll rely on myself.

468
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
I can't count on you.

469
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,840
Coward.

470
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,600
Baby.

471
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,440
What?

472
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
What are you doing?

473
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,840
Tell me what you're doing.

474
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,488
I...

475
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,560
I'm

476
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,320
doing makeup for photos.

477
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,440
Photos for whom? Which boy?

478
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,680
If you draw another line here,

479
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,440
you'll be prettier.

480
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,960
Stop the nonsense.

481
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
You're wearing this?

482
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,920
Don't you fear scaring him?

483
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,840
What do you know?

484
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,320
Boys nowadays all like the Joker.

485
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,800
I'll be the Joker with another line.

486
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,840
So it is indeed for a boy.

487
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,680
Alright. Go. Stop asking.

488
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,320
Hurry up.

489
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,600
I am the most beautiful Joker
in Gotham City.

490
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,320
I'm definitely the most beautiful.

491
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,040
I don't know what you like to eat.

492
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,600
So I bought a bit of everything for you.

493
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,440
See if there's anything to your taste.

494
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,240
Keep them for yourself.

495
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,960
Why?

496
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,440
I bought them especially for you.

497
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,680
Right, and this cake too.

498
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,320
Look.

499
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,680
Even though the second piece
is half price,

500
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,200
it's tasty according to the baker.

501
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,680
I...

502
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,320
Just taste it.

503
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,720
Forget it.

504
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,200
I mean I'll eat.

505
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,480
Actually, there's something

506
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,800
I want to consult with you.

507
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,680
You see, I like a girl.

508
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,840
You like a girl?

509
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,040
Go on.

510
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,480
You probably know her too.

511
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,600
She's pretty.

512
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
But I don't quite know
what girls are thinking.

513
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,440
So I just don't know

514
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,560
how to make this girl

515
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,040
like me.

516
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
How pretty is she?

517
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,840
Very pretty.

518
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,200
All the boys in the school like her.

519
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,040
So I feel like
I don't have much competitive edge.

520
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,680
And I've embarrassed myself
in front of her before.

521
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,560
I really don't know what to do.

522
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,960
If you ask me, although you've

523
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,600
embarrassed yourself in front of her,

524
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
it might have made her

525
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
more impressed by you.

526
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,840
You should take the advantage,

527
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,840
confess your love,

528
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,120
and then capture her heart.

529
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,840
It seems improper.

530
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,360
Isn't this a bit too abrupt?

531
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,200
Shouldn't I do something for her first

532
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,040
to improve her favorability towards me?

533
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,680
What's improper with that?

534
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,480
You're just overthinking it.

535
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,800
Many can't embarrass themselves

536
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,720
in front of her.

537
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,680
You're a lucky guy.

538
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,440
But doing more for her

539
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,240
and finding some common topics
seem like not a bad idea.

540
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,040
What are you thinking?

541
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,920
What you're doing now is quite good.

542
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,920
What do you mean?

543
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,120
You know what I mean.

544
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,240
Listen to me.

545
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,920
Just show up in front of her more often.

546
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,440
Then seize the right moment

547
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,920
to show off your personal charm.

548
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,240
Understand?

549
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,480
And then you'll make it.

550
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,560
Simple, right?

551
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,440
You are a master.

552
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,840
Master, I have understood.

553
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,360
Thank you.

554
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,920
The teacher told us to lose weight.

555
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,120
And you ate so much cake.

556
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:34,800
Are you crazy?

557
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,680
What do you know?

558
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,120
This is the cake of love.

559
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,800
Which boy?

560
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,120
You never told me.

561
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,800
Who is it?

562
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,960
It's a secret.

563

564
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,240

565
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,840
Come on. This way.

566
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,800
Nice shot!

567

568
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,120
How was my juke?

569
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,800
Wasn't it too fake?

570
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,920
Not at all.

571
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,200
Is what Li Jiatong says reliable?

572
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,600

573

575
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,560
Quickly. The ball.

576
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,680
W-What's the plan?

577
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,240
Dribble it.

578
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,200
What should I do?

579
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,960
Just shoot it.

580
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,680
Shoot it.

581
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,208
Go.

582
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,320

584
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,560
Dr. Zhou,

585
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,320
is she really okay?

586
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,120
Does it hurt?

587
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,720
Any dizziness?

588
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,320
I felt a bit dizzy when I was hit.

589
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,680
I'm feeling much better now.

590
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,200
Ms. Zhou,

591
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,680
I didn't want to trouble you.

592
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,080
They insisted on dragging me here.

593
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,360
No external injuries.

594
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,560
But you may have a slight concussion.

595
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,680
It's okay.

596
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,720
Just go back, rest well,

597
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,560
and observe.

598
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,800
If you feel unwell, come back to me.

599
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,240
Alright. Go.

600
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,240
Thank you.

601
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,840
Dr. Zhou,

602
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,320
can you take another good look?

603
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,680
A concussion can be quite serious.

604
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,040
Who's the doctor here? You or me?

605
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,240
Li Yanhao,

606
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,840
play basketball more carefully, okay?

607
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,920
- Okay.
- Unbelievable.

608
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,920
I'm really fine. You guys can go.

609
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,080
L-Let me escort you back to the dorm.

610
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,800
There's no need. Please leave.

611
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,960
You add each other on WeChat.

612
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,080
If something happens later,

613
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,680
just tell him.

614
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,600
He'll be responsible.

615
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,960
He is a very responsible boy.

616
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,560
You know?

617
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,960
He will definitely be responsible.

618
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,720
You just let him go?

619
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,200
We're classmates. And he didn't mean it.

620
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,840
Forget it.

621
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,920
You're really kind-hearted.

622
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,240
If it were me,
I definitely wouldn't let him off.

623
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,680
Didn't Ms. Zhou just say?

624
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,480
I'll be fine in a few days. Don't worry.

625
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,120
Why don't you rest for these few days?

626
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,240
I'll take care
of the film festival preparations.

627
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,200
No need.

628
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,960
What was the name of that boy just now?

629
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,960
Li Yanhao.

630
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,320
A freshman in Library Management.

631
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,200
He's the one
who was accused of harassment

632
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,680
and then got his name cleared.

633
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Li Yanhao?

634
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,080
Well, Li Yanhao,

635
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,840
when God was creating you,

636
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,680
he must have forgotten
about your IQ and EQ.

637
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,320
Be a politician.

638
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,560
You're good at shifting blame.

639
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,680
What flashed by me?

640
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,960

You're just overthinking it.

Many people even

Is there a script?

653
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,680
It requires inspiration.

So, not yet.

655
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,040

656
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,480
Yes.

658

I'm not the people you're looking for.

You're right. You are not people.

662
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,240

Is there a way to make a movie

675
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,680
without spending the money?

676
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,320

Then how can I join the Film Festival?

679
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,680
You can shoot the movie
if you really want to.

680
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,560
But that'll be your own concern.

681
