Xiao Rang.

41
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,400
Wait.

42
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,360
How did you two get in here?

43
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,400
Zhang Haizhe, the dorm manager
of the boys' dorm,

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,560
went to chat with
the girls' dorm manager.

45
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,200
So we just came in. Awesome, right?

46
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,000
Awesome!

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,760
What's wrong?

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,800
Well,

49
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,400
it's the summer vacation.

50
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,160
Yes.

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,480
Because of it,

52
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,200
I wanted to sleep in.

53
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,200
I heard you guys are going out to play.

54
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,800
Why don't you take me with you?

55
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,800
Don't you go to the training camp?

56
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,680
Whether I go or not,

57
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,760
that's my business.

58
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,480
But,

59
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,800
it's your fault for not taking me.

60
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,680
Right, you're right.

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,480
You two go out,

62
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,760
and I'll put on my pants first.

63
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,680
Then I'll listen to you.

64
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,800
Then put them on now.

65
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,440
Xu Xiangdong and Ren Ze are waiting.

66
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,520

67
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,080
Xiao Rang hasn't gotten up either.

68
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,800

Don't worry.

73
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,360
When I was little,

74
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,080
I came first in the motorcycle game.

75
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,000
Motorcycle game?

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,080
Couple's helmets.

77
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,240
Father and daughter's.

78
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,160
Let's go.

79
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Are you ready?

80
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,240
- Let's go.
- Ready.

81
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,880
Be careful.

82
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,360
Hold it tight.

83
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay.

84
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,320
Let's set off.

85
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,000
Why is this so slow?

86
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Out of battery, I guess.

87
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,040
Out of battery?

88
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,320
Xu Xiangdong!

89
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,480
Xu Xiangdong!

90
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,920
(My dear Ms. Zhao,)

91
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,760
(I thought about it all night,)

92
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,600
(I decided to stay)

93
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,880
(to help Li Yanhao finish his film.)

94
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,920
(I know this will disappoint you.)

95
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,000
(But I'm sure
you will definitely understand me.)

96
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:55,600
(I said I wanted
to be his leading actress,)

97
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,440
(not just in his film,)

98
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
(but also in his life.)

99
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,880
(I don't want to miss out)

100
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,040
(such an important moment in his life.)

101
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,320
Hurry up.

102
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,440
Right.

103
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,440
Why don't you go to the training camp?

104
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,480
Never mind that.

105
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,320
I'm staying, are you happy?

106
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,480
Yes.

107
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
You are not sincere.

108
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,040
(I want to and I will accompany him)

109
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,160
(to do what he wants to do.)

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,200
(My dear Ms. Zhao,)

111
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,480
(please rest assured.)

112
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,040
(I will definitely train harder
in the new semester.)

113
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,000
(And I will go to Beijing next year)

114
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,320
(to study at the place
where you studied)

115
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,320
(and become your best student.)

116
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,600
(I will definitely stick to my ideals.)

117
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,720
(Meanwhile,
I will also stick to my love.)

118
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,160
What's in your bag?

119
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
So many things?

120
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,640
I'm bringing some gadgets,

121
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,760
so I can set up a stall

122
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
to earn some extra money

123
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,720
when you go play.

124
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,920
What's the matter?

125
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,480
We are waiting for you.

126
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,600
What's with him?

127
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,320
Motion sick?

128
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,040
I've never

129
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,880
heard anyone

130
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,880
would get motion sick
on an electric vehicle.

131
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,640
You try sitting behind her.

132
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,000
Forget it.

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,640
Let go. Come down and take a rest.

134
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,480
No way.

135
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,640
I think it's quite nice.

136
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:23,880
Well...

137
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
Well, let's not rest.

138
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,320
Keep going.

139
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,440
Then let's go.

140
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,600
How is it? Beautiful?

141
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,720
So beautiful.

142
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,920
Ocean, here we come.

143
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,920
Here we come.

144
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,480
You shout too.

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,920
You shout too.

146
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,040
Then you won't feel sick.

147
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Ocean.

148
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,200
Oh my.

149
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,480
Are you crazy?

150
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,760
Be careful.

151
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,880
Hit him on the head.

152
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,000
Hit him on the head.

153
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,160
- Hurry.
- Smash his head.

154
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,920
Smash his head.

155
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Knock him out.

156
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,200
I'm exhausted.

157
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,720
You go play, don't mind me.

158
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,760
We won't mind you.

159
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,920
We'll go hang around.

160
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,480
Too bad.

161
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,320
Let's go then.

162
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,000
You're on your own then.

163
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,800
The shots I took are great.

164
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,600
Hurry, come on.

165
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,200
Give it to me.

166
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,160
Be careful.

167
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,760
Go over there.

168
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,200
Come on, three, two, one, go.

169
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,240
Okay.

170
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,040
Come on, keep going.

171
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,720
Kang.

172
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,000
You are...

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,640
Liu Tong, Vice President
of the student union.

174
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,160
What's wrong?

175
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,200
I want to talk to you.

176
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,760
About what?

177
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,480
Something you want to know.

178
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,880
Sure.

179
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,200
Okay.

180
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,320
Then let's find a place
to eat while we talk.

181
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,000
Slow down.

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,760
You're making me dizzier
by going so fast.

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
You're really annoying.

184
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,000
I am the one to take care of you.

185
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,200
If you didn't ride so bad,

186
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,320
I would never be this dizzy.

187
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,320
It's because you're weak, okay?

188
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,000
You don't get enough train.

189
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,320
Slow down. I'm getting dizzy.

190
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,880
You leave. Let me take a break alone.

191
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,200
I don't want to take care of you.

192
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,440
What's wrong?

193
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,640
Help!

194
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,760
Murder!

195
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,560
Madam.

196
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,880
Let me go, please.

197
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,760
You're welcome.

198
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,520
Right.

199
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,880
You didn't tell me

200
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
about the training camp.

201
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,120
There's nothing much to say.

202
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,320
I gave my spot to Liu Lu.

203
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,320
What about you?

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,680
Me?

205
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,520
I'll go next time.

206
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,520
Why not go this time?

207
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,840
Don't you really

208
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,400
know the reason?

209
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,880
Because of me?

210
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,760
What?

211
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,520
This is an important opportunity.

212
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,320
What are you thinking?

213
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,000
How could it be because of you?

214
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,280
I'm doing it for the film,

215
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,880
to be the leading actress.

216
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,640
I'm the one who makes the film.

217
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,000
So,

218
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
you have to film me well.

219
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,440
That would be a favor for me, got it?

220
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,520
You really are silly.

221
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,320
Let's go.

222
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,080
Come take a look!

223
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,640
Quality goods for sale.

224
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,880
Everything you need!

225
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,640
Kids.

226
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,880
This doll is a limited edition.

227
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,680
You won't regret buying it.

228
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,520
You two have a great taste.

229
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,760
Her. One for 20 yuan,
and two for 40 yuan.

230
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,400
Scan the code.

231
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,880
Come take a look!

232
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,440
Quality goods for sale.

233
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
We have everything!

234
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,520
Stop bragging over there.

235
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,880
You have everything?

236
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,280
Motion sickness medicine?

237
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,640
Yes.

238
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,640
You have it,
yet you didn't give it to me?

239
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,880
You didn't ask me either.

240
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,320
Besides, if I gave you,

241
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,320
what would I sell?

242
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Water?

243
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,440
Total 12.8 yuan.

244
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,760
Scan the code and transfer it to me.

245
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
You are quite good at calculation.

246
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,520
We should make this clear.

247
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,880
You stingy man.

248
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,000
How dare you say so.

249
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,080
You're not any better.

250
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,880
What's with me?

251
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,320
As my boyfriend,

252
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,200
you've never treated me to a meal.

253
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,880
Treat you to a meal?

254
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,320
You're either hitting me or abusing me.

255
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,760
You even buried me alive.

256
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,520
I can treat you to take medicine.

257
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,880
You do want to take

258
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,200
my punch, right?

259
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,520
Come here.

260
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
Come here.

261
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,880
Stop. Stop.

262
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,880
Stop right there.

263
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,200
It's been a long time
and you're still dizzy?

264
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,440
He was fine before,

265
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,440
but he took some medicine
and got poisoned now.

266
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,320
Don't blame my medicine.

267
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,760
I've seen you two.

268
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,880
It's all due to your punch.

269
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,760
Hey you!

270
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,320
She is a girl,

271
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,440
although a bit tomboyish,

272
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,760
she isn't that strong.

273
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,760
Exactly.

274
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,760
She isn't that strong?

275
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Even two Xiao Rangs may not beat her.

276
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,440
You! You be the judge.

277
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,000
He...

278
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,000
He fainted from being too happy.

279
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,080
Enough, stop pretending.

280
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,200
I am a professional actor.

281
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Professional?

282
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,880
She might punch you

283
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
if you don't get up.

284
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,640
W-What?

285
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,320
What is it?

286
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,880
I've realized why

287
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,320
we can never offend the women.

288
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You want to try it too?

289
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,080
You want me to be like him too?

290
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,200
It's okay,
don't be afraid of getting hurt.

291
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,080
But if you get hurt,

292
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,000
I have a band-aid.

293
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,880
Do you carry everything here?

294
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
I wanted to,

295
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,320
but his car can't fit it.

296
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,080
You two!

297
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,080
Who said that?

298
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,760
Stop pretending.

299
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,640
Let me do it.

300
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,520
Wait.

301
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,880
Since he's passed out,

302
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,080
let's take a photo.

303
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,760
Come on.

304
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,440
Alright.

305
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,000
Come on.

306
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,640
Come on.

307
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
Cheese.

308
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,080
Hello.

309
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,320
Hello, Xia.

310
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,640
I have a favor to ask you.

311
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,760
What is it?

312
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,080
I'm about to make a film.

313
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,440
And I haven't decided
on the leading actress.

314
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,080
You want Huo Yue, right?

315
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,520
Well, that's perfect.

316
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,320
I'm her agent now.

317
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,440
I'm not familiar with her,

318
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,880
so I had to come to you.

319
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,880
Okay, how about this?

320
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,960
Send me the script.

321
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,000
I need to review it.

322
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,200
Alright, I will do it
as soon as possible.

323
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,760
That's it. Bye.

324
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,440
Only one case of wine left.

325
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,080
You all should drink less.

326
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,560
It's okay.

327
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,520
We believe you can get more.

328
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,640
Right?

329
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,760
- Come on.
- Exactly.

330
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,320
Let's drink.

331
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,640
Don't. You're feeling unwell.

332
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,640
I'll drink for you.

333
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,200
I can drink.

334
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,320
Now, I wish to recite a poem.

335
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,640
Recite a poem.

336
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,520
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with him?

337
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,320
Isn't he better?

338
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,520
Ocean...

339
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,000
Question!

340
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,760
Answer!

341
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,760
If you like someone,

342
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,200
will you make a film for her

343
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,080
or to make a film for her to watch?

344
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
Any difference?

345
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,640
Of course.

346
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,640
Question!

347
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,520
No!

348
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,080
Question!

349
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,440
Answer!

350
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,200
If you like someone,

351
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,000
what do you want to do with him most?

352
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,560
Come here a bit.

353
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,000
Come here a bit.

354
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm already doing it.

355
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,880
Watching the sea together
with the person I like

356
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,520
and playing with my good friends.

357
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,760
I think it's worth not going to Beijing.

358
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,080
I'll take a leak.

359
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,080
Where to?

360
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,440
I'll take a leak.

361
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,880
Wait for me.

362
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,880
I'll go too.

363
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,280
Ms. Zhao.

364
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,560
Don't get relaxed
before the training camp?

365
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,280
Have something to eat.

366
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,640
It's late now.

367
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,560
I have to control my weight.

368
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,760
Come on, sit down.

369
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,560
Many things can't be achieved overnight.

370
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,920
Including dancing

371
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,680
and controlling weight.

372
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,400
Thank you, Ms. Zhao.

373
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,160
But I want

374
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,640
to lose a bit more weight.

375
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,080
Look at you, you're so thin.

376
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,800
If you keep this up,

377
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,200
your body won't be able to take it.

378
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,400
Let's go.

379
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,160
The dorm is about to lock up,
don't you go back?

380
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,400
Come on.

381
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,200
Let's go.

382
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,640
We're staying here?

383
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
Any problem?

384
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,400
Wait.

385
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,280
Why aren't we staying at a hotel?

386
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,520
It would cost a lot.

387
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,280
Isn't this seaside villa nice?

388
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,880
It's been cleaned up very well.

389
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,680
Right, why do you have the keys?

390
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,640
This is my house.

391
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,640
Your house?

392
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,400
Right, let me tell you.

393
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,920
If you damage anything,
you'll have to pay for it.

394
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,040
Be careful.

395
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,160
The two girls
will sleep upstairs tonight.

396
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,560
And the four of us
will sleep here tonight.

397
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,280
Sleep here?

398
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,800
Sleep on the floor?

399
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,080
Would I let you sleep on the floor?

400
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,080
We'd sleep together.

401
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,160
It's my first time sleeping with

402
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,400
someone like you.

403
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,280
Actually, aside from Yu Lan,

404
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,800
I've never slept with anyone else.

405
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,080
Don't be shy, come on.

406
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,680
If someone dares to break in tonight,

407
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,280
I'll protect you.

408
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,160
What if the one
who breaks in is Xiao Rang?

409
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,880
Do I have to get away?

410
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,680
He?

411
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,640
He dares not to break in.

412
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,680
Do you want to know

413
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,400
what the guys are doing now?

414
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,560
Yes.

415
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,320
Let's go.

416
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:19,920
Let's go.

417
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,560
Don't move.

418
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,400
What are you? What am I?

419
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,920
Take a sip.

420
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,640
Take a sip.

421
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,280
Two little honeybees,

422
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,560
flying among the flowers.

423
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,680
- Flying...
- How to play again?

424
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,560
I kind of forgot.

425
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,920
- You lost. Drink it.
- You lost.

426
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,680
You lost again.

427
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,680
You have to drink.

428
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,800
- You drink.
- Who lost?

429
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,640
No, no.

430
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,040
You! If you lose, you'll drink.

431
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,560
Right, give it to your belly.

432
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,160
Continue, keep drinking.

433
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,160
Your Xiao Rang is impressive.

434
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,520
Your Li Yanhao is also quite impressive.

435
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,800
Didn't expect them to be so crazy.

436
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,080
I just knew

437
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,400
they have this side to them.

438
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,800
Funny.

439
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,680
Shall we go to sleep?

440
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm fine with the couch.

441
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,800
You'll take the bed.

442
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,680
Don't be shy.

443
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,040
Then that's it.

444
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,160
Good thing they didn't see us.

445
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,000
So embarrassing.

446
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,920
Morning.

447
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,400
You're up so early to clean.

448
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,680
I haven't been back in a while.

449
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,640
I saw you and Xiao Rang slept well,

450
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,800
so I didn't wake you up.

451
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,280
Where's Ren Ze?

452
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,920
I'll go to the seaside.

453
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,520
Alright.

454
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,280
Hello, Dad.

455
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,520
Where are you?

456
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,040
Just taking a walk to clear my mind.

457
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,920
You do not study properly.

458
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,400
Why do you go to the seaside?

459
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,680
How do you know that?

460
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,920
I am smart.

461
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,280
You hear it, right?

462
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
The sound of the waves.

463
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,640
Is there

464
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,040
something on your mind?

465
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,880
Encountered any difficulties?

466
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,640
- Hello?
- Talk to me.

467
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,160
- I can help.
- Hello?

468
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,560
Hello?

469
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,880
- Hello.
- Bad signal.

470
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,320
Yanhao.

471
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,080
Yanhao.

472
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,400
Look.

473
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,400
What are you two doing here?

474
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
- Yanhao.
- Cut the nonsense.

475
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,160
You've grown up.

476
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,280
How dare you hung up on me.

477
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,400
I've told you the signal is bad.

478
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,040
You!

479
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,280
It's so close, my signal is fine,

480
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,680
and your signal is bad.

481
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,280
How's it?

482
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,640
How have your study been recently?

483
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,560
Are you busy?

484
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,280
He's doing a social practice.

485
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,400
What, Mom?

486
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,640
I'm on vacation now.

487
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,160
On vacation.

488
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,880
On vacation?

489
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,800
Since when?

490
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,280
Why don't you go home?

491
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,560
You two.

492
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,680
Go home?

493
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,920
You two are always out having fun,

494
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,560
and it's boring that I go home alone.

495
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,160
Then you could come to us.

496
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,560
We'll take you out.

497
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
I'm not going.

498
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,640
My dad's car

499
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,160
is only enough for you two.

500
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,800
Besides,

501
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,280
how could I bother

502
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,800
your happy and romantic life?

503
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,080
Look.

504
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,520
H-He has grown up.

505
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,160
Let me see
if my precious boy have lost weight.

506
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,280
Mom.

507
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,640
I'm in college
and still your precious boy?

508
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,520
You're my precious boy, anyway.

509
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,040
Well, my living expense is almost gone.

510
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,400
When will you give me support?

511
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,560
Here's the sea breeze.

512
00:24:26,304 --> 00:24:26,880
It's cold.

513
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,040
I'll get you a blanket.

514
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,920
Where is it?

515
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,680
Old Li.

516
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,560
My blanket.

517
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,400
Where is my blanket?

518
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,040
Come out.

519
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,160
What's wrong?

520
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,040
Where's the living expense to our son?

521
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,520
Living expense.

522
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
I did transfer.

523
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,800
Didn't you receive it?

524
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,680
It's transferred, Mom.

525
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,560
I was too busy with end-of-term.

526
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,080
Really?

527
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,800
Yes, he did.

528
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,920
Look. Geez.

529
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:02,920
Yanhao.

530
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,280
What to eat? I will buy it for you.

531
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,400
Anything's fine, Mom.

532
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,800
Just wait.

533
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,000
Old Li.

534
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,520
She left. Come out.

535
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,520
She left.

536
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,920
Tell me.

537
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,400
Did you secretly keep my living expense?

538
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,400
You can't say so.

539
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,680
I just borrowed it.

540
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,400
Here's the thing.

541
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,160
I bought your mom a silk scarf,

542
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,920
it's really beautiful.

543
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:46,920
Take a look.

544
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,080
Your mom wearing this

545
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,400
looks like Gulandanmu.

546
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,800
You are quite ruthless.

547
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,280
You do this for your wife,

548
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,400
not caring about your son.

549
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,160
That money is my meal money.

550
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,800
Can you be a bit more ambitious?

551
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,080
You've grown up.

552
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,760
Aren't you working part-time?

553
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,160
You should make some money.

554
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,920
It's for other purpose.

555
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,040
Besides, it's not much.

556
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
Listen.

557
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,280
Let's just say

558
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,160
we bought this silk scarf for your mom.

559
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,280
Okay?

560
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,680
You beat me.

561
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,520
It's fate bringing us together.

562
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
I have 200 yuan.

563
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,760
But that's it.

564
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,400
Take it.

565
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,400
Don't mention the living expense.

566
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,280
Don't mention it.

567
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,400
Hush money?

568
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,280
You could say that.

569
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,760
Dad,

570
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,160
you are quite pitiful

571
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,560
being oppressed by mom.

572
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,640
Why don't you

573
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,160
take 200 yuan back?

574
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,320
Okay.

575
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,160
I didn't really mean it.

576
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,920
But I mean it.

577
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,400
Don't, don't.

578
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,160
- Wait.
- Don't.

579
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,040
- I only have 200 yuan.
- I was...

580
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,800
I was just kidding.

581
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,640
No kidding.

582
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,880
I'm not kidding.

583
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,760
- Be careful.
- I'm not kidding.

584
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,000
- Look at you.
- Dad.

585
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,760
You...

586
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,000
Be careful.

587
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,520
- If you push me, I'll jump down.
- Don't trip yourself.

588
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:06,400
Be careful.

589
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,520
Your dad jumps into the sea
for 200 yuan.

590
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,160
This is really beautiful.

591
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,640
What's your next stop?

592
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,560
Next,

593
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,040
find a place with mountains.

594
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,800
I'll take your mom hiking.

595
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,040
You two really know how to live well,

596
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,400
spending all day traveling.

597
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,160
That's great.

598
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,040
As long as your mom is happy.

599
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,040
It also matters that you are happy.

600
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,400
Alright.

601
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,680
You've finally said something nice.

602
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,680
Take it.

603
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,680
If it's not enough, ask me.

604
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,680
We'll share it.

605
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,400
The girl in the video
was your girlfriend, right?

606
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,760
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

607
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,520
You could have one.

608
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,160
I think she's nice.

609
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,280
Yanhao.

610
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,160
Study hard.

611
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,280
Enjoy life.

612
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,920
No matter when,

613
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,040
we are proud of you.

614
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,520
Come back for the meal.

615
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,680
Coming.

616
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,280
Let's go.

617
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,400
After it, your mom
needs to take her medicine.

618
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,160
What medicine?

619
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,400
Nothing.

620
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,000
Her stomach's

621
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,280
feeling unwell.

622
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,880
Don't worry.

623
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,800
Come for the meal.

624
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,400
What's good to eat?

625
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,760
Something tasty.

626
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,560
Yanhao, look.

627
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,400
Your favorite buns.

628
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:02,920
Come on.

629
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,040
Come, sit down.

630
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:08,800
Yanhao.

631
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,640
Really nice.

632
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,280
It's fine, you sit.

633
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,920
I'll stand here.

634
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,680
One more.

635
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,520
Xu Xiangdong.

636
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,520
Xiao Rang.

637
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,520
Ren Ze.

638
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,160
Xiao Rang, where are you guys?

639
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,600
