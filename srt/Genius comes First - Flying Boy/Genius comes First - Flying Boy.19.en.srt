38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,440
Yanhao,

39
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,920
did you have fun today?

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,840
I did.

41
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,480
I want to go catch fish in the sea too.

42
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,400
Yanhao, be good.

43
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,760
Let's wait for your dad here.

44
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,440
Come on.

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,040
Let Mommy give you a kiss.

46
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,680
Yanhao, when you grow up,

47
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,200
will you take me
to travel around the world?

48
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,440
Yes, of course.

49
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
Then when I get old,

50
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,440
will you always be with me?

51
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,200
Mommy, you will never grow old.

52
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,440
If I fall ill,

53
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,560
will you always take care of me?

54
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
You will never fall ill.

55
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,360
Silly boy.

56
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,360
All people age or fall ill.

57
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,360
I got it.

58
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,720
I caught a fish.

59
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:32,280
Be careful.

60
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,560
I caught a fish.

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,520
It's not for you.

62
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,080
The water's coming.

63
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:50,528
=Episode 19=
(The Darkest Hour)

64
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:19,160
Dad.

65
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,720
You're here.

66
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,800
She's not awake yet.
She just took medicine.

67
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,240
No, she isn't.

68
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,440
You're awake, Mom.

69
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
Why are you here?

70
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,440
Isn't there social practice at school

71
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,640
during the summer vacation?

72
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,640
Dad said that you were sick.

73
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
He told me to see you.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,520
Let me.

75
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,880
Your dad always overreacts.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,600
I've been eating outside recently.

77
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,440
It's just a stomachache.

78
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,800
And your dad dragged me to the hospital.

79
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,240
Don't worry, son.

80
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,160
I'm in good health.

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,080
The doctor also said

82
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,520
your health is fine.

83
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
Rest assured.

84
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,880
I'm very healthy.

85
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,800
I have a good appetite.

86
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,360
You guys go eat something outside first.

87
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,520
Then bring back something tasty for me.

88
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
I'll rest a bit more.

89
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,040
What would you like to eat?

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What are you waiting for?

91
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,480
Hurry up and take our son to eat.

92
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,880
Right. Let's eat. Come on.

93
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,760
Time to eat.

94
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,320
Let's go.

95
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,160
See you in a bit.

96
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,600
Let's go.

97
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,160
Dad. Dad.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,600
Eat.

99
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,040
You eat.

100
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,440
Dad,

101
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,480
don't stress so much.

102
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,200
The doctor has already said.

103
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,440
Even if it's stomach cancer,

104
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,160
there's still a good chance
the surgery will work.

105
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,600
Life hasn't

106
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,640
been easy for your mom.

107
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,040
She's endured hardships

108
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
and suffered a lot.

109
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,920
When you were young, I was busy.

110
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,160
She took care of you alone.

111
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,480
She didn't eat regularly

112
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,720
and often skipped her meals.

113
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,920
That's how she ended up
with this stomach pain problem.

114
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,040
Before we got married,

115
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,200
her greatest dream

116
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,600
was to travel around the world.

117
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,760
I joked about it with her back then.

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,320
After we had you,

119
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,720
she completely changed.

120
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,760
Her greatest dream

121
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,920
was that our family

122
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,760
could live peacefully

123
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,320
and that you could grow up happily.

124
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,160
Now that you've gotten into college,

125
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,320
we can finally say that we've made it.

126
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,760
Why is she sick now?

127
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,440
Son,

128
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,880
do you think
that I am particularly unreliable?

129
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,760
No, Dad.

130
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,040
I know what you think of me.

131
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
A foolish old man

132
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,920
who has no money.

133
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,640
But actually, I'm not heartless.

134
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,920
I am weighed down by worries.

135
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,760
I know.

136
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,640
I simply wanted

137
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,200
to take your mom

138
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,040
to see great views of nature

139
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
when she's still around

140
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,200
so that

141
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,200
it would fulfill her dream.

142
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,240
I didn't expect the disease
to develop so quickly.

143
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,440
After all,

144
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,480
she takes her medicine every day.

145
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,480
Dad,

146
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,320
do you think

147
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,040
Mom will leave us?

148
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,320
I'm really scared.

149
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,320
My mom...

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,320
You look much more spirited.

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,480
Still too tired to speak?

152
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,880
It's no surprise.

153
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,320
For someone like you
who runs until fainting,

154
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,760
your current state is normal.

155
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,760
Do you know?

156
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,320
When she first brought you here,

157
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,440
you really looked frightening.

158
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,760
I was about to have her give you CPR.

159
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,520
If he's okay, I'll take my leave.

160
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,440
Take care of him.

161
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,760
Can you talk?

162
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,520
Yes.

163
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,440
Can you walk?.

164
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,320
Yes.

165
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,000
What are you waiting for? Go after her.

166
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,200
Hurry.

167
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,200
Yanhao,

168
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,880
I've kept your mom's diagnosis

169
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,560
of gastric cancer from her.

170
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,440
She doesn't know.

171
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,640
When you enter the ward later,

172
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
don't let her find out.

173
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
You've grown up.

174
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,200
You're a part of the family.

175
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,440
You have to learn
to face things together with us.

176
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,000
We're back.

177
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,880
What tasty food did you eat?

178
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,080
The best food, of course.

179
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,520
I wouldn't ill-treat your son.

180
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,880
Here's your porridge.

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,080
Slow down.

182
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,880
Have some.

183
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,520
What's wrong? Feeling bad again?

184
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,440
It's hot.

185
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,280
It's hot?

186
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Son, I'm thirsty.

187
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,280
Go get some water for me.

188
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,880
Okay.

189
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,640
I'll go get it.

190
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,080
Here.

191
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,640
Take a sip.

192
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,440
What did the doctor say
about my disease?

193
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,000
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

194
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,520
Gastric ulcer.

195
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,880
They said once you get checked out

196
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
and rest for a few days, you'll be fine.

197
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,000
Really?

198
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,320
Yes.

199
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,000
By the way,

200
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,640
I've got some good news.

201
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,760
Our little car

202
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,880
has been cleaned
inside and out by me again.

203
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,200
Every part of it

204
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,280
is bright and clean now.

205
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,280
It's very cozy.

206
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,880
When you get better,

207
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,080
we'll go wherever you want to go.

208
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,640
Be it climbing mountains
or sailing seas.

209
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,440
Of course, we'll go

210
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,520
wherever I want to go.

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,200
I'm the one in charge
of this home, right?

212
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,080
That's right.

213
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,640
You're the head of our family.

214
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,080
Dad, the cup.

215
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,880
Okay.

216
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,024
Mom.

217
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,520
Good boy.

218
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,200
Come on, let me give you a kiss.

219
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,840
Mom, I'm grown up now. No more kisses.

220
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,880
No matter how old you are,
you're always my son.

221
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,640
I can give you as many kisses as I want.

222
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,880
Mom.

223
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,880
What's wrong?

224
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,200
It's nothing, Mom.

225
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,760
Feeling aggrieved?

226
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,400
Mom.

227
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,840
Dad, I'm going out for a bit.

228
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,760
Thank you.

229
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,200
I'll walk you back.

230
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,080
No need.

231
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,840
Then how about you walk me back?

232
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,320
What if I faint again?

233
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,880
Be good to the end.

234
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,320
Don't even think about it.

235
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,080
Besides, I won't return to the dorm.

236
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,520
Then where to? I'll join you.

237
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,000
Fine.

238
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,000
If you insist.

239
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,200
But don't say thanks.

240
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,000
Hearing you say that
is kind of disgusting.

241
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,880
What exactly is going on
with that movie?

242
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,760
Li Yanhao came and yelled at me.

243
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
I was so dumbfounded.

244
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,440
According to Li Jiatong,
you ran out of time

245
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,000
and failed to achieve a one-shot take.

246
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,440
Actually, it's quite a pity.

247
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,000
The one-shot take
was never realistic to begin with.

248
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,320
Li Yanhao is just too stubborn.

249
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,000
We didn't even have a proper rehearsal.

250
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,640
Who would know
so many issues would arise?

251
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,000
Everyone has aspirations.

252
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,000
I understand him.

253
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,840
It's just a shame
I couldn't stick it out till the end.

254
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
Don't overthink it.

255
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,640
Everyone would help
when seeing you foam at the mouth

256
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
and were about to faint.

257
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,880
I'm sorry

258
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,320
for saying harsh words to you yesterday.

259
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,440
Yes, you should be saying sorry.

260
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,520
But you should say it to Li Yanhao.

261
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,440
After all, he had prepared for so long

262
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,000
and failed to complete it due to you.

263
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,320
I won't say sorry to him.

264
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,400
He scolded me in front of all.

265
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,880
Our friendship should be over.

266
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,640
I really can't comprehend
your way of thinking.

267
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,880
Ms. Zhao,

268
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,280
the doctor said it was just a sprain.

269
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,640
I'll be fine soon.

270
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,520
It's no big deal.

271
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,640
Stop grinning cheekily.

272
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,880
An injury like that
needs 100 days to recover.

273
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,520
You won't be fine in just a few days.

274
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,880
Don't try to fool me.

275
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,400
Besides, I've asked the doctor.

276
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,520
You've suffered
an Achilles tendon strain.

277
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,520
If it doesn't heal well,

278
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,880
it will greatly affect your dancing
in the future.

279
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,640
Didn't you promise me

280
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,520
that you'd take good care of yourself?

281
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,520
How did it end up like this?

282
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
Where's Li Yanhao?

283
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,880
Where is he?

284
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,440
H-He's also at the hospital.

285
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
At the hospital?

286
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,520
Then why isn't he by your side?

287
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,840
His mother is sick.

288
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,440
I heard it's quite serious.

289
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,840
I really don't know
what to say about you guys.

290
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,880
You've caused too much worry.

291
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,760
School is about to start.

292
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,640
What are you going to do about this?

293
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,640
Ms. Zhao,

294
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,880
the doctor said
I will be better in a few days.

295
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,080
When I return to class, you can train me

296
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,960
as hard as you like, okay?

297
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
Remember what you said.

298
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,840
I'll definitely train you hard.

299
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,880
I'll give you ten lessons every day.

300
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,200
Alright, rest now.

301
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,440
I'll go talk with the doctor.

302
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,400
You need money again?

303
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,880
Okay, I'll think of a way.

304
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,080
Xu Xiangdong.

305
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,400
Come over and sit.

306
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,880
Two bottles of beer.

307
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,280
I wonder how Yanhao's mother is doing.

308
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,000
Actually, I can guess your situation.

309
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,040
You also have someone sick
at home, right?

310
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,760
It's my grandma.

311
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,080
She's been in bed for over a decade.

312
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,760
My parents go out to work for money

313
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,880
to sustain my grandma's life.

314
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,400
So I can understand
Li Yanhao's feelings.

315
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,400
So you embezzled the movie fund

316
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,640
to treat your grandma?

317
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,280
I believe Li Yanhao
will understand you too.

318
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,920
I have some savings here.

319
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,040
Take it for the emergency.

320
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,400
Remember to pay me back.

321
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,040
Stop it.

322
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,760
We're both men. I can't watch it.

323
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,040
Why do you want to help me?

324
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,560
We haven't known each other
for a long time.

325
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,520
But we've strived together.

326
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,080
We are a team.

327
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,160
I believe we'll all do the same.

328
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,760
You've been to my home.

329
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,920
Since I was a child,

330
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,640
it has been a remote
and poor little fishing village.

331
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,080
My parents have been absent
since I was little.

332
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,520
They went south to earn money.

333
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,160
I grew up with my grandma.

334
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,280
Actually, the happiest times

335
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,400
were when my grandma took me out

336
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,800
to scavenge scraps for money.

337
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,800
Because my parents were not around.

338
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,040
Many children looked down on me.

339
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,400
I haven't had many friends.

340
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,160
Only when I met you guys recently

341
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,040
did I truly feel

342
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,400
what friends were like.

343
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,920
At the college entrance exams,

344
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,000
I was well-prepared.

345
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,680
But my dad fell ill

346
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,280
and went back home to recover.

347
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,160
I had no choice but to study
while taking care of him.

348
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,640
As a result,
I didn't do well on the exams.

349
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,680
No wonder you seem

350
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,920
more mature than us.

351
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,560
So you repeated a year.

352
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,000
More than a year.

353
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,920
During the first year,

354
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,560
I fell seriously ill

355
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,040
because of too much pressure.

356
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
I didn't do well again.

357
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,920
I was about to give up my dream
of going to college.

358
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,880
My grandma's insistence

359
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,920
made me repeat another year.

360
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,280
Finally, I got into Binhai University.

361
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,680
So you can't be without your grandma.

362
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,680
Get back to work. I'm leaving.

363
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,560
Not waiting for your dad?

364
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,920
I mean, Mr. Lei.

365
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,280
Where is my son?

366
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,400
He left.

367
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,000
Why didn't you keep him here longer?

368
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,560
I...

369
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,280
Stop that.

370
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,040
Get back to work.

371
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,400
Why is Li Yanhao so persistent?

372
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
There's no need
to make it so complicated

373
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,560
with such difficulty.

374
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,160
You and Xiao Rang...

375
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,800
Don't mention him.

376
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,160
Whenever I think of him,

377
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,520
I feel like hitting someone,

378
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,560
Aunt,

379
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,640
it's my first relationship.

380
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,160
Why did I end up with such a person?

381
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,640
Maybe Xiao Rang feels the same way now.

382
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,680
It's my first relationship.

383
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,280
Why did I end up with such a person?

384
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,800
Every day,
she either hits me or scolds me.

385
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,880
As a guy,

386
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,400
I'm bullied by a girl like this.

387
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,040
I don't want to live anymore.

388
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,280
Aunt, don't copy him. It's disgusting.

389
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,040
Alright. I'll stop.

390
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,680
Every time I think of him,

391
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,680
I just get angry.

392
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,160
It's your first time in a relationship.

393
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,400
It's normal to have ups and downs.

394
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,560
You have to understand each other.

395
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,400
Actually, I think he is good.

396
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
You think he's good?

397
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,400
I don't think he's good enough.

398
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,000
He's infuriating.

399
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,280
It's my first time
being in a relationship.

400
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,680
And it ended with being dumped.

401
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
You said it's my first time.

402
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,800
You spoke
as if you had a lot of experience.

403
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,640
From the perspective of dating,

404
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,920
I am more experienced than you.

405
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,640
Don't get too smug.

406
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,040
You count even failure as experience?

407
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
Why wouldn't it count?

408
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,400
Isn't a failed experience
also an experience?

409
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,560
I would rather
you had successful experiences

410
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,640
for me to learn from.

411
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,640
That might be a bit difficult.

412
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,560
But I saw him taking you home just now.

413
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,680
The two of you were dawdling.

414
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,880
And he didn't want to leave.

415
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,800
I think there's still a chance
for you two.

416
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,680
What chance?

417
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,400
He can stay as far as it can be.

418
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,280
Let's eat.

419
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,520
Who are you texting this late?

420
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,680
Nobody.

421
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,160
You have a secret.

422
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,280
Let me see.

423
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,520
No.

424
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,400
Let me see.

425
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
- No.
- Let me see.

426
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,040
No.

427
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,080
Let me see.

428
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,280
My answer is no.

429
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,160
Let me see.

430
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,800
No.

431
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,040
Let me see. Hurry.

432
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,160
There's nobody.

433
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,280
I'll put it in the soup.

434
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,280
Go ahead.

435
00:23:11,411 --> 00:23:16,288
(Yu Lan)

436
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,680
Go sleep in the car for a while.

437
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,800
You're awake, Mom.

438
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,760
You don't have to keep me company here.

439
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,800
It's alright, Mom. I'm not sleepy.

440
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,160
I want to be with you.

441
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,160
Over this past year at school,

442
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,280
I haven't spent much time with you.

443
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,800
Have some water.

444
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,280
Time flies.

445
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,560
In the new school term,

446
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,400
you'll become a sophomore.

447
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,800
Then tell me.

448
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,280
How has your year at college been?

449
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,920
It's quite good.

450
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,160
What do you mean by quite good?
Tell me more.

451
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,160
It's just that college life
is different from what I imagined.

452
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
How is it different?

453
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,680
Without you two by my side,

454
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,400
I've been more free than before.

455
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,160
But when I think of you,

456
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,400
I still feel a bit unaccustomed.

457
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,040
Luckily, Xiao Rang has been by my side.

458
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,520
Mom, you know what?

459
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,760
Xiao Rang has got a girlfriend.

460
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,040
She is really sturdy.

461
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,400
How can you call a girl sturdy?

462
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,680
I'll change the word.

463
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,760
Robust.

464
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,040
Let me put it this way.

465
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,280
Even if we guys go together,

466
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,160
she'll knock us down.

467
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,680
She's that good?

468
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,280
Yes.

469
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,040
Then I have to meet this girl.

470
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,920
It's funny.

471
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,040
What about you?

472
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,280
What about me?

473
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,800
Do you have a girlfriend?

474
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,880
Of course, I don't.

475
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,280
I'm focused on my studies
and nothing else.

476
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,280
I don't believe you.

477
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,560
With your looks and character,

478
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,920
at school,

479
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,800
you must be the school belle
every girl chases after.

480
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,400
What are you talking about?

481
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,280
School belle is a term for girls.

482
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,160
I'd be a school hunk.

483
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,040
Right, you are the school hunk.

484
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,920
You have me all confused now.

485
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,520
I am not.

486
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,040
Why are you here?

487
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,760
You didn't come to see me.

488
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,160
Can't I come to you?

489
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,560
Besides,

490
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,400
I've come to see your mother.

491
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,800
Slow down.

492
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,280
- I'm fine.
- Be careful.

493
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,160
Hello, Mrs. Li.

494
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,640
What happened to your foot?

495
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,800
Just a minor injury.

496
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,680
Mrs. Li,

497
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,280
my name is Li Jiatong.

498
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,040
That's a nice name.

499
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
Are you classmates?

500
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,160
She majors in dance.

501
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,040
We're not classmates,

502
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,400
but schoolmates.

503
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,920
- Mrs. Li.
- You're pretty.

504
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,040
Although we are not from the same class,

505
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,000
we are best friends.

506
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,800
Right?

507
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,920
M-My best friend is Xiao Rang.

508
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,520
I was talking about a girlfriend.

509
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,400
I don't have a girlfriend.

510
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,400
Then the best female friend, alright?

511
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,320
Don't have it.

512
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,920
You...

513
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,800
Mrs. Li,

514
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,280
don't listen to him.

515
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,040
We two are best friends.

516
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,280
He always walked me back to the dorm.

517
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,920
He treated me to meals.

518
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
And he accompanied me
to the library to read.

519
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,160
He even peeked at my practice.

520
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,040
Mom, I didn't.

521
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:09,800
You did.

522
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,520
Stop that.

523
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,680
Mrs. Li, believe me, not him.

524
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,520
I have evidence.

525
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,800
What evidence do you have?

526
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
Isn't this evidence?

527
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,920
How did you hurt your foot?

528
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,920
We collaborated on a movie

529
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,400
for the school film festival earlier.

530
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,800
And that's how I got injured.

531
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,280
Why weren't you careful?

532
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,160
You've even injured her foot.

533
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,040
Okay.

534
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,160
Exactly.

535
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,680
You have to take responsibility.

536
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,160
I mean, the responsibility
for the injury of mine.

537
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,640
He's the director.

538
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,880
And I'm the leading actress.

539
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,680
You have to take responsibility
for my injury.

540
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,280
You've become a film director?

541
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,800
Mrs. Li,

542
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,280
our school hosted a film festival.

543
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,520
He's the first one to sign up.

544
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,920
He wrote the script

545
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,280
and borrowed the equipment.

546
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,040
He even gathered all of us together.

547
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,280
There were six of us.

548
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,280
We all listened to him.

549
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,400
Really?

550
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,920
He's pretty good.

551
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,680
You never mentioned it.

552
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,680
What are you waiting for?

553
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,280
Hurry and show that to your mother.

554
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,400
Let me see.

555
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,040
Are you sure?

556
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,400
Yes.

557
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,280
It's really good.

558
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,800
As expected of a dancer,

559
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,920
you're so elegant.

560
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,040
It's good.

561
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,760
I really want
to go to your Film Festival

562
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,040
to see the movie Yanhao made.

563
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,800
Not bad, huh?

564
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,880
Mrs. Li, you know what?

565
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,280
He is good in every aspect.

566
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,400
It's just

567
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,040
that he's a bit slow on the uptake.

568
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,000
I'm not slow.

569
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,880
Being able to ask such a question
on this occasion

570
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,280
is certainly being slow.

571
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,680
I'm slow? I...

572
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,400
Yes, you are.

573
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,520
I won't argue.

574
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:15,880
Mrs. Li,

575
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,160
with him like this,

576
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,800
he must've been beaten a lot, huh?

577
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,280
Eat an apple.

578
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,760
His dad beat him.

579
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,040
Got beaten, huh?

580
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,920
This apple seems unwashed,

581
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,560
Mom.

582
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,560
Li Yanhao, I...

583
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,280
It's washed. I was just kidding.

584
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,920
Alright. Eat it. It's washed.

585
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,160
I do want a relationship.

586
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,520
But just a normal relationship.

587
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,800
Since we met,

588
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,400
all you care about is weightlifting.

589
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Not me.

590
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,040
To you, I'm not a boyfriend.

591
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,400
Xiao Rang?

592
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,880
Xiao Rang? Xiao Rang!

593
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,040
I won't say sorry to him.

594
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,040
He scolded me in front of all.

595
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,520
Our friendship should be over.

596
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,880
Thank you for what you did.

597
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,800
Why thank me?

598
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,280
Well,

599
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,560
thank you for letting my mom
see our movie.

600
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,040
Although I was embarrassed at that time,

601
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,800
I was truly happy.

602
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,520
Before that, my mom asked me,

603
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,640
"Son,

604
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,560
what have you gained during this year

605
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
in college?"

606
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,040
Actually, I really didn't know

607
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,280
how to answer her.

608
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,160
That's because you lack confidence.

609
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
If it were me

610
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,800
and if my parents asked that question,

611
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,280
I would just get up

612
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,040
and perform for them.

613
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,800
Don't move.

614
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,040
Sit down.

615
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,200
Don't move around.

616
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,520
Although the movie
was a failure this time,

617
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,920
I realized that as long
as my family is happy, that's enough.

618
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,640
Besides, I don't think it was a failure.

619
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
We didn't attend

620
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,560
the Film Festival to win awards.

621
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
I think,

622
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,400
as long as you do something

623
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,640
that makes the people you love happy,

624
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,280
then everything is worth it.

625
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,920
What do you think?

626
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,400
But your foot...

627
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,920
My foot injury is minor...

628
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,160
It's a severe Achilles tendon rupture.

629
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,160
I might have to

630
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,880
rely on this thing
for the rest of my life.

631
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,920
What am I supposed to do?

632
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,800
Take responsibility.

633
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,280
Did you hear?

634
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,520
Yes, I heard you.

635
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,880
You have to take care of me
and be with me.

636
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,280
No, you have to take care of your mom.

637
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,920
She's more important.

638
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,920
So, for the rest of my life,

639
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,920
I can only keep this wheelchair
as my companion.

640
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Just kidding.

641
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,400
It isn't an Achilles tendon rupture.

642
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,280
It's just an Achilles tendon strain.

643
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,920
- I can move.
- Don't move.

644
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,440
Don't pinch me.

645
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,920
To be honest,

646
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,040
I feel quite sorry towards everyone.

647
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,560
By making the movie with me,

648
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,160
your foot was injured,

649
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,040
and Xiao Rang

650
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,880
and Xu Xiangdong
were scolded by me so terribly.

651
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,160
They must hate me to guts.

652
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,920
Maybe they'll just ignore me.

653
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,560
That's not true.

654
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,920
You and Xiao Rang
have been brothers for years.

655
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,920
Your friendship
won't just end like that.

656
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,400
Moreover, I think Xu Xiangdong

657
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,400
is not such a narrow-minded person.

658
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,280
It's you overthinking again.

659
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,680
I've decided on something.

660
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,560
What?

661
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,040
I won't attend

662
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,160
the Film Festival.

663
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,760
What?

664
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,280
I won't

665
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,280
attend the Film Festival.

666
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,680
Wait. Why is that?

667
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,920
We've worked so hard.

668
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,160
You can't decide for us all.

669
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,920
Are you giving up

670
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,160
because of a small setback?

671
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,680
Where is the tenacity of yours?

672
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,520
No. I...

673
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,640
Are you really giving up?

674
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,040
I'm talking to you.

675
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,040
I said I'm talking to you.

676
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,040
Hands off.

677
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,000
Tell me.

678
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,160
Why have you decided for us all?

679
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,560
You wanted to make a movie.

680
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,760
Because of your words,

681
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,040
we all went along with you.

682
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,360
What about our dedication
during this time?

683
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,760
Can't you see it?

684
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,040
Besides, now your mom knows
you've made a movie.

685
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,880
Don't you know how happy she is?

686
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,760
Li Yanhao,

687
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,760
if you give up this time,

688
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,560
I will look down on you.

689
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,360
My mom is having surgery.

690
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,640
I just want a bit more time with her.

691
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,560
I don't...

692
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,160
It's okay.

693
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,160
Sit down.

694
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,296
Sit.

695
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,600
Lift your feet.

696
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,120
Well,

697
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,160
the surgery is scheduled for tomorrow.

698
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,080
You should rest well in the ward.

699
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,800
Why are you going to the seaside?

700
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,320
It's because the surgery is tomorrow

701
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,800
that I want to go out.

702
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,080
If I didn't make it tomorrow,

703
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,080
I would have at least seen the sea
one last time.

704
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,280
Mom!

705
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,320
You...

706
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,040
I'm telling you. Don't talk nonsense.

707
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,080
Or you'll scare our son.

708
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,920
I was just kidding.

709
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,080
I promised Yanhao

710
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,840
that I'd definitely get better.

711
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,640
Right?

712
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
- Mom.
- My sweet boy.

713
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,800
How about you listen to my dad?

714
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,600
Don't go until you're better, okay?

715
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,280
No.

716
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,080
You both have to listen to me.

717
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,160
Let's go.

718
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,520
What's up? Tired?

719
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,840
Go ahead and play.

720
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,880
Having your dad here with me is enough.

721
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,840
Mom,

722
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,120
I don't want to play.

723
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,040
I want to be with you.

724
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,600
I want you to go to the sea

725
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,080
and catch a big fish

726
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,600
for me just like your dad did.

727
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,360
Go ahead.

728
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,360
What? Feeling unwell again?

729
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,360
Give me the medicine.

730
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,600
Here.

731
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,328
The water.

732
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,840
Shall we go back?

733
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,000
Let me stay a little longer.

734
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,360
I want to see more
