=Genius comes First=

38
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,760
Mom and Dad,

39
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,200
look at me.

40
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,760
What a big fish!

41
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,080
Can I take a look?

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,000
Be careful not to prick your hand.

43
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,160
Grandma, look quickly!

44
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,360
I caught such a big fish.

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,160
Niu,

46
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,800
did the young man catch this?

47
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,120
You must give it back to him.

48
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,840
No, I won't.

49
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,640
I want to make fish soup for Grandma.

50
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
So her stomach ailment

51
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,160
can get better faster.

52
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,960
Her grandma also has a stomach ailment?

53
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,640
My mother was diagnosed
with stomach cancer 14 years ago.

54
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,840
She's treated conservatively.

55
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,880
Later, when it got serious,
she underwent surgery.

56
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,240
Is the recovery rate high
after the surgery?

57
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,320
If it is not late-stage,

58
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,240
the chances of recovery are quite high.

59
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,560
At first, my mom couldn't eat anything

60
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,880
or keep anything down.

61
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,520
So I tried making her fish soup.

62
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,880
She actively complied
with the doctor's treatment.

63
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,480
Slowly, her condition
started to improve.

64
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,800
Now, other than being a bit thin,

65
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,560
she has no other health issues.

66
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,240
So after surgery,
she could drink fish soup?

67
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Of course.

68
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,120
Niu has always known

69
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,840
that fish soup
can cure grandma's sickness.

70
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,680
That's why

71
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,160
she just took your fish

72
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,600
to make fish soup for her grandma,

73
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,920
I see.

74
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,640
Then,

75
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,480
about post-surgery recovery,

76
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,680
what should we note?

77
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,360
The key is to pay attention
to the patient's mood and mindset.

78
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,240
Keep her happy.

79
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,880
Give her more hope.

80
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,160
My mom likes to look at the sea.

81
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,120
So I brought her and Niu here,

82
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,120
and we've stayed for several years.

83
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,560
Each day I take her and Niu
for a walk by the sea,

84
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,440
telling her to live well and healthily

85
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,080
to watch Niu grow up.

86
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,600
Rest assured.

87
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,160
Your mom will be fine too.

88
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,080
Thank you.

89
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,600
Here is your fish.

90
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,880
No need. Consider it a gift for Niu

91
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
and her grandma.

92
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,800
Thank you.

93
00:04:13,907 --> 00:04:17,952
=Episode 20=
(Rekindling the Flame of Hope)

94
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,360
You're back.

95
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,080
Yes.

96
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
Where's your catch?

97
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,640
Gave it to a friend.

98
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
To a friend?

99
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,240
Caught none, did you?

100
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,600
Mom, Dad, I'm hungry.

101
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,640
Let's go eat.

102
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,920
Okay, let's go.

103
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,640
Don't let Yanhao go hungry.

104
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080
What do you want to eat?

105
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,640
I want to have fish soup.

106
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,240
Don't you dislike fish soup?

107
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,760
Why do you want to drink that?

108
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,080
Dad, you may not know.

109
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,520
Binhai University is seaside.

110
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,920
The fish here tastes good.

111
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,240
So will be the fish soup.

112
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,760
Ever since I got into college,

113
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,800
I've grown fond of fish soup.

114
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,040
Okay.

115
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,640
Let's go.

116
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,760
Let's have some fish soup.

117
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,320
Let's go.

118
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,200
Let me help.

119
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,432
- The shoes.
- Let's go.

120
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,640
Let's go.

121
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,320
You're still working so hard
despite being injured?

122
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
What brings you here?

123
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,800
As friends from the same class,

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,920
we must see you.

125
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,760
Exactly.

126
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,080
We thought
we might see something different.

127
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,520
But we ended up seeing nothing.

128
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,080
Exactly.

129
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,040
You've disappointed us.

130
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Even if we can't see the two of you

131
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,800
cuddling

132
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,520
and kissing,

133
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,240
can we at least get to see

134
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,360
you feeding each other

135
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,320
and snuggling?

136
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,800
Jiatong.

137
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,920
Yanhao.

138
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,040
Have you two
been reading too many novels?

139
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,040
You've even brought a gift.

140
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,720
We're just making a gesture.

141
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,600
Wu Qianqian.

142
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,640
Hurry back to us.

143
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,720
The dorm is less fun without you.

144
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,440
Right.

145
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,080
Now you know how important I am?

146
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,240
Look at how smug she is.

147
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,320
This isn't minor at all

148
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,640
Hasn't Li Yanhao
been taking good care of you?

149
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,600
It's not his fault.

150
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,520
This is called dedicating myself to art.

151
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,600
I'll be an Oscar-winning actress
in the future.

152
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,240
How's your movie coming along?

153
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,080
It's finished.

154
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
It's turned out great.

155
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,240
Then we'll watch it

156
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,480
when it's the Film Festival.

157
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,320
Right.

158
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,800
Once the school starts,

159
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,200
it will be the Film Festival soon.

160
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,080
We're all looking forward to it.

161
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,800
Alright, you've all seen enough.

162
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,640
I'm fine except for a leg injury.

163
00:06:55,936 --> 00:06:56,600
Just go.

164
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,160
What?

165
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,240
Alright, let's all go.

166
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,600
Listen to the injured one.

167
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,440
Right, we're all leaving.

168
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,800
Let's all go.

169
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,240
Maybe after we leave,

170
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,720
Li Yanhao will pop out
from under the bed.

171
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,600
You guys...

172
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,360
Hurry and leave.

173
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,600
Why do I feel like

174
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
you don't know how to make a movie?

175
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,240
The others

176
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,920
have finished filming one after another.

177
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Only you are still stuck
with the script.

178
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I need to come up with a good script.

179
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,640
You've been at it for a while.

180
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,800
With the time
you've spent copying the plot,

181
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,000
you'd have long finished it.

182
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,080
Stop discussing scripts with me.

183
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,800
Xia,

184
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,040
let me treat you to dinner tonight.

185
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,880
You can ask Huo Yue to join us.

186
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,800
So you like Huo Yue.

187
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,040
No, I mean...

188
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,520
I know. How about this?

189
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,320
I'll help you ask her out next time.

190
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,880
She had errands today and left early.

191
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,720
Xia.

192
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,360
Mrs. Li, I'm here.

193
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,160
Jiatong.

194
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,440
Come on in.

195
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,760
Go help her.

196
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,920
Let me help.

197
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,000
This girl is...

198
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,480
Mr. Li, don't you recognize me?

199
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,160
We met on the video call.

200
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,240
Right.

201
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
Well, you...

202
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,440
How come you look different
from the video?

203
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,920
The real person looks better
than in the video.

204
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,760
Right.

205
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,240
You came for Yanhao, right?

206
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,080
No.

207
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,640
Mrs. Li, I came to see you.

208
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,480
I'm fine. I'm doing great.

209
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,920
We went to the seaside today.

210
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,080
I'll let him take you around there too.

211
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,640
Mom,

212
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,560
it's so late.
We won't see the seaside now.

213
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,680
Go see the night view.
It'll be romantic.

214
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,760
Mom, we'll stay a bit longer.

215
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,760
I don't need your company. Go on.

216
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,000
You caused her injury.
Take responsibility.

217
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,280
Right, you need to take responsibility.

218
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,080
Listen to your mom.

219
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,640
Just go.

220
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,872
Mrs. Li, take care.

221
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,400
Go.

222
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,880
See the night view with him.

223
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,880
It's beautiful.

224
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,560
Be careful.

225
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,840
No need to come back early.

226
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,320
Satisfied?
This is the seaside you wanted.

227
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,280
Pushing the wheelchair

228
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,560
on the beach has tired me out.

229
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,440
Why are you so far away from me?

230
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,680
I'm tired.

231
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I-I-I'll take a break.

232
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,320
Take this.

233
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,120
Don't move around.

234
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,000
Be careful with your foot.

235
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,760
I just want to be closer to you.

236
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,680
Here, drink this.

237
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,520
I'll drink this.

238
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,000
Don't drink it.

239
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,520
You can't drink alcohol. You're sick.

240
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,280
Who says that?

241
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,560
Alcohol boosts circulation.

242
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,320
You don't know?

243
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
To boost circulation,
you need to apply ice and massage too.

244
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,880
What's the use of drinking this?

245
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,280
Then I won't drink it. You're the boss.

246
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,840
Cheers.

247
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,640
Cheers.

248
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,400
Tired, aren't you?

249
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
It's been hard for you.

250
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,960
The Film Festival...

251
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,280
Forget about the Film Festival.

252
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,880
Keep your mom company.

253
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,440
Wait until she recovers.

254
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,000
We'll talk about it then. Got it?

255
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,200
Well, if... if my mom's surgery

256
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,640
doesn't go well,

257
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,520
you might have to explain to them.

258
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,440
I might not have time.

259
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,760
Take that back.

260
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,320
How could it not go well?

261
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,520
It'll definitely go well.

262
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Don't say that.

263
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,520
Besides,

264
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,760
your mom said she wants

265
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,000
to see your movie at the Film Festival.

266
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,080
You can't go back on your word.

267
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,280
So now, just keep her good company.

268
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,760
And when she gets better,

269
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,640
you can rejoin us immediately. Got it?

270
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,000
Everyone will wait for you.

271
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,120
I got it.

272
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,200
Also, I've noticed something.

273
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,520
When I first met you,

274
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,840
I thought those friends

275
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,640
around you were very unreliable.

276
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,400
After going through so much,

277
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,840
I found they're all very good

278
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,440
and very loyal.

279
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,400
So,

280
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,200
when your mom gets better,

281
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,080
you'll have to apologize to each of them

282
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,120
to let them forgive you

283
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,000
and treat them to a good meal.

284
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,000
Definitely.

285
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,880
You know
who you should apologize to first?

286
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,120
Me.

287
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Look at my foot.

288
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,440
Shouldn't you apologize?

289
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,960
Jiatong, I'm sorry.

290
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,520
You don't need to say that to me.

291
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,960
I was just joking.

292
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,760
It's my dad.

293
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,520
Hello, Dad?

294
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,280
Yanhao, come back quickly.

295
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,880
Your mom's not doing well.

296
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,520
The hospital says she needs surgery.

297
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,760
Okay, I-I'll go back right now.

298
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,400
What happened?

299
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,280
My mom needs to have surgery now.

300
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,640
Then you better hurry.

301
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,880
What about you?

302
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Don't worry about me. Go.

303
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,960
I'll come back later.

304
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,000
- Just go.
- Take care.

305
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,640
Hurry.

306
00:12:21,236 --> 00:12:21,888
(Doctor's Room, Outpatient Room,
Emergency Room)

307
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,760
Yanhao.

308
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,296
Mom.

309
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,880
If I don't survive this...

310
00:12:33,344 --> 00:12:33,880
Mom.

311
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,320
Take good care of yourself,

312
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,880
study hard,

313
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,320
and strive to fulfill your dreams.

314
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,200
Mom, don't worry.

315
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,320
You'll definitely be fine.

316
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,640
You haven't seen the movie
I made for you.

317
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,440
I'll make you one

318
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,320
about mothers' love.

319
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,520
Let's watch it together later.

320
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,120
Mom,

321
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,440
don't worry.

322
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,640
You can do it.

323
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,080
Rest assured.

324
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,200
Fight.

325
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,400
Please.

Are you relieved now?

Continue the movie?

I'm leaving.

350
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,280
No need.

351
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,000
I can go back by myself.

352
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,440
I came back from the beach.

- Sorry.

00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,760
What did you say?

359
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
I didn't say anything.

360
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,000
I think I heard someone

361
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,840
say sorry to me.

362
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,440
You misheard.

363
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,560
I didn't say anything.

364
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,880
I think I heard you say sorry to me.

365
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,320
What do I have to be sorry to you for?

366
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,880
You scolded me publicly.

367
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,000
You should apologize to me.

368
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,960
You deserved that.

369
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,960
You were like a drunk fool.

370
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,120
It wasn't me scolding you.

371
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,680
It was everyone scolding you.

372

I was the mouthpiece for them all.

373

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,320
What can we do?

377
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,000
We've failed. There is no other way.

378
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,000
If you ask me, you're just too stubborn.

379
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,760
Why be so serious?

380
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,000
We didn't finish the one-shot take.

381
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,680
But we filmed the earlier part
pretty well.

382
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,320
We can reshoot the latter part

383
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,680
and then piece it together.

384
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,560
We can't do that.

385
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,000
It won't be perfect then.

386
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,680
A great person once said

387
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,520
it's the imperfections that make art.

388
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,120
Which great person said that?

389
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,080
It doesn't matter.

390
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,280
It makes sense, right?

391
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,880
Look.

392
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,120
Filming a movie
is like living a person's life.

393
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,680
Have you ever seen a life
without regrets?

394
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,400
We can pursue perfection.

395
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,200
But we can't force it
to be perfect, right?

396
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,880
That does make some sense.

397
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,400
Right?

398
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,400
Since when
have you become so philosophical?

399
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,440
I've always been like this, okay?

400
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,160
We know each other too well.

401
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,520
So you never noticed before.

402
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,920
It's not that I didn't notice,

403
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,520
but that you've always been superficial.

404
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,640
Who are you calling superficial?

405
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,560
You.

406
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,040
You are the superficial one.

407
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,920
You're superficial.

408
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,520
So childish.

409
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,560
So, what do you plan to do next?

410
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,520
I plan to finish the movie

411
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,920
and let my mom see it
at the Film Festival.

412
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,040
That's right.

413
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,160
It's the right choice.

414
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,080
Don't worry.

415
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,400
I'll fully support you.

416
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,880
Just say what we should do next.

417
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,800
I plan to invite them all back

418
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,560
and then strive to finish our movie.

419
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,160
This might be a bit difficult.

420
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,920
Besides, Gu Ran and I
have already broken up.

421
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,800
So, you go find Gu Ran.

422
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,560
And I'll bring the others back.

423
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,400
I won't go.

424
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,160
That will be embarrassing.

425
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,560
It'll make me lose face again.

426
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,400
You have to go, no matter what.

427
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm not going.

428
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,920
So I go?

429
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,400
If I go,

430
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,200
I'm sure what I will say.

431
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,000
Got it.

432
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,800
I'll tell her, "Xiao Rang regrets it.

433
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,520
He's too ashamed to approach you.

434
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,560
He's home, regretting so deeply,

435
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,880
and hasn't eaten or drunk
for three days and nights.

436
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,280
Who knows? Maybe he's trying

437
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,280
to jump off a building now."

438
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,160
Alright.

439
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,080
- No rumors.
- Or cut his wrist.

440
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,520
I will go. Alright?

441
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,920
Keep it down.

442
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,200
You sure you're going?

443
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,080
Yes.

444
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,280
What about Xu Xiangdong and Ren Ze?

445
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,680
I'll figure it out.

446
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,160
I'll deal with them.

447
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,440
You handle Gu Ran.

448
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,760
Alright.

449
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,200
Working out?

450
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,760
Are you cutting fat?

451
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,520
It seems like
you've lost even more weight.

452
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,760
What are you doing here?

453
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,280
Recently, I feel

454
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,080
that I'm still lacking
in physical fitness.

455
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
I'll step up my training.

456
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,160
How is my posture? Is it correct?

457
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,160
Work out over there by yourself. Okay?

458
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,000
I don't want to see you. It annoys me.

459
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,440
I want to work out here.

460
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,000
I think you're being masochistic.

461
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,520
You...

462
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,200
Take a break. Have some water.

463
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,920
Actually, I came here today

464
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,760
to ask you for a favor.

465
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,280
I won't help.

466
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
It's not for me. It's for Li Yanhao.

467
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,560
His movie starts filming tomorrow.

468
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,560
Can you help him out?

469
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,440
I don't care about Li Yanhao.

470
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,560
Why should I help him?

471
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,920
But you helped him before.

472
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Why can't you now?

473
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,320
I didn't help him before because of him.

474
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,520
Besides,

475
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,000
I study media studies.

476
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,320
I know he has no capability

477
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,280
to make a movie.

478
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:02,800
(Fitness Club)

479
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,000
But this matter
is really important to him.

480
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,320
I know you hate me a lot.

481
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:07,880
But...

482
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,560
can you not take it out on this matter?

483
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,920
Xiao Rang,

484
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,000
we've already broken up.

485
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,200
We aren't connected anymore.

486
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
I have no reason to go.

487
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,520
Even if we're not a couple anymore,

488
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,200
you can still help him.

489
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,760
After all...

490
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,440
Then have him come to me.

491
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,440
Why are you here?

492
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,560
He can't come to you.

493
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,560
He's in the hospital with his mom.

494
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
His mom is seriously ill.

495
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,680
Her life hangs in the balance.

496
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,520
He wants to finish the movie

497
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,520
to show his mom.

498
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,560
I don't think it matters

499
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,320
whether it's filmed well or not.

500
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,640
But as his brother,

501
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,440
I have to support him.

502
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,040
Among us,

503
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,280
you're the only professional

504
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,160
we have.

505
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,680
Except you,

506
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,200
no one can help us.

507
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,560
Alright then. Fight with me.

508
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,680
If you can beat me,

509
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,320
I'm in.

510
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,560
Another fight?

511
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,800
That's not good.

512
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,400
What's not good with that?

513
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,280
Now you have two choices.

514
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,200
Either fight me

515
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,320
or leave right now.

516
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,400
I can't fight you.

517
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,880
Then forget it.

518
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:31,264
(Persistence)

519
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,000
You can really fight, huh?

520
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,920
Let's have fun.

521
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,280
Are you mad?

522
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,680
Stay away from me.

523
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,160
So wild?

524
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,280
Let's have some fun.

525
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,080
Will you give in or not?

526
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Will you give in?

527
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,760
Take this.

528
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,920
Will you give in or not?

529
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,880
Will you give in or not?

530
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,760
I give in. I give in.

531
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,200
He is my boyfriend. Got it?

532
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,800
- I'm sorry, bro.
- Will you give in?

533
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,680
I'm so sorry.

534
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,760
I'm sorry.

535
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,560
Get lost.

536
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,160
Your boyfriend wasn't fighting.

537
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,760
He was trying to kill.

538
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:37,400
(Time. Sweat.
Taekwondo makes me strong.)

539
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,080
Are you alright?

540
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,040
I'm fine.

541
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,760
Then I'm off.

542
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,000
What did you just call me?

543
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,760
Boyfriend.

544
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,920
Let's eat.

545
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,400
Come. Sit here.

546
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,080
You...

547
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,680
Sit here.

548
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,760
You...

549
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,920
Don't be fooled
by their ordinary-looking decor.

550
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,520
There's more than meets the eye.

551
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,520
I booked it several days ago

552
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,280
to get a table.

553
00:24:18,784 --> 00:24:19,400
Their...

554
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,200
Their dishes

555
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,520
are exceptional, you know.

556
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,800
It's a pity

557
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,080
that my aunt never dares
to come and eat with me.

558
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,040
Actually...

559
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,080
Actually, their dishes

560
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,400
only look intimidating.

561
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
They're actually very tasty
and nourishing.

562
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,200
Yes, you're right.

563
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,080
I swore before

564
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,760
that I started dating
and got a boyfriend,

565
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,800
I would bring him here.

566
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,440
It's okay
if you're not used to the food.

567
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,880
It's all about the experience.

568
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,440
We started cooking when you called me.

569
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,400
Hi.

570
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,560
You two know each other?

571
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,680
She's my girlfriend.

572
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Eat.

573
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,520
Go ahead.

574
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,000
Okay.

575
00:25:14,803 --> 00:25:17,440
(There's a romance in the world
called sharing the same taste.)

576
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,080
Two bottles of beer, please.

577
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,560
Do you recognize me?

578
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,400
How about this?

579
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,200
What do you want?

580
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,520
My big brother has feared hot pot.

581
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,640
And boiling water too.

582
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,520
Pack and go apologize to him.

583
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,320
Hurry up.

584
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,680
Hurry.

585
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,040
Bear One and Bear Two.

586
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,400
Sorry, I was mistaken.

587
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
You did it on purpose.

588
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,160
No.

589
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,400
This is for bullying him.

590
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,080
Beat him up.

591
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,160
- Stop!
- Stop!

592
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,920
Why are you here?

593
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,640
I...

594
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,160
Stop!

595
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:13,920
Stop!

596
00:26:14,176 --> 00:26:14,680
Stop!

597
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,640
Run. See you at the bar.

598
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,280
Hurry.

599
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:16,864
Okay.

600
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,520
Come on. I'm right here.

601
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,640
You're wanted?

602
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,800
Mr. Lei, you scared me.

603
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,520
Some hoodlums were picking a fight.

604
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,920
Yanhao protected me

605
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,520
and led them away.

606
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,920
He hasn't come back yet.

607
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,400
I'm a bit worried.

608
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,800
Then go to help him.

609
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,520
Why are you hiding here?

610
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,880
Are you okay?

611
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,400
The great hero has returned.

612
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,440
My heroic deeds

613
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,640
have reached your ears so quickly?

614
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,520
Have a drink to calm the nerves.

615
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,880
You two chat first.

616
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,320
I'll talk to you later
about something important.

617
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,560
Okay.

618
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Thanks for what you did.

619
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,440
It's nothing.

620
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,400
We are all teammates on the same team.

621
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,880
But the filming has stopped.

622
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,320
The team doesn't exist anymore.

623
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,320
Who said that?

624
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,800
I've come to you

625
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,400
to talk about this matter.

626
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,680
Our movie will still be finished.

627
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,040
We also hope

628
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,000
you can come back to join us.

629
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,080
Even though you saved me,

630
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,040
I won't go back.

631
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,760
I know it's all my fault.

632
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,160
I embezzled the movie fund

633
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,400
everyone worked hard to earn.

634
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,400
Don't worry.

635
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,000
I will pay you back bit by bit.

636
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,400
I did it as my grandma was ill

637
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,280
and I needed money.

638
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,520
I had no choice.

639
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,200
The summer vacation is ending.

640
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,000
I'll pay you back as much as I can.

641
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,800
Xiangdong,

642
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,200
Ren Ze

643
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,520
has already told me all about it.

644
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,000
I know your grandma has been sick,

645
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,640
and you've sent all the money
you earned back home.

646
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,560
My mom just had surgery too.

647
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,520
So I understand
how you're feeling right now.

648
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,760
You don't have
to repay the movie fund money.

649
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,800
I only hope we can

650
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,040
finish the movie together.

651
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,920
If our movie

652
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,400
can win a prize, I'll give it

653
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,400
all to you for your grandma's treatment.

654
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,520
I appreciate your kindness.

655
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,920
But I can't face you guys.

656
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,280
All this time, I was pretending.

657
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,200
I was pretending
to have resources and experience

658
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,920
and to know many famous directors.

659
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,160
All these are fake.

660
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,280
I simply went to a crew
to be a helping hand.

661
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,000
I can't help you.

662
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,800
I will

663
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,080
hold you back.

664
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,400
That's not true.

665
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,400
Who said you would hold us back?

666
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,080
From the perspective of filming a movie,

667
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,880
we're all newbies.

668
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,640
Having you join us
is what gave us confidence.

669
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,080
Xiangdong,

670
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,520
without you,
I don't have the courage to continue.

671
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
No matter what,
I'm not participating anymore.

672
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,040
I'm off to sell goods.

673
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,680
Xiangdong.

674
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,040
Xiangdong!

675
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,640
He will understand.

676
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,080
You scared me.

677
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,760
How do you know he will?

678
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,640
What you said just now even moved me.

679
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,760
Let alone him.

680
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,920
I heard your mom is sick.

681
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,880
Is she better now?

682
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,440
She just had surgery. Don't worry.

683
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,320
You also know about this?

684
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,080
I am well-informed.

685
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,800
I have a favor to ask of you.

686
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,080
Why did you call me here?

687
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,440
To drink.

688
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,000
And to take a look at this gallery.

689
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,320
There's no gallery at Binhai
that I don't know about.

690
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,880
This one's newly opened.

691
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,440
Let me see
what the owner's taste is like.

692
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,160
Don't rush. Come.

693
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,400
Have a drink first.

694
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,640
Come on. Have a seat.

695
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,640
Come on.

696
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,000
Here. Have a drink.

697
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,400
What's there to drink for?

698
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,920
The movie was a failure.

699
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,080
But my mom's surgery was a success.

700
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,160
For great moms,

701
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,640
let's have one.

702
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,280
You called me

703
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,520
not for drinking, right?

704
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Actually, it's Mr. Lei
who asked me to come.

705
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,200
What did he bribe you with?

706
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,760
Don't say that.

707
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,400
Well, Mr. Lei is my boss

708
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,200
and your father.

709
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,560
He doesn't need to bribe me.

710
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,560
Just speak.

711
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,880
There are two things.

712
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,400
First,

713
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,160
I plan to reshoot the movie.

714
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,520
Everyone has gotten back together.

715
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,520
We hope you can come back too.

716
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,160
No.

717
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,000
The second thing.

718
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
The second thing...

719
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,880
To be honest,

720
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,000
this gallery is a gift

721
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,920
Mr. Lei bought for you.

722
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,400
He invited you, but you didn't come.

723
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,680
And you wouldn't listen

724
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,280
when he spoke.

725
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,400
So he came to me for help.

726
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,000
Task completed.

727
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
You are not me.

728
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,040
You don't know what went through.

729
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Why help him to persuade me?

730
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,160
Well, we are all friends.

731
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,680
Just say it if there's anything.

732
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,160
We can share the burden with you.

733
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
You said just now

734
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,400
that your mom's surgery succeeded

735
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,640
and how great moms are.

736
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,680
When I was three years old,

737
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,200
my mom was driven to death
by Lei Yonghao.

738
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,640
My mom loved painting when I was little.

739
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,080
Since I could remember...

740
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,160
Look at here.

741
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,400
She'd always been with me.

742
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
But as for Lei Yonghao,

743
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,760
my memories of him

744
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,000
are either of drinking outside...

745
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,640
Stop that.

746
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,880
Or beating my mom at home.

747
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,320
I never felt a bit of fatherly love
from him.

748
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,200
I remember the last time he came back.

749
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,440
Let go of me. Stop!

750
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,400
He was drunk

751
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,400
and locked me in the room.

752
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,640
You're crazy.

753
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,560
He and my mom had a terrible fight.

754
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,640
When I saw my mom again,

755
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,520
she was already dead.

756
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,400
People all say

757
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,440
Lei Yonghao forced my mom
to jump off the building.

758
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,080
Over the years,
I've been drawing portraits

759
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,000
on the streets to support myself.

760
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,520
I don't need him.

761
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,200
No.

762
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,520
Now he has come around.

763
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,320
He wants to acknowledge me
and reconcile with me.

764
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,640
If it were you, what would you do?

765
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,920
Actually,

766
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,080
Mr. Lei told me

767
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,560
about your mom's matter.

768
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,880
But it's a different version.

769
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,560
He said you were young then,

770
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,920
and your memory was not complete.

771
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,080
He loved your mom very much.

772
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,640
But since you were born,

773
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:08,880
your mom

774
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,080
had undergone great changes.

775
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,000
Can't take it anymore.

776
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,160
She was sometimes manic
and sometimes indifferent.

777
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,120
As it continued...

778
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,400
Go die if you can't take it.

779
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,040
He drowned his sorrows in alcohol.

780
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,680
Mom!

781
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,600
He said

782
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,200
your mom did commit suicide,

783
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,840
and he also regretted it deeply

784
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,600
for not protecting you

785
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,000
or your mom well.

786
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,840
I feel...

787
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,840
I feel maybe what he said is true.

788
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,200
What if your memory
wasn't complete back then

789
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,760
because you were only three years old?

790
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,840
If it's the case,

791
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,640
do you and Mr. Lei

792
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,360
have to suffer for a lifetime?

793
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,000
Right?

794
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,680
If it's really the case,

795
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,840
I don't think your mom's spirit

796
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,760
will rest in peace.

797
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,360
Ren Ze,

798
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,120
no matter what you have suffered

799
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,280
from childhood to now

800
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,600
or how dark your heart is,

801
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,120
it's time to let the sunshine in.

802
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,400
Look. These are

803
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,160
all the paintings
you've sold over the years.

804
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,840
Mr. Lei knew
you wouldn't take his money.

805
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,200
So he deliberately
had someone buy them all.

Have you eaten?

822
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,360
You hit me really hard today.

823
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,880
You need to compensate me well.

824
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,600
You have to treat me to a meal tomorrow.

825
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,120
And I'll reluctantly treat you
to a massage.

826
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,040
Who is it?

827
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,680
Come in.

828
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,360
I'm hanging up.

829
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,280
I need to go.

830
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,160
I've canceled my rental.

831
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,880
I see you have space here.

832
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,120
So I'm moving in.

833
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,400
This will help our creativity.

834
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,600
Really?

835
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,600
Which bed?

836
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,280
It's your choice.

837
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:54,880
Really?

838
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,384
Come on. Let me help.

839
00:37:56,384 --> 00:37:57,160
- Let me help.
- Come on.

840
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,680
Such a small ball, huh?

841
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,360
Here.

842
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,160
What's this?

843
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,880
Storyboards?

844
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,200
Yes.

845
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,840
Let's film it again.

846
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,640
The last time we filmed

847
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,120
without any preparation.

848
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,160
The filming started too abruptly.

849
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,200
That's why everyone's months of effort

850
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,200
went down the drain.

851
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,400
But it's precisely because of it

852
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,840
that I understood

853
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,640
filmmaking is not so simple.

854
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,400
We must take it seriously

855
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,400
and respect it.

856
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,880
So this time, I have

857
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,160
prepared everything well.

858
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,600
I believe

859
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,600
we will definitely make it this time.

860
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,920
I must say these storyboards

861
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,760
are really something.

862
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,400
The effort hasn't all gone to waste.

863

This is the result of your effort.

864
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,920
When I was a kid, my dad told me

865
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,920
that we should
let flowers bloom and trees rise.

866
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,280
I think

867
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,920
now is the time.

868
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,640
I have your back.

869
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,040
I won't be left behind either.

870
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,080
