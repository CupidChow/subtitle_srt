(Acting Audition)

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,760
Why are you here to join our movie?

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,520
I'm not here to join your movie.

41
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,520
Then why are you here?

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,560
We're auditioning.

43
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,720
I'm here to see
how you guys do the auditioning.

44
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,800
Get lost.

45
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,400
I want to participate more

46
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,360
in the school's events.

47
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,760
Do you know how to act?

48
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,040
I want to learn acting

49
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,080
through this movie.

50
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,480
Thanks, we'll consider it.

51
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,080
I want everyone in the school

52
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,640
to see my glorious visage.

53
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,880
Is there anything else?

54
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,880
I heard the leading actress is a beauty
that majors in dance.

55
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,560
I want to be the leading actor

56
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,560
and have a kissing scene with her.

57
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,440
You can leave now.

58
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,760
I wish to use this movie

59
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,040
to show my well-toned muscles

60
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,280
and conquer all the audience

61
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,160
to let them know

62
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,800
about the charm of us who learn sports.

63
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,760
But you don't look like
you're from the sports department.

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,960
I used to be a fitness trainer.

65
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,920
Now I'm in college,
hoping to learn more things.

66
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,280
What do you think of my muscles?

67
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,920
Pretty good.

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
So, can you act?

69
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,040
I don't think I need acting skills.

70
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,400
As long as I take off my shirt,

71
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,800
everyone will be mesmerized
by my muscular build.

72
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,320
Alright, enough.

73
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,912
Stop.

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,160
After seeing so many,

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,760
what actors exactly do you want?

76
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,840
Actually, I don't know either.

77
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
You don't know?

78
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
Do you know what to film?

79
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,400
I don't know, either.

80
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,560
S-Say it again.

81
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,480
I just don't know.

82
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,920
We've auditioned so many actors.

83
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,520
Why isn't there any actress?

84
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,200
Of course. This is a boys' dormitory.

85
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
How could a girl come in?

86
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,520
Then you don't know

87
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,560
about the feats
of the two girls on our team.

88
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,840
How's the actor selection?

89
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
No progress at all.

90
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,200
A pretty girl is outside

91
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
wanting to see Li Yanhao.

92
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,520
She must be here to audition.

93
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,880
A girl?

94
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,120
Then I'll take a look.

95
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,040
I'll go too.

96
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,640
Let's go.

97
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,200
What's wrong?

98
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,600
I overturned the previous filming plan.

99
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,800
Now I have no idea what to film.

100
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,840
I'm at a complete loss.

101
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,120
Why don't you
go check out the pretty girl too?

102
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,280
Maybe you'll get an idea.

103
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,600
Together?

104
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,760
I'm not interested.

105
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,120
Consider it a team-building event.

(Block 7, Building C)

108
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,080
Is she the pretty girl you mentioned?

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,720
Of course.

110
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
Here for the audition?

111
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,000
No, I am here to see Li Yanhao.

112
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,880
Then, you guys talk.

113
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
W-We'll go eat first.

114
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,600
That's right.

115
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,640
Don't forget about the work
at the bar at two o'clock.

116
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,720
I believe she can bring you inspiration.

117
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,200
Shall we go somewhere else
and have a chat?

118
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,160
Thank you.

119
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,320
Hello, let's get formally acquainted.

120
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
I'm Zhu Ruoqing from
the Literature Department.

121
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,040
Hello.

122
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,200
I am Li Yanhao
from the Library Management Department.

123
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,880
I know.

124
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,440
Actually, I came to ask

125
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
about the movie you make
for the Film Festival.

126
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,200
How's it going?

127
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,920
It's still in preparation.

128
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,320
We're selecting actors now.

129
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,600
How is the casting going?

130
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,880
Quite well.

131
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,760
The Film Festival

132
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,880
has expanded
so that college students of this city

133
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,720
will all participate.

134
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,880
You know that, right?

135
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,200
I know.

136
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,640
With such a grand scale,

137
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,480
we all need to take it seriously.

138
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,200
So how exactly are your

139
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,320
preparations going?

140
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,000
How about this?

141
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,600
If you have any purposes,

142
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,760
just say it, okay?

143
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,000
Actually, about making a movie,

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,480
I have no experience at all.

145
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,880
And I'm quite envious of you.

146
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,920
You have a bunch of good friends
helping you,

147
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,000
while I'm all alone.

148
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,160
Get to the point.

149
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,480
Please record an encouragement video
for me.

150
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,880
And these are the lines.

151
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,480
May my fellow student Zhu Ruoqing
from the Literature Department

152
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,720
achieve first place
at the Film Festival?

153
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
Wait. We're competitors.

154
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,760
Why would I...

155
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,320
This is simply a kind wish

156
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,600
and a beautiful dream.

157
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,880
I will work hard.

158
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,600
And you also have to keep it up, okay?

159
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,920
Thank you for your video.

160
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,920
What was it?

161
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,920
Hello? Mom?

162
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,600
Jiatong,

163
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,320
how is your training going in Beijing?

164
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,160
Are you tired?

165
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,000
Hello?

166
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,640
Why aren't you talking?

167
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,200
Mom,

168
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,480
I didn't go to Beijing.

169
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,480
Why didn't you go to Beijing?

170
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,200
It's a great opportunity.

171
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,200
What did your teacher say?

172
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,480
Mom,

173
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,440
I'm going to do something

174
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,040
more important than going to Beijing.

175
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,320
Jiatong,

176
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,000
what could possibly
be more important than that?

177
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,080
I've spent so much money on you.

178
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,240
And now you just quit?

179
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,000
Tell me why.

180
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,640
Mom, I am sorry.

181
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,160
I'll explain to you later, okay?

182
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,320
This matter is really important to me.

183
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,480
Jiatong.

184
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,920
What's the matter?

185
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,200
My mom just called me.

186
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,480
Everything okay?

187
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,920
Yes.

188
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,640
Seems like I've never heard

189
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,320
you talk about your family.

190
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,800
There's not much to say.

191
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,720
It's just that my parents divorced
when I was little.

192
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
What do you want with me?

193
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,760
I want to discuss

194
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,200
the movie matter with you.

195
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,880
Rest assured.

196
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,600
You will look pretty in my movie.

197
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,320
Li Yanhao,

198
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,200
do you really want to film me?

199
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,040
Of course.

200
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,920
No one can replace you.

201
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,160
That sounds better.

202
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,640
Let's go and drink something.

203
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,480
Why hasn't Li Yanhao arrived yet?

204
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,640
Indeed.

205
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,480
He must be enjoying chatting
with that chubby girl.

206
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,760
I have a question.

207
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,760
You said your college dream

208
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,920
was to have 100 romances.

209
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,000
Now you've been

210
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,160
with someone for a while.

211
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,480
Tell me, how do you feel?

212
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
Can you sit down?

213
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,920
You look just like my director.

214
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,320
In my mind, you're not gossipy.

215
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,200
I'm bored. That's all.

216
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,040
I'm just curious.

217
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,040
Bro, here's my advice.

218
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,480
Never have a girlfriend.

219
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,920
Women are too scary.

220
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,920
Just look at my arm.

221
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,880
Look.

222
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,160
Look at my leg.

223
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,200
Look at my back.

224
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,720
And in places you can't see

225
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,320
are all injuries from training with her.

226
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,080
This gal

227
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,000
drops weights on my foot, bumps into me,

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,200
and kicks me in the groin.

229
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,760
She would do anything

230
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,200
that could torture me.

231
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,440
It's pretty good.

232
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,320
No, I mean, it's too scary.

233
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,560
Luckily, my energy

234
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,880
is all spent on making money.

235
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,880
Exactly.

236
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,440
Why so money-obsessed?

237
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,192
I

238
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
I'm not money-obsessed.

239
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,000
Although I'm just a college student,

240
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,760
as the old saying goes,

241
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,320
everyone should manage their money.

242
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,760
Once you achieve financial freedom,

243
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,880
your life will be free.

244
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,000
And once your life is free,

245
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,440
you can fulfill your dreams.

246
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,560
Forget it. Dreams?

247
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,640
What dreams?

248
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,440
I dream of having more

249
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,440
than I can spend

250
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,200
and sleeping with money every day.

251
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,440
Then continue dreaming.

252
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,760
I do not have many dreams.

253
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,440
Now I have only one thought.

254
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,640
What thought?

255
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,880
I want to stay away from Gu Ran.

256
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
Then stay away from her.

257
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,640
Don't say that.

258
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,440
I have to accompany her

259
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,320
to the gym later.

260
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,080
You've reminded me.

261
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,760
She will check my biceps.

262
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,880
Let me pump them up.

263
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
You can choose not to go.

264
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,080
You dare? I don't.

265
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
I fear she might kill me.

266
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,760
I fear the same thing.

267
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,000
Tell me. With our current state,

268
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,080
is making a movie achievable?

269
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,200
To be objective,

270
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,880
after seeing the actors this morning,

271
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,880
I've lost confidence.

272
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,120
We'll start filming soon.

273
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,000
'Director' Li Yanhao

274
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,320
doesn't even know what to film.

275
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,440
In this current situation,

276
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,440
let alone winning awards, coming first,

277
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,320
or winning prizes,

278
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,320
we don't even know if we can be chosen.

279
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,520
Chatting, huh?

280
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,320
Director Li.

281
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,080
Director Li,

282
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,640
how's the chat with the chubby girl?

283
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,520
A long story.

284
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,960
Then don't bother telling it.

285
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
We don't want to hear it.

286
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,000
Anyway, we've cleaned the front area.

287
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,640
As for you,

288
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,280
just clean the toilet and that'll be it.

289
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,760
I'm cleaning the toilet again?

290
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,752
You arrived the latest.

291
00:10:34,752 --> 00:10:35,280
Right.

292
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,640
You can think about the script.

293
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
It's sage's time.

294
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,640
The toilet can aid your creativity.

295
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,880
That place is full of inspiration.

296
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,080
By the way,

297
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,440
how much money is left
in our movie fund?

298
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,640
You guys insisted
on giving all the money

299
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,880
to that little girl earlier.

300
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,880
We haven't earned much money either.

301
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,640
Then we'll have to film
with the equipment we have.

302
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,440
I guess so.

303
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,640
Okay, I'll go scrub the toilet.

304
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,760
You hit me where it hurts.

305
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,520
Here I am now.

306
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,280
So what?

307
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,760
I'm already the leading actress
in your movie.

308
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,880
When can I become the leading actress
in your life?

309
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,880
Li Yanhao,

310
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,840
do you really want to film me?

311
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,640
Of course.

312
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,320
No one can replace you.

313
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,320
Hello?

314
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,200
Where are you?

315
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,880
I'm at the bar.

316
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,960
Want to see a long-legged beauty

317
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,280
dancing gracefully on the sports field?

318
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,960
I'm working in the toilet.

319
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,760
The toilet?

320
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,760
Who made you clean it again?

321
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,280
Wait for me to come over.

322
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,440
I'll deal with them.

323
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,200
How dare they make you clean the toilet?

324
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,080
Big artist,

325
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,000
back from a trip,

326
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,640
why didn't you drink with me at the bar?

327
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,880
It's summer vacation.

328
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,760
Why are you still holed up
in the studio?

329
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,400
Aren't you also holed up
at the bar every day?

330
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,640
That's my money-making place.

331
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,000
I have to work.

332
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
This is my school,

333
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,280
the place where I create.

334
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,320
You're right.

335
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,880
It's filled with an artistic atmosphere.

336
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,320
It really suits your temperament.

337
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
What do you need?

338
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,760
Didn't I say I'd give you a surprise?

339
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,520
I got you a gift.

340
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,440
Let's go take a look.

341
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,000
Do you think I would want your stuff?

342
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,960
A father buys his son a gift.

343
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,760
Isn't that a matter of course?

344
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,960
Don't say that you're my dad.

345
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,080
Since my mom died, I've had no dad.

346
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,200
So you just won't forgive me.

347
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,520
I thought about that.

348
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,000
But I can't do it.

349
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,080
I'll never forget the things

350
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,320
you did to my mom and me.

351
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,440
Yes, I have made mistakes before.

352
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,200
But you have to give me a chance
to explain.

353
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,520
I don't want to hear.

354
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,000
I didn't want to hear.
I don't want to hear.

355
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,080
Nor will I in the future.

356
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,640
So we'll just stay awkward?

357
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,080
I need to lock the door. You should go.

358
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,280
Aunt.

359
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,200
Aunt.

360
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,280
What are you doing?

361
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,520
I've noticed that since you came back

362
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,000
from the sea, you've been distracted.

363
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,080
I haven't.

364
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
No?

365
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,960
I've seen it all,
and yet you won't admit it.

366
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,880
I really haven't.

367
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,080
Actually, it's good

368
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,320
that you drop out of the Film Festival.

369
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,880
Relax your mind once in a while,

370
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,080
enjoy life,

371
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,320
and enjoy the vacation.

372
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,440
Though I've told Kang Yide

373
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,400
that I'm dropping out,

374
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,080
after being so busy for so long,

375
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,000
suddenly having free time

376
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,640
is really an adjustment.

377
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,880
Isn't that simple?

378
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,400
Just keep yourself busy.

379
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,840
But besides work and study,

380
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,320
I don't know what else I should do.

381
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Join me in weightlifting.

382
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,000
Forget that.

383
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,280
See my basketball game.

384
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,200
I'll play against Xiao Rang.

385
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,320
You can be our referee.

386
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,520
Then go shopping.

387
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,000
Shopping is fine, right?

388
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,760
I need some new workout clothes.

389
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,840
Let's go clothes shopping.

390
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,200
Or maybe not.

391
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,440
Staying put only grows duller.

392
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,520
Let's go.

393
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,280
I really don't want to go.

394
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,880
Aren't you going to the gym
with Xiao Rang?

395
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Standing him up once doesn't matter.

396
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
You're the most important, Auntie.

397
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,320
Besides,

398
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,760
what girl doesn't like shopping?

399
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,520
Let's go.

400
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,960
Let's go. Come on.

401
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,080
Alright. I'll go.

402
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,000
But you have to promise me one thing.

403
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,840
Don't buy any more dumbbells today.

404
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,320
Deal.

405
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,640
President.

406
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,760
Let me introduce.

407
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,280
This is Kang Yide, the former president
of the student union.

408
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,440
I know him.

409
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,520
Zheng Nan, right?

410
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,320
I heard you're making a movie.

411
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,880
That's right.

412
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,040
I'll fully support you.

413
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,760
What? Not happy about it?

414
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,880
Wait.

415
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,320
Why is that?

416
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,040
Talk about your ideas.

417
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,160
How much have you run?

418
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,280
Ms. Zhao,

419
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,040
I've run seven kilometers.

420
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Running seven kilometers
in a row will exhaust you.

421
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,400
I used to run ten kilometers.

422
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,680
Seven kilometers is nothing.

423
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,880
Liu Lu called me,

424
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,280
saying she's very fulfilled
in Beijing every day

425
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,920
and has learned a lot.

426
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,680
I saw her post on Moments.

427
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,160
It seems pretty good.

428
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,760
I'm quite happy for her.

429
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,160
Ms. Zhao,

430
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,280
I'm very grateful to you.

431
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,640
But I have a small suggestion.

432
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,000
That is, everyone actually
has their own choices.

433
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,560
So you can't keep imposing your wishes

434
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,640
on me, right?

435
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,400
You're right.

436
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,520
But this time,

437
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,040
don't you feel any regret at all?

438
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,680
I can't say there's no regret at all.

439
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,880
But I'm firm in my choice.

440
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,760
In you,

441
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,400
I see my younger self.

442
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,400
Your younger self?

443
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,560
Is it the one who takes center stage

444
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,160
with outstanding dance moves?

445
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,760
It's the foolish one
that gives up for love.

446
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,880
Actually, I haven't given up anything.

447
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,520
Although I didn't go to Beijing,

448
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,400
I'm recovering every day.

449
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,920
Look. I just ran seven kilometers.

450
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,560
Don't get too cocky.

451
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,640
Are you that diligent?

452
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,400
Of course.

453
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,040
All right then.

454
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,280
Take this.

455
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,280
Every morning at 7:30,

456
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,920
arrive at the classroom to warm up.

457
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,560
I'll arrive at eight o'clock

458
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,800
to teach you a private lesson
of one and a half hours.

459
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,800
So you're giving me special treatment?

460
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Less chatter.

461
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,640
My husband is away on business.

462
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,400
I'm idle during the vacation anyway.

463
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,040
'Tormenting' you a bit

464
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,880
will be a pleasure for me.

465
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,280
Then I'll reluctantly
cooperate with you.

466
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,520
Take it.

467
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,920
Stop dawdling here.

468
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,040
If I don't see you
at eight o'clock every morning,

469
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,680
see how I'll deal with you.

470
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,080
Rest assured, Ms. Zhao.

471
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,440
Even if there's a huge matter,

472
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,640
I will definitely go.

473
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,920
I'm leaving now.

474
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,400
Next time you go shopping,

475
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,000
have Xiao Rang accompany you.

476
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I can't do this anymore.

477
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,040
Him?

478
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
Forget it.

479
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,000
Last time, when he accompanied me
to buy a boxing wrap,

480
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,040
he got as tired as a spent dog

481
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,160
on the ground.

482
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,400
Hadn't I beaten him up,

483
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,800
he could have stayed still forever.

484
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,760
Why does dating you
feel like playing with fire?

485
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,280
Xiao Rang is quite good.

486
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
Be nicer to him.

487
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,760
I think Li Yanhao is also quite good.

488
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,160
You should be nicer to him too.

489
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,800
We are not a couple.

490
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,040
I think he and Li Jiatong
are a great match.

491
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,280
Then who is a great match with you?

492
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,400
Kang Yide?

493
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,560
Actually, I've thought a lot
during this time.

494
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,280
He managed to grow the Film Festival
to its current scale.

495
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,000
There's a lot we can learn from him.

496
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,800
To learn from him?

497
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,160
Learn what? Being evil?

498
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,680
It would be so annoying
to become like him.

499
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,680
Maybe this is just a form of maturity.

500
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,160
Why don't you help Li Yanhao
with filming his movie?

501
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,640
That way, you can
attend the Film Festival indirectly.

502
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,520
Forget it.

503
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,880
I'll leave some time to myself

504
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,520
to do something meaningful.

505
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,640
Alright then.

506
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,560
No one can persuade you, my aunt.

507
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,520
Dude,

508
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,800
we've known each other
for such a long time.

509
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,160
But you're always in a hood.

510
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,160
We don't even know what you look like.

511
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,800
Yeah, Mr. Lei isn't here today.

512
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
Take off the hood

513
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,760
and let us have a good look.

514
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,800
Then at least say something.

515
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,160
We've been here for so long,

516
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,520
but never heard your voice.

517
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,160
Exactly. You don't...

518
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,160
You're not mute, are you?

519
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,880
In my opinion,

520
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,040
he's just simply not good-looking,

521
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
ashamed to show his face.

522
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,040
How can you say that about him?

523
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,040
That's the way he looks.

524
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,280
Is that so?

525
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,040
Then shouldn't you trim your ear hair?

526
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,400
You are...

527
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,760
You three seem pretty leisurely.

528
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,160
Did I pay double the wages

529
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,400
for you to have fun?

530
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,560
Stop smiling.

531
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,800
Do you know why I gave you a raise?

532
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,280
It's all because
my son told me to do so.

533
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,920
Thank your son.

534
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,560
Thank Mr. Lei's son.

535
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
Right.

536
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,520
He's not just good at painting
and handsome.

537
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,880
He's also righteous.

538
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,520
What's the use of just thanking him?

539
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,000
You should thank me.

540
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,920
Thank you, kind-hearted Mr. Lei.

541
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,680
Thank you, Mr. Lei.

542
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,560
I'm not on good terms with my son now.

543
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,160
He doesn't recognize me as his father.
What should I do?

544
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,640
Speak up.

545
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,800
We want to know
why he doesn't recognize you.

546
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,920
It's none of your business.

547
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
You three

548
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,280
often hang out with him.

549
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,920
Just tell me

550
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,800
how I can make him
recognize me as his father.

551
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,400
Well,

552
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,920
we don't even know the whole story.

553
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,560
We have no idea where to start.

554
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,040
I was busy when he was a child,

555
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,680
and I neglected him.

556
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,400
Now that he's grown up,
he's distant from me.

557
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,040
Don't you think he is a bit heartless?

558
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,800
I wanted to celebrate his birthday.

559
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,160
So I bought him a gift
and asked him to go and see.

560
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,800
But he refused to go with me.

561
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
What gift?

562
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,920
You talk too much.

563
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,160
Wait, Mr. Lei.

564
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,040
Based on our understanding

565
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,800
of Ren Ze over the period,

566
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,880
although he's a man of few words,

567
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,920
he is very kind-hearted.

568
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,560
Someone in their department

569
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,880
kept going against him.

570
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,880
He has forgiven him anyway.

571
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,800
Why won't he forgive you?

572
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,640
Is there something else?

573
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,040
I can't tell you about that.

574
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,880
Get lost.

575
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,520
Go back to work.

576
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,040
Okay.

577
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,400
Clean the floor. Understood?

578
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,920
Or I'll deduct from your pay.

579
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,880
You.

580
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,040
Come here.

581
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,280
Sit.

582
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,280
Those two are unreliable,
but you seem dependable.

583
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,760
Think of a solution, will you?

584
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,000
I...

585
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,160
You are unwilling?

586
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,040
No.

587
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,800
I'm not, Mr. Lei.

588
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,560
I-I think that...

589
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,000
What do you think?

590
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,800
Every lock has its key.

591
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,440
We need to find the root cause

592
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,160
of the problem.

593
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,400
That's it?

594
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,400
That's it.

595
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,040
That's all?

596
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,640
Yes.

597
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,000
Next time you see my son,

598
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,280
talk with him.

599
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,160
You'll be well compensated
once it's done.

600
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,400
What compensation?

601
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,000
You haven't succeeded yet.

602
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,760
Forget about the compensation for now.

603
00:24:55,872 --> 00:24:56,400
Well...

604
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,000
Get lost.

605
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,760
Go back to work.

606
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,680
Sorry. I'm late.

607
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,640
Not at all.

608
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,160
Here, the eye drops.

609
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,400
Actually, my eyes are fine now.

610
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,280
Then why did you come to me?

611
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,400
I have an impolite favor to ask.

612
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,160
What is it?

613
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,560
I...

614
00:25:22,464 --> 00:25:23,040
By the way,

615
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,040
the painting you did for me
was really good.

616
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,040
I've framed it
and hung it in my bedroom.

617
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,280
- Oh.
- 'Oh'?

618
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,560
I want...

619
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,800
You want to paint me again?

620
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Then just say it. What's the big deal?

621
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
Don't be polite with me.

622
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,160
Well, I want...

623
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,400
You want to paint my nude?

624
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,560
I can't do that.

625
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,400
I-I want to paint your back.

626
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,520
My back?
Even my back needs to be clothed.

627
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,040
Of course.

628
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,560
I've got the clothes ready.

629
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,160
So, the old place?

630
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,400
You want me to wear this?

631
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,160
T-This dress

632
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,160
is something my mother wore.

633
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,880
I see.

634
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,160
You want me to change here?

635
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,880
T-There is a restroom over there.

636
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,000
And then?

637
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,560
And then? I'll be just like this?

638
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,680
Well... If you...

639
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,160
If it's okay,

640
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,400
letting your hair down a bit
would be better.

641
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,560
Right. Just stay still like this.

642
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,000
We'll just sit here quietly like this?

643
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,800
Of course.

644
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,640
Why don't you chat with me?

645
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,000
Chatting won't
affect your painting, right?

646
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,040
No, it won't.

647
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,280
When I was little,

648
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,280
I took all sorts of art classes,

649
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,000
be it piano, dance, or violin.

650
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,160
I even learned to paint.

651
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,800
I have thought about painting

652
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,040
with my body on stage as well.

653
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,680
Me saying these things

654
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,680
won't affect
your painting rhythm, right?

655
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,000
No, it won't.

656
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,640
Actually, later on,

657
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,400
I didn't continue to study art.

658
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,160
My mom is a doctor.

659
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,560
She insisted that I study medicine,

660
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,160
saying

661
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,520
that studying medicine is good.

662
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,040
It's quite good.

663
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,040
You at least have a mother for advice.

664
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,680
What about you?

665
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,160
Nothing to say about me.

666
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,680
Let's still talk about you.

667
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,880
I'm telling you.

668
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,160
My mom is very anxious now.

669
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,720
She even wants me to go on blind dates.

670
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,400
And then?

671
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,800
Then... Forget it.

672
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,760
You're still a student.

673
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,160
You won't understand.

674
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,680
D-Don't worry.

675
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,880
It must be the light bulb.

676
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,800
Don't move.

677
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,920
I-I'm coming to you right now.

678
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,160
I'll take you out.

679
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,760
I have a question for you.

680
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,640
Why do you want to paint my back?

681
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,560
Because your back looks like my mom's.

682
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,160
I saw on the internet before

683
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,080
that if a girl
drinks too much bubble tea,

684
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,040
she'll grow a beard.

685
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,760
Then I won't drink.

686
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,680
Don't drink it either.

687
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,520
Why?

688
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,760
Because I'm here, and I'm super sweet.

689
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,560
Alright, stop that.

690
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,680
What's wrong?

691
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,160
Nothing.

692
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,920
Something's off about you.

693
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,280
What happened?

694
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,560
Nothing big deal.

695
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,880
I'm just a bit down.

696
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,400
We'll start filming soon.

697
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,920
But I still don't know what to film.

698
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,560
I went

699
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,160
over the script in my head.

700
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,880
And I think it's just a pile of crap.

701
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,040
I have an idea.

702
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,680
We can go to Mr. Feng

703
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,400
and ask for his advice.

704
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,400
He's perfect for this.

705
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,920
I want to capture the kind of texture
found in movie scenes.

706
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,400
While he makes short videos.

707
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,400
It's not the same.

708
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,160
Don't underestimate Mr. Feng.

709
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,920
He graduated
from a professional academy.

710
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,880
He studied directing.

711
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,400
Really?

712
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,640
Of course.

713
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,640
He was once a very popular director.

714
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,280
That's great.

715
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,680
Let's go and buy some stuff.

716
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,400
Buy what?

717
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,640
Who asks for a favor with empty hands?

718
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,280
Are you dumb?

719
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,800
Isn't this Romeo and Juliet?

720
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,920
No, it's Romi and Juli.

721
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,560
Give me a break.

722
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,560
You simply replaced the character names.

723
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,160
The School of Media

724
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,280
suggested this.

725
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,040
They say they usually

726
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,160
perform the graduation plays
based on classic scripts.

727
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,520
They simply change names.

728
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,160
What I do is called
learning from the pros.

729
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,400
Change it.

730
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,680
Change it?

731
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Change to what?

732
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
Something closer, maybe.

733
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,680
Find one that has recently
won an international award,

734
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,520
and that'll be it.

735
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,040
That's right.

736
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,560
You're truly a genius.

737
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,680
I must buy you a drink.

738
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,160
Waiter.

739
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,400
If there is nothing else, I'm off.

740
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,400
Xia. Xia?

741
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,400
Well,

742
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,800
I'll show it to you once I'm done.

743
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,400
Okay. Bye.

744
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,000
Mr. Feng.

745
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,160
What brings you two here?

746
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,560
We just missed you.

747
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,680
So we came to see you.

748
00:31:14,848 --> 00:31:15,920
And Fatso and Blackie?

749
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
They work early tomorrow.

750
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,920
So I let them go home to rest.

751
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,040
Then they are missing out
on some good stuff.

752
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,280
You must have something important.

753
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,680
You've even brought liquor.

754
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,040
If there's something, speak up.

755
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,280
You have keen eyes.

756
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,920
Actually, it's nothing big.

757
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,160
It's just that our director
has no new ideas lately.

758
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
You are experienced.

759
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,000
Maybe you could offer some advice?

760
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,800
That's easy.

761
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,680
Drink, and you'll get the ideas.

762
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,800
R-Really?

763
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,680
I'll give it a shot.

764
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,160
Are you sure?

765
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,400
It's okay.

766
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,040
How is it?

767
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
I don't feel anything.

768
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,400
Try this one.

769
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,160
I...

770
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,400
Wait, Mr. Feng.

771
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,920
Stop pushing him to drink.

772
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,400
Listen to me. Drink it.

773
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
I'll try. It's okay.

774
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,640
No worries.

775
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,560
Let's hear your thoughts.

776
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,560
Actually,
I don't really have any thoughts.

777
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,040
When I decided to make a movie,

778
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,040
I just wanted to showcase my talent.

779
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,160
What talent do you have?

780
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,920
I...

781
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,520
I'm a top commenter
in the movie review area.

782
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,160
What else?

783
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,040
I have loads of fans.

784
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,040
That's useless.

785
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,280
Do you want to impress everyone
in one fell swoop?

786
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,640
I have a tip for you.

787
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,680
Only by rehearsing
countless times in your mind

788
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,400
can you produce a good work.

789
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,400
Do you understand?

790
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,840
