We will watch a film later.

I want to sit next to you.

00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,120
The sports leader sits on my other side.

44
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,840
Don't worry, I have convinced him

45
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,760
to swap places with me.

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,080
How?

47
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,440
I'd treat him to fried chicken.

49
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,760

the fast-forward button,)

00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,520

00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,480
(Fast forward now.)

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,480
(I can't fast forward.)

54
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,320

hasn't happened yet.)

56
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,080
Do you know what this film is about?

57
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,000
You tell us.

58
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,880
He hardly watched it.

59
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,440
I wonder what he's been doing.

60
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,800
Then you tell us.

61
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,960
What?

62
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,160
What was it about?

63
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,080
What?

64
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,800
You watched it too,
why are you asking me?

65
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,160
I fell asleep in two minutes.

66
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,640
These past days have worn me out.

67
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,240
You've been dating,

68
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,320
of course, you've worn out.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,720
I need to go to the restroom, hold this.

70
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,720
I can't.

71
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,320
Fine, I'll hold it myself then.

72
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,440
We'll wait here.

73
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,720
Okay.

74
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,160
This film is not fantastic.

75
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,040
Right?

76
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,080
Yu Lan.

77
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,160
This is...

78
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,360
Gu Ran's mom is my cousin.

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,960
How was the film?

80
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't know,

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
but I slept well though.

82
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
This is an art film.

83
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
It's a bit obscure,

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,440
but it's quite good as a sleep aid.

85
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,880
So you understood it then?

86
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,720
Of course.

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I know the director.

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,160
and I made

89
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,320
the promotion too.

90
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,240
Yu Lan.

00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,320
Xiao Rang.

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,880
We have met.

93
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,960
He is my boyfriend now.

94
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,800
Since when?

95
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,520
Today is our first date.

96
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,000
I think he's not bad.

97
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,720
Xiao Rang.

98
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,080
Hang in there.

99
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,960
Hanging in.

100
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,800
Li Yanhao.

101
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,360
How was the film today?

102
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,040
As a participant,

103
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,800
you can share your thoughts with me.

104
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,080
The film is nice,

105
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,320
very profound.

106
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,320
It's an art film.

107
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,040
Is that it?

108
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,600
I hope you understand it.

109
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,800
Then I'm worried about your work.

110
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,800
How is that possible?

111
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,920
This film is quite inspiring to me.

112
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,800
The shots in it...

113
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,640
I don't think this film is good.

114
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,240
But as the director, Li Yanhao

115
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,800
can lead me, the leading actress.

116
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,520
It's teamwork.

117
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,040
So this is Xu Xiangdong,
our chief in charge.

118
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,240
Hello.

119
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
Hello, hello.

120
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Cinematographer, Xiao Rang.

121
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,920
Art Director, Gu Ran.

122
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,920
Very well.

123
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,080
The more people, the greater the power.

124
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,920
Go for it.

125
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,760
Yu Lan.

126
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,920
We've finished the film,

127
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,080
let's get to the business.

128
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,040
- Alright?
- Okay.

129
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,760
What's your team called?

130
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,480
I...

131
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
Flying Boy.

132
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,480
What?

133
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
Flying Boy.

134
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,800
Right?

135
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,040
Flying Boy.

136
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,320
Very well.

137
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,920
Fly, fly, fly.

138
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,520
Good luck.

139
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,200
Let's go.

140
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,800
Take care.

141
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,080
Wait, what do you mean?

142
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,760
What's going on?

143
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,040
I've only been gone for a short while,

144
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,320
since when did we have a name?

145
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,160
You've finished?

146
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,520
I don't want to go back yet.

147
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,720
Haven't had enough.

148
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,240
The dorm will be closed.

149
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,440
I'm not happy.

150
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,360
Then how can you be happy?

151
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,520
Did you all bring your IDs?

152
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,480
I don't want to go
to the internet cafe anymore.

153
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
Neither do I.

154
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,040
I am so tired.

155
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,880
Let's go back.

156
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,240
No way.

157
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,160
Alright, in that case,

158
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,640
I will take you to a nice place.

159
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,000
We are not working,

160
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,240
what are we doing here?

(Qinghong Music Bar)

162
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,240
I've told you,

163
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,440
Mr. Lei is looking for our help,

164
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,600
so we can make money.

165
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,600
We are not short of money now.

166
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,160
We're not short of money?

167
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,200
Alright.

168
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,080
No work today, just drink.

169
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,240
Enjoy.

170
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,880
After all, I am going to talk

171
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,800
about cooperation with Mr. Lei.

172
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,520
Don't be kidding.

173
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,000
Cooperation?

174
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,200
You just came to ask him

175
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,520
when you can come to clean the toilets.

176
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,800
That's also cooperation.

177
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,160
That's just your wishful thinking.

178
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,360
You didn't even ask the two girls.

179
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,440
What do you think?

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,720
You're with such a weird taste.

182

You're the one with a weird taste.

183
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
I think...

184
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,520
I think we can go,

185
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,480
leaving them behind.

186
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,200
Good idea.

187
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,160
Come in with me.

188
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,360
Hurry up, go in.

189

Let's go.

190
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,360
Ask Mr. Lei

191
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,760
to change your headgear.

192
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,320
I heard you can mix drinks.

193
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,480
Who told you?

194
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,760
Tong.

195
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,760
What?

196
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
Did you sell me out?

197
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,240
Just now, what's wrong?

198
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,760
Go mix a drink for Gu Ran.

199
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,640
Mix the one called

200
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,160
Pink Lady.

201
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,480
What Pink Lady?

202
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,640
Just have some beer.

203
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
What a hassle.

204
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,680
Going or not?

205
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,000
Look who's here.

206
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,680
Mr. Lei.

207
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,440
Mr. Lei, we are here.

208
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,280
I am not treating today.

209
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
We'll pay for it.

210
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,520
There's a newcomer.

211
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,280
This young guy is handsome.

212
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,120
Mr. Lei.

213
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,880
She's Xiao Rang's girlfriend.

214
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,440
Xiao Rang can get a girlfriend?

215
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,000
What do you mean?

216
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,120
Nothing.

217
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,440
I think you two are a good match.

218
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,680
Well, you've got an eye for it.

219
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,120
Where's Xiao Rang?

220
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,560
He went to mix a drink.

221
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,520
Oh no.

222
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,960
They'll break up after this.

223
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,440
What's wrong?

224
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,400
Why do you look so listless?

225
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,080
Nothing.

226
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,000
You're wearing the wrong clothes.

227
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,640
Go change into

228
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,680
that outfit,

229
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,520
then you'll be spirited.

230
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,280
Believe it or not?

231
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,280
Mr. Lei, please.

232
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,080
I'll drink.

233
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,960
That's right.

234
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,880
Come to my bar
and you should drink well.

235
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,880
Here, for Xiao Rang's new girlfriend,

236
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,400
I'm treating all the drinks here.

237
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Enjoy.

238
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
Take your time. Enjoy.

239
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:57,880
Here.

240
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,440
Thank you.

241
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,440
That guy just now
was called Li Yanhao, right?

242
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
He is your friend, right?

243
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,760
Why do you ask?

244
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,640
I think you're paying attention to him.

245
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,120
He's one of the participants
in the Film Festival.

246
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm really impressed
that you can make friends

247
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
with someone like him.

248
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,440
There's nothing wrong with him.

249
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,520
He has plans and is brave.

250
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,200
And he dares to go forward.

251
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,320
I think it's good.

252
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,120
Right.

253
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,080
Ignorance is bliss.

254
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,120
The juice I just ordered for you

255
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,840
will surely become your favorite.

256
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,840
It looks good.

257
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,840
Of course.

258
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,960
When has my choice ever been wrong?

259
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,560
Including supporting you.

260
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,000
Last time you said
we could come over to help.

261
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes.

262
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,680
Hurry up.

263
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,960
Can you be on call anytime?

264
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,840
No problem.
As long as you pay sufficiently,

265
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,280
we can even sleep in here.

266
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That's good.

267
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,640
But you have to work hard.

268
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,640
Or, I'll dock your wages.

269
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,440
Rest assured.

270
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,760
They all have girlfriends.

271
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,200
And you're single.

272
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,960
I'm single.

273
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,440
Get to work.

274
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,080
Starting now?

275
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,400
What else?

276
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,400
Hurry up.

277
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,520
So does the pay start from today too?

278
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,880
Stop with the nonsense.

279
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,120
Or don't ever come.

280
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,400
Hurry up.

281
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,520
First clean the toilets.

282
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,640
And the kitchen.

283
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,120
It's so dirty.

284
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,520
Are you that tired?

285
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,400
I'm so sleepy.

286
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,120
Then drink a bottle to re-energize.

287
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,400
Drink it up.

288
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,120
Drink it all.

289
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,000
Actually,

290
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,120
I have a question for you.

291
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,960
Why are you doing this for me?

292
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,680
Why?

293
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,320
Because from your eyes, I can see

294
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,080
your desire,

295
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,400
your ambition,

296
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,000
and the motivation to pursue perfection.

297
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,840
Just like me.

298
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,000
So we

299
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,400
are of the same kind.

300
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,320
From schools

301
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,680
to the entire society,

302
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,840
people like us

303
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,680
are the ones leading.

304
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,320
But I think everyone

305
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,680
has their merits.

306
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,680
Because you think in this way,

307
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,120
the student union's efficiency
in handling affairs

308
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,280
is so low.

309
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,680
I know you are kind.

310
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,560
But when you deal with something big,

311
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,120
kindness alone is not enough.

312
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,440
Listen to me.

313
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,560
I will definitely help you
get what you want.

314
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,840
Then what should I do?

315
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,400
The first step to success is
to stay away from useless people.

316
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,908
(Qinghong Music Bar)

317
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,440
I heard that when people are unhappy,

318
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,680
they should drink.

319
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,560
I'm not unhappy.

320
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,280
Turn around and look at me.

321
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,080
It's showing on your face now

322
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,280
that you are not happy.

323
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,000
No.

324
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,080
It's just a bit...

325
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,400
disconsolate.

326
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,400
Because of the president?

327
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,000
We have known each other
since we were little,

328
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,520
but after she moved
and transferred the school,

329
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,840
we've lost contacted.

330
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
Now that I see her,

331
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,560
it feels like she's changed.

332
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,200
You two were childhood sweethearts?

333
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,080
Not exactly.

334
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,560
In these few encounters,

335
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,320
I think she seems different from before.

336
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,400
You feel
something's different in reality.

337
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,560
Right?

338
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,000
Maybe.

339
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,000
I always feel like

340
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,320
there's something on my mind.

341
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,680
We both are people
troubled by affection.

342
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
What?

343
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,960
Am I not right?

344
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,840
I wonder

345
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,120
why you fall for me.

346
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,960
You're silly, and so am I.

347
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,960
Two fools happy together.

348
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,080
Look at how silly you are.

349
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,000
Go back and keep drinking.

350
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,032
I can't.

351
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:56,640
Don't.

352
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,400
I can't drink.

353
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,640
No way.

354
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,280
A man never says he can't.

355
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,880
Let's go.

356
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,560
Let's go.

357
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,000
They are quite a match.

358
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,960
What about us?

359
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,400
Are we a good match?

360
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,120
I...

361
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,560
Don't say it. I know it all.

362
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,520
Girl,

363
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,640
why are you here all alone?

364
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,040
(A Deaf-Mute Girl,
Collect Wastes to Save Mom)

365
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,280
How pitiful.

366
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,440
Collecting wastes
to make money at this age.

367
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,280
This is all I have.

368
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,000
I have some.

369
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,520
Take it.

370
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,520
This surely isn't enough.

371
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,320
Wait here.

372
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,760
I believe
you can understand what I mean.

373
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,120
You're a smart girl.

374
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,520
I don't need to say much.

375
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,080
So, you should stick with the strong
and avoid the weak.

376
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,560
That's the law of survival in society.

377
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,200
I understand.

378
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,200
Alright.

379
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,280
That's all for today.

380
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,120
Go back and digest that.

381
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,000
Think it over.

382
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,680
Right.

383
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,080
Come to my studio tomorrow

384
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,280
to pick up the school's approval
of the Film Festival.

385
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,160
Okay.

386
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,440
I know you can do it.

387
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,040
Go for it.

388
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,800
Do you mean

389
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,680
we'd give all the movie fund to

390
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,800
her?

391
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,400
No way.

392
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,440
What if she's a fraud?

393
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,320
Let me see what's written above.

394
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,200
Enough.

395
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,640
Just give her the money.

396
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,560
She is so pitiful.

397
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,520
Indeed.

398
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,040
Let me tell you.

399
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,808
Saving others matters the most.

400
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:48,400
Every day...

401
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,560
Stop it.

402
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Just give her the money.

403
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,800
Saving her in emergency matters.

404
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
It's the movie fund.

405
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,560
We couldn't make the film then.

406
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,800
I can still earn the money.

407
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,560
She needs the money.

408
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,440
Okay.

409
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,920
Here, girl.

410
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,000
Take out the phone.

411
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,920
I'll transfer you the money.

412
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,680
Are you silly?

413
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,040
She doesn't have a phone.

414
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,280
Go withdraw money.

415
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,040
Where can I go to withdraw money now?

416
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,800
You're the smartest, please.

417
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,920
Please.

418
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,800
Here.

419
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,560
Take it. Don't drop it.

420
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,200
Put the money in the bag.

421
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,680
It's more secure.

422
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,400
Take the flower too.

423
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,920
It's not just for you,

424
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,560
but also for your mom.

425
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,800
Wishing your mom recover soon.

426
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,680
You'd take this money,

427
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,680
and we'd take

428
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,160
this bag.

429
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,080
Take it.

430
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,680
Okay, let's go.

431
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,560
Get up.

432
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,280
Let's go.

433
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,680
You're all out of money.

434
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,080
What's there to be happy about?

435
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,920
How about the competition?

436
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,080
I've told you I'm not interested.

437
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,320
You are not, but I am.

438
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,520
I've told you
I have to defeat you in public.

439
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,760
You don't accept it,

440
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,040
how can I defeat you in public?

441
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,320
Defeating me

442
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,320
makes you feel satisfied?

443
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,080
Anyway, I just can't stand

444
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,640
seeing you being arrogant.

445
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,000
I just want to defeat you.

446
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,680
Rest assured.

447
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,080
I won't give you the chance.

448
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,560
If you're scared, just admit it.

449
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,760
Well, Ren Ze.

450
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,440
Everyone.

451
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,800
Tomorrow, I'll have a fair competition

452
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,640
with Ren Ze.

453
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,920
I hope you can come and witness it.

454
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
What's it about?

455
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,640
We'll draw the same model.

456
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,880
And you will be the judges

457
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,080
to decide the winner.

458
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,920
Interesting.

459
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,520
I want to join.

460
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,040
We'll definitely be there then.

461
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,640
How is it, Ren Ze?

462
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,640
Since you want to disgrace yourself,

463
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,800
then I'll grant you.

464
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,280
See you at the rooftop tomorrow at noon.

465
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
You're treating me to this?

466
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,680
Be grateful there's something to eat.

467
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm running out of money this month.

468
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,200
Your parents are abroad,

469
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,080
and giving you money monthly?

470
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,080
It's good
that they give it to me monthly.

471
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,560
Recently they learned
something from somewhere,

472
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,680
asking me to live on myself.

473
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,080
We gave all the money to that girl.

474
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,320
Regretting it now?

475
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,320
We have no money to make the film now.

476
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,880
I wonder who

477
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,920
said arrogantly,

478
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,280
"Give her all.

479
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,760
We can still earn the money."

480
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,680
Get lost.

481
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,160
You drank so much.

482
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,080
Still remember it?

483
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,200
Of course not.

484
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,520
Gu Ran told me.

485
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,440
You drank so much

486
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,200
and went to practice boxing
this morning?

487
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,320
Well,

488
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,880
I had it all planned out.

489
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,520
I wanted to take the morning off.

490
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,680
But then early this morning, she

491
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,920
kept calling me,

492
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,920
and waking me up.

493
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,640
Okay. You two are quite interesting.

494
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,440
Have one.

495
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,640
No.

496
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,680
Come on, grab one.

497
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,440
Gu Ran said to check my body fat,

498
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,560
I dare not to eat these.

499
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,200
So cool.

500
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,320
You two eat this for lunch?

501
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,680
We have no money.

502
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,200
Get in.

503
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,560
Take you two for a big meal.

504
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,080
Really?

505
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,200
Then I...

506
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,680
You follow behind on the bike.

507
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,560
You need to exercise,

508
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,560
so you can eat more.

509
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,760
You two, wait for me!

510
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,200
My bike chain fell off.

511
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,520
You two were going too far.

512
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,200
You two were riding a motorcycle ahead,

513
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,200
and I was tiring on the bike.

514
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,520
Stop talking, just eat.

515
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,160
Don't you eat?

516
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
I don't have an appetite.

517
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,640
Something's up, you.

518
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,680
You eat first, we can talk after.

519
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,080
That's not okay.

520
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,440
We are all one team.

521
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,320
Just say it. Right?

522
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,560
Besides, it's you who's treating us.

523
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,040
Tomorrow, I need a nude model.

524
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,800
We've said last time.

525
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,560
No problem.

526
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,320
2 PM on the rooftop.

527
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,200
Become one with nature, got it.

528
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,080
Tomorrow is a competition.

529
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,280
A lot of people will come.

530
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,080
Isn't it just the two of us?

531
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,520
Well...

532
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,640
If you're not okay, you can refuse.

533
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,880
I'll think about it.

534
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,160
Alright, I'll wait for your news.

535
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,320
You guys eat. I'm leaving.

536
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,680
What?

537
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,160
Are you really going

538
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,000
to be his nude model?

539
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,400
What?

540
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Are you really going

541
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
to be his nude model?

542
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,800
I didn't agree yet.

543
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,080
You must definitely not go.

544
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,760
If you go, you'll be disgraced.

545
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,440
You have to make films.

546
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,000
Alright.

547
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,080
I can't hear what you say.

548
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,000
Hurry up and eat.

549
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,400
Hot!

550
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,640
Five, six, seven, go.

551
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,640
One.

552
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,280
Two.

553
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,000
Three.

554
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,640
Four.

555
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,200
Five.

556
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,040
Six.

557
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,560
Good, stop.

558
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
Stand properly.

559
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,000
None of you are dancing very well.

560
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,160
Don't you practice?

561
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,760
If you make another mistake,
do it a hundred more times.

562
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,880
Take a break.

563
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,760
Li Jiatong.

564
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,000
Come here.

565
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,040
Dance it once more.

566
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,920
Count the beats yourself.

567
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,200
Get ready.

568
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,560
About the summer training camp
in Beijing.

569
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,920
how is your preparation?

570
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,880
Focus.

571
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
There's only one spot for our class.

572
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,760
I've already signed you up.

573
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,440
Miss.

574
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,280
I recommend Liu Lu.

575
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,000
She's more suitable than I am.

576
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,040
Look how hard she works, right?

577
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,760
Liu Lu is very good,

578
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,040
but I think

579
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,640
this opportunity is
more suitable for you.

580
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,040
But I...

581
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,760
But I have things to do.

582
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,560
You can do live-streaming
and film short movies.

583
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,080
But now, here's a great opportunity,

584
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
don't you want to go?

585
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,000
Do something meaningful.

586
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,200
Dance well.

587
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
I'm going out.

588
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,560
Don't stop until I come back.

589
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,440
Li Jiatong.

590
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
Why are you here alone?

591
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,880
Just finished class?

592
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,040
Why is she ignoring us?

593
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,640
Let's go back to the dorm.

594
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,520
Li Yanhao.

595
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,680
Come with me.

596
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,040
Where to?

597
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,000
Exactly.

598
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,320
Where to?

599
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,320
What's it to you?

600
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,760
Go get beaten up by your girlfriend.

601
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,304
Let's go.

602
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,400
Li Yanhao, you...

603
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,640
Hello.

604
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,000
Come to play basketball with me.

605
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,040
Can I not go?

606
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,400
If you don't come, I'll hit you.

607
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,320
Get up.

608
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,160
Are you okay, wimp?

609
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,320
What?

610
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,320
If not, then come play.

611
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,320
Fine.

612
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,000
As my boyfriend,

613
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,320
you can't be this week.

614
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,880
I'll let you off now.

615
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,640
I'll train you tomorrow morning.

616
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,640
I have classes.

617
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,400
Then, afternoon.

618
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,440
I have classes too.

619
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,440
Then, evening.

620
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,760
It's settled then, see you tomorrow.

Sir.

623
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
It's closed.

624
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,520
