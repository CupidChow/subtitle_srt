Stay away from me.

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,560
Let her go!

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,080
Who are you?

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,720
I said,

43
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
"Let her go".

44
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,160
Gentlemen, please don't be mad.

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,720
In broad daylight,

46
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,440
isn't bullying a girl improper?

47
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
How about this?

48
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,720
If you let her go,

49
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,880
I'll pretend I saw nothing.

50
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,920
I won't say anything.

51
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,800
Just go.

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,120
Get up!

53
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,560
Because of you,

54
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,760
I'll have to be slapped again.

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,040
What are you doing?

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,760
We are shooting a video.

57
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,560
Well...

58
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,120
It's a misunderstanding.

59
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,880
I...

60
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,280

(My life)

62
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,600
(is always full
of various misunderstandings,)

63
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,240
(like this mishap.)

64
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,520

that my college life is a trial.)

(but ended up as a harasser,)

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,000
(and was recorded by passersby
and put online.)

69
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,280
(It's such bad luck.)

70
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,920
Hello?

71
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,680
Where are you?

72
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,840
Speak up if you've something to say.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,200
You've been popular.

74
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,760
What are you talking about?

75
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,120
Come back and see for yourself.

76
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,480
(Harasser! Catch the harasser!)

77
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,760
(Harasser! Catch the harasser!)

78
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,560
(He touched her. I saw it.)

79
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,920
(Harasser! Catch the harasser!)

80
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,680
(He touched her.)

81
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,040
(He touched her. I saw it.)

82
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,040
(You run really fast.)

83
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,480
(Harasser! Catch the harasser!)

84
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,848
(Harasser! Catch the harasser!)

85
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,560
(He touched her. I saw it.)

86
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,400
(Harasser!)

87
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,040
Watching it?

88
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,920
(Harasser! Catch the harasser!)

89
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,040
(You run really fast.)

90
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,640
I've watched it

91
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,280
more than a dozen times.

92
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,560
Li Yanhao, I really didn't expect this.

93
00:04:11,744 --> 00:04:13,560
Our friendship spans
more than ten years.

94
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,136
I never expected this from you.

95
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
Under broad daylight,

96
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,840
you harassed a girl.

97
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,200
Don't look at me.

98
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,760
Am I not right?

99
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,520
As your good friend,

100
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,280
in life,

101
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,240
I can tolerate
and take good care of you.

102
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,080
But what is this?

103
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,680
It's a principled mistake.

104
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,040
I need to teach you a lesson.

105
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,080
Nonsense.

106
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,520
Can you just stay away?

107
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,240
Your chattering

108
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,280
is so annoying.

109
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,760
You're angry. You're infuriated.

110
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,080
Roar. Be furious. Come on.

111
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,400
Shout.

112
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,080
Get lost.

113
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,880
What are you looking at?

114
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,520
The view counts.

115
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,280
Not many people watched it.
I've checked.

116
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
How did you find this?

117
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,240
Wang Pengpeng sent it to me.

118
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,848
I guess only a few of us
have watched it.

119
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,920
Why are you smashing my laptop?

120
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
(This must
be the so-called cyberbullying.)

121
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,680
(Who can I reason with?)

122
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,280
(But I underestimated the speed
of online dissemination.)

123
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,840
Ms. Jiang.

124
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,640
Li Yanhao,

125
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,960
come to my office immediately.

126
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
(Harasser! Catch the harasser!)

127
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,280
(Harasser! Catch the harasser!)

128
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,080
(He touched her.)

129
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,520
(He touched her. I saw it.)

130
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,080
It's a misunderstanding again, right?

131
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,280
Actually, at that time, I...

132
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,640
I saw a girl being surrounded by
a group of people.

133
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,400
I thought she was being bullied.

134
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,240
It sounds like you've acted bravely.

135
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,520
How did it end up like this?

136
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,680
Yes, indeed.

137
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,080
Although it's a misunderstanding.

138
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,400
But what if it wasn't?

139
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,680
I couldn't just stand by

140
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,680
and watch a girl bullied.

141
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,800
Ms. Jiang,

142
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,800
I don't care about the misunderstanding
or cyberbullying.

143
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,360
If such a thing happens again,

144
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,520
I will still help.

145
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,240
Be it once

146
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,520
or 100 times.

147
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,680
I think I did nothing wrong.

148
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,080
Although I'm at the bottom

149
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,040
of my class,

150
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,520
I think that one must

151
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,680
still possess a heart for justice.

152
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,680
Don't get too cocky.

153
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,360
What should we do now?

154
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,080
Someone has already leaked it online

155
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,680
that you are a student of our college.

156
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,120
This has a very bad impact
on our college.

157
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,640
If you score over 85
in the makeup exam, you'll pass.

158
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
Thank you, Ms. Gao.

159
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,680
Ms. Jiang,

160
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,680
that girl seems to be from our college.

161
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,960
Should I find her to testify for me?

162
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,560
You better hurry to class.

163
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
If you don't score 90
in next month's makeup exam,

164
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,560
Ms. Gao will definitely not let you off.

165
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,560
She just said 85.

166
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Alright, 85 then.

167
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,080
You should put in extra effort.

168
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,120
Okay.

169
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,120
Alright then.

170
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,520
Don't look for that girl
about this matter first.

171
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,520
Let it fade away gradually.

172
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,680
Okay, Ms. Jiang.

173
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,120
Actually, I didn't care too much
about this.

174
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,120
The internet inherently has no memory.

175
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,480
You're the one with no memory.

176
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,960
Right.

177
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,480
I will definitely work hard.

178
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,960
I will do well in the final exam

179
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,200
and not embarrass you.

180
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,240
Haven't you
embarrassed me enough, Yanhao?

181
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Alright, you can go now.

182
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,640
Let Xiao Rang come in.

183
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,040
Goodbye, Ms. Jiang.

184
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,480
How is it?

185
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,360
Did you explain it?

186
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
What should I explain?

187
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,960
I did what was right.
There's nothing to explain.

188
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,760
You are now famous in the college.

189
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
I can act responsibly.

190
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,200
Fine, you can do that.

191
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,080
Let's go.
We can watch the show after class.

192
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,400
We can't.

193
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,400
-What's wrong?

194
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,640
- Ms. Jiang wants to see you.
- Why is that?

195
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,240
I...

(Office of Library Management
Department)

197
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,680
Xiao Rang,

198
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,840
look at your homework.

199
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,920
What gibberish is this?

200
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,760
Come take a look.

201
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,640
Clappers, glow sticks, and glasses!

202
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,840
Essential gadgets for tonight's show.

203
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,800
Come take a look.

204
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,840
Take a look.

205
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,760
What's that?

206
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,840
Clappers, glow sticks, and glasses.

207
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,800
Everything you need!

208
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,240
Essential gadgets for tonight's show.

209
00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:09,240
How much for the clappers?

210
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,960
Twenty.

211
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,840
Twenty?

212
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,400
That's robbery.

213
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,920
Then clap with your hands.

214
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,800
It will hurt.

215
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,080
How do I look?

216
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,040
Buddy,

217
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,240
you look good. You have great taste.

218
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,120
How much?

219
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,960
Thirty.

220
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
- Thirty?
- Th...

221
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,680
Are you out of your mind?

222
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,840
- Don't buy them.
- Stop.

223
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,520
Listen to me.

224
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,800
They're expensive for a reason.

225
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Compared to clappers,

226
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,200
they attract girls better.

227
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Don't listen to him.

228
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,280
Hurry. Let's go.

229
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,640
Wait. I need these.

230
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,960
Here, thirty.

231
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,520
Here.

232
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,440
You are that harasser in the video.

233
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,880
You're the harasser. I scanned it.

234
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,040
Yes, it's you.

235
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,120
I'll pay you later.

236
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,320
That's right. It's you.

237
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,440
Take a photo for me.

238
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,480
What the heck is this?

239
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,160
I have such a perfect profile.

240
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,680
Can't you find a good angle for me?

241
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,120
Never mind. I'll do it myself.

242
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,240
What's this? Isn't it too lame?

243
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,800
I think it's quite good.

244
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
They're not real dancers.

245
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,680
They are dancing quite well.

246
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,600

I can't watch this anymore.
I'll take a nap.

Just keep watching.

253
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,304

He almost turned himself into nunchucks.

287
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,560
Okay. Just post it like this.

288

Alright.

290
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,680
today's cultural show was a success.

291
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,560
Well done.

292
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,120
Let's go for a meal together.

293
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,040
- Okay.
- Okay.

294
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,680
A meal!

295
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,680
For the Film Festival,
I still need your support.

296
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,480
No problem.

297
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,920
I have a question.

298
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,560
I don't know.

299
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,480
It's serious.

300
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,040
I know even less.

301
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,680
You know a lot of girls
from our college.

302
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,232
I want to ask you about a girl.

303
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,920
A girl?

304
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,160
So you've started to like girls?

305
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,160
You are so frivolous.

306
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,560
Why did you say so?

307
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,800
Besides,

308
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,480
since little,

309
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,680
you're always the serious one,

310
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,720
and I'm the frivolous one.

311
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,680
You are the flower, and I am the leaf.

312
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,240
To make you stand out,
I have made great sacrifices.

313
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Alright.

314
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,160
In our grade,

315
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,360
is there a girl named Yu Lan?

316
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,800
No.

317
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,480
That can't be.

318
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,680
I saw her last time.

319
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
Not in our grade.
She's in the previous grade.

320
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,040
She's the student union president.

321
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,040
The student union president?

322
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,240
Yu Lan?

324
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,920
Is the seat taken?

325
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,040
No.

326
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,480
It's you?

327
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
Such bad luck.

328
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,880
Your video has gone viral.

329
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,160
It's all thanks to you.

330
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,360
Why is that?

331
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
I didn't upload it.

332
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,360
No matter who uploaded it,

333
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,800
I've been cyberbullied.

334
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,360
I need you to clarify for me.

335
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,320
But I was a victim too.

336
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,680
I need you to clarify for me.

337
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,880
You have the ability now.

338
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,160
- You know I didn't...
- But I don't have time.

339
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,680
You've finally made a move.

340
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,800
Were you in the video with him?

341
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,880
You are from our college?

342
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,240
Thanks to you, he's now famous.

343
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,560
Let me introduce myself.
I am his agent.

344
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,240
This is what I've prepared for him.

345
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,480
Doesn't it quite suit him?

346
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,560
Yes, it does.

347
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,360
I'm Xiao Rang.

348
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,160
And you are?

349
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,000

352
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,920
Nice name.

353
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,584
But the surname Li isn't.
It's the same as his.

354
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,600
I'm different. My surname is Xiao.

355
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,920
The Xiao family has a lineage
of talented people.

356
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,240

357
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240

- I feel like hitting you right now.
- I feel like hitting you right now.

359
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,880
You two are in great sync.

360
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,240
No wonder you were in the same video.

361
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,440
(This boy is quite interesting.)

362
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,040
(Let me tease him a bit.)

363
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,680
Li Yanhao,

364
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,560
when will you apologize to me?

365
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,560
Why should I apologize?

366
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,440
I did nothing wrong.

367
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,440
But the netizens said you harassed me.

368
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,000
Right?

369
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,040
I did not harass you.

370
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,680
Don't you know for yourself?

371
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,240
But that's what netizens said.

372
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,560
Won't you apologize?

373
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,560
Wait.

374
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,680
What I need is for you to clear my name.

375
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,000
Why should I apologize
if I did nothing wrong?

376
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,680
So you mean you won't apologize?

377
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,360
Of course.

378
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,800
Fine.

379
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
Li Yanhao is a harasser.

380
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,920
He harassed me.

381
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,480
This is Li Yanhao.

382
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,560
I... You...

383
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,720
You win.

384
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,560
Go.

385
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,600
Stick with the group.

386
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,680
Stop dawdling.

387
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,560
Keep your voice down.

388
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,600
Isn't that Li Yanhao?

389
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,160
How come you're coming to class today?

390
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,720
What do you want?

391
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
Nothing.

392
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,480
I just want

393
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,040
to meet with you,

394
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,920
an online celebrity.

395
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,560
Exactly.

396
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,920
You've now made our Library

397
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,120
Management Department famous.

398
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,320
Now everyone in Binhai City

399
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,360
knows you, Li Yanhao,

400
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,120
the infamous harasser.

401
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,040
By the way,

402
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,000
that girl, what's her name...
something Tong?

403
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,040
That's not important.

404
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,480
Come on.
Let me take a photo with the harasser.

405
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,240
Turn on the flash.

406
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
Are you finished?

407
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:46,800
It has nothing to do with you.

408
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,120
You are done for.

409
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,040
I'm done for?

410
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,680
Look at you, your glabella is dark.

411
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,360
- My glabella is dark?
- Lifeless eyes.

412
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,160
A pale face.

413
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,040
And a pale tongue.

414
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,680
Are your hands and feet usually cold?

415
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,880
- And your back is sore?
- Nonsense!

416
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,560
You have insomnia, dreaminess,
dizziness, and tinnitus.

417
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,360
Do you know why?

418
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:58,800
Why?

419
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,720
You are weak.

420
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,480
I am... I am weak?

421
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,600
At such a young age,
you have kidney deficiency.

422
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,480
How is it?

423
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,800
That's basic.

424
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,920
Hello, everyone.

425
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,560
Welcome.

426
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,440
I'm Li Jiatong from Binhai University.

427
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,040
This place

428
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,840
(Sichuan Spicy Hot Pot)
is Binhai University's night market.

429
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,680
Here are two beautiful stall owners.

430
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,200
Come on. Let's give them a shot.

431
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,440
Say hello, ladies.

432
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,320
Hello.

433
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,120
I'll have a portion

434
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,920
of all these.

435
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,560
Okay.

436
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,120
Thank you.

437
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,080
Let's go to the next stall.

438
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,440
This is the second stall.

439
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,720
The beautiful stall owner.

440
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
I'll take a portion of all these.

441
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,240
Okay.

442
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,960
Okay. Thank you.

443
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,800
You're welcome.

444
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,720
Don't miss out as you pass by.

445
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,920
Come to Jiatong's livestream room.
Give me follows and likes.

446
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,800
I'm waiting for you
in the livestream room.

447
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,720
This isn't a food livestream.

448
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,080
I'm just showing all of you

449
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,080
the delicacies here.

450
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,720
Take a look.

451
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,080
Not bad, huh?

452
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,680
Guys,

453
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,440
I've spotted the harasser.

454
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,960
I'll go tease them now.

455
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,840
Why is it you two again?

456
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,600
How come you're everywhere?

457
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,560
I...

458
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,600
That's because you're following me.

459
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,720
Let's go.

460
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,320
You...

461
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,320
What's that?

462
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:31,920
Stop that.

463
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,680
Let me look again.

464
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,680
For this kind of girl,

465
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
what kind of man can win her heart?

466
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
Hurry up and eat.

467
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,040
Stop being silly, okay?

468
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,600
I'm speaking the truth.

469
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
Look, she's pretty,

470
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,680
with a good personality
and is good at studying,

471
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:49,504
and also the student union president.

472
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,320
As a normal man,

473
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,560
when facing this kind of girl,

474
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,720
won't you

475
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,200
feel inferior?

476
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,920
Won't you feel particularly unconfident?

477
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,960
Why were you staring at her?

478
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,200
You don't like her, do you?

479
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,120
What are you blabbering about?

480
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,920
H-How could I possibly...

481
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,840
T-Then why are you stammering?

482
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,720
When did I stammer?

483
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,080
When have I ever stammered?

484
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,080
I-I...

485
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
I-I...

486
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,440
Go on. You what?

487
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,680
I-I... I've finished eating.

488
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,200
Wait. Tell me everything.

489
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,080
I'm off.

490
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,840
What's with the rush?
I didn't finish my food.

491
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,840
Wait a minute.

492
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,440
What are you hiding?

493
00:19:55,648 --> 00:19:56,600
Review materials.

494
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,920
What review materials?

495
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,080
- I've never seen them. Let me see.
- Stop. You know...

496
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,680
I-I'm about to take the makeup exam.

497
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,960
I need to review these materials.

498
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,560
Otherwise I'll fail and be expelled.

499
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,800
Li Yanhao, we've known
each other for 20 years.

500
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,560
You've started hiding things
from me, right?

501
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,320
I haven't.

502
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Then show me.

503
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:11,960
- Let me see what it is.
- Stop.

504
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,680
Wait. Stop.

505
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,080
How about this?

506
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,840
I can tell you.

507
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,600
But don't laugh at me.

508
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,440
Sure. We don't laugh at each other.

509
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,440
Got any alcohol?

510
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:31,800
Yes.

511
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,200
I'm treating.

512
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,600
Why are you here?

513
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,080
Didn't you ask me to come over?

514
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
They beat you again?

515
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,720
This time, I not only fought them off,

516
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,680
but I also didn't cry.

517
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,480
This is your reward.

518
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,200
They won't dare bully you anymore.

519
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,800
Just avoid them when you see them.

520
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
Study hard, okay?

521
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,840
What's with that look?

522
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,320
Don't believe me?

523
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,720
Knowing you for so long,

524
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,176
it's the first time
I find that you are romantic.

525
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,200
Yes, I am.

526
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,200
Don't get too smug.

527
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,080
That's not being romantic.

528
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
That's being delusional.

529
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,960
It happened a long time ago.

530
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,064
There's nothing in the notebook.
Why are you sure Yu Lan gave it to you?

531
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,080
My goddess gave it to me.

532
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,840
How could I possibly
write anything on it?

533
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,440
Fine.

534
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,320
Even if your story is true,

535
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,960
what is Yu Lan like?

536
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,080
She is gentle, kind, beautiful,
and generous.

537
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,800
The girl in your story
was clearly a hoiden.

538
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,320
She's a different person.

539
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,440
It's been years.

540
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,720
People can change.

541
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,720
Don't spout nonsense.

542
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,840
Are we brothers?

543
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,600
No.

544
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,560
I am your father.

545
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,120
I'll kick you right into the wall.

546
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,200
It's not that I won't help you.

547
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,200
Your title as the harasser is known

548
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
throughout the college.

549
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,360
And you lack in all areas.

550
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,320
You don't have a good figure,
and are not handsome, or smart.

551
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
In your case,

552
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,920
if you go to Yu Lan,

553
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
will she acknowledge you?

554
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,440
I find that you truly lack moral virtue.

555
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,840
You really lack moral virtue.

556
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,080
I don't have any good quality?

557
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,800
You do. You're a good person.

558
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,080
So what do you suggest I do?

559
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,080
Don't worry. I will help you.

560
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
After all, I am your...

561
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
Agent.

562
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,080
Leave it to me.

563
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,360
Rang.

564
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,320
- Thanks.
- Here.

565
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:41,960
Fried chicken.

566
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:43,960
Milk tea.

567
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,720
Thank you.

568
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,840
It's a bit hot.

569
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,600
Hot?

570
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,800
Let me help.

571
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,960
Tell me, what's the good plan?

572
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,480
Don't worry. There's always a way.

573
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,720
Hurry up. My patience is limited.

574
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,960
Well, I haven't thought of it yet.

575
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Then give my milk tea back.
You shameless one.

576
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,480
I was just joking.

577
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,320
I will help you.

578
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,480
I've gathered all the information
for you.

579
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,600
Later on, Li Jiatong will

580
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,080
have a class in Classroom 708.

581
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,840
Go and find her.

582
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,720
Explain things to her properly
and plead with her.

583
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,600
If she scolds you, just listen.

584
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,320
If she hits you, just bear it.

585
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
As long as she's willing
to clarify for you,

586
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,720
your infamy of being a harasser

587
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,600
will be cleared.

588
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,320
That's it?

589
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
What else do you want?

590
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,080
That's all?

591
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
That's what you come up with
after half an hour?

592
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,256
I can come up with it too.

593
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,080
Whatever.

594
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,440
What about you?

595
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,200
I'll drink milk tea, bask in the sun,

596
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,320
eat fried chicken,

597
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,720
and enjoy life.

598
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,200
No way. You have to come with me.

599
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,720
I won't go with you.

600
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,200
I've told you the situation,
time, and place.

601
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,720
To accompany you will cost more.

602
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,720
Fine.

603
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,440
I remember the dance room

604
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,960
seems to be full of girls
in body-shaping outfits, right?

605
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,960
The figures...

606
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,840
Hurry up. Or the class will be over.

607
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
I've heard that recently

608
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,480
in our college, there's been a harasser.

609
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,600
They say a harasser has been seen
in the restrooms.

610
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,720
Is it the same person?

611
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,080
It seems like
he's also harassed female students.

612
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,320
He wouldn't come here, right?

613
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,600
I dare not get changed.

614
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,200
Seven, eight. The other side.

615
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,040
One, two, three, four.

616
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,840
It should be here.

617
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,440
No one's here?

618
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,720
Who are you two?

619
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,080
Liu Lu, they're peeping.

620
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:00,720
No. Wait.

621
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,440
We're not.

622
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,200
What are you doing?
Which class are you from?

623
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,320
Well, w-we came for someone.

624
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,440
Liu Lu, I know them.

625
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
They're from my class.

626
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,720
This guy is that harasser.

627
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,800
The other one is Xiao Rang.

628
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,200
He added me on WeChat
at the show last night.

629
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,320
I ignored him.

630
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,840
I...

631
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,440
Who exactly are you two here for?

632
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,600
That's an excuse.

633
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,960
Just two harassers here to peep.

634
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,720
No.

635
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,840
It's a misunderstanding.

636
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,960
- We came...
- Why are you here?

637
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,840
Right. We came for her.

638
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,080
Hurry. Explain it for us.

639
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,600
Explain what?

640
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,680
Explain what?

641
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,960
You two harassers!

642
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,200
- We are not.
- Hurry.

643
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,960
- Chase him!
- Chase him!

644
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,080
- Catch them.
- Stop.

645
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,240
- Catch them
- Harassers!

646
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,600
Harassers, stop! Catch him.

647
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,080
- Stop, harassers!
- Stop.

648
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,600
- Stop.
- Bad guys!

649
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,720
- Harassers!
- Stop.

650
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,120
- Harassers!
- Stop.

651
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,010
(Harasser Duo)

652
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,840
It's over.

653
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,840
Now my reputation is completely ruined.

654
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,600
How can I chase after girls now?

655
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,440
You've got the nerve to talk.

656
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,440
Your information was not accurate.

657
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,080
Nonsense.

658
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,440
You saw Li Jiatong, didn't you?

659
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,600
Seeing her in that situation
wouldn't help at all.

660
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,800
(Li Yanhao, you've even found a partner)

661
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,960
(in being a harasser?)

662
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,440
(Xiao Rang,)

663
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,360
(you and Li Yanhao)

664
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,680
(ran to the dance room to peep?)

665
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,920
(You two did what I never dared to do.)

666
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,200
(Come to my office
with Xiao Rang tomorrow.)

667
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,728
Let's transfer to another college.

668
00:26:21,728 --> 00:26:23,936
Let's find a place
where no one knows us and start over.

669
00:26:23,936 --> 00:26:25,720
Are you insane?
Can you say something useful?

670
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,008
Then what should we do?

671
00:26:27,008 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm out of ideas too.

672
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,720
I'm hungry.

673
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,840
Let's eat first.

674
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,440
Okay.

675
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:31,960
Let's go.

676
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,440
Let's go.

677
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,960
They are here.

678
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,680
So shameless.

679
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,320
Let's leave.

680
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,320
Let's stay away from him.

681
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,600
Stay away from him. Let's go.

682
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,440
- Let's avoid them.
- Right.

683
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,712
Look how scared everyone is.

684
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,320
They're so shameless.

685
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,240
Let's go.

686
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,680
Look.

687
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,480
They're watching us.

688
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,360
- Harassers.
- They look

689
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,320
decent.

690
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,040
They did such terrible things.

691
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,384
What are you looking at?

692
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,200
Never seen a harasser eat?

693
00:27:30,496 --> 00:27:32,384
(Den of Harassers)

694
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,080
What happened?

695
00:27:48,512 --> 00:27:50,624
How would I know?
It was like this when I got back.

696
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,200
It's all thanks to you two.

697
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,960
When they painted the door,

698
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,720
we were here.

699
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,720
Take this.

700
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,960
I-I'm sorry.

701
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,320
Because of me...

702
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,080
What are you doing?

703
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:03,960
Isn't it obvious?

704
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,840
We are moving.

705
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,200
Anyway, I'm not a harasser.

706
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,240
You two better pray for good luck.

707
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,240
Let's go.

708
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,200
Move.

709
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
I can't take it anymore.

710
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,240
This is unbearable.

711
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,480
We are from Journalism Department.
Are you Xiao Rang?

712
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,720
Are you done?

713
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,440
Get out.

714
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,920
Fellow journalism students,

715
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,920
I'm sorry. He does not do this
during lunchtime.

716
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,720
Maybe next time. See you around.

717
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,240
Thank you.

718
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,200
We will come back.

719
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,840
Alright.

720
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,960
You're always welcome.

721
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,720
Bye.

722
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,920
We can't sit back.

723
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,600
I'll go fix it.

724
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,840
Waiting for me?

725
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
Let's go somewhere else.

726
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,200
With so many people here,
I'm afraid you'll get mobbed.

727
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,840
Put this on.

728
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,840
Why are you standing there?

729
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,960
There are so many people here.

730
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
Why did we come here?

731
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,240
Wasn't the place earlier better?

732
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,720
Don't be so close to me.

733
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,800
Look, there are more people here.

734
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,040
I don't have to worry
about getting harassed.

735
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,360
Don't slander me.

736
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,480
You know I haven't harassed you.

737
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,960
What I did last time
was an act of bravery.

738
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,840
So what now?

739
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,040
Now everyone says you have.

740
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,840
You know

741
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,200
I haven't.

742
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,080
What's the use of explaining it to me?

743
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,960
I'm also the topic.

744
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,840
Everyone is saying...

745
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,360
Who can I reason with?

746
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,240
Xiao Rang
is also being cyberbullied now.

747
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,600
We can't let him end up like me.

748
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,440
I'm so sorry.

749
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,080
Sorry.

750
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,840
Please.

751
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,240
Now you're the only one
who can prove our innocence.

752
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,360
Please. I beg you.

753
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,360
Well, I am a girl

754
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,840
who was harassed.

755
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,720
How can I clear your name?

756
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,840
Alright, I think I understand now.

757
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,600
Tell me.

758
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,240
What do you want me to do?

759
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,360
I'll have to think about that.

760
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,720
I've got it.

761
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,080
How about the name of Harasser Duo?

762
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,920
Isn't it perfect for you two?

763
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,720
Just let it be.

764
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,240
You're becoming famous so fast.

765
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,464
You're internet celebrities now.
That's pretty good. No need to explain.

766
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,360
What's wrong with you?
Why can't I get through to you?

767
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,480
Are you fooling me?

768
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,120
Yes, that's who I am.

769
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,240
I am just that bad.

770
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,360
So what now?

771
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,720
How about you hit me?

772
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,480
If you dare to hit me,

773
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,600
I'll scream "harassment".

774
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,960
Harassment?

775
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,440
Go ahead. Scream that right here.

776
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,560
You meant it?

777
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,320
I can post a clarification video for you

778
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,480
if you agree to one condition.

779
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,200
Say it.

780
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,720
You post an apology video first.

781
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,360
Then I'll post a clarification video.

782
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,440
Very fair, isn't it?

783
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,920
I did nothing wrong.

784
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,480
Why should I post an apology video?

785
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,120
If you don't do that,
why should I post a clarification video?

786
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,680
Wait.

787
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,440
Just wait.

788
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,800
Let me understand this logic.

789
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,240
I did nothing wrong.

790
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,800
Why should I post an apology video?

791
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,800
If I were to do that,

792
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,120
wouldn't that imply I did wrong?

793
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,960
I came to you for a clarification video.

794
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,480
How come now

795
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,920
I need to post an apology video?

796
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,480
If I posted an apology video, that...

797
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,320
Shut up.

798
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,680
Listen to me.

799
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,360
If you don't post an apology video,

800
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,920
I won't post a clarification video.

801
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,480
Just think about it.

802
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,600
Alright, I'm telling you.

803
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,040
Even if my reputation is ruined,

804
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,480
I won't let you distort the facts.

805
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,616
Even if my reputation is ruined,
I won't let you distort the facts.

806
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:46,760
(An art district outside campus)

807
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,200
We watch your livestream every day.

808
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,560
We've liked you for a long time.

809
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,800
Thank you.

810
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,720
Come on. Have a few drinks with us.

811
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,080
I...

812
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,680
What are you doing?

813
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,120
Help!

814
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,440
What happened?

815
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,960
Filming something again?

816
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,040
Alright then. Carry on.

817
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,040
I won't disturb you.

818
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,600
Guys,

819
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,600
still working at this late hour?

820
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,240
Do you need me

821
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,960
help you with anything?

822
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,600
I am a director now.

823
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,320
I'm pretty good.

824
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,480
I can film a lot of things.

825
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,600
Let's go.

826
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,680
