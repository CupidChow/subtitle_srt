00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,040
Auntie,

50
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
how is our shooting?

51
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,800
Noble in intent, beautiful in imagery.

52
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,040
Though the one-shot technique

53
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,320
is still not mature enough,

54
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,240
I think it's already quite good.

55
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,080
Especially the last part,
paying tribute to familial love.

56
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
I especially like it.

57
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,440
I knew you can do it.

58
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,440
So, could our film

59
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,880
win an award?

60
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,160
That depends on how well others perform.

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,400
But I have high expectations for you.

62
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,680
Shall we celebrate?

63
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,440
Let's celebrate.

64
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,240
Come on.

65
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,080
Give a speech.

66
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,720
Come on.

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,520
For the successful completion!

68
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,040
Wishing us first place!

Let's thank the president
for recognizing us.

00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,440
Thank you.

71
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,800
You should also thank us,

72
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,080
for my help to him, right?

73
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,240
- Come on.
- Cheers.

74
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

75
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,080
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

76
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
Which class are you from?

77
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,040
Why are you on the rooftop so late?

78
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,080
Please, come in.

79
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,520
Director, you're right on time.

80
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,160
We are holding our movie premiere.

81
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,520
W-Whose premiere?

82
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,400
Director,

83
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,960
it was filmed by our entire team.

84
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,160
Our director, Li Yanhao.

85
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:26,976
But,

86
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:28,960
still you can't stay here so late.

87
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,440
Director,

88
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,240
we were just planning to invite

89
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,600
a respected teacher like you

90
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,680
to give us some guidance.

91
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,160
Here you come.

92
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,680
Director,

93
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,080
could you please check it

94
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,240
by your unique insights

95
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
and give us some advice?

96
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,800
You're inviting me?

97
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,040
- Yes, please.
- Please.

98
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,680
Well...

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,520
Here!

100
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,040
- Please sit.
- Okay.

101
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,880
Sit.

102
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,800
- Please.
- Okay.

103
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
- Okay.
- Please.

104
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,736
Well...

105
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:49,320
Director.

106
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,080
No, thanks.

107
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,160
Just play it, now.

108
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,960
Let me do it!

109
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,520
Play it.

110
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,440
Here it comes.

111
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,800
Okay.

112
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,160
The thing I told you last time,

113
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,320
no need repeating it, right?

114
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,440
So, how are you with your dad?

115
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,680
Your relation is still...

116
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,800
That's my business.

117
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,560
Come on.

118
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,280
Aren't we friends?

119
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,600
Yes, but it's my business.

120
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,840
Fine, you guys watch it.

121
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,560
I'm leaving now.

122
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,000
You!

123
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,440
It really is

124
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,840
quite touching.

125
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,440
I didn't expect...

126
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,000
We can make it so good, right?

127
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,720
Let me tell you,

128
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,280
if this film doesn't win an award
at the Film Festival,

129
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,240
I'll talk to the school

130
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,840
give you guys an award.

131
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,400
Alright.

132
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,000
Thanks!

133
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,840
Thank you.

134
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,880
Let's aim for the first prize!

135
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,600
- Cheers!
- Thank you, Director.

136
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
- Come on!
- Cheers!

137
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,160
I hope you will keep your promise.

138
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,440
Don't worry.

139
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,400
You'll definitely
be the next student union president.

140
00:05:18,272 --> 00:05:19,840
School's about to start.

141
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
Just wait and see.

142
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,160
Can I ask you a question?

143
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,840
You have views on Yu Lan.

144
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,440
Why do you support her
to be the president?

145
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,000
Because of my current self.

146
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,880
I don't get it.

147
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,160
During my postgrad exam period,

148
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,160
as a supporter of equal rights

149
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,120
and women's empowerment,

150
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,600
I needed to earn my advisor's favor

151
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,000
while maintaining good grades.

152
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,160
Because my graduate advisor

153
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,880
is a woman.

154
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:49,120
(Student Union Office)

155
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,160
Thanks for your honesty.

156
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,400
I think highly of you.

157
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,440
Your spirit mirrors my past self.

158
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,120
Keep it up.

159
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,560
You can go now.

160
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,440
Hang the 'closed' sign on the door.

161
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,320
I want to be alone now.

162
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,800
We're closed.

163
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,080
Closed.

164
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,520
You still can't forgive me.

165
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
The gallery is beautiful.

166
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
The story is great too.

167
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,080
But this is not what I want.

168
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,120
What do you want?

169
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,080
What can I give you? What else can I do?

170
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,120
I want my mom.

171
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,960
I wanted your protection for her then.

172
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,720
I wanted a beautiful childhood.

173
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,720
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

174
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,520
Through these years,

175
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,720
I always want to find a good opportunity

176
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,240
to say I'm sorry to you.

177
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,320
I am your father.

178
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,240
But I am unworthy.

179
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,720
I didn't take good care of your mother.

180
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,720
Nor did I take good care of you.

181
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,400
I don't expect you
to call me 'dad' again.

182
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,520
But,

183
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,520
I just want to make amends

184
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,160
for all my mistakes over the years.

185
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,840
Now,

186
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,600
I often dream of
the moment you were born.

187
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,800
I think that period

188
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,400
was the happiest time of my life.

189
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,160
After your mother died,

190
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,520
I have lost interest in everything.

191
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,360
It's true.

192
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,520
I once enjoyed earning money.

193
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,960
Because I needed to
take good care of your mom

194
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,040
and you.

195
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,080
But,

196
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,840
since your mom passed away,

197
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,200
my life has completely lost direction.

198
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,040
I love your mom deeply.

199
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,200
I love you deeply too.

200
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,720
But every time I look into your eyes,

201
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,520
my heart aches terribly.

202
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,360
I can't even

203
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,520
forgive myself.

204
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,520
How can I hope

205
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,080
that you can call me "dad" again?

206
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,160
I've thought about leaving this city,

207
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,760
far behind,

208
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,360
disappearing completely from your life.

209
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,400
But when I see your paintings,

210
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,840
which reminds me of your mother,

211
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,520
I realize I can't leave you.

212
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,960
I can never leave you.

213
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,600
I think you've finished. Here's the key.

214
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,200
Thank you for everything these years.

215
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,080
Dad.

216
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,520
School is about to start.

217
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,280
The first week,

218
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,760
is the Film Festival presentation.

219
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,640
Where is your work?

220
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,600
Speak up!

221
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,520
Gone mute?

222
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,200
I've already sent it to you.

223
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,760
Yes, you did.

224
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,640
Didn't you see what you sent me?

225
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,080
A pile of garbage.

226
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,760
Worse than garbage.

227
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,920
You call that a film?

228
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,040
You're insulting film!

229
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,600
I'm the organizer of such a grand

230
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,760
Film Festival.

231
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,160
But you disgrace me with these trashes.

232
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,160
How did you swear to me

233
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,760
and promise me?

234
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,040
You said, "We'll do it well."

235
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,280
We'll bring honor to our school.

236
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,160
And now?

237
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,920
Liars!

238
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,960
Someone even sent me a 90-second clip.

239
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,080
Now, even TikToks are longer than that!

240
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,960
I've told you to work hard in holiday.

241
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,040
Then I'll help you to win the award.

242
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,760
The prize money will all belongs to you.

243
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,640
But what did you do?

244
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,600
Some couldn't be contacted.

245
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,360
Some went travelling.

246
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,040
There's even some said

247
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,040
their hands cramped from playing games

248
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,360
and couldn't carry the camera.

249
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,760
What lousy excuses these are!

250
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,360
I'm talking about you.

251
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,480
Still playing, huh?

252
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,480
I know.

253
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,920
You want to go out
and have fun during the holidays.

254
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,720
To relax.

255
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,920
But have you thought about it?

256
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,480
If you make a good film,

257
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,520
isn't it an honor you receive at school?

258
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,640
Didn't you let us participate

259
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,720
just to kick Yu Lan off?

260
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,960
Now she has already left,

261
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,200
is it so important if we participate?

262
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,200
What do you mean?

263
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,640
When did I kick her off?

264
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,840
She left
because she couldn't handle the task.

265
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,200
I aim to expand the Film Festival,

266
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,600
to lead you win awards in the city.

267
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,760
So you just work hard.

268
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,840
The jury is arranged by me.

269
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,600
All of you will be able to win an award.

270
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,920
I'd be honored too.

271
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,400
Understand?

272
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
What are you waiting for?

273
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,040
Now get to work!

274
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,520
Zheng Nan and Liu Yang, you stay.

275
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
What I just said,

276
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,360
don't take it seriously.

277
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,080
I was addressing the group.

278
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,040
What you two filmed is not long enough.

279
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,360
The content is too dull.

280
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,480
But the idea is good.

281
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,400
Keep working in this direction.

282
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,920
Understand?

283
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,040
I'm sure you'll win the first prize.

284
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,960
This way, the first

285
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,760
citywide college student film festival

286
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,840
will have two top winners.

287
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,360
And both will be from our school.

288
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
How glorious!

289
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
In that case,

290
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,760
won't other people

291
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,040
think we're rigging it?

292
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,720
Yes.

293
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,480
Two first prizes.

294
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,480
Isn't it a bit too obvious?

295
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,600
Exactly.

296
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,360
Don't worry.

297
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,200
I will handle the judges.

298
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,480
What about other competitors?

299
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,720
How are their works?

300
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,040
Zhu Ruoqing hasn't submitted it yet.

301
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,200
Your classmate Li Yanhao

302
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,080
has already submitted.

303
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,720
His work is very good.

304
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,920
But don't worry, boys.

305
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,960
I won't let him in.

306
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,200
Why?

307
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,360
Because he was recommended by Yu Lan.

308
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
He is a strong competitor of yours.

309
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
I must eliminate him from the start.

310
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,480
If he gets in,

311
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,920
you two will have no chance. Understand?

312
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:23,960
Well,

313
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,640
I think this is not appropriate.

314
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,200
And it's also not fair.

315
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,280
Just win the prize.

316
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,520
Who cares about fairness?

317
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,720
There's no real fairness in this world.

318
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,360
Can she, Yu Lan, do better than me?

319
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,520
The person she recommended,

320
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,480
will never

321
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,160
appear in the Film Festival.

322
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,600
Alright, you two hurry back to prepare.

323
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,720
Do it well, okay?

324
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,040
Okay.

325
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,040
Go, now!

326
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,760
Zheng Nan.

327
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,520
Your phone.

328
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,840
I forgot it.

329
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,480
I believe in you, come on!

330
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,640
This doesn't seem right.

331
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,040
I think it's incorrect.

332
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,480
I don't really like Li Yanhao,

333
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,600
but I think

334
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,920
we can't beat him so dishonorably.

335
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,280
Yes.

336
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
In fact, I don't like him either.

337
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,400
But after all, we are classmates.

338
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,080
I make films

339
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,360
just for fun.

340
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,520
But now it's

341
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,360
kind of disgusting.

342
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,520
I find it disgusting too.

343
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,280
Li Yanhao is truly annoying.

344
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,280
But what we did to him before

345
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,640
was also dishonorable.

346
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,600
But he said nothing.

347
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,080
After all, we're dorm mates.

348
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,600
We've lived together for so long.

349
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,760
Exactly.

350
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,760
But Kang Yide
was the former student union president,

351
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,400
and a media mogul.

352
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,040
Think about it again.

353
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,360
Just think it over.

354
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,480
Hasn't your foot healed already?

355
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,160
Why are you still so stiff
when moving it?

356
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,920
Don't you know
that a bone takes 100 days to heal?

357
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,840
But in filming,

358
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,360
I didn't feel something unusual.

359
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,360
Because I was enduring the pain.

360
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,760
It actually still hurts now.

361
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,760
I just didn't say it.

362
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,360
Massage it for me?

363
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,760
I'll be gentle.

364
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,720
How was my dance just now?

365
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,840
Great.

366
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,520
But your outfit...

367
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
If...

368
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,600
It's just a regular gymnastics suit.

369
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,760
For practice. What about it?

370
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
Well, I mean,

371
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,480
if you could wear

372
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,360
the outfit you had on our film shoot,

373
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,480
it would be stunning.

374
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
That depends on my mood.

375
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,040
If I'm in a good mood,

376
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,640
I'll wear it on formal stage.

377
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,040
Okay.

378
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,360
Then that will fulfill one of my wishes.

379
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,640
What are your wishes? I'll fulfill them.

380
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,400
My wish is...

381
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,480
Flirting in the classroom, huh?

382
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,760
You must be Li Yanhao.

383
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,000
Yes.

384
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,600
This is my teacher, Ms. Zhao.

385
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,240
Hello, Ms. Zhao!

386
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Well, young man, you're quite attentive.

387
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Her foot...

388
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,480
She asked me to give it a rub.

389
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,640
And you just did it?

390
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,720
What are your relationship?

391
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,360
We are...

392
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,000
We are friends, Ms. Zhao.

393
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,240
Yes, we're friends.

394
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,760
I don't care about your relationship.

395
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,880
But she is the best student in my class.

396
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,480
You must take good care of her, alright?

397
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,240
Definitely.

398
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,600
How is your recovery going?

399
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,520
I'm all right now, see?

400
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,880
Didn't you just say
it takes 100 days to recover?

401
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,240
That's...

402
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
It's better now.

403
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,720
Then why let me...

404
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,280
Show affection after I'm gone, okay?

405
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,880
Listen,

406
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,360
this term's first weekend,

407
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,120
there's a dance competition audition.

408
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,720
You must participate it.

409
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Don't worry, Ms. Zhao.

410
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,760
I'll definitely get in!

411
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,880
Next Saturday at 7:30 PM,

412
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
at Binhai Grand Theater.

413
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,480
I'll go with you that day.

414
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,400
Really?

415
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,000
Thank you, Ms. Zhao!

416
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,280
I love you the most!

417
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,120
The person you love the most
in this room now

418
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,520
should be him, isn't it?

419
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,640
Alright.

420
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,360
I'll leave you to your private time.

421
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,280
I'm leaving.

422
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,760
Goodbye, Ms. Zhao.

423
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,720
Just now,

424
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,600
why did you hesitate?

425
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,080
I didn't.

426
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,760
Well, I wanted to admit...

427
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,760
But, didn't you say

428
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,760
that we are good friends?

429
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,280
So I just went along with you.

430
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
What do you think then?

431
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,600
What's our relationship now?

432
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,840
We...

433
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,600
We are definitely...

434
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,160
Stop.

435
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,000
You haven't confessed to me yet.

436
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,840
So for now, we can only be friends.

437
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,280
Why are we back to friends?

438
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,640
Didn't

439
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,160
everything we went through

440
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,640
mean anything?

441
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,960
But you didn't say anything just now.

442
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,280
She's your teacher!

443
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,600
I don't know if you want to

444
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,000
tell her our relationship.

445
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,640
If I said it...

446
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,280
So,

447
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,000
you just didn't say it.

448
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,720
Then,

449
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,080
you've missed this opportunity.

450
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,600
Now, you must confess to me,

451
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,160
and then pursue me seriously.

452
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,280
How do you want me to pursue you

453
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,480
and confess to you seriously?

454
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,000
Don't stop, you two.

455
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,600
Keep going!

456
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,480
What are you doing?

457
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,000
Doing my work for the Film Festival.

458
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,600
Well, your competitor.

459
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,360
Stop filming.

460
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,960
But,

461
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,240
there's no competitor!

462
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,240
I just participate in it for fun,
not for awards

463
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,400
Besides, I always join

464
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,360
the school's activities.

465
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,720
Do you need a leading lady?

466
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,536
There's no leading lady in my movie.

467
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:26,080
Why?

468
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,080
Because I'm making a documentary.

469
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,120
To capture the beautiful moments

470
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,880
and life at school.

471
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,480
And the name of my film is

472
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,760
"Lovely Campus".

473
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,400
Your thoughts?

474
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,480
Not bad, right?

475
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,640
But are you sure
you don't need a leading lady?

476
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,880
We've just worked together.

477
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,400
A pleasant collaboration, right?

478
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,240
Everyone is a protagonist in my film.

479
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,720
You two keep going.

480
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,720
I'll go filming.

481
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,840
Can I have a look?

482
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,640
Wait for the final cut, alright?

483
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,400
But just now, the scene of you two

484
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,760
was so lovely.

485
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,280
I've filmed on campus for days,

486
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,720
but never captured
such a beautiful scene.

487
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,000
Alright, see you.

488
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,720
Bye!

489
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,840
I didn't expect that
you made an appearance too.

490
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,880
Haven't been a director,

491
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,840
but a lead male, huh?

492
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,960
Stop teasing me.

493
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,960
Shouldn't we finish what we didn't?

494
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,600
What's that?

495
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,160
No, you have to confess to me in public.

496
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,080
Otherwise, don't even think about it.

497
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,240
(Binhai University Film Festival
Participant List)

498
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,600
Hello?

499
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,400
Are you sure you've

500
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,000
uploaded your film
to the campus website?

501
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,640
I uploaded it right after editing.

502
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,240
It took more than eight hours!

503
00:21:43,392 --> 00:21:44,080
What's wrong?

504
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,400
I'm checking for it right now.

505
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,880
I don't see it at all.

506
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,640
That's impossible.

507
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,480
No worries, I'll solve it.

508
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,600
Alright.

509
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
What happened?

510
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,080
Yu Lan said
she didn't receive my submission.

511
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,280
Maybe it's a network delay.

512
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,080
She said she'll find a resolution.

513
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,880
She is so nice to you.

514
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,480
Helping you solve your own issue.

515
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,000
Of course.

516
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,600
After all, we are

517
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,520
old friends since childhood.

518
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,600
You!

519
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,880
Alright, just kidding.

520
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,760
I'm joking.

521
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,360
It's all past things, just memories.

522
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,640
Just this once.

523
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,000
No more reminiscing!

524
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,600
I just remembered...

525
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,400
Don't interrupt me!

526
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,240
Okay.

527
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,080
As your teacher just said,

528
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,840
the time for your audition

529
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,160
is when the Film Festival opens.

530
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,080
So what to do?

531
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,280
How about

532
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,160
I call Ms. Zhao now and tell her

533
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,880
I won't go?

534
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
No, don't.

535
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,720
For making this movie,

536
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,400
you've missed the chance to Beijing

537
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,640
and even got injured.

538
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,720
I really don't want you
to miss this chance.

539
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,880
Then what about the Film Festival?

540
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,080
Look at these.

541
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,160
How long has it been?

542
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,600
This is all you've done?

543
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,080
Submission portal is about to close.

544
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,600
Are you going to compete by these?

545
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,640
I am from the Department
of Library Management.

546
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,080
I don't know how to film.

547
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,520
Isn't Li Yanhao from your department?

548
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,400
He's your classmate, isn't he?

549
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Why can he do it?

550
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Why can't you?

551
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,160
Are you missing an arm or a leg?

552
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,080
Or are you lacking in wit?

553
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,400
Where's your brain? Where is it?

554
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,960
I've done everything I can.

555
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,960
I'll pass.

556
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,080
Say it again.

557
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
Okay, you can quit.

558
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,360
Then, I'll let all teachers target you,

559
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
students ostracize you.

560
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,360
No peaceful life in campus.

561
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,640
With my relationships at school,

562
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,600
ruining your reputation

563
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,160
is a cinch.

564
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,720
It's up to you.

565
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,080
I quit.

566
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,480
Do whatever you want.

567
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,640
Let's see who wins in the end.

568
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,600
You've got guts.

569
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,120
Come in.

570
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,960
Kang, do you have a moment?

571
00:24:41,248 --> 00:24:42,400
I want to have a talk.

572
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,720
I'm free.

573
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,400
Then, now?

574
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,000
No problem.

575
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,480
Go back now, prepare it well.

576
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,240
There's no time left, okay?

577
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,880
Hurry up!

578
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:02,960
Yu Lan,

579
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,160
how was your holiday?

580
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,640
You seem to be in good mood.

581
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,160
Thanks to you,

582
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,600
stress-free.

583
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
Then you should really thank me.

584
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,720
This Film Festival

585
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,280
is progressing smoothly

586
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,160
and is about to open.

587
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,160
If you have time, you must come.

588
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,160
I'll save you a seat.

589
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:21,280
Here.

590
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,480
Oh, it's yours.

591
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,160
Then thank you, former president.

592
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,600
Oh, come on.

593
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,000
About your past contributions,

594
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,280
I really appreciate it.

595
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,960
Those are indelible.

596
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,760
I came here today

597
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,520
to ask about Li Yanhao.

598
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,720
Li Yanhao?

599
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,160
Oh, I remember now.

600
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,640
The one made a film to chase after you,

601
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,880
and then used it for the competition.

602
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,400
How can you speak of him like that?

603
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,480
Am I wrong?

604
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,000
Yu Lan.

605
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,000
You're a smart person,

606
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,600
I supported you
as the student union president

607
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,960
because I expected you
to follow my lead.

608
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,240
But now,

609
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,400
you are too independent.

610
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,840
Do you think you can handle all these

611
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,080
on your own?

612
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,600
So now,

613
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,120
you don't need to worry about these.

614
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,280
Just do your own part well.

615
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,520
Yu Lan.

616
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,160
You're still too green.

617
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,960
Actually, I had made my plan before.

618
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,160
In the early stages, I can't intervene,

619
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,840
so I let you handle all the things.

620
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,360
You did it very well.

621
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,840
Later, by some connections,

622
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,840
I expanded

623
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,000
the Film Festival
into a large-scale city-wide one.

624
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,960
Naturally, I became the organizer.

625
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,480
But I will bear in mind

626
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,120
your contributions.

627
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,280
I really appreciate it.

628
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,160
Fine, you've won.

629
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,600
But I beg you,

630
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,400
can you allow Li Yanhao to compete?

631
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,160
Why should I let him in?

632
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,360
Because his efforts need to be proven.

633
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,240
His mother, who just had surgery,

634
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,960
needs to see his work recognized.

635
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,280
What does it have to do with me?

636
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,840
You...

637
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,600
Alright.

638
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,720
I can let him participate.

639
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,080
But what can I get?

640
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,960
I have seen his work.

641
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,480
You'll get an outstanding contestant

642
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,840
who is very likely to
win awards for our school.

643
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,520
True.

644
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,960
I have seen his work.

645
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,600
Quite good, indeed.

646
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,480
But did you see the two guys just now?

647
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,240
Their works are terrible.

648
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,880
But through my management,

649
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,280
they could win awards anyway.

650
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,960
I want to support my own contestants.

651
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,160
All of this is just to target me,
isn't it?

652
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
Alright. You,

653
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,600
like before,

654
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,600
work as the president
in the student union.

655
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,840
The meeting room is yours now.

656
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,840
I am going to report to the principal.

657
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,480
President,

658
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,400
I heard your conversation just now.

659
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,280
I need to talk to you.

660
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,960
I have nothing to say to you.

661
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:16,960
Come in.

662
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,600
Principal, I'm sorry to disturb you.

663
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,960
Kang!

664
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,080
Have a sit.

665
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
I was looking for you.

666
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,960
Tell me, how is the Film Festival going?

667
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,760
I am here to report to you.

668
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,760
It's progressing very smoothly.

669
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,000
Many contestants
have submitted their works.

670
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,640
Our opening ceremony will be
on Saturday evening,

671
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,360
right after
the school's opening ceremony.

672
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,240
That soon?

673
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,080
Quite efficient.

674
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,160
Then, on the opening ceremony,

675
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,960
I can share this good news

676
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,720
with all the students.

677
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,360
Of course.

678
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,880
If you could

679
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,400
promote our Film Festival on it,

680
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,840
I would be grateful.

681
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,080
I also want to invite you

682
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,760
as the honorary president,

683
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,640
to give a speech to all

684
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,160
at our opening ceremony.

685
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,280
Am I the honorary president?

686
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,120
No problem. I'll come.

687
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,160
Principal,

688
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,400
do you have any further instructions?

689
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,960
By the way, Kang,

690
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,640
I trust your character and ability.

691
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,600
But this is the first time

692
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,840
that our school hosts
such a large-scale event.

693
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,840
It must be a success.

694
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,720
And it must be open, fair and impartial.

695
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,840
We can't lose fairness

696
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,760
because we are the host.

697
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,080
Principal, don't worry.

698
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,280
These judges

699
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,520
are all leaders I invited

700
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,720
from different universities.

701
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,080
It'll be fair, open, and impartial.

702
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,520
I see.

703
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,400
Then, if on this basis of fairness,

704
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,240
our school could win an award,

705
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,080
that would be even better.

706
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,240
Of course.

707
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,280
Understood.

708
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,720
No matter who wins at our school,

709
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,080
all the honor goes to you.

710
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,616
Don't.

711
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,160
Principal.

712
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,480
I'll bring the trophy to your office.

713
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,400
No.

714
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,840
Give it to the winner.

715
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,760
After all, it's their personal honor.

716
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,400
Of course.

717
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,000
But, if it can remain in my office
for a few days,

718
00:31:19,776 --> 00:31:20,400
it'd be better.

719
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,160
Understood.

720
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:22,880
Okay.

721
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,520
Then you go ahead.

722
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,720
Alright, sir.

723
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,280
No more bothering.

724
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,720
I'll report to you about our progress.

725
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,480
I'm leaving.

726
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,960
Where should I put this trophy?

727
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,160
Mom, I'm busy.

728
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
I'll call you later.

729
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,600
Ren Ze!

730
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,960
I didn't bring medicine

731
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,160
or be your model anymore,

732
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
so you don't come to me?

733
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,280
I've been a bit busy recently.

734
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,960
You haven't thanked me

735
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,600
for being your model last time.

736
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,600
Then I'll treat you to coffee.

737
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,840
I'm already drinking it.

738
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,280
How do you want me to thank you, then?

739
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,080
How about

740
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,360
treating me to a drink?

741
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,760
Looking for me?

742
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,160
Yes, I have something to tell you.

743
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,880
Huo Yue will be here soon.

744
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,840
Go ahead, how can I help you?

745
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,520
Call her and tell her not to come.

746
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,280
Eat this.

747
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,280
Why?

748
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,240
Turn around.

749
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,160
I can't say it while looking at you.

750
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,520
You're so weird.

751
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,640
Feng Xia,

752
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,600
I like you.

753
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
Always like you.

754
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,160
I really value your opinion.

755
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,160
I know

756
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,520
I lack the talent
and creativity to direct.

757
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,640
I make films as what Li Yanhao did

758
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,720
only because

759
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,720
you're interested in it.

760
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,120
I didn't expect

761
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,400
you misunderstood that I like Huo Yue.

762
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,240
Don't get me wrong.

763
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,600
I actually didn't expect anything.

764
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,280
I just wanted to tell you

765
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,960
my real thoughts.

766
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,960
Alright, I've done.

767
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,160
You can leave now.

768
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,600
Are you crazy?

769
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,840
Didn't expect anything?

770
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,000
Then why tell me all this?

771
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,160
Then what can I do?

772
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,960
Want to be my girlfriend?

773
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,280
In your dreams.

774
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,400
Then I'll go.

775
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,160
At least buy me an ice pop
that hasn't melted!

776
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,600
This one has already melted.

777
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
W-Wait for a moment.

778
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,840
I'll get you one.

779
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,360
Let's go together.

780
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,520
The most innocent in Binhai, that's you!

781
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:51,960
Xia!

782
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,280
There's a lot over there!

783
00:33:53,504 --> 00:33:56,128
(KCOFFEE)

784
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,400
Would you like something else?

785
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,720
Food doesn't matter.

786
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,080
Drinks matter.

787
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,960
Drinking needs a reason, right?

788
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,400
Then, wish your filming goes smoothly.

789
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,960
Wish your blind date goes well.

790
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,080
I wish you

791
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,120
to create your most satisfying painting!

792
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,680
I wish you rediscover your dreams.

793
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,080
I quit my job.

794
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,920
Why?

795
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,080
I've joined
an adult dance class in Beijing.

796
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,440
I plan to start from there

797
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,080
to realize my childhood dream of

798
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,080
painting with my body on stage.

799
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,840
You're not trying to avoid the date

800
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,080
by going to Beijing, are you?

801
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,680
What are you talking about?

802
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,520
It's for chasing my dream!

803
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,360
Come on.

804
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,680
To the two of us chasing our dreams.

805
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:48,920
Cheers.

806
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,680
Do you know why I

807
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,120
must resign and go to Beijing?

808
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,200
Isn't it for your dream?

809
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,200
There's another more important reason.

810
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,200
Because you dislike
the smell of disinfectant.

811
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,680
Meet me in Beijing after graduation.

812
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,680
Why are you here?

813
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,480
Why am I here?

814
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,520
The dormitory will soon close,
and you're not back.

815
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,600
That's why I'm here.

816
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,280
Why are you drinking my liquor?

817
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,200
Why can't I drink your liquor?

818
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Your treat then.

819
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,440
By the way,

820
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,680
I haven't asked you,

821
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,680
aren't you happy living in Beijing?

822
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,120
Why are you drinking here?

823
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,360
I shouldn't have gone.

824
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,440
Going there made me realize
what's a "frog in a well".

825
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,360
Beijing is full of people
better than you.

826
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,720
And I am

827
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,400
not even as good as you.

828
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,400
Look at you.

829
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,280
You have such a great talent.

830
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,640
Why go shoot the lousy film?

831
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,160
You're wasting your talent!

832
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,880
You think so too?

833
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,000
Listen, monitor.

834
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,160
Talent is not important.

835
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,400
I did all of this for my mom.

836
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,160
I've been dancing since I was five.

837
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,120
Every time I made a mistake,

838
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,840
she would whip me with a teaching stick.

839
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,400
I just don't understand

840
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,160
other parents
worry about their kids getting hurt,

841
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,080
but my mom? So ruthless.

842
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,640
So I always thought she didn't love me.

843
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,920
She only cared about how well I dance.

844
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,840
To be honest,

845
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,440
even now, I still dream about

846
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,160
her whipping me.

847
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,920
Actually, I'm quite envious of you.

848
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,160
My parents never supported me dancing.

849
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,640
They thought I had no talent.

850
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,120
Even my teacher thought the same.

851
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,640
But I refused to believe it.

852
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,840
I must prove them wrong by dancing.

853
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,880
Do you know how much I envy you?

854
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,440
Ms. Zhao always favors you.

855
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,160
But no one favors me like that.

856
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,440
Indeed, she is nice to me.

857
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,000
But let me tell you,

858
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,880
sometimes I'm scared of her,

859
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,400
because she always reminds me of my mom.

860
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,880
It's because both she and my mom

861
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,160
have high expectations of me.

862
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,160
That's why I've been working so hard.

863
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,920
I'm afraid

864
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,160
that they will be disappointed.

865
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,440
I'm afraid of letting them down.

866
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,360
But no one has ever asked me

867
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,160
what I really want.

868
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,920
Do you understand?

869
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,280
Isn't it me who's feeling sad?

870
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,840
Why are you also starting to feel down?

871
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,760
Jiatong.

872
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,640
Was it worth it to choose Li Yanhao?

873
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,400
Isn't that question childish?

874
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,400
Was dancing worth it for you?

875
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,520
I think,

876
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,880
no matter what the outcome is,

877
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,400
I feel happy now.

878
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,640
That's enough, right?

879
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,880
Dr. Wu has said,

880
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,280
your recovery is going well.

881
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,760
At this rate,

882
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,160
you can be discharged next week.

883
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,080
This time, we owe a lot to Doctor Wu.

884
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,640
He's such a skilled doctor.

885
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:10,880
By the way, son,

886
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,080
about that girl, Li something Tong?

887
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,160
- You two...
- Yeah.

888
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,160
I also think that girl is good.

889
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,640
It seems like she likes you too.

890
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,920
Be nice to her, alright?

891
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,400
Of course. I will.

892
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,160
Definitely. Our kid is kind-hearted,

893
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,160
always nice to everyone.

894
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,280
He's my son, after all.

895
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,000
But remember,

896
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,600
being nice is good,

897
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,400
but you must be mindful of propriety.

898
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
You know what I mean.

899
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,440
Moreover, don't neglect your studies.

900
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,880
Dad, don't worry.

901
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,160
Stop, please.

902
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
Do you really like her or not?

903
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:42,960
Of course...

904
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,640
Li Yanhao?

905
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,400
How do you know I'm here?

906
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,880
Xiao Rang told me.

907
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,920
Why are you looking for me?

908
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,280
Let's talk somewhere else.

909
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,160
What's it?

910
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,640
Just say it here.

911
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,160
Maybe you cannot

912
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,760
participate in the Film Festival.

913
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,160
Why?

914
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,920
Calm down.

915
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,160
How can I calm down?

916
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,440
Don't rush, let me think of a solution.

917
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,840
What solution?

918
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,160
I'll go ask Kang Yide!

919
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,680
Or I'll go to the principal!

920
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,760
Li Yanhao!

921
00:40:44,243 --> 00:40:46,272
(Student union)

922
00:40:50,611 --> 00:40:51,648
(Student Union Office)

923
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,080
You, a murder!

924
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,160
Principal Jiang!

925
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,960
Li Yanhao,

926
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,920
want to murder the principal?

927
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,440
No, no! I...

928
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,440
Hurry up and help him up!

929
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,120
Principal,

930
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,160
are you alright?

931
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,080
Be slowly.

932
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,600
Li Yanhao.

933
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,160
I know what you're here for.

934
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,640
For the film festival, right?

935
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,640
I was considering
letting you participate,

936
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,840
but look what you've done!

937
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,760
I will surely cancel your eligibility!

938
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,640
Well, I...

939
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,440
You just wait.

940
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,640
Principal,

941
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,840
