Yes.

40
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,280
Can you do it?

41
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,920
Sure.

00:01:53,856 --> 00:01:54,400

Come on.

You two are dawdling too much.

54
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,040
Does it have to be so troublesome

55
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,920
to test a camera?

56
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,360
You two have been standing here
for half an hour already,

57
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,760
doing nothing but babbling.

58
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,120
Let's just go in and test the camera.

59
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,760
Alright?

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,640
Besides,

61
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,760
you can't fight ten people.

62
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,200
Fine. Alright.

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,000
Let's test it.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,560
Right.

65
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,280
Hurry up.

66
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,856
Come on.

67
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,400

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,400
Come on.

70
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,040
Go for it.

71
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,920
Can you do it?

72
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
What's going on?

73
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,200
Everyone, come out.

74
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,040
I'll fight ten of you.

75
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,000
What are you doing?

76
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,680
I... I...

77
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,280
I said I want to fight ten of you.

78
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,200
What are you saying? I don't understand.

79
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,360
I said I want to fight ten of you.

80
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,200
Ten of what?

81
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
I'm cleaning up here.

82
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,560
I'm doing a thorough cleaning.

83
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,680
Come back in the afternoon, okay?

84
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
Sorry, ma'am.

85
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,280
How is it?

86
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,680
I don't know. See for yourself.

87
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,680
Ma'am.

88
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,480
Please rest if you've finished cleaning.

89
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,240
Since they're here to challenge,

90
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,520
let them come in.

91
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,280
W-We came to try out

92
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,080
the newly rented filming equipment

93
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,280
and to relive

94
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,680
the exciting scenes in the movies.

95
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,240
We meant to challenge no one.

96
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,280
Don't go. Since you are here,

97
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,040
have a round with me.

98
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
You are a girl?

99
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,280
It seems you have doubts.

100
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,360
Then fight with me.

101
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,760
I can't. I don't know how.

102
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,800
A man should not say he can't do it.

103
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,040
Just fight with her.

104
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,520
I will act as the cinematographer
first to familiarize myself

105
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,800
with the camera placement
and scheduling.

106
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,480
You familiarize... Wait.

107
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
Even if I knew how,

108
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,520
I couldn't fight a girl.

109
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,400
Come on.

110
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,080
Right.

111
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,960
This is the first time in your life that
you've had such close contact with a girl.

112
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,040
I have faith in you.

113
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,960
You can make her submit to you.

114
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,360
Go for it.

115
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,480
Then let's have a friendly fight.

116
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,240
What was your slogan again?

117
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
I'll fight ten of you.

118
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,120
You've started filming?

119
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Yes. Come on.

120
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,120
I'll fight ten of you.

121
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,960
Okay, you can try.

122
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,120
Help! Murder!

123
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,240
Useless.

124
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,560
You. You do it.

125
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,360
Do what?

126
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,560
Fight me.

127
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,680
I... I...

128
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,560
Listen to me.

129
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,152
Move aside.

130
00:07:21,152 --> 00:07:22,840
We're here
to test the filming equipment.

131
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
We... Let's go.

132
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,080
Stop!

133
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,680
- Dr. Zhou.
- Hurry up.

134
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
Is this really necessary?

135
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,560
- Dr. Zhou, give him a shot.
- Sit.

136
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,360
What shot?

137
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,960
I'm all better now.

138
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,800
What's happened?

139
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,960
When we were filming,

140
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,560
there was a small accident.

141
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,760
An accident?

142
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,480
You fought again, right?

143
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
Not at all.

144
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,360
We didn't fight.

145
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,960
We were filming a movie.

146
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,360
Look. We've got the camera here.

147
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,000
And the light.

148
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,800
Here.

149
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,400
Dr. Zhou,

150
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,240
give him a shot.

151
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,800
I really don't need a shot.

152
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,760
I'm all better now.

153
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,400
It's nothing.

154
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,200
Look.

155
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,760
Only medicine. No shots.

156
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,400
Did you hear that?

157
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
- Boring.
- Let me see.

158
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,520
It's nothing.

159
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,080
You've got guts, brat.

160
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,520
Daring to challenge her?

161
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,080
Her?

162
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,680
Ouch! It hurts.

163
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
What's with her?

164
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,840
You mean Gu Ran?

165
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,280
She's a junior in media.

166
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,960
She has good academic grades.

167
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,680
But she is more talented in sports.

168
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
So people say
she should major in sports instead.

169
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,160
You were kind of unlucky.

170
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Her aunt is the president
of the student union.

171
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,680
Her name is Yu Lan, I think.

172
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,240
Yu Lan?

173
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,880
Bro,

174
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,920
challenge her again tomorrow.

175
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,000
Are you insane?

176
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
No, I am not.

177
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,360
She's Yu Lan's niece.

178
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,560
I wouldn't do it
even if she were Yu Lan's daughter.

179
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,040
It will get me killed.

180
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,600
Go away.

181
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,240
You're right.

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,240
Alright. Done.

183
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,240
It'll be swollen for a few days.

184
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,120
Don't get beaten up again.

185
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,560
Did you hear the doctor's advice?

186
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,720
Okay.

187
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,680
Go by yourself.

188
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,480
Can you stop filming?

189
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,560
It's all your fault.

190
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,000
My handsome face is all ruined.

191
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,360
Does 'handsome'
have anything to do with your face?

192
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,120
Scram.

193
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
I have a question.

194
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,880
What's it like to be beaten up

195
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,720
by a girl?

196
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,440
Are you serious?

197
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,680
So, are we going tomorrow?

198
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,240
No.

199
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,720
Let me see how the filming is going.

200
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,320
Here.

201
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,120
What on earth is all this?

202
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,480
Well, I think it's pretty good.

203
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,560
Just speed up.

204
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,680
I have to return it soon.

205
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,360
Don't. I haven't finished filming yet.

206
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,440
Why return it already?

207
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,120
The rent is hundreds of yuan per day.

208
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Just hurry up.

209
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,680
If you return it, what can I use?

210
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,120
Renting this professional equipment

211
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,240
is just for you to practice.

212
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,800
But you don't have a script right now.

213
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,000
You don't know what to film.

214
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,560
Having such good equipment

215
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
is a waste to you.

216
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,680
First, think about
what you want to film.

217
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
You do make sense.

218
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,000
But what if I want to enhance my sense

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,880
of camerawork?

220
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,040
That's easy.

221
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,120
Film with your smartphone.

222
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,680
You said my phone was garbage.

223
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
You can use mine.

224
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,360
It's very affordable.

225
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,240
I'll only charge you ten yuan per hour.

226
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,120
But you have to pay.

227
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,680
Bro,

228
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,920
our phones are the same model.

229
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,040
Really?

230
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,680
How about this?

231
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,240
Just tinker

232
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,120
with the camera first.

233
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,240
I have things to do.

234
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,480
I'm going back to class.

235
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,480
I'm off.

236
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,240
- Bye.
- Bye.

237
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Don't look at me.

238
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,680
I won't go to her tomorrow.

239
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,600
If you do it,

240
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,680
I'll buy you lunch.

241
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,120
Then it better be a feast.

242
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,040
Of course.

243
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Let me think about it.

244
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,920
You look quite happy today.

245
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,480
Of course, I'm happy.

246
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,480
This morning,

247
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
I had a good release at the gym.

248
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,480
I don't get it.

249
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,040
What kind of feeling is the release
you're talking about?

250
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,880
A campus goddess
doesn't need to understand

251
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,480
our kind of release.

252
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
It gives a sense of conquest.

253
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,600
You were alone in the gym.

254
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,560
Who did you conquer?

255
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,560
This morning, in the boxing ring,

256
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,360
I knocked a guy to the ground.

257
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,920
That guy really had it tough.

258
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,040
Now thinking about it, he did.

259
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,680
By the way,

260
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,120
he had a friend by his side

261
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,920
filming with a camera.

262
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,480
I felt like I was in a real ring.

263
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,360
It felt so good.

264
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,560
Did you take a shower
after working out today?

265
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,360
I did.

266
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,480
I really did.

267
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,040
Have a smell.

268
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,360
Smell it.

269
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,360
Smell it. I really did.

270
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,800
I really did shower.

271
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,120
You're treating me to this?

272
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,800
Don't expect me to go tomorrow.

273
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,360
I'm running out of money.

274
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,480
Just eat what I gave you.

275
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,680
Let's eat in the canteen.

276
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,240
How can I go to the canteen
with my face like this?

277
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,040
That's true.

278
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,240
You couldn't even beat a girl.

279
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,560
Useless.

280
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,040
It's not that I couldn't beat her.

281
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,240
I was being a gentleman.

282
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,880
Besides, that girl...

283
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,240
Given her demeanor,

284
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,240
she doesn't look like a girl at all.

285
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,360
I think she's quite good.

286
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,600
And most importantly,
she's Yu Lan's niece.

287
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,800
So now you like anyone who's related

288
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,920
to Yu Lan, huh?

289
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:37,920
More or less.

290
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,800
Alright, you can fight her tomorrow

291
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
to get the same wound.

292
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,240
If she can bring me closer

293
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,120
to Yu Lan,

294
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,920
I'd be happy even if she beat me harder.

295
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,480
Fine.

296
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
How will you face Yu Lan

297
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,920
if she beats you into crap?

298
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,040
Come on. Look at me.

299
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,360
Li Yanhao.

300
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,920
Is this your new equipment?

301
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,040
Yes.

302
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,360
A handy tool

303
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
makes a handy man.

304
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,480
Having good equipment is essential

305
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,560
to making a good film.

306
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,240
He's Xiao Rang.

307
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,360
He is the cinematographer

308
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
in our movie.

309
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,360
It seems he's been injured.

310
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,240
It's thanks to her.

311
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,920
Next time you fight her,

312
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
you can do it together.

313
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,800
Don't say that.

314
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
What are you talking about? I...

315
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,120
We are men.

316
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,480
How could we bully a girl?

317
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,680
Men?

318
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,360
Skinny men, you mean?

319
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,040
Scrag.

320
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,480
Who are you calling scrag?

321
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,040
I think you're the scrag.

322
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,800
Dissatisfied?

323
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,920
How about this?

324
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,360
Let's fight in the ring tomorrow.

325
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,240
Or how about now?

326
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,168
I didn't get enough this morning.

327
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,920
Wait.

328
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,240
Don't try to conquer anyone in public.

329
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,680
Let's go to the canteen now.

330
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,600
By the way,

331
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,120
the Film Festival's
roadshow plan is ready.

332
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,680
If you're free, you can come and look.

333
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,800
Really?

334
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,240
When and where?

335
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,680
Come find me after class next Monday.

336
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,240
I'll take a look at what you've shot.

337
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,600
Okay.

338
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,680
Happy? Excited?

339
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,920
Blissful? Joyful?

340
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
Come on. Shout it out.

341
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,920
Happy, huh?

342
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
Yu Lan, I love you.

343
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,680
Yu...

344
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,320
Yu Lan wants to see me.

345
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,360
I heard her.

346
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,560
Invite her to a meal

347
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,480
and confess after it.

348
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,600
Buzz off.

349
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,800
I don't want to rush it.

350
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,800
But I want to use the opportunity

351
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,040
to do something big.

352
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,680
How big?

353
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,480
I'll make her a video.

354
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,680
I can't help you.

355
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,800
I'm injured.

356
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Do it yourself, Director.

357
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,480
I don't need you.

358
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,040
I'll start brainstorming now

359
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,920
and film it tonight.

360
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,240
Look at you, all smug.

361
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,920
Alright. Just brainstorm.

362
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,016
Where are you going?

363
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,560
Scram.

364
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,560
What are you doing?

365
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,120
I... Nothing.

366
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,680
You look so suspicious.

367
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,800
What are you up to?

368
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,680
I'm up to nothing.

369
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,240
I'm brainstorming about what

370
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
to film tonight.

371
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,240
What to film tonight?

372
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,120
Aren't you filming me?

373
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
Why are you everywhere?

374
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,616
I'm the leading actress in your film.

375
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,920
Who else would you want?

376
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,360
Right.

377
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,480
Y-You're going to eat, right?

378
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,040
Go now, or the food will be gone.

379
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,360
Hurry. Go eat.

380
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,440
I-I need a moment alone

381
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,800
to think about what to film.

382
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,360
Why are you so impatient?

383
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,000
Then stay here and brainstorm.

384
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,800
No food for you
if you come up with nothing.

385
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,480
Understood?

386
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,240
No food for you.

387
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,440
Why do you always take my food?

388
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,328
(Student Canteen)

389
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,480
Hello, Dad?

390
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,920
Yanhao,

391
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,920
Take a look at your mother's grace.

392
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,560
I don't need to look to know her grace.

393
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,680
Now take a look at my style.

394
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,440
Right.

395
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,360
Only you can capture my mom's grace.

396
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,240
See how my photography skills are.

397
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
I'm climbing up.

398
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,560
Be careful.

399
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,560
Yanhao.

400
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,240
How do I look?

401
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,040
Why aren't you in class?

402
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
My dear dad,

403
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
if I were in class,

404
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,680
could I take your call?

405
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,920
That's true.

406
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,120
Alright, Dad, I need to go.

407
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,920
Have a good time.

408
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,800
Be safe.

409
00:17:38,176 --> 00:17:39,104
(Houde Building)

410
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,080
Why didn't you stay where you were

411
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
but come over here?

412
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
You saw me?

413
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,440
I'm not blind.

414
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,720
The most important thing

415
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,720
about painting is to have a perception
of the surroundings.

416
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,320
You paint so well.

417
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,560
Actually, the first time I saw you,

418
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,600
I wanted to tell you

419
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
that I really appreciate
the spirit you have.

420
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,720
I mean, you are completely focused

421
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,600
when creating something.

422
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,920
That spirit is very charming.

423
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,720
And cool.

424
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,800
I've been creating something too.

425
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,800
I want to make a movie

426
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,600
to participate
in our school's Film Festival.

427
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,800
Now I'm working on the script.

428
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,800
I remember you're a student
in Library Management, right?

429
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,800
Then why do you want to make a movie?

430
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,080
I...

431
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,320
For a girl?

432
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,920
Sort of.

433
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,080
Boring.

434
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,200
When you are making this painting,

435
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,720
what's your inspiration?

436
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,200
I simply want to record my feeling
of boredom at this moment.

437
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,440
Impossible.

438
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,680
This painting clearly has a story.

439
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,480
Actually,

440
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,120
I want to build

441
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,200
an excellent team.

442
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,440
I think you're a good choice.

443
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,960
You want to hire me?

444
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,200
Is it costly?

445
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,840
What movie will you make?

446
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,120
I haven't decided.

447
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,720
I'm still brainstorming.

448
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,960
But I think,

449
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,560
with you on our team,

450
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,720
the shots we take
will definitely look amazing.

451
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,560
Only having good shots is useless.

452
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,600
You have to know what you want to film.

453
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,200
Yes, I know.

454
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,200
I just haven't figured it out yet.

455
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,440
I'm working on it.

456
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,960
Here is my advice.

457
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,560
Now, take your camera, go downstairs,

458
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,440
and start filming.

459
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,960
Film whoever you see

460
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,800
and whatever happens.

461
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
Just keep filming.

462
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
Then you'll figure out
what you want to film.

463
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,080
Why did I not think of that?

464
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,480
See? I told you.

465
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,040
You are the most indispensable

466
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,200
to our team.

467
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,440
Well,

468
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,680
we plan to hold

469
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,720
a script workshop after some time.

470
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,600
You can join us.

471
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,320
Look, now we have a director,

472
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,080
a producer,

473
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,600
a cameraman, and a leading actress.

474
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,840
We're missing you.

475
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,720
Once you're in,
our team will be complete.

476
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,920
What do you think

477
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,360
if I draw a unity
of heaven and man here?

478
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,440
What unity?

479
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,720
It's a man, without reservations...

480
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,360
And?

481
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,720
Merging with the world.

482
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Without reservations?

483
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,720
You mean, in a state of nature?

484
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,080
Yes, naked.

485
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,600
Right here?

486
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,480
If I agree to be your model,

487
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,840
you'll join my team, right?

488
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,720
It's a possibility.

489
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,080
Or maybe not.

490
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,600
You said it. No backing out now.

491
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
Forget it.

492
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,320
Not today.

493
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,320
I'm tired.

494
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,800
Bring your people
and find me in the studio tonight.

495
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,200
Really? Then, it's a deal.

496
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,960
Let's meet tonight.

497
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
Tonight. In the studio.

498
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,600
My face seems to hurt.

499
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,320
Does it still hurt?

500
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,480
No.

501
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,480
My hand seems to hurt.

502
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,200
Does it still hurt?

503
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,440
No.

504
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,600
What a miracle healer!

505
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,600
Can you cure a stomachache?

506
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,960
My punch will cure it.

507
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,440
Hello, Director.

508
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,960
Well, what are you filming?

509
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,480
I-I'm going to participate

510
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,120
in our school's Film Festival.

511
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,960
So I'm just filming
some footage randomly.

512
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,200
Why are you filming me?

513
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,736
Tut.

514
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,080
Director.

515
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,200
You are the pivot of our school.

516
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,200
How should I put this?

517
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,200
You're the backbone.

518
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,600
Really?

519
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Absolutely.

520
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,960
Then make sure you film me well.

521
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
Don't worry, Director.

522
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,320
I'll definitely capture
your imposing stature

523
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,960
and your proud demeanor.

524
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,200
Wait.

525
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,080
Why are you so eloquent today?

526
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,600
Director,

527
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,200
I'm sincerely grateful

528
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,960
for your leniency with my makeup exam.

529
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,600
Well,

530
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,560
helping you students to improve

531
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,360
is the duty of us teachers.

532
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,680
It's comforting that you could

533
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,080
pass the makeup exam this time.

534
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,240
This shows...

535
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,360
That your teaching works,

536
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,600
making me see the light.

537
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,600
You are indeed a teachable young man.

538
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,320
This shows...

539
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,480
That your guidance has helped me grow.

540
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,840
Director, please turn around.

541
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,720
Let me capture your majestic figure
from behind.

542
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,720
From behind?

543
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,096
From behind?

544
00:23:24,096 --> 00:23:24,720
(Principal's Office)

545
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,600
Majestic?

546
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,360
Director,

547
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,120
please strike a majestic pose for me.

548
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,360
Majestic?

549
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,080
Let me help you.

550
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,720
Look here.

551
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,960
Clench your fist to your chest
and lift your elbow.

552
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,960
Right, then extend
your whole leg forward.

553
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,720
Extend this leg.

554
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,360
That's right.

555
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,240
Director, you look too majestic
and cool like this.

556
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,600
Director, please lift up
your back leg a little.

557
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,200
My back leg?

558
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,440
Lift it up and hook it upwards.

559
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,080
The foot below.

560
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,600
Lift it up.

561
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
Lift it up. Up.

562
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,240
Director, you look so cool.

563
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,840
Hold it.

564
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,720
Majestic. Right.

565
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,448
Hold it. I'll give you some depth.

566
00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:56,960
Hurry.

567
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,840
Hold on.

568
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,840
Hold on.

569
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,320
I can't hold it for too long.

570
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,960
He fooled me again.

571
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,080
Bro,

572
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,360
what are you doing?

573
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,840
Sorry about that.

574
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,680
I wanted to film

575
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,960
a youthful campus movie.

576
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,840
And you looked so cool

577
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,840
when doing the pull-ups.

578
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,960
You want to film me?

579
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,080
How about this?

580
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,360
Race me around the sports field.

581
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,080
If you win, film me as you like.

582
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,720
What? Scared?

583
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
How could I be?

584
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,120
I'm not scared.

585
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,720

Of course.

Bro,

605
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,240
are you alright?

606
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,960
Bro, what's your department?

607
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,840
The sports department. Octathlon class.

608
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,200
By the way,

609
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,104
I'm the student union presenter.

610
00:25:55,104 --> 00:25:55,720
My name is...

611
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,480
Stop.

612
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,360
I don't want to know that.

613
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,680
Go ahead and run.

614
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,960
Run.

615
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,480
Let's go.

616
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,840
It's been almost two hours.

617
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,040
and you've been filming blindly.

618
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,040
Who are you exactly?

619
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,600
Wait.

620
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,480
Are you the Li Someone

621
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,080
who's attending the Film Festival?

622
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,960
How do you know?

623
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,040
I heard you mention it to your director.

624
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,240
You've followed me ever since?

625
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,840
Even earlier.

626
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,720
I've followed
since the time you disrupted

627
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,600
that couple's date.

628
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,480
Are you a freak?

629
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,840
Freak? No.

630
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,600
I'm not even interested in you.

631
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,440
You're filming me.

632
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,600
I am just discovering

633
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,960
interesting people and things

634
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,040
in the school

635
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,960
to find inspiration for my own work.

636
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,840
I'm interesting?

637
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,960
I find you kind of interesting.

638
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,360
Although we are rivals,

639
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,720
I still respect you.

640
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,480
What have you filmed of me?

641
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,200
You want to see?

642
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,440
Catch up to me and I'll show you.

643
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,200
Wait.

644
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,840
Catch...

645
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,080
I...

646
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,200
I feel dizzy.

647
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,480
You're here.

648
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,240
Where are they?

649
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,480
Xu Xiangdong is making money.

650
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,840
Xiao Rang is recuperating in bed.

651
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,840
Xu Xiangdong is clearly a money-grubber.

652
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,720
But what's with Xiao Rang?

653
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,960
Well, it's a long story.

654
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,200
Then let's drop it.

655
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,960
Anyway, I'm not interested
in either of them.

656
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,800
Why do you always snatch my food?

657
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,960
You can order another bowl.

658
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,840
One bowl is too much for me.
Half a bowl is good.

659
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,720
I'm full.

660
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,080
I'm still hungry.

661
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,720
Then order another bowl.

662
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,080
Forget it. I'm running out of money.

663
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,320
Sir.

664
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,720
Another bowl, please.

665
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,488
Alright.

666
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,440
No need.

667
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,840
You said you wouldn't order.

668
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,480
I won't let you starve.

669
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,960
Hadn't you taken mine,

670
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,960
I'd have been full.

671
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,240
What do you mean?

672
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,680
I even dislike others'.

673
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,560
I only take yours.

674
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,960
Thank you.

675
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,200
Eat up quickly.

676
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Then I'll start eating.

677
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,480
Right.

678
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,040
Meet someone with me later.

679
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,960
I won't go.

680
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,680
Why not?

681
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,440
Finally, your friends aren't around.

682
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,240
I want some time alone with you.

683
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,920
Why do you want that?

684
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,720
Let's go to Ren Ze's studio later

685
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,080
and talk about filming.

686
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,960
So you think our time

687
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,320
alone together is meaningless?

688
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,320
I think you are full.

689
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,080
Stop eating.

690
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,080
Are you Sun Wukong?

691
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,080
You are ever-changing.

692
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,840
No tissue for you.

693
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,480
Let's go eat.

694
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,960
Didn't you just eat?

695
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,320
I'll treat you, okay?

696
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,480
I've already promised
to go to Ren Ze's studio.

697
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,440
Xiao Rang and Xu Xiangdong
are not there.

698
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,040
There's no point for us to go.

699
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,720
Don't you agree?

700
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,440
You seem to make a point.

701
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,600
Then let's go eat.

702
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,720
You go. I'll go to the studio.

703
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,480
Stop.

704
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,200
I'm hungry no more.

705
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:28,960
Let's go.

706
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,240
I'd like to see
what charm Ren Ze possesses.

707
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,840
Wait.

708
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,320
It's as if you've been captivated.

709
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,200
Let me tell you some good news.

710
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,120
My personal art exhibition is on.

711
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,480
You can have a look.

712
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,200
Right.

713
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,840
I am different from you.

714
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,600
My father has refurbished

715
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,120
his art gallery a bit.

716
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,080
For the entire upcoming year,

717
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,320
it will showcase my personal works.

718
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,720
Even presented
on the most beautiful plate,

719
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,120
the crap's nature does not change.

720
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,240
Don't try to pretend.

721
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,080
If you're envious, say it out loud.

722
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,040
Ren Ze,

723
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,840
people with a stubborn mind like yours

724
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,960
are rare nowadays.

725
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,320
Tell me.

726
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,200
Even if it is crap, so what?

727
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,840
If we put it in a high-end place

728
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,320
and cook it in every possible way

729
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,080
before finally dressing it
with some side dishes,

730
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,040
I can guarantee

731
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,840
that people will praise it
to no end after having it.

732
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,360
In my opinion,

733
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,080
you should exhibit your paintings

734
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,200
in your father's bar.

735
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,840
They are all about naked men.

736
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,720
They're in sync with the bar's style.

737
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,480
I don't think dressing up crap

738
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,720
can make it tasty.

739
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,080
If you think so,

740
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,120
you're just right.

741
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,120
Let's make a bet.

742
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,720
My paintings will definitely sell out

743
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,440
within a month.

744
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,600
Then you will surely win.

745
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,120
On the last day,

746
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,960
your father
will buy all those paintings.

747
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,960
I will definitely beat you.

748
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,320
Let's see.

749
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,320
Go back for now.

750
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,720
I want some time alone.

751
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,360
Didn't we agree to discuss

752
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,600
our creations together?

753
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,960
I'm not in the mood now.

754
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,200
But I thought about your filmmaking

755
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
all afternoon.

756
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,960
I think you can start

757
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,960
by finding inspiration from life.

758
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,840
That's what I was thinking.

759
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,440
I filmed the entire afternoon.

760
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,040
Want to see?

761
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,840
Maybe another day.

762
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,320
I think your studio is pretty good.

763
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,080
Do you still need models?

764
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,720
I can model for you.

765
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,480
I have already booked him.

766
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,600
And you can't meet my requirements.

767
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,960
You can't do it.

768
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,600
Why can't I do it?

769
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,200
I have both looks

770
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,600
and good shape.

771
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,080
I can pose and kick too.

772
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,600
Which of your needs am I not meeting?

773
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,240
I paint nudes.

774
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,960
I can't do that.

775
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,720
Good for you.

776
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,720
Wait.

777
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,040
You agreed to let him paint you nude?

778
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,080
That's his precondition
for joining our team.

779
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,320
I've painted nudes before.

780
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,600
Where are they?

781
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:20,600
Where...

782
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,960
Don't snoop around.

783
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,600
He's busy.

784
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,480
We're leaving.

785
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,440
Wait. Wait a moment.

786
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,360
Let's make a deal.

787
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,480
Show me his nude painting.

788
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,840
And I'll find you a girlfriend.

789
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,720
- What girlfriend?
- The girls in our class

790
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,960
are all very beautiful.

791
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,528
Let's go.

792
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:31,800
- I mean it.
- Let's go.

793
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,840
Follow your heart's desires.

794
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,960
Start by filming the people around you.

795
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,600
Okay.

796
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,360
It's not important.

797
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,080
- The girls in our class...
- Just go.

798
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,600
(Follow my heart's desires?)

799
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,440
What's on your mind?

800
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,960
I'm thinking about what Ren Ze said
to me a few days ago.

801
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,560
He told me to film interesting people

802
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,200
and events around me.

803
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,920
I thought about it carefully
these few days.

804
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,960
But I've found no interesting events
or people around me

805
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,080
that I can film.

806
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,840
What should I film?

807
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,600
I think what he said
makes a lot of sense.

808
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,440
Look.

809
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,040
The best people and thing around you

810
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,960
is me.

811
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,240
Right?

812
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,320
Be careful.

813
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,960
Film now.

I don't know.

828
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,680
Be careful, my face.

829
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,680
Tell me.

830
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,160
Do you want to join
Beijing's training camp too?

831
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,600
I just picked up the parcel.

832
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,840
I want to see if it's useful.

833
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,880
Don't say that.

834
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,480
It could have been guessed with toes

835
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,840
that Ms. Zhao will definitely
let Li Jiatong go.

836
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,040
Her level

837
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,200
is way better than mine.

838
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,400
Have you no idea?

839
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,720
You have a lot of self-awareness, huh?

840
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,040
But I think

841
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,920
Ms. Zhao really likes Li Jiatong a lot.

842
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,640
I'm sleeping.

843
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,480
Keep it down.

844
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,400
Carry on.

845
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,640
So cool.

846
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,040
Thank you.

847
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,200
So cool.

848
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,080
Luckily, it was a dream.

849
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,800
What time is it?

850
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,720
He hasn't come back yet?

851
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,040
He's not back.

852
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,640
Just knock on the door and go in.

853
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,880
It's late.

854
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,800
If I do that,
the dorm manager will scold me.

855
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,080
Where will you go in a bit?

856
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,720
I'm a big guy.

857
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,240
I can handle staying out for a night.

858
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,200
That's great. I envy you so much.

859
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,880
If I go back now,

860
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,240
I'll be reported to the school.

861
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,240
That's too much.

862
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
They'll also report you

863
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,600
if you don't return at night.

864
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,720
If I don't go back,
the manager won't find out.

865
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,080
And my roommates

866
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,240
will definitely cover for me.

867
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,680
If I go back, the manager will know.

868
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,880
So what's the plan?

869
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,160
You won't go back?

870
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,720
I can't go back.

871
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,080
