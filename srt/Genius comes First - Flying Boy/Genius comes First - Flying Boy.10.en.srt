00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,800

lie down and sleep on the sofa.

Jiatong,

51
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,920
we've already paid this money.

52
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,040
What a waste that we leave.

53
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,400
A pity?

54
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,360
You can go back.

55
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,680
There are snacks and a sofa.

56
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,680
You can sleep.

57
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,680
Don't say that.

58
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,400
If I go back,

59
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,040
where can you go so late at night?

60
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,920
You actually want to go back?

61
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:50,040
No.

62
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
Why do you care where I go?

63
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,840
Wait.

64
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,360
Without me,

65
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,920
what if you run into bad people?

66
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,520
Right?

67
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,920
All you care about
is whether I run into bad people?

68
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,760
There's nothing else?

69
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,840
What else?

00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,920

71
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,040

72
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,840
We can't stroll

73
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,920
on the road all night.

74
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,280
I'm tired.

75
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,040
I'll stay here.

76
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,920
I won't go anywhere.

77
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,000
This is the road.

78
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,400
What if a car comes over?

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,920
You will... Right?

80
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,200
Plus, it's cold at night.

81
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,120
I'm not wearing much.

82
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,640
I can't

83
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,760
magically produce a coat

84
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,640
for you to wear
like the male lead in a movie.

85
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,200
Wait.

86
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,200
Don't you have hands
if you have no coat?

87
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,400
What should I do?

88
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,120
How about I do some Qigong for you?

89
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,360
Why would I ever know a fool like you?

90
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,480
Where are you going?

91
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,048
I...

92
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,480
Why do you even care?

93
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,400
Don't be mad.

94
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,120
Right?

95
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,000
Stop following me.

96
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,640
We can talk.

97
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,360
Any issues can be solved.

98
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,000
Come in.

99
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
Why not mention this great place sooner?

100
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,000
We had nowhere else to go.

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,920
That's why we're here.

102
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,120
This place is good.

103
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,840
Don't stop it.

104
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,040
They are Mr. Feng's treasures.

105
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,560
If you break them, he won't spare me.

106
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,000
I won't touch them. I'll just look.

107
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,560
You can use the laptop.

108
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,680
I'll go to sleep now.

109
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,640
Okay.

110
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,680
Chat with me for a while.

111
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,960
Aren't you sleepy?

112
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,400
I can talk when I'm sleepy.

113
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,240
Then let's chat.

114
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,240
Why do you make a movie?

115
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,680
For a dream.

116
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,680
How did you know my nickname is 'Dream'?

117
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,640
Right.

118
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,240
For the dream of my childhood.

119
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,680
You have a conscience.

120
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,920
Daring to argue with me?

121
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,800
(Comments)

122
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,640
Take this.

123
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,360
Keep it down. I'm going to sleep.

124
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,080
Alright, I'll keep it down.

125
00:05:22,644 --> 00:05:23,456
(Each person understands the film

126
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,256
(After reading your comment,
I find you very insightful.)

127
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,080
She's pretty from all angles.

128
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,520
It's a pity

129
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,680
that she is noisy.

130
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,520
Where are you going?

131
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
I'm hungry. I'm going to buy some food.

132
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,920
How about
buying two bottles of wine too?

133
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,680
He's sleeping so soundly.

134
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,960
He must have been tired.

135
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,240
Wake up.

136
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,120
Who are you?

137
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,520
I-I am Li Yanhao.

138
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,760
And s-she...

139
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,800
Where is she?

140
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,800
Tell me honestly.

141
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,120
How did you get in?

142
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,920
I have checked just now.

143
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,680
Our company
is missing many valuable items.

144
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Look at the camera.

145
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Confess now.

146
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Wait... what is all this?

147
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,680
I... I am not a thief.

148
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,800
Li Jiatong brought me here yesterday.

149
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,120
Don't you know Li Jiatong?

150
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,920
Who is Li Jiatong?

151
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,040
I don't know Li Jiatong.

152
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,680
How could that be? I'm not...

153
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,560
Alright, Mr. Feng.

154
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,920
Stop teasing him.

155
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
Let me tease him a bit.

156
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,360
Give it to me.

157
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,240
Tell me.

158
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,360
Why did you film me sneakily last night?

159
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,360
I thought you looked pretty.

160
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,680
You did think so?

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's more like it.

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,040
Let me introduce them.

163
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,800
They're the people that we film with.

164
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,480
Mr. Feng.

165
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,920
Big Head.

166
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,920
Blackie.

167
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,040
And he is...

168
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Li Yanhao, right?

169
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,800
He caused trouble last time.

170
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,440
Right.

171
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,880
We all know him.

172
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,120
We all know the thing

173
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
between you two.

174
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
What thing between us?

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,120
Alright, don't stand there.

176
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,800
Let's go.

177
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,480
Where to?

178
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,720
Back to school.

179
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,560
We stayed at Mr. Feng's for a night.

180
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,600
They still have to work.

181
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,440
Don't disturb them.

182
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,320
Mr. Feng,

183
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,040
your equipment here

184
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,800
is impressive.

185
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,440
Alright.

186
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,160
Come over and talk with us
when you have time.

187
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,160
Definitely.

188
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,040
Bye.

189
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,800
Bye.

190
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,440
- Bye.
- Let's go.

191
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,040
Take care.

192
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,560
Let's work.

193
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,000
Come on. Let's work.

194
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
Why walking so fast?

195
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,120
I won't walk with you.

196
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,800
Why?

197
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,240
You embarrassed me.

198
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,160
How have I embarrassed you?

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,440
Enough. I have class in the morning.

200
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,128
I'm off.

201
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,560
What's with her?

202
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Who knows?

203
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,120
Is she sick?

204
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Who's sick?

205
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,240
Where did you go last night?

206
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,120
Don't ask.

207
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,920
She's in a bad mood again.

208
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,120
Lu.

209
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
What happened?

210
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm fine.

211
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,720
How can you be fine?

212
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,560
You're sitting here all by yourself.

213
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,920
Are you in a bad mood?

214
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,920
It's nothing.

215
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,920
Tell me.

216
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,360
Where did you go last night?

217
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,000
I stayed out too late last night.

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,120
So I spent the night
at Mr. Feng's studio.

219
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
Alone?

220
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,320
Yes, alone.

221
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,320
The dorm manager didn't find out, right?

222
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,000
She found out.
You're in for a deduction.

223
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,800
I don't believe that.

224
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:28,832
(In the open interval)

225
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,000
Stop.

226
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,560
If you're one minute late again,

227
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,320
I'll mark you as absent.

228
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,120
Please don't.

229
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,360
Anything but that.

230
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,680
You've got the nerve to say that.

231
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,800
You think everything is fine now

232
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,320
as you passed the makeup exam?

233
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,240
No.

234
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,160
The final exam is coming up right away.

235
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,000
The fate

236
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,240
of us all is in your hands.

237
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,320
Glib-tongued.

238
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,560
Sit down.

239
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,920
Thank you.

240
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,320
Next, we'll learn
about setting functions.

241
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,120
You're back.

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,232
Where were you last night?

243
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,240
Makeup class.

244
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,880
Makeup class?

245
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,240
What makeup class?

246
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,120
At midnight?

247
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
About how to sleep?

248
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,360
I expected better out of you.

249
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
What exactly did you do?

250
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,480
I stayed with Li Jiatong

251
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,360
at her friend's studio all night.

252
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,160
You stayed

253
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,560
with Li Jiatong in a hotel?

254
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,560
Are you deaf?

255
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,800
Her friend's studio.

256
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,560
Just the two of you?

257
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,920
A man and a woman stayed alone

258
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,120
for one night?

259
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
What did you two do?

260
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,440
Nothing. I just...

261
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,560
She lay on the sofa when we arrived.

262
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,000
And then?

263
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,560
It has nothing to do with you two.

264
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,920
And then?

265
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,880
You...

266
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,920
Then the two of us
drank a bottle of wine.

267
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,360
And then?

268
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,560
And then she continued
to sleep on the sofa.

269
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,440
Then what did you do?

270
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,680
I used the laptop.

271
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,240
Get out if you won't study.

272
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,920
You played the laptop all night?

273
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
You spent last night

274
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,120
with Li Jiatong outside.

275
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,720
I wonder how you'll face Yu Lan.

276
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,480
Shut up and focus on your study.

277
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,440
It's on the house.

278
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,600
Thank you, ma'am.

279
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,120
How is it? Is the food good?

280
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
It's tasty and plentiful.

281
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
And clean.

282
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,000
Alright, enjoy it.

283
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,240
Thank you, ma'am.

284
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,000
Nothing happened
between you two last night?

285
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,440
I've been telling you.

286
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,920
Nothing happened between us.

287
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,240
Nothing happened.

288
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,880
Come on.

289
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,920
You two were alone.

290
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,920
And nothing happened?

291
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,800
I'm no fool, alright?

292
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,720
Don't lie to me.

293
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,440
You're a fool to me.

294
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,160
I...

295
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,800
How did the filming go?

296
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,360
Let me see.

297
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,880
It's pretty good.

298
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,120
The filming went well.

299
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,440
I'll take the camera.

300
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,720
Don't. I haven't finished yet.

301
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,880
I promised to return it

302
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,920
in the afternoon.

303
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,240
Each extra day costs extra money.

304
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,560
Extend the rental.

305
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,920
We have money in the movie fund.

306
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,560
Exactly.

307
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,920
We do. But as I've said,

308
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,120
the official filming
will definitely cost more.

309
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,920
Take us with you to earn money then.

310
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,880
You said it.

311
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,360
No backing out, okay?

312
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,560
I got a good gig moving today.

313
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,800
You two can join me.

314
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,560
I'm off.

315
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,560
By the way, are there only two

316
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,720
of you in your dorm?

317
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,480
Then I can move in to live there.

318
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,240
Nothing.

319
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,160
I'm leaving.

320
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,040
Wait.

321
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,360
When is our creation meeting?

322
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,040
We can start it at any time.

323
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,040
Recently,

324
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,480
I've taken on several big jobs.

325
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll take you to make money.

326
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,040
As long as the script is ready,

327
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,120
let's start filming.

328
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,720
Okay.

329
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,560
I'm off. Eat more.

330
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,800
Both of you, eat more, okay?

331
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,320
You never leave empty-handed.

332
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,240
Isn't making money enough for him?

333
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,800
Are you sure
nothing happened last night?

334
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
You must have
some sort of serious illness.

335
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,560
Should I take you to a doctor?

336
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,560
She is here.

337
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,240
Have you two finished eating?

338
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,800
Sure. It's already late.

339
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,680
Why are you so late?

340
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
We were rehearsing.

341
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,360
We just came to grab some food.

342
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,320
Why are you so concerned?

343
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,880
A lot of bonding seems
to have happened over the night.

344
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,360
Shut up.

345
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,000
It's okay. It's all in the past now.

346
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,720
Where's Zirou?

347
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,160
What? You miss her?

348
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
I...

349
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,160
During our rehearsal this afternoon,

350
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,560
you can come and watch.

351
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
You have a rehearsal?

352
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Let's go watch it.

353
00:15:57,216 --> 00:15:57,800
You go ahead.

354
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,000
I have things to do later.

355
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,560
Yeah, you are a busy person.

356
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,680
You don't have time
to watch our rehearsal, right?

357
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,360
Alright, let's not be in the way here.

358
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,560
Let's go.

359
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,360
Okay.

360
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,440
Li Yanhao, you...

361
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,360
You really are heartless.

362
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,240
Do you have some serious illness?

363
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,800
Why always mention the worst?

364
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,880
Go watch the rehearsal.

365
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,800
Don't bother me here.

366
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,320
Get lost.

367
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,120
I'm not going.

368
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm not going if you're not.

369
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,160
You weren't convinced.

370
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
Why not fight me again?

371
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,920
He was busy this morning.

372
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,240
I was accompanying him outside.

373
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,480
R-Right, in the morning,

374
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,560
I-I had things to do.

375
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,000
Lift up your head.

376
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,440
Lift it up.

377
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
You're actually handsome.

378
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,440
But still a weakling.

379
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,680
Me? A weakling?

380
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,800
Wasn't I a scrag yesterday?

381
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,080
Why am I a weakling today?

382
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,320
I can't be both.

383
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,320
Aren't you both?

384
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,200
What do you mean?

385
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,320
What? Not satisfied again?

386
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,120
So what if I am?

387
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,680
Fine, fight me again this afternoon.

388
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,320
Let's fight then.

389
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,320
Go.

390
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Fight now.

391
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,320
Come on.

392
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,800
Maybe no.

393
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,920
I might as well wait for my aunt.

394
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,440
Yu Lan is coming?

395
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,600
She should already be downstairs.

396
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,560
What does Yu Lan usually like to eat?

397
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,920
I'll help to order a portion for her.

398
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,040
They're about to sell out everything.

399
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,680
I'll go take a look.

400
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,080
Is he sick?

401
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,320
Thanks to your aunt.

402
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,200
Ma'am.

403
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,680
You're busy?

404
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,440
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

405
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,320
What is it?

406
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
Could you make some more food for me?

407
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,960
There's nothing left. What do you want?

408
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,840
What do you have?

409
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,600
Make something you're good at. Okay?

410
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,200
Please.

411
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,080
Clean this table for me.

412
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,440
I'll make some food for you.

413
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,840
Okay, thank you, ma'am.

414
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,680
Where are they?

415
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:41,920
They left.

416
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,440
What?

417
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,440
Yu Lan came just
to look for the boxing champion.

418
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,200
All yours now.

419
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,080
I won't eat.

420
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,840
By the way,

421
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,600
Yu Lan wants to see you
in the afternoon.

422
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,320
Really?

423
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,960
If you lie to me, I'll kill you.

424
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,080
Why would I lie to you?

425
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,600
You're crazy.

426
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,920
Big artist,

427
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,320
hurry up and paint.

428
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,320
Can't you see the model is pretty tired?

429
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,440
Isn't he hired to do this?

430
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,320
Yes.

431
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,200
Big artist,

432
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,720
you produce fine work out of slow work

433
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,200
and pay attention to every detail.

434
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,600
Buddy,

435
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,680
hang in there.

436
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,440
Leave if you're done here.

437
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,440
Don't bother me.

438
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
You can rest now.

439
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,840
Work out.

440
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,840
Being a model
when not as muscular as I am?

441
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,600
Is that skinny

442
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,320
and mean person your classmate?

443
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,920
He's so mean and annoying.

444
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,320
Why don't you give him a beating?

445
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,720
Like the way you beat me before?

446
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,320
I was disciplining the younger.

447
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,200
Fine.

448
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,560
Then next time,
I'll also whip him with a belt.

449
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,960
That's my son.

450
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,080
We don't share the same surname.

451
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,840
Listen.

452
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,960
You've taken your mom's surname,

453
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,320
but you're still my son.

454
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,080
What do you need?

455
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,840
I woke up

456
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,440
and went out for some exercise.

457
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,320
I want to invite you for breakfast.

458
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,720
I'm not free now.

459
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,080
I'll wait

460
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,720
until you're free.

461
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,720
It's embarrassing
when you met Yu Lan alone last time.

462
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,200
But don't be afraid or fret.

463
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,440
Success is born from failure.

464
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,320
A man must become braver
with every setback.

465
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,920
Last night you spent

466
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,320
a night alone with a girl.

467
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,840
Now you are reborn
and completely transformed.

468
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,200
You're no longer who you were.

469
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,440
Now you're a mature man.

470
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,480
What you need to do

471
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,600
is to show Yu Lan

472
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,200
the charm of your mature masculinity.

473
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,600
Start with the topic of movies,

474
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,800
and then muster your courage
and confess to her.

475
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,080
Go on, my brother.

476
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,840
This afternoon, I will defeat Gu Ran.

477
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,840
You'll win over Yu Lan.

478
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
Wish the two of us...

479
00:21:56,947 --> 00:21:57,320
(Knight)

480
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,680
Good luck!

481
00:21:58,995 --> 00:22:01,536
(No noise allowed)

482
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,720
We're waiting for you. Take a seat.

483
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,320
Sit over there.

484
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,440
This is the student union's

485
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,840
former president, Kang Yide.

486
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,600
And this is An Ran,
a member of the student union council.

487
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,920
She's in charge of many things
for the Film Festival.

488
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,720
These are all participants
in the Film Festival this time.

489
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,680
He is also one of the participants.

490
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,440
Mr. Li, right?

491
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,840
He's on the registration list.

492
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
I'm Li Yanhao.

493
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,960
I know.

494
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,200
When you registered,

495
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,800
why didn't you use your real name?

496
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,480
At that time, I was thinking...

497
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,200
Alright, I have things to do in a bit.

498
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,080
Let's get started quickly.

499
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,960
The roadshow promotional plan

500
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,080
for the Film Festival
you mentioned to me before

501
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,960
is quite good.

502
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,600
It can both promote among students

503
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,320
and urge the school

504
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,720
to quickly approve our proposal.

505
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,840
I called you over to have a look

506
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,920
at what could be changed in this plan.

507
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,800
But now there's no need to look anymore.

508
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,440
Just now, Kang told us that the school

509
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,960
has approved our proposal,

510
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,080
and the time is set.

511
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,720
It'll be the first week
after the summer.

512
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,960
The time is set?

513
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,200
That's good.

514
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,200
They approved

515
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,320
entirely because of me,
the former president.

516
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,600
So you must all do well.

517
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,840
Don't worry, Kang.
You've been so supportive.

518
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,320
We will definitely work even harder.

519
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,200
So we won't
do the promotional roadshows?

520
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,960
Why do roadshows
when the school already supports us?

521
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,720
Besides,
with the school management's support,

522
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,200
all students from our department
and faculty will attend.

523
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,600
So we don't have to worry

524
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,680
about not having participants
sign up anymore.

525
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,720
It's all thanks to Kang.

526
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,080
I did it for Yu Lan.

527
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,080
It's the first key event she organizes

528
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,960
since she became president.

529
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,440
As the former president,

530
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,600
I will certainly provide support.

531
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,960
Thank you, Kang.

532
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,960
You're welcome.

533
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,960
You said he is also a contestant, right?

534
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,080
Li Yanhao.

535
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,720
Then tell us about your movie.

536
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,200
I...

537
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,920
I'm just making a short movie.

538
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,080
What genre?

539
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,960
I haven't decided yet.

540
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,720
What content?

541
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,600
Not decided either.

542
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,720
What equipment will you use?

543
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:23,960
I have it.

544
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,200
I rented the equipment.

545
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,440
It's quite expensive.

546
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
It's 1... 1080P.

547
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,080
It...

548
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,720
It was already obsolete ten years ago.

549
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,960
We are now using all high-tech devices.

550
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,680
Now even a decent phone

551
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,800
can film better than yours.

552
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,600
Yes, indeed.

553
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,840
You couldn't sell it
for even a few hundred yuan.

554
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,080
I know

555
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,720
it has been outdated for a long time.

556
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,320
I was thinking that if I could

557
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,560
film something good with it,

558
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,840
surely I could film better
with a better device.

559
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,600
Making a good movie is the key.

560
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,200
The equipment doesn't matter.

561
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,960
Let's welcome other participants

562
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,200
to share their thoughts too.

563
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,200
My teacher lent his professional camera

564
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,040
to me.

565
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,840
He said the lens is particularly good.

566
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,800
I think roadshows are useless.

567
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,560
Now that the school is so supportive,

568
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,840
all students know the event.

569
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,080
I want to create a love story.

570
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,440
A story about a boy chasing a girl.

571
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,840
Our department gave a special grant
of tens of thousands

572
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,960
to support our participation
in the Film Festival.

573
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,960
Your department is so rich.

574
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,200
Wait.

575
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,320
They said this thing

576
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,680
isn't even worth a few hundred?

577
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,080
Alright, they dared to deceive me.

578
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
I'll go argue with them.

579
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,440
Xiao Rang,

580
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,600
tell me,

581
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,080
what's the point of me doing this?

582
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,720
Come on. Turn around.

583
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,200
- What?
- You've changed, Li Yanhao.

584
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,600
Ever since you met Yu Lan,

585
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,720
you've changed completely.

586
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,600
How have I changed?

587
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,200
You've become foolish.

588
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,440
Where's your confidence

589
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,600
and tenacity?

590
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,320
I don't know.

591
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,320
How about

592
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,720
not making the movie?

593
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,960
Fine, let's not make it.

594
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,840
You should stop me.

595
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,320
What should I stop you?

596
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,440
We've been friends for long.

597
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,600
Whenever you act,

598
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,720
I always support you.

599
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,840
But now I really don't know

600
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,360
what the purpose is of doing this.

601
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,960
Then why did you want to do this

602
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,840
in the first place?

603
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,600
I...

604
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,440
I wanted Yu Lan to see my talent.

605
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,080
Come on.

606
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,600
You watched more movies than others

607
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,840
and wrote some reviews online.

608
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,720
And you think you have talent?

609
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,080
You are just an internet troll.

610
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,200
And to win over Yu Lan?

611
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
She's beyond your reach.

612
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,440
You overestimate yourself.

613
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,560
But you must finish making the movie.

614
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,960
First of all,

615
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,720
you can't retreat
because of such a small setback,

616
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,320
right?

617
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,800
Secondly, you don't have the talent,

618
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,320
yet you want to pursue Yu Lan.

619
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,600
So what do you need?

620
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,440
What do I need?

621
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,320
Persistence.

622
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,320
And your shameless tenacity.

623
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,320
Through my recent encounters
with Yu Lan,

624
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,680
I found that she's far different
from the one

625
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,200
I pictured in my mind.

626
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,320
That means you've matured, bro.

627
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,960
In this process,

628
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,320
you've slowly come to know

629
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,840
what you truly want, right?

630
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,080
Even if it's not for Yu Lan,

631
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,600
finish making the movie

632
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
for your own growth.

633
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,320
That makes sense.

634
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:37,840
Right?

635
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,320
When did you become so smart?

636
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,440
Turn around.

637
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,800
Got beaten up again?

638
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,440
You have failed.

639
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,600
Can I bear to succeed alone?

640
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,080
How is it? Feeling better?

641
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,960
What you said isn't very pleasant.

642
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,440
But talking to you
has made me a lot happier.

643
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,080
It seems that relying on me alone

644
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,080
is still not enough.

645
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,600
You need a girl to keep you company.

646
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,320
What girl?

647
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,200
The girl is here.

648
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,560
Have a good chat.

649
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,840
You faced setbacks in the student union?

650
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,600
Yes.

651
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,320
I faced setbacks
in the student union today.

652
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,720
Li Yanhao,

653
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,960
do you know why I

654
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,720
must be the leading actress
in your movie?

655
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,320
Actually...

656
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,440
Stop. Knowing it is enough.

657
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,440
No need to say it.

658
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,080
Don't overthink.

659
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,440
I won't overthink either.

660
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,200
I am just thinking
that since I've already signed up,

661
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,680
I will do my best to film well.

662
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,320
That's right.

663
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,200
And make sure you film me beautifully.

664
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,440
Don't worry about it.

665
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,080
Hey.

666
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,200
Here's your device.

667
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,440
What device? Do I know you?

668
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,800
Take the device
and give me back my deposit.

669
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,200
You mean I collected your deposit?

670
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,200
Where's the receipt?

671
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,440
You didn't give me a receipt.

672
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,840
Besides, you rented it to me

673
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,440
at a price of two hundred yuan a day.

674
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,560
Return the deposit to me.

675
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,440
That's because you were blind.

676
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Listen up now.

677
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,680
There is no deposit.

678
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,080
Now take this crappy device

679
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,960
and scram quickly.

680
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:27,960
Wait.

681
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,200
Kid, listen up.

682
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,200
Open your eyes wide in the future.

683
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,560
Don't always get fooled.

684
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,920
Fine. Good for you.

685
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,960
The food is good, huh?

686
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,960
Let me add something.

687
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,480
Stop.

688
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,680
- Stop there.
- Stop.

689
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
Stop right there, brat.

690
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,320
Stop now.

691
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,320
I don't believe it.

692
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,960
I, a grown man,

693
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,600
can't win against you?

694
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:06,624
(Girls' Dormitory)

695
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,080
We've arrived. Hurry back to your dorm.

696
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,960
What will you do if I go back?

697
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,800
I-I'll go back to my dorm.

698
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
I didn't sleep well.

699
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
I need to sleep well.

700
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,720
You should also rest well.

701
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,560
Well...

702
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,960
Thinking of not returning again?

703
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,320
No one will cover for you tonight.

704
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,320
Alright, let's go.

705
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,480
Bye.

706
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,200
Bye.
