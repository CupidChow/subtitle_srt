Call us anytime you need us.

66
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,840
Next time I want a nude painting.

67
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,840
Pay extra.

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,080
No problem.

00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,080
Is this painting of us three?

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,240
Do we three look like this?

Don't speak nonsense.

72
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,480
This is art.

73
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,120
Look at the blank space,
the composition,

74
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,960
and the shadows.

75
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,360
So amazing.

76
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,240
Don't talk nonsense.

77
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,240
We are leaving.

78
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,240
Don't. I want to see

79
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,960
a little longer.

80
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,760
Let's leave.

81
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,960
I have things to do.

82
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,560
Go change clothes.

83
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,120
Are you really going
to be a nude model for him?

84
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,240
I'm just asking.

85
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,520
Do you think I would do that?

86
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,520
There is a bottom line to making money.

87
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,560
But he said he'd pay extra.

88
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,480
So what?

89
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,400
I can be undressed,

90
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,360
but I have to wear the underwear.

91
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,360
How much did we make?

92
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,040
300 yuan.

93
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,360
The money we've made is all with you.

94
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,560
You must keep it safe.

95
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680

96
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,080

00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,960
Rest assured.

98
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,120
I am a professional producer.

99
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
Keep working hard.

100
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,960
We could start filming soon.

101
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,760
Where has Xiao Rang gone?

102
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,240
He's been gone for such a long time.

103
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,680
Such a long time,

104
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,240
anything happens to him?

105
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,680
Look at the way he was,

106
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,480
he might not carry the tissue.

107
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,120
Then he could give us a call.

108
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,120
He might not carry a phone either.

109
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,760
Are you here to be nude models?

110
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,360
Please call us gentlemen
who dedicate themselves to art.

111
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,120
I don't care.

112
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,760
A man in the restroom without tissue

113
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,480
can't come out.

114
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,080
I remember

115
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,280
I have something to do.

116
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,240
Well, meet at the bar at 8 PM.

117
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,080
I'm leaving.

118
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,080
(Library)
Any better?

119
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,520
So numb.

120
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,840
I'll rub them.

121
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,240
Are you sick?

122
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,840
Any better?

123
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,120
- Let's go.
- Not at all.

124
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,800
How dare you! It's all your fault.

125
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,280
I've been waiting for you to come.

126
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,840
My left leg went numb,

127
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,080
and my right leg went numb too.

128
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,400
Now both my legs are numb.

129
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:21,960
Carry me back.

130
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,080
Don't blame me on this.

131
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,360
It's your fault for going
to restroom without the tissue.

132
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,240
At that time, all my willpower

133
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,960
was concentrated on my buttocks.

134
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,120
I couldn't care about the tissue thing.

135
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,480
Well,

136
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,760
now put all your willpower

137
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,240
on your legs.

138
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,080
Stand up.

139
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,520
Meng, stand up!

140
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,520
Meng, stand up!

141
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,520
I...

142
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,960
Meng, stand up!

143
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
You!

144
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,360
Can you walk or not?

145
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,240
If you can't, I'm off.

146
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,960
I can't.

147
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,800
Alright, you sit here then.

148
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,400
I have to go.

149
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,520
See you in the afternoon.

150
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,240
To meet Li Jiatong again?

151
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
You never take me

152
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,760
to the gathering with girls, right?

153
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,800
If you want to come, hurry up.

154
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,520
Mr. Ren.

155
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,520
Your time has come.

156
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,960
Get to the point.

157
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,040
Ren Ze.

158
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,840
My model is here.

159
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,240
Could you please let me use the studio?

160
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,480
Give me one more minute.

161
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,720
I really can't understand you.

162
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,360
You like to paint

163
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,240
a bunch of men in the studio.

164
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
Exactly.

165
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,000
Don't need to understand me.

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,920
Anyway,

167
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,880
in the end-of-term art exhibition,

168
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,120
which of us can take first place?

169
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,240
Doesn't matter.

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,680
Clean the studio when you leave.

171
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
Get up!

172
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,880
Sit down.

173
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,240
What's wrong?

174
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,120
Sit next to a beauty,
aren't you pleased?

175
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,680
Exactly.

176
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,560
It makes no difference.

177
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,240
Well...

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,440
I feel like having an ice pop.

179
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,560
Why don't you go buy one?

180
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,680
Me?

181
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,680
A surprise for you.

182
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,120
Do you want one?

183
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,720
No.

184
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,880
How is it? Did I do a great job?

185
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,560
Awesome.

186
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
You are amazing.

187
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,120
So this meal...

188
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,560
You treat.

189
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,800
Why should I treat?

190
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
It should be him treat.

191
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,560
I don't want him to treat.

192
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,240
Then you'd treat.

193
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,560
It's not my turn, anyway.

194
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,240
I thought

195
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,120
to take you to our girls' dorm party.

196
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,880
Really?

197
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,480
Seriously?

198
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,680
Of course.

199
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,720
Pinky swear.

200
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,240
Pinky swear.

201
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,800
Wait, this isn't safe.

202
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
I need to record it.

203
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,560
Say what you just said again.

204
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,600
I'll take Xiao Rang
to the girls' dorm party.

205
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,320
Is that okay?

206
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,040
It's a deal.

207
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,000
Stop grinning like a fool.

208
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,680
Pay the bill and leave.

209
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,560
Wait.

210
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,920
You two eat, I'll pay,

211
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,800
and I can't eat.

212
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,600
Don't you find it too much?

213
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,600
Is that so?

214
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,320
If you refuse,

215
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,360
I might not take you.

216
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,480
You two enjoy.

217
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,480
Where's Xiao Rang?

218
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,320
He's left.

219
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,360
Left?

220
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,600
Where to?

221
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,120
No idea. He might have a date.

222
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,560
What? I didn't hear about it.

223
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,120
Then I don't know.

224
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,360
And,

225
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,440
why did you take him to our appointment?

226
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,360
What a third wheel.

227
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,120
We've taken on a big job today.

228
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,000
A big job?

229
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,000
Is it a fraud again?

230
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,560
Last time, you were fooled around.

231
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,720
I wonder what job it is now.

232
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,880
Listen.

233
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,600
This time we are modeling
for an art student.

234
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,320
It's an easy job.

235
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,880
Just stand still there.

236
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,680
Wait. You two men

237
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,360
are as models with no shirts on?

238
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,680
Is the art student boy or girl?

239
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,000
Boy.

240
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,680
That's so weird.

241
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,440
Wait.

242
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,360
He only wants male models.

243
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,680
He doesn't want female models.

244
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,600
Then he's a weirdo.

245
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,320
Right.

246
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,800
Surprise.

247
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,440
What is it?

248
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,160
You got fooled by bunny girl last time.

249
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,440
And I got the original video

250
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,120
back.

251
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,720
How did you get this original video?

252
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,440
Never mind. Just enjoy your meal.

253
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,560
Impressive.

254
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,600
As a return,

255
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
I treat you this meal.

256
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,920
What?

257
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,480
Xiao Rang has paid this meal.

258
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,320
I don't know he's so generous.

259
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,800
I promise to introduce
a girlfriend to him.

260
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,920
No wonder. That explains it.

261
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,320
How about I introduce one to you?

262
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,320
No need.

263
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,600
Don't introduce me to a girlfriend.

264
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,560
I must love my girlfriend
at first sight.

265
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,040
and we live happily together.

266
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,320
And she must be elegant.

267
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,920
Are you done?

268
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,440
Done.

269
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,320
Then let's go.

270
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,040
What? I haven't finished.

271
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
That's all you know.

272
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,920
I'll order you a pig's brain

273
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,480
to nourish your brain.

274
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,600
That works.

275
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,560
I really need it.

276
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,360
I've stayed up late,

277
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,680
reading books about films.

278
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,560
I really need it.

279
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,320
Sir, eight servings of pig's brain.

280
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,880
Can we eat eight servings?

281
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,680
Sir, no need.

282
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,240
You want it?

283
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,600
I...

284
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,680
One serving is enough.

285
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,800
You...

286
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,160
Alright, enjoy.

287
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,560
Nourish your brain well.

288
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,560
I'm off.

289
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,680
What? Don't you eat?

290
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,240
I have an ice pop.

291
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,240
Hello.

292
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,920
Director.

293
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
Sorry, Ms. Jiang.

294
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,680
I'm late.

295
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,000
Should we let him in?

296
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,000
Certainly not. Why?

297
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,000
We are very upset.

298
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,920
He has

299
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,720
wasted one minute of our time.

300
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,240
There are so many students here.

301
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,800
Then,

302
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
he's wasted the time
of an entire class period.

303
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,560
Exactly.

304
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,480
Look.

305
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,040
Public opinion can't be defied.

306
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,560
Ms. Jiang,
please give him another chance.

307
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,920
When we talk about management,

308
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,320
he has to do a demonstration.

309
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,040
Okay.

310
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,880
You and Li Yanhao

311
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,720
will go on stage
to do a demonstration, okay?

312
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,000
No problem.

313
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,880
Don't be late again.

314
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,000
Alright.

315
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,120
Wait.

316
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,440
You finish eating.

317
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,240
Turn to page 76.

318
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,440
How did you come in?

319
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,880
I came in after I've finished.

320
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,680
If I'm late again,

321
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,920
I'll be counted as absence.

322
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,880
You and Li Jiatong...

323
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,440
Li Jiatong has gone back.

324
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,440
Did she say

325
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,680
when to eat together?

326
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,480
No, she didn't say anything.

327
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,440
Then why did I treat the two of you?

328
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,240
Want to go on stage, right?

329
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,160
I've posted it on WeChat account,

330
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,240
and put up the posters.

331
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,320
Why are there only
three people signing up?

332
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,440
Yes.

333
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,560
I've revised this draft
several times already.

334
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,680
I can't possibly say,

335
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,680
"Welcome THREE directors
to the Film Festival."

336
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,000
Let me see.

337
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,920
Which department is Zhu Ruoqing from?

338
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,000
Literature.

339
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,320
Who is this Mr. Li?

340
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,040
I don't know either.

341
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,320
He is quite funny.

342
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,560
He doesn't even dare
to write his real name,

343
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,680
and uses Mr. Li instead.

344
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,880
Library Management.

345
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,680
Who is he?

346
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,440
I don't know.

347
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,600
(Mr. Kang, do you have time to meet?)

348
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,560
Mr. Li.

349
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,000
(See you at 8 PM at the bar.)

350
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,560
(Okay.)

351
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,160
Mr. Dong, your stall is open.

352
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,800
What a cute doll.

353
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,880
Moreover, it can

354
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,160
get you wealth and blessing.

355
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,480
It is better than a fortune cat.

356
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,920
Where did you buy it?

357
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,000
Why isn't it sold online?

358
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,120
Of course not.

359
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,240
It's my own creation.

360
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
I made it by hand.

361
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,320
I even sang to it.

362
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,720
Why sing to it?

363
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,320
Well,

364
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,440
that's blessing.

365
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,960
So it works better than a fortune cat.

366
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,720
Mr. Dong.

367
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,080
My birthday is coming.

368
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,080
Just give it to me as a birthday gift.

369
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,200
Happy Birthday!

370
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,960
You can buy it,

371
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,200
but you can't get it for free.

372
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,800
How much for this one?

373
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,320
A fixed price of 188 yuan.

374
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
Is the number auspicious?

375
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
That expensive?

376
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,320
Really?

377
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,200
Mr. Dong.

378
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,600
How about this?

379
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,960
Make it cheaper.

380
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,960
If it's cheaper, I'll buy it for her.

381
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,080
You're so sincere.

382
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,800
Alright, 88 yuan then.

383
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,720
No further discounts.

384
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,600
I spent two nights

385
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,960
singing to it

386
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,200
during my carefully crafting.

387
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,440
88 yuan, no bargaining.

388
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,680
You show no respect to us.

389
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,560
Zhou Yu is the class belle of
the School of Economics and Management,

390
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,440
and the host of the student union.

391
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,320
Many people want to give her gifts.

392
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,720
And those chasing her
have lined up from Binhai University

393
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,480
all the way to Mauritius,
do you know that?

394
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,800
No matter how many people,

395
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,840
it's no use.

396
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,040
I don't care any of this.

397
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,680
I only sell this, not give it away.

398
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Forget it, let's go.

399
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,920
Class Belle, listen.

400
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,680
In this world, only it

401
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,720
can be worthy of you.

402
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,960
How can you be so lucky?

403
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,680
You've met your destined girl.

404
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,200
Girl.

405
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,480
Think it over again.

406
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,080
Alright then.

407
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,560
Then I'll transfer the money to you.

408
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,320
Okay, okay.

409
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,680
Wait.

410
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,600
You spent two nights making it?

411
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,840
Singing to it while making it?

412
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,920
It's called blessing.

413
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,800
What did you sing?

414
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,120
I sang,

415
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,920
"I really want to live..."

416
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,560
Stop it.

417
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,720
Just imagine,

418
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,440
in the middle of the night,

419
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,080
he's making a doll,

420
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,480
and singing to it.

421
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,600
What a creepy scene.

422
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:05,960
Wait.

423
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,840
I don't want it.

424
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,240
Wait.

425
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,960
I don't want it.

426
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,920
Wait, I'll give you discounts.

427
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,960
62 yuan. 22 yuan.

428
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,800
Giving you for free. No way.

429
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,360
I...

430
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,200
If you finish taking notes,
you can leave.

431
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Finish it before leaving.

432
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,720
Why are you so slow?

433
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,040
I've finished.

434
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,480
Can you understand what you've written?

435
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,360
Don't worry about it.

436
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,240
It's finished, anyway.

437
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,960
Why don't you leave?

438
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,960
Treat me to a meal?

439
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,800
She means...

440
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,360
No, forget about it.

441
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,200
Let's go.

442
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,480
Put it in your bag.

443
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,120
I have no bag.

444
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,040
You two, stop there.

445
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,480
Your homework was quite well.

446
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,800
Right?

447
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,360
We've been studying really hard.

448
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,240
Not you.

449
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,200
Your performance today

450
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,480
can get a pass, at most.

451
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,240
Ready for the makeup exam?

452
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,360
Don't worry.

453
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,360
I've been reviewing so hard.

454
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,480
I won't let you down.

455
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,720
Should I thank you?

456
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,320
Don't.

457
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,240
Ms. Jiang.

458
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,720
I've been preparing
for something big recently.

459
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
Film Festival, right?

460
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,080
How did you know?

461
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,360
I told her.

462
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,680
Why are you so nosy?

463
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
I wanted to surprise her,

464
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,800
so I even used a pseudonym.

465
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,920
What's the big deal with that?

466
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,200
If we win the award,

467
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,120
it will honor the department.

468
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,840
Right?

469
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,480
Miss.

470
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,360
Please keep the Film Festival thing
a secret for me.

471
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,680
I'll do well in the exam.

472
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,360
Is that so?

473
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,440
It's either you or him

474
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,240
ranking bottom.

475
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,440
You handle it yourself.

476
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,800
Just go.

477
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,600
Goodbye, Ms. Jiang.

478
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,040
Wait.

479
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,840
While ensuring your exams,

480
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,720
work hard on the Film Festival,

481
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,920
aiming to win an award.

482
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,840
Rest assured.

483
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,480
Bye.

484
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,080
Bye.

485
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,600
Why didn't you let me speak just now?

486
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,600
Maybe later.

487
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,120
I think they're unreliable.

488
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,680
Just treat them to a meal.

489
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,480
Xia.

490
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,840
Let's go have a meal together.

491
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,680
You. Forget about it.

492
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,240
Everyone knows who you are,

493
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,360
Mr. Zheng.

494
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
We don't want to owe you anything.

495
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,080
Exactly.

496
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,720
We wanted to treat Li Yanhao

497
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,600
because he's going to be a director.

498
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,240
You treat us to a meal.

499
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,040
You are up to something.

500
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Exactly, let's go.

501
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,600
(Lei Yonghao)
(New wine has arrived.)

502
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,960
(Come for a drink in the evening.)

503
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,360
(Li Yanhao)
(Where to go tonight?)

504
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,120
Come on.

505
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,120
(Work at the bar.)

506
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,720
Where to go for fun?

507
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,200
Yes, where to go for fun?

508
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,720
Li Jiatong.

509
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,360
Li Jiatong.

510
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,560
Where to go for fun tonight?

511
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,360
Change your clothes.

512
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,440
Today, I will take you to a nice place.

513
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,600
- Where to?
- Where to?

514
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,600
Bar.

515
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:46,016
(Bar)

516
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,360
What's wrong?

517
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,200
The Mysterious Night.

518
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,080
Are you mysterious enough?

519
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,920
What time is it now?

520
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,920
It's 8:15 PM.

521
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,320
Where is this place?

522
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,720
The bar I run with all my heart.

523
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,320
This is a place
that brings happiness to people.

524
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,360
Look, are you happy?

525
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,240
Who can be happy seeing you?

526
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,920
You!

527
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,440
I know what you want to say.

528
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,680
Although you can't express it in words,

529
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,120
you can use body language

530
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,840
to show your happiness.

531
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,600
Happiness comes from within.

532
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,600
You!

533
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
What's up?

534
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,600
I-I'm quite happy.

535
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,360
I can't see it.

536
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,440
What I see is fatigue and hypocrisy.

537
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,800
Can you be sincerer?

538
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,720
Smile.

539
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,120
Yes, keep it.

540
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,480
What's wrong with you?

541
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,040
Not in high spirits?

542
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,240
Unsatisfied with your look?

543
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,720
No, boss.

544
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,800
See, either they have masks

545
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,920
in this outfit,

546
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,920
or in suits.

547
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,840
Well, I...

548
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,120
What is this?

549
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,720
I think it's quite good.

550
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,720
And your outfit

551
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,600
is suitable for work.

552
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,080
Just wear it.

553
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,680
The one at the door.

554
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,120
Yes, that's you, standing at the door.

555
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,840
Boss.

556
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,360
You're just posing there,

557
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,120
and you'll attract the customers?

558
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,200
You have to let them know

559
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,480
tonight is the Mystery Night,

560
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,240
with 50% off,

561
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,960
and ladies can get in free. Okay?

562
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,040
Got it.

563
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,440
I'll give you a name.

564
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,320
You

565
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,480
are Horsehead.

566
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,840
Boss, this is Deerhead.

567
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,240
I know what's a horse and what's a deer.

568
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,840
Don't tell me this.

569
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,840
What's your name?

570
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,240
I-I'm Luffy.

571
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,080
I don't know who he is.

572
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,960
You'll be called Straw Hat.

573
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,120
And you are called Dark Circles,

574
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,480
or Maruko?

575
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,840
Dark Circles.

576
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,320
Maruko is so cute.

577
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,200
You'll be called Maruko.

578
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,120
What about me?

579
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,320
You don't have a name.

580
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,360
Before 100 customers come in,

581
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,960
don't make me see you again.

582
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,720
Go stand at the entrance.

583
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,720
Come back.

584
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,480
You all have names,
but I don't have one yet.

585
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,680
Starting now,

586
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,680
you will call me

587
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,480
Captain.

588
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,040
Captain.

589
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,600
Come on, say it with me.

590
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,840
Captain.

591
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,320
Captain.

592
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,240
Haven't you all eaten?

593
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,040
Once more, Captain.

594
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,200
- Captain.
- Captain.

595
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,440
That's the spirit, come on.

596
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,720
Get to work.

597
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,600
If you slack off, go clean the toilets.

598
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,560
Hurry up.

599
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,440
Everyone.

600
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,072
(Qinghong Music Bar)

601
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,200
Maruko.

602
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,720
Maruko.

603
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
Get lost. Don't bother me.

604
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,320
Do you think

605
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,200
a beauty might take a fancy
to me after drunk?

606
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,440
Stop daydreaming.

607
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,600
No one will.

608
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,480
Get to work.

609
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,840
What work?

610
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,840
Stop pretending here.

611
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,080
Captain isn't here anyway.

612
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,720
You...

613
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,120
Captain?

614
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,360
You are quite into it.

615
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,080
Where have all these pretty girls gone?

616
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,840
Why don't they come out
for some fun on the weekend?

617
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,800
Well,

618
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,320
it's already the weekend.

619
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,480
I haven't seen Yu Lan for a whole week.

620
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,800
Before starting filming,

621
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,120
you have no chance to meet?

622
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,240
I think so.

623
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,120
Just think,

624
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,600
I was so awkward when we met before.

625
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,240
Oh, my.

626
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,680
When can I see Yu Lan?

627
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,040
What?

628
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,840
I want a girlfriend.

629
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,680
Get out of the way.

630
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,600
You came on time.

631
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,080
I've always been so.

632
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,240
You've grown up in the student union.

633
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,600
Oh, no.

634
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,240
They are dating.

635
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,600
There's something between them.

636
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,480
Don't talk nonsense.

637
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,040
Look at the way those two are talking.

638
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,480
You can tell they are not a couple.

639
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,240
I've always wanted to learn from you.

640
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,600
But no matter how hard I work,

641
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,800
I can't achieve the way
you were back then.

642
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,240
Let me tell you.

643
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,320
You are the most capable
student union president after me.

644
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,600
You can.

645
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,600
I'll go find out more.

646
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,240
Hello, good evening.

647
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,440
Welcome to the Qinghong Bar.

648
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,040
Tonight

649
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,840
is the Mystery Night.

650
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,960
Looking at my outfit,

651
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,920
I bet you can tell who I'm dressed as.

652
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,600
Luffy.

653
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,600
You can just call me Straw Hat.

654
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,320
What can I do for you?

655
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,120
A cup of whiskey.

656
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,800
Juice.

657
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,600
Juice.

658
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,720
Tonight,

659
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,120
we've launched a special cocktail,

660
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,480
named Pink Lady,

661
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,800
especially suited for
couples to enjoy together.

662
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,960
No need, I don't drink alcohol.

663
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,360
Orange juice will be fine.

664
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,320
The Pink Lady

665
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,680
is made with eight base liquors,

666
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,480
tasting really good.

667
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,960
If you post photos in the Moments,

668
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,120
you can get half off.

669
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,600
A whiskey and a juice.

670
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,920
Please hurry.

671
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,480
Okay.

672
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,840
I think they are not a couple.

673
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,080
Why?

674
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,480
Did they say anything?

675
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,360
I said

676
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,360
we've launched a Pink Lady cocktail,

677
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,080
and couples can get half off.

678
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,840
If they were a couple,
they would order it.

679
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,960
But they didn't.

680
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,720
You are quite something.

681
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,200
What if they really ordered it?

682
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,840
Then,

683
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,360
I'd dash to the bar and put on

684
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,120
the horsehead,

685
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,960
to make a glass for them.

686
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
I knew it.

687
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,960
How could my goddess
get into a relationship so easily?

688
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,120
Well...

689
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,120
Look.

690
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,480
The relationship between them
is clearly not ordinary.

691
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,480
They are out on a romantic night alone.

692
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,680
Having some wine,
and atmosphere kicks in,

693
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,120
if the guy publicly confesses,

694
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,920
and Yu Lan

695
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,960
might just accept it.

696
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,320
Get lost.

697
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,600
Go get the drinks for them.

698
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,920
What?

699
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,240
He looks decent,

700
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,440
but is brainwashing a student,

701
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,480
which makes me mad.

702
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,320
Let him wait.

703
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,920
Wants to go clean the toilets?

704
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,120
I'll make the drinks.

705
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,440
If everything is done,

706
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,480
I'll go clean the toilets.

707
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,360
This outfit makes you lose face?

708
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,720
No, well...

709
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,920
Took a fancy to her?

710
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
Don't talk nonsense.

711
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
No, not at all.

712
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,240
Clean the toilets well.

713
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,360
If you don't like this outfit,

714
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,720
I have an Ultraman suit

715
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,840
for you.

716
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,960
No need, really.

717
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,240
At least this one isn't that silly.

718
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,120
Ungrateful boy!

719
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,600
This suit of mine is limited.

720
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,200
I only wore it
at the tenth-anniversary celebration.

721
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,800
I'll clean the toilets.

722
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,960
(Lianfa, Huamei Space)
It's right over there.

723
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
Haven't been here before.

724
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,840
The name looks very old-fashioned.

725
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,960
The boss

726
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,120
must be a fat, old man,

727
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,200
Feel like the waiters
are definitely ugly.

728
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,840
What?

729
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,120
We have to find a place
with handsome guys.

730
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,600
Right.

731
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,800
At least it's pleasing to the eye.

732
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,120
A feast for the eyes.

733
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,960
How do you know

734
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,080
there are no handsome guys?

735
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,840
What if there are?

736
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,120
It just doesn't seem like it.

737
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,440
(Qinghong Music Bar)
It's right here.

738
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,480
No way, we haven't been here.

739
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,440
Pretty good.

740
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,200
- Come on.
- What?

741
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,120
Four pretty ladies.

742
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,600
Welcome.

743
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,480
Today, we have a Mysterious Night event.

744
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,800
New drinks are at half off.

745
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,960
And you can enjoy many surprises.

746
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,600
You are Xu Xiangdong, right?

747
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,600
It's you.

748
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,600
You are here to spend the weekend?

749
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,600
You brought them to work here, right?

750
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,200
How is it?

751
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,040
They can both earn money and have fun.

752
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,240
Is it good?

753
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,040
Well...

754
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,720
Mention me,

755
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,840
enjoy a discount on drinks.

756
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,600
Hello, four guests.

757
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,240
What can I...?

758
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,200
It's you?

759
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,480
Why couldn't it be us?

760
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,240
The state has regulations

761
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,720
minors can't drink alcohol.

762
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,360
Take out

763
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,120
our ID cards and show him.

764
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,120
Just kidding.

765
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,600
I did what I promised you at noon.

766
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,840
From now on,

767
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,360
you'll take care of it.

768
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
Alright.

769
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,960
What would you four like to drink?

770
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,240
What's good to drink here?

771
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,200
Give us a recommendation

772
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,360
We have launched a new cocktail

773
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,480
tonight,

774
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,840
named Pink Lady,

775
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,840
really delicious.

776
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,600
If you want to try,

777
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,680
I'll mix it for you myself.

778
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,600
It doesn't sound attractive.

779
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,720
Get me a bottle of beer.

780
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,800
That Pink Lady.

781
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,840
Let's go with that.

782
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,600
How is it?

783
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,320
Me too.

784
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,080
Understood.

785
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,600
Where's Li Yanhao?

786
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,120
He was just here.

787
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,720
He may go to clean the toilets.

788
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,040
My hat!

789
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,240
What's up?

790
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,720
Why are you here?

791
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,600
Men's room here.

792
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,960
Why can't I come in?

793
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,600
Besides, I've checked before I came in.

794
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,360
Nobody's here.

795
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:14,720
Leave.

796
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,360
No girls enter the men's room.

797
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,600
Why would I leave?

798
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,680
Here I am now.

799
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,320
So what?

800
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,840
Don't be so close to me.

801
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,800
My hands are dirty.

802
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,840
I don't mind.

803
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,960
Just kidding.

804
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,360
How could I possibly be into you?

805
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,440
Look what you're dressed.

806
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,840
Xiao Rang and Xu Xiangdong
picked all the clothes,

807
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,840
and only this one left.

808
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,480
Get out.

809
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,040
It'll be so awkward if men come in.

810
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,720
Hurry.

811
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,320
This is the men's room.

812
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,200
How is the drink I mixed?

813
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,840
Tastes good?

814
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,840
It's okay. It's the flavor I like.

815
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,600
Then that's fine.

816
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,360
I haven't learned it either.

817
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,120
Maybe I just have some talent.

818
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,440
What flavor do you like?

819
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,240
I can mix for you.

820
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,400
Alright.

821
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,600
You like sweet?

822
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,480
Quite generous.

823
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:20,880
No, Boss.

824
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,160
I'll pay with my own salary.

825
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,800
What did you just say?
What did you call me?

826
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,480
Bo...

827
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,440
Captain.

828
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,720
Captain.

829
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,240
Where's your hat?

830
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,640
I lent it to a customer.

831
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,400
I'll get it back.

832
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,560
Get it back now.

833
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,240
You have no soul without a hat.

834
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,880
Hurry up and go get it.

835
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,400
Ladies.

836
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,960
Are you of age? Drink so much alcohol?

837
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,720
Old man.

838
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,160
We're all freshmen at university.

839
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,400
Freshmen?

840
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,480
Really mature.

841
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
Which university?

842
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,240
Binhai University.

843
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,120
Binhai University?

844
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,720
I'm familiar with it.

845
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,720
Ren Ze, do you know him?

846
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,880
Yes. I know him.

847
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,240
He's quite famous.

848
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,640
I've seen his art exhibition.

849
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,240
Me too.

850
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,640
Consider you've seen it,

851
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,480
I'll treat you

852
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,640
all the wine on the table.

853
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,480
Drink as much as you want.

854
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,600
If it's not enough, ask me for more.

855
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,440
Thank you.

856
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,240
Thank you.

857
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,600
Here, cheers.

858
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,440
Who is that weird man?

859
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,360
The boss.

860
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,240
He's treating all the drinks today.

861
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,200
- Really?
- A nice person.

862
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,720
This place is really nice.

863
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,600
We can come again.

864
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,240
What now?

865
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,480
You three, toast me a drink?

866
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,360
Come on.

867
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,400
Come on.

868
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,720
- Cheers.
- Thank you for bringing us here.

869
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:46,960
Okay.

870
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,120
So what should I do next?

871
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,400
First of all,

872
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,880
you need to ask for the cooperation
from the school.

873
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,680
Although I have submitted

874
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,120
the proposal to the school,

875
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,640
it will takes some time
to get approved.

876
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,680
You should communicate more
with the teachers,

877
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,360
and try to shorten the time.

878
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,480
Secondly,

879
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,440
you need to intensify the promotion.

880
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,400
To increase the view count

881
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,360
of the WeChat account,

882
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,440
letting more people
know about the Film Festival.

883
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,880
To ignite their passion

884
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,960
and get them involved.

885
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,960
Here's the wine Boss gave you.

886
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,160
It doesn't look good.

887
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:34,920
Here you are.

888
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,920
You won't look good with it.

889
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,680
It doesn't fit you.

890
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,160
I...

891
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,360
She looks good with it.

892
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,400
Qian.

893
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,920
Take a photo for me and him.

894
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,040
- Look here.
- I'm busy.

895
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,240
- You guys do it.
- Say

896
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,440
cheese.

897
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,440
It's pretty.

898
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,600
Yu Lan, your bag,

899
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,360
don't forget it.

900
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,400
President.

901
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,800
Why are you here too?

902
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,040
It's a gathering
of Binhai University today.

903
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,640
Let me introduce you.

904
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,160
This is our school's president,

905
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,800
Yu Lan.

906
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,400
This is...

907
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,040
Hello.

908
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,040
This is her boyfriend.

909
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,640
Look at him,

910
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,440
both gentle and handsome.

911
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,920
This is Li Yanhao.

912
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,880
He is my good friend.

913
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,880
And he is preparing to make a film now.

914
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,640
Because he joined

915
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,120
our school's Film Festival.

916
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,240
Pretty good.

917
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,920
Judging from your clothes,

918
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,360
you're related to the films.

919
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,640
Let's go.

920
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,680
Let's go.

921
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,360
Mr. Li.

922
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,360
Although you hit me with the ball,

923
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,640
rest assured,

924
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,400
on the Film Festival,

925
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,400
I will not make it personal.

926
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,680
What does she mean?

927
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,560
We're closed.

928
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,720
Hold on.

929
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,840
Never mind.

930
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,360
Have a drink with me.

931
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,480
Beer on draft,

932
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,480
Lei Yonghao.

933
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,400
From our relationship,

934
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,200
you should call me Dad.

935
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:04,760
(First Time Failing an Exam)

936
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,680
Miss.

937
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,160
I need to use the restroom.

938
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,320
You can only leave
after handing in your paper.

939
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:19,960
Wait, please.

940
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,240
I can't hold it anymore.

941
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,320
Hang in.

942
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,400
Finish it.

943
00:39:46,816 --> 00:39:48,960
(Second Time Failing an Exam)

944
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,800
Don't be late.

945
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,160
Don't be late.

946
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:55,960
Move.

947
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,400
Don't move.

948
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,600
Don't move.

949
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,880
