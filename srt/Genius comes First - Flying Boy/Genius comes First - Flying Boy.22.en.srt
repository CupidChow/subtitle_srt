38
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,440
What does

39
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,040
making films mean to you?

40
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,440
I think the most romantic thing

41
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,960
is to make our story into a film.

42
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,880
So this is your definition of romance.

43
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,160
What about you?

44
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,960
What do you think
is the most romantic thing?

45
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,240
I think

46
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,720
it's probably when
I'm acknowledged by someone,

47
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
publicly confessed love,

48
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,560
and becoming the only one for him.

49
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,640
I am afraid I might mess it up.

50
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,160
I have realized

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,280
you are quite smart to choose me

52
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
the fairy costume,

53
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,280
but in other time, you're like a fool.

54
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,160
Fool.

55
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,640
Because you resemble a fairy.

56
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,080
Look at your big eyes,

57
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,760
they are spirited, cute and beautiful.

58
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,440
Then why didn't you say so
when I wore it?

59
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,280
You are already beautiful.

60
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,480
Do you need me to compliment you?

61
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,800
Look, a shooting star.

62
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,560

(Run! Youth)

64
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,800
Your mom is finally discharged.

65
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
Everything is good.

66
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,240
I am going to take her

67
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,240
out to travel the world.

68
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,240
We'll go to the Film Festival.

69
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,880
Come on.

70
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
What's the matter?

71
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,240
You seem lost.

72
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,520
Are you upset?

73
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,440
No.

74
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,720
My mom is discharged and leaving.

75
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,600
I'll miss her.

76
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,160
Well,

77
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,080
then we don't have to go.

78
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,520
Let's find a small hotel
and stay a few more days.

79
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,880
Dad.

80
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,160
Mom just got discharged.

81
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,240
Let her go home and rest.

82
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,240
Then let your dad
take you back to school.

83
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,080
No need.

84
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,240
You have such a long way to go.

85
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,400
Dad.

86
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,680
Don't let Mom do chores at home.

87
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,680
Take good care of her.

88
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
Don't do chores, Mom.

89
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,400
Don't worry.

90
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,520
Your dad has been
taking good care of me.

91
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,960
You are so caring towards me.

92
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,680
Come on, let me give you a kiss.

93
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,800
Mom, don't.

94
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,080
Be a good boy.

95
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,080
Alright, enough.

96
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,440
Enough with the talking.

97
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,680
We'll come to support you
at the Film Festival.

98
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,800
We are leaving.

99
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,280
Dad.

100
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,720
Take care.

101
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,000
Be careful.

102
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,520
Right, listen to him.

103
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,800
Drive safe, okay?

104
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,960
Alright. Drive safe.

105
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,680
I'm going to drive at a slow pace,

106
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,120
ensuring the safety, okay?

107
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,240
What is it?

108
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,280
Here, something to eat.

109
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,800
Be a good boy.

110
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,840
Thank you, mom.

111
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,720
Didn't you say to drive slowly?

112
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,880
Yes, slowly.

113
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,120
You're going too slow.

114
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,840
Is that so?

115
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,400
At this speed, when will we get home?

116
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,680
Slow pace!

117
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,000
Just...

118
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,080
Go slow...

119
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,080
Safety first.

120
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,680
Stop it.

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,600
Safety.

122
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,840
Drive faster.

123
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,960
Faster?

124
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,120
You should've said so earlier.

125
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,560
Let's go.

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,080
The film is well-made.

127
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Kang Yide

128
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,840
has been using your film to motivate us.

129
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,120
What's the use of that?

130
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,000
I can't participate either.

131
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,520
I have a question for you.

132
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,680
As a student of Library Management,

133
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,720
why must you attend the Film Festival?

134
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,840
We are in the same class.

135
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,280
Then why do you attend it?

136
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,840
In the beginning,

137
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,400
I made the film to chase a girl.

138
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,840
But later, I did so
to not let down my team.

139
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,280
Now it's for making my mom happy.

140
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,280
By the way,

141
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,280
during the time
you and Wang Pengpeng absent,

142
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
I've thought a lot.

143
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,800
You did so because

144
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,280
Xiao Rang and me

145
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,840
seriously disturbed your lives.

146
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,960
I'm sorry.

147
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,560
It's good not living together.

148
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,280
However, through this Film Festival,

149
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
I really admire you.

150
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,960
Stop it.

151
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
I have failed,
and you are the participant.

152
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,840
I'm going to drop out.

153
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,840
Why?

154
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,720
I'm leaving.

155
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,280
Tell me why.

156
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,050
Thinking about the Film Festival?

157
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,720
Maybe we should go talk to Kang Yide.

158
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,400
Our film was shot so well.

159
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,720
It's qualified.

160
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,000
I came to him several times.

161
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,120
He made up excuses to send me off

162
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,080
and reject me.

163
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,120
Does he own this Film Festival?

164
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,840
Why can he decide everything?

165
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,840
In this case,

166
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,400
he really decides everything.

167
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,520
He made the organizing committee.

168
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,240
He can reject me if he wants.

169
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,720
Does President have any solution now?

170
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,400
Yu Lan said she would do something.

171
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,960
But before,

172
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,560
she had a conflict with Kang Yide.

173
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't think there's much hope.

174
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,960
How about we go to the principal?

175
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,000
It's no use.

176
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,840
At worst,

177
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,280
we just won't participate in it.

178
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,560
It doesn't matter.

179
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,560
We won't play with them.

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,840
Anyway,
no one in our team will blame you.

181
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,560
You've already done very well.

182
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,400
But your mom...

183
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,720
Your mom can't watch the film you shot.

184
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,960
It's okay, no worries.

185
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,560
We have worked hard together
for so long.

186
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,120
Forget it.

187
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,240
After all, we did do our best.

188
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,840
Right?

189
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,080
What's most important now
is your selection.

190
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,520
I have no mood right now

191
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,840
to participate in the selection.

192
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,720
Don't.

193
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,080
Let's go have midnight snack.

194
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
Then have a drink.

195
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,080
What?

196
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,400
You have
to participate in the selection.

197
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,280
In the next few days,

198
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,600
I will stay with you.

199
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,640
Really?

200
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,400
Really.

201
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,520
Then we should have a drink. Let's go.

202
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,280
What?

203
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,200
Take it slow.

204
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:06,848
(Student Union Office)

205
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,640
President.

206
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,960
What's wrong?

207
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,840
I have something to tell you.

208
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
(Just get the award.)

209
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,720
(Why do you need to be fair?)

210
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,920
(This world isn't fair, anyway.)

211
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
(Can she, Yu Lan, do better than me?)

212
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,760
(I didn't plan to let)

213
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,280
(the person she recommended)

214
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,840
(appear at the Film Festival.)

215
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,720
It is the evidence
of Kang Yide suspected manipulating

216
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,080
at the Film Festival,

217
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,600
and deleted Li Yanhao's film

218
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,960
maliciously.

219
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,600
Darn it.

220
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,600
President.

221
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,600
Did you

222
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
swear?

223
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,400
I have to help Li Yanhao.

224
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
This Film Festival

225
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,760
should be a fair event.

226
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,960
I can't let my efforts

227
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,080
be destroyed by him.

228
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,400
The day after tomorrow
is the Film Festival.

229
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,520
There's no time left.

230
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,760
I can do it.

231
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,840
But I need your help.

232
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,960
Kang, why are you here?

233
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,480
You're still working?

234
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,720
The student union is short-staffed,

235
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
so I have to work more.

236
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,840
As the president,

237
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,960
you are quite competent.

238
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,600
The preparation for the Film Festival
is going smoothly, right?

239
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,960
Is there anything I can help with?

240
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
It is going smoothly.

241
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,080
I heard a girl named Zhu Ruoqing
in the Literature Department

242
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,080
filmed a very beautiful love story.

243
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,960
I like love stories,

244
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
so I look forward to it.

245
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,840
Zhu Ruoqing?

246
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,400
I've seen it.

247
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,040
It's very delicate and well-shot.

248
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,080
It should touch a few young girls.

249
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,720
I am looking forward to it.

250
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,160
I believe that under your leadership,
the Film Festival

251
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,720
will definitely shine.

252
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,840
Of course.

253
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,360
Even if we can't attend
tomorrow's Film Festival,

254
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,280
we must not get disheartened.

255
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,600
So, do you have any good ideas?

256
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,720
Share with us to lift our spirits.

257
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,920
I suggest we have a drink.

258
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,600
No.

259
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,480
Drinking only makes it worse.

260
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,840
What's with all of you?

261
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,600
Looking listless.

262
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,400
It's just a film festival, right?

263
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Look at you,

264
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,480
being so distressed.

265
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,840
At the Film Festival's opening ceremony,

266
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,160
our film

267
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,600
would have been premiered.

268
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,920
Now all the effort go in vain.

269
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,080
I thought it's some big deal.

270
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,160
You just want your film

271
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,600
to be seen by more people.

272
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,360
Indeed.

273
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,040
We can't even do that.

274
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,960
Who said that?

275
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,160
From today on,

276
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,160
I allow your film

277
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,160
to be played in my bar

278
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,720
on a 24-hour continuous loop,

279
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,400
so everyone who comes here can see it.

280
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,040
If after watching, they like it

281
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,080
or give some review,

282
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,600
then I'll give them a half off.

283
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,840
Nice, huh?

284
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,840
That works.

285
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,080
Your place is too noisy
to watch the films.

286
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,760
I'm not that thoughtful.

287
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,720
But in that case,

288
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,400
I do have a place that's more suitable.

289
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,160
Son.

290
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,040
Take it.

291
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,200
The premiere tomorrow night

292
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,280
will be held at your gallery.

293
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,920
Get two cases of beer.

294
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,520
Celebrate well after the evening ends.

295
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,080
Alright.

296
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,600
Dad.

297
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,960
Alright, son.

298
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,520
You two make peace?

299
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,080
This is such great news.

300
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,840
We must celebrate well tomorrow night.

301
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,520
Right.

302
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,480
Celebrate properly.

303
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,840
You guys chat.

304
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,080
Tell me if you need anything.

305
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,080
Wait.

306
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,960
Tomorrow evening at six-thirty,

307
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,160
I have a selection.

308
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,960
Then I won't come over.

309
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,280
How can that be okay?

310
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,520
If you are not there,
who are we celebrating for?

311
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
We'll wait for you.

312
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,520
Right.

313
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,160
Then I'll go prepare.

314
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,400
Okay.

315
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,520
Aunt.

316
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,280
Why are you here?

317
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,400
Any good news?

318
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,840
Share it with me.

319
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,040
Tomorrow night, we plan
to host a private premiere

320
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,520
at Ren Ze's studio.

321
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,040
Come join us.

322
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,600
A private premiere?

323
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,600
I can't join.

324
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,600
Aunt.

325
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,080
Not only me,

326
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,600
none of you can join either.

327
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,080
Principal Wang said

328
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,200
to invite all of you

329
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,720
to the opening ceremony.

330
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,400
After it,

331
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,480
your film will also be played.

332
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,520
After watching it,

333
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,520
you have to go up on stage one by one

334
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,840
to share your experiences.

335
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Really?

336
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,720
That's great!

337
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,960
Long live Aunt!

338
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,040
Alright.

339
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,400
Be a lady.

340
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,480
I'm curious

341
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,400
how you dealt with that Kang Yide

342
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,200
I told Principal Wang your story,

343
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,160
and he made an exception
to let you participate.

344
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,840
Really?

345
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,600
Cheers!

346
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,720
Cheers!

347
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,160
Question.

348
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,720
Answer.

349
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,840
A difficult question.

350
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,960
Difficult question?

351
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
I don't answer, okay?

352
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,280
No.

353
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:02,960
Question.

354
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,160
Answer.

355
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,600
If it weren't for me,

356
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,720
would you date president?

357
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,480
What a difficult question!

358
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,160
Not at all.

359
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,080
What do you mean?

360
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,960
Well, I...

361
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,600
was wrong.

362
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,280
What a question.

363
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,600
I can answer it directly.

364
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,280
Then you tell me.

365
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
Yu Lan

366
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,840
is just a dream girl from my childhood.

367
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,600
Now we are all grown up,

368
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,720
and have experienced so many things,

369
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,600
met many people,

370
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,840
and had different thoughts.

371
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,960
No, we wouldn't.

372
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,520
Really?

373
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,080
Really.

374
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,920
Really?

375
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
Absolutely.

376
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,160
You are just trying to fool me.

377
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,160
No.

378
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,600
If we could always be like this,

379
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,720
that would be great.

380
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,600
Indeed.

381
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,360
Being carefree,

382
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,400
with wine to drink and the sea to see.

383
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,960
And there's

384
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,520
a troublemaker by my side.

385
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,720
How nice!

386
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,360
Who's the troublemaker?

387
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,040
You.

388
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,080
Then I would make trouble to you.

389
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,040
I have to stay with you.

390
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,400
You have to always indulge me.

391
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,080
Indulge you?

392
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,080
Never.

393
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Li Yanhao.

394
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,920
Stop right there.

395
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,960
You can't catch me.

396
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,720
(Everything is ready.
See you at the Film Festival.)

397
00:16:32,244 --> 00:16:35,168
(Everything is ready.
See you at the Film Festival.)

398
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,760
You haven't changed clothes.

399
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,520
You go to the Film Festival.

400
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,480
We've agree

401
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,360
not attending it.

402
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,400
We'll go to the selection.

403
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,720
Listen.

404
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,160
You must go to the Film Festival.

405
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,720
You don't go to the selection.

406
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,960
Everyone put in so much for the film.

407
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,600
If you don't go, they will be upset.

408
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,840
Including me,

409
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,720
will also be upset. Got it?

410
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,960
Well...

411
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,080
Enough, then it's settled.

412
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,600
Just go.

413
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,480
Get this sorted out.

414
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,000
Then you get the backstage there.

415
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,848
Okay.

416
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,080
President Yu.

417
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,160
You look very beautiful today.

418
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,600
It's a formal occasion.

419
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,360
This Film Festival

420
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,840
is hosted by the student union.

421
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,240
You're right.

422
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,640
We are all

423
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,880
at your service.

424
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,880
Right.

425
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,600
I am sure

426
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,120
if the speech has been revised.

427
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,480
This time without my help,

428
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,360
I hope you can learn something.

429
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,600
Thank you, Kang.

430
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,360
I will not disappoint you.

431
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,120
(The 1st Binhai University Film Festival)
Dear teachers,

432
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
(Opening Ceremony)
guests,

433
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,240
and fellows.

434
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,720
- Good afternoon, everyone.
- Good afternoon, everyone.

435
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,840
In this early autumn season,

436
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,240
we finally welcome the long-awaited

437
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,840
first Binhai University Film Festival.

438
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,080
Next, let us use warm applause

439
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,640
to welcome Principal Wang
of Binhai University

440
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,080
to make a speech for our Film Festival.

441
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,960
Let's welcome him.

442
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,480
(Binhai University)
Using light and shadow to capture youth,

443
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,480
and chasing dreams with youth.

444
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,480
Everyone's life

445
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,480
is filled with many regrets.

446
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,000
But films

447
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,720
are precisely an art of regret.

448
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,880
They can capture moments in our lives

449
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,480
that are less than perfect.

450
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,760
And films

451
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,880
are also an art form
that compensates for regrets.

452
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,240
They allow our creators

453
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,600
to turn them into
a remedy for life's regrets.

454
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
The wound hasn't healed?

455
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,960
Don't worry. I can do it.

456
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:14,656
Okay.

457
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:16,760
Next, we invite the fifth participant

458
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,640
to come up and introduce their entry.

459
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,160
Hello, everyone.

460
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,280
Previously, my film was called
The Lovely Campus.

461
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,640
She is really interesting.

462
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,880
Wearing the headgear?

463
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,240
Yes, who is she?

464
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,360
This documentary had
no leading actress or actor.

465
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,000
But all the scenes I captured

466
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,280
can't outshine them.

467
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,480
So this film has
a leading actress and actor.

468
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,880
And I changed the title

469
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,960
to Run! Youth.

470
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,760
Well, cut the crap.

471
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,160
Let's just watch it.

472
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,640
Let her go!

473
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,360
Who are you?

474
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,640
I said,

475
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
"Let her go".

476
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,880
I am...

477
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,720
a director now.

478
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,640
I am good at this.

479
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,232
Really.

480
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,480
Let's go.

This is the video

485
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,600

486
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,000
How did you get this?

487
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
How about I introduce one to you?

488
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,240
Don't introduce me to a girlfriend.

489
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,120
I must love my girlfriend
at first sight,

490
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
and we live happily together.

491
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,120
Romantic and perfect.

492
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,000
And this girl must be elegant.

493
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,120
Are you done?

494
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:37,960
Yes.

495
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,720
Then let's go.

496
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,960
What? I haven't finished.

497
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,080
That's all you know.

498
00:20:42,496 --> 00:20:43,120

- They are dating?

502
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,480
Are they dating?

503
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,480
That's a deal then.

504
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,240

Then you have
to confess to me in public.

509
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,880
Otherwise, don't even think about it.

510
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:29,880
Wait.

You.

577
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,360
Impossible.

578
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,240
I sent it to you,

579
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,520
but you didn't watch it.

580
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,880
But in our selection, this is

581
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,600
indeed the best one.

582
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
You silly!

583
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,760
Alright, let's welcome
the director of this film

584
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,640
to come up and speak.

585
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,960
So it's her.

586
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,360
How could it be her?

587
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,736
Hello everyone, I am Zhu Ruoqing.

588
00:27:52,736 --> 00:27:53,360
Oh my.

589
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,600
As you can see,

590
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,360
this documentary is very realistic.

591
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,600
I believe it has deeply moved everyone.

592
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,600
What is the reason?

593
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,840
When I was filming this documentary,

594
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,360
I used many identities

595
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,880
to document

596
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,640
the daily life
of a student at our school.

597
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,360
This documentary by Zhu Ruoqing

598
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,000
has deeply touched me.

599
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,720
The name Run! Youth

600
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,240
is also very apt.

601
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,240
Let's applause for Run! Youth.

602
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,480

Really nice.

No wonder you are
our school's best graduate.

625
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,640
This is our student.

626
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,000
Not at all. Principal, thank you.

627
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,720
Nice.

628
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,880
I don't know how to do this.

629
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,240
Can you help me with this?

630
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,640

642
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,240

Where did he go?

Hello, I am Li Yanhao.

694
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,960
Actually, I can't say much.

695
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,640
But in this Film Festival,

696
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,840
I've learned a few things.

697
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,120
Films can cure my mom's illness.

698
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,600
Films can make me realize

699
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,640
that I have so many

700
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,080
friends worth cherishing around me.

701
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,360
Films

702
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,480
can help me find the one in my life.

703
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,760
My film doesn't have an ending yet.

704
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,120
I think now is the time.

705
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,360

706
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,240

It's normal?

718
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,720
Say it again if you dare.

719
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,440
I'm wrong, okay?

720
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,840
I'll perform for you.

721
