My signal is bad here.

Xiao Rang.

44
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,920
You're at the Binhai Grand Hotel, right?

45
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,920
Wait for me there.

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,680

(The Taste of the Sea)

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,840
Morning, sir.

49
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,560
Hello.

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,040
Where are you headed?

51
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,400
I'm going to your restaurant.

52
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,040
The biggest one.

53
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,120
Sir, this is a high-end hotel.

54
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,280
You can't enter without shoes.

55
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,120
What should I do? They're broken.

56
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,920
Sir,

57
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,920
they smell like salted fish.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,680
I just stepped in trash.

59
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,920
Okay, wait a moment.

60
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,400
Here, sir.

61
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,480
Wear these.

62
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,480
Thank you.

63
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,920
Your high-end hotel

64
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,280
services really are exceptional.

65
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,360
Certainly.

66
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,640
Oh, so comfortable.

67
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Could you throw these away for me?

68
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,000
Uh...

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,840
Okay, I'll do it.

70
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,200
Oh, no. I'll do it.

71
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,280
Let me help.

72
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Thanks.

73
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,640
Don't wait for Li Yanhao.

74
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,920
I can't eat another bite.

75
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,960
If we hadn't come early,

76
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,240
would we have got the good food?

77
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,800
Eat up.

78
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,080
Don't make me eat alone.

79
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Didn't we have breakfast this morning?

80
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,960
Is that the same?

81
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,200
What did he make for us?

82
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,240
That bland soup.

83
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,960
But this? It's so delicious!

84
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,800
Grand hotel,

85
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,760
you know, is quite different.

86
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,480
Do you see that bar behind us?

87
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,680
Those drinks are free!

88
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,760
Really?

89
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,200
I'll grab some. Want anything?

90
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,480
No. I want to eat more.

91
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,800
Then let's eat first.

92
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,984
Okay.

93
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,640
Li Yanhao, over there!

94
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
How did you get into

95
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,080
such a high-end place?

96
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,680
Well, thanks to Yu Lan.

97
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,120
She came here for a seminar

98
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,240
and said there was a free meal voucher.

99
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,080
So we came over.

100
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,960
How did you get in?

101
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,080
No one is at the entrance,
so I just came in.

102
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,680
It's almost closing time. No one cares.

103
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,080
Exactly. Hurry and grab some food.

104
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,120
I'm not hungry.

105
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,080
Try this, it's really great.

106
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,800
I really don't want any. Here, take it.

107
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,560
Try some.

108
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:57,520
Why do I feel

109
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,120
something stinks after you arrived?

110
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,240
Pass me that Kimchi.

111
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,120
Let me smell it.

112
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,480
Maybe some of the seafood stinks.

113
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,640
I... I'll go to the restroom.

114
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,760
You guys go head.

115
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,560
The plum wine is
sour and sweet. Amazing!

116
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,200
You want some?

117
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,760
No, thanks.

118
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,840
I'm going surfing later.

119
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,080
Surfing while drunk,

120
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,400
you're the wildest one.

121
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,400
Here you come.

122
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,560
I went to the beach for shooting.

123
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,680
Go eat something.

124
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,520
Already ate, you guys go ahead.

125
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,960
You're Li Yanhao, right?

126
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,840
After the last student union conference,

127
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,480
Yu Lan always says you are talented.

128
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,040
You've started your movie?

129
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,280
Right.

130
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,920
This morning,

131
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,920
I went to the beach scouting locations.

132
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,560
That's great.

133
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,920
I've been interested in you before.

134
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,960
And with Yu Lan's introduction,

135
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,200
I'm even more interested.

136
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,760
Thank you.

137
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,240
So, at this afternoon's seminar,

138
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,760
I'd like you to give a speech.

139
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,200
Maybe it's a bit sudden.

140
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,080
Gu Ran mentioned that you're here.

141
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,960
Kang said

142
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,040
that I highly recommended you
as a contestant.

143
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,240
So we decided to let you give a speech.

144
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
Cherish this opportunity.

145
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,920
Make the most of it.

146
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,280
Sure, absolutely.

147
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,240
Alright, I'll go to the restroom.

148
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,520
You guys chat.

149
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,240
Let me tell you,

150
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,640
this plum wine must be drunk properly.

151
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,360
You can't just drink it.
You need to eat the plums

152
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,520
to get the full essence.

153
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,640
Give it a try.

154
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,920
Really?

155
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,520
You need to eat two at once.

156
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,280
Two plums?

157
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,760
Right, for taste balance.

158
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,960
Then take a big gulp.

159
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,480
The flavor really comes alive.

160
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,920
Want to try?

161
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,520
Try one.

162
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,480
Come on.

163
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,400
Try it.

164
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,040
Right?

165
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,840
That's good!

166
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,920
I need another bottle.

167
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,640
Not so good.

168
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,960
The plum is really intoxicating.

169
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,640
I'm feeling drunk.

170
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,200
Not bad, right?

171
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,240
Try four this time.

172
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,920
Okay.

173
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,920
The seafood doesn't seem very fresh.

174
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,120
I'll arrange the meeting room in a bit.

175
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,040
Come with me.

176
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,760
No.

177
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,040
I'll go find Gu Ran.

178
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
Then you should hurry up.

179
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,120
I have many people to introduce you to.

180
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,840
Okay.

181
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,000
What have you eaten?

182
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,040
I feel like the seafood isn't fresh.

183
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,480
Pick some fresh ones.

184
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,560
Don't get a stomachache.

185
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,800
Thank you, Kang.

186
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,000
Wipe your mouth.

187
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,320
Yu Lan, I'll wait for you there.

188
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,040
Let me pick a plum for you.

189
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,680
Good.

190
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,360
Okay.

191
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,720
- Okay.
- I don't eat plums.

192
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,360
Young man,

193
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,240
when you were in the restroom just now,

194
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,360
did your phone fall in?

195
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,480
No.

196
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,360
Then why wash so vigorously?

197
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
You almost scrub yourself bald.

198
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,360
I love cleanliness.

199
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,720
It's good.

200
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,680
But that's enough.

201
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,600
Everyone shall save water.

202
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,440
Sure.

203
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,040
I'll be quick.

204
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
You finally come back.

205
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
You are back, huh?

206
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,600
What did you eat in the restroom?

207
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,880
Just eat your oysters!

208
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,480
I don't want these oysters.

209
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,320
Where is your manager?
I want to make a complaint.

210
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,600
As his girlfriend,
could you do something?

211
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,600
Sit down!

212
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,360
Alright.

213
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,720
What are you going to say
in your speech this afternoon?

214
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Secret for now.

215
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,480
There will be many experts there.

216
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
You are the only contestant
that can give a speech.

217
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,720
This was specially arranged by Kang.

218
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,120
You have to do your best.

219
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,880
He has invited a lot of

220
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
famous experts

221
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,600
and leaders from other institutions.

222
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,000
The success of the film festival

223
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,920
must attribute to him.

224
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,920
Yes.

225
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,120
I will try my best.

226
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
I will go prepare.

227
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,560
Let me see what he is eating
in the restroom.

228
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,104
Hey!

229
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,120
Idiot.

230
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,360
Distinguished leaders and teachers,

231
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
I am Li Yanhao

232
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,720
from Library Management Department
of Binhai University.

233
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,880
It's my great honor

234
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,480
to give this speech before you.

235
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
What are you doing?

236
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,560
What are you thinking about?

237
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,360
You scared me.

238
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,160
Have you prepared well for your speech?

239
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,720
I just wrote a few lines.

240
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,120
Got no clue.

241
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,320
That's not the truth, right?

242
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,320
You're nervous about
facing the president and Kang Yide,

243
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,920
aren't you?

244
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,880
Nervous? No way.

245
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,800
They ask me to speak, so I will

246
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,480
just talk about my plans.

247
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,240
Just with my disposable slippers,

248
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,560
I can convince them completely.

249
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,360
Then I'm relieved.

250
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,240
Try your best this afternoon.

251
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,680
You are the backbone of our team.

252
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,040
Keep it up!

253
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,680
Don't worry.

254
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,120
I have a question.

255
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,040
Where did you go?

256
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,800
Running by the sea and taking pictures.

257
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
Why didn't you take me?

258
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,240
You were asleep at that time.

259
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,120
I...

260
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,480
Couldn't you wake me up?

261
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,360
Besides,

262
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,120
why did you come back so late?

263
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,680
You might not believe

264
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,360
that I ran into my parents by the sea

265
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,800
and had breakfast with them.

266
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,040
Your parents are here?

267
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,560
I've wasted such a great opportunity.

268
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,160
What do you mean?

269
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,720
Nothing.

270
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,680
You should have taken me with you.

271
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,480
But my parents were there.

272
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,120
That wouldn't be appropriate.

273
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,800
What's inappropriate about it?

274
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,920
As the saying goes,

275
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,480
an ugly bride has to meet the in-laws
sooner or later.

276
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,160
Besides,

277
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,880
I'm not ugly, right?

278
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,800
Isn't it a bit early to say that?

279
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,600
Early?

280
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,800
I...

281
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,680
Listen,

282
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,240
if you leave me behind again...

283
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,480
Next time, I promise to go with you.

284
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,560
Leave me alone for the next hour.

285
00:13:24,915 --> 00:13:26,208
(No Smoking)

286
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,560
Don't be scared, man.

287
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,720
I'm fine.

288
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
I'll just wash my face.

289
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,680
Sir, are you in charge of this restroom?

290
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,800
What's this smell?

291
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,680
Come and smell it.

292
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,920
No.

293
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,120
No way.

294
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,160
You must smell it.

295
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,880
If you don't,

296
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,920
I'll complain about you!

297
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,040
Come on. Smell it.

298
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,680
Alright.

299
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,600
Let's give a round of applause

300
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,680
to welcome our leaders

301
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,040
to unveil the trophy

302
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,680
(University Film Festival)
for our film festival.

303
00:14:36,052 --> 00:14:38,528
(Let the Youth Take the Stage)

304
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,240
Thank you, dear teachers and leaders.

305
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,680
Thank you.

306
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,360
Please take your seat.

307
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,680
Distinguished leaders and teachers,
good afternoon.

308
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,560
I am Kang Yide from Binhai University.

309
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,040
I'm honored to invite you

310
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,120
to join the seminar
of our film festival.

311
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,680
Thank you.

312
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,920
The theme of our festival is

313
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,240
"Let the Youth Take the Stage".

314
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,920
We've done a lot for promotion.

315
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,920
Where did you get plums?

316
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,560
From the wine.

317
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,360
Really tasty.

318
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,440
I saved one for you.

319
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,000
So, my wish is

320
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,480
to expand this Film Festival

321
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
Into a grand event

322
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,360
involving all schools across the city.

323
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,560
As the initiator and organizer

324
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,000
of the event,

325
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,160
I hope that all leaders and teachers

326
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,800
could give us your full support.

327
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:45,360
(College Film Festival Seminar)

328
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,040
Next, let's invite

329
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,040
a participant from Binhai University

330
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,240
to give us a report.

331
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:52,920
Please.

332
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,920
(Let the Youth Take the Stage)

333
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,240
Distinguished leaders and teachers,
good afternoon.

334
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,800
I am Li Yanhao from

335
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,480
the Library Management Department
of Binhai University.

336
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,920
Great!

337
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,560
I feel very honored to be here

338
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,120
to give you the report.

339
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,040
I'm very happy

340
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,360
to participate in our film festival.

341
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,040
Who is that?

342
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,000
How much wine did he drink?

343
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,560
Oh,

344
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,560
here,

345
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,600
I'd like to discuss in depth with you

346
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,560
- about my concept of the film.
- Do something!

347
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,480
How? Teachers are all here.

348
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,480
A different kind of movie

349
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,040
- with innovative ideas.
- Come back!

350
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,480
- And then, as a college student,
- Come back!

351
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,360
I will also

352
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,920
work very hard to shoot my movie well

353
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
in the film festival.

354
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,160
By the way, we have

355
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,360
a very professional producer,

356
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,040
excellent makeup artists
and art department.

357
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,160
Right. There's also...

358
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,920
A good cameraman!

359
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,040
That's me!

360
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,120
Who is this?

361
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,720
Who is he?

362
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,560
I am the cameraman.

363
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,720
- He's drunk.
- Do you know him?

364
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,120
- Is he from our school?
- I don't know him.

365
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,800
No.

366
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,080
Look at what he is doing.

367
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,200
What's he here for?

368
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,560
I don't know him, either.

369
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,440
Look.

370
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,920
Look at him.

371
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,360
Why did you come up? Go down!

372
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,720
Go away.

373
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,080
Hello everyone, my name is Xiao Rang.

374
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,080
He is our cameraman.

375
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,600
Li Yanhao

376
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,600
has been my buddy for over ten years.

377
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
Growing up,

378
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,320
we always have clear roles.

379
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,960
He is leading, and I'm supporting.

380
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,360
He is flower and I am leaves.

381
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,360
He is Rukawa Kaede

382
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,600
and I am Sakuragi Hanamichi.

383
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Although he is rather ordinary,

384
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,960
and self-righteous,

385
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,080
as long as he believes he can make films

386
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,920
and be a director,

387
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,120
I'll have his back as the cameraman.

388
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,240
Right, he is very professional.

389
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,920
Let's take a break.

390
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,800
You know why he wants to be a director?

391
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,360
Do something!

392
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,080
For love!

393
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,600
Love?

394
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,120
He and...

395
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,840
Shut up.

396
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,480
We are young.

397
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,360
We must be brave.

398
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,600
- What's going on?
- Look at the young people.

399
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,440
(Let the Youth Take the Stage)
Let's go.

400
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,960
Go.

401
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,960
Are you crazy?

402
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,320
I won't go.

403
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,080
Hurry up.

404
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,080
Come down.

405
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,200
Go.

406
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:50,912
(University Student Film Festival
Seminar)

407
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,720
Didn't you promise

408
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,440
to help me with the film festival?

409
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,480
Yes, I did.

410
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,200
I am helping you now.

411
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,720
Think about it, without me,

412
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,320
could the film festival be so great?

413
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,320
But why didn't you

414
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,960
tell me that you decided to extend it

415
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,680
to all schools in the city?

416
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,960
It was a last-minute idea.

417
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,080
Since we are going to do it,

418
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,720
we should make it big, right?

419
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,600
I've done so much before.

420
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,960
I know you've done a lot

421
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,320
and made a lot of efforts.

422
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,600
But these are not enough.

423
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,320
Introducing someone like Li Yanhao

424
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,600
is not enough to make an impact.

425
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,960
Today he is...

426
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,720
Yu Lan.

427
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,440
You need to improve your abilities.

428
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,080
I've organized such a large meeting

429
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,840
with so many guests

430
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,440
attending our film Festival.

431
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,840
Li Yanhao and his friends

432
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
disrupted the event today,

433
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,320
but it doesn't matter.

434
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,600
Because of me,

435
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,320
leaders won't make a big deal of it.

436
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
- But I...
- Yu Lan.

437
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,840
Think it over.

438
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,440
A Film Festival organized
by a single school

439
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,080
and a city-wide one,

440
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
isn't it obvious

441
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,440
the latter has bigger influence?

442
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,840
For such a big event,

443
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,120
your abilities are not enough.

444
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,960
So I must be the top organizer.

445
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,720
I know you've made a lot of efforts

446
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,320
and gained a lot of experience.

447
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,200
So,

448
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,320
after it ends,
I'll issue you a certificate

449
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,200
in the name of the main organizer.

450
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,240
As a recognition of your work.

451
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,600
I don't want any certificates.

452
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
I just want to do it well

453
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,720
from the start to the end.

454
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,840
Now, I am helping you

455
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,320
to do this thing better.

456
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,720
To get more students involved

457
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,720
and expand our influence.

458
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,840
That's not what I want.

459
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,200
But this is what I want.

460
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,200
I've talked with the teacher.

461
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,200
It's decided.

462
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,440
From now on, I'll handle all matters

463
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,240
regarding the Film Festival.

464
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,720
If you're still willing to work with me,

465
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,840
join me.

466
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,240
If not,

467
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,600
go and enjoy your summer vacation.

468
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,440
Awake now?

469
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,320
Why am I here?

470
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,960
Remember what you did this afternoon?

471
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,080
What did I do?

472
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,440
Shame on you.

473
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,480
You got drunk

474
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,080
and disrupted the seminar.

475
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,840
We wheel you back on a cart.

476
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,480
Xu Xiangdong

477
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,960
forced me to eat those plums.

478
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,960
I was sober

479
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,600
until I ate the plums.

480
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,600
I don't know you can be so strong
when you got drunk.

481
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,920
We couldn't hold you down.

482
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,840
I was careless.

483
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,040
I think

484
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,320
leaving Li Jiatong to wash all dishes

485
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
isn't quite appropriate.

486
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,200
Then you go help her.

487
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,320
What's inappropriate about it?

488
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,200
We cook, and she washes dishes.

489
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,240
Isn't that fair?

490
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
It is.

491
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
But I think

492
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,600
you should take a look.

493
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,240
Take a look?

494
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,720
Okay.

495
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,200
Li Yanhao

496
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,600
films to chase another girl,

497
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,720
leaving me washing dishes.

498
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,320
I'll make you pay.

499
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,840
Make you pay!

500
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,960
Who will pay?

501
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,440
One minute later,

502
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,440
it will be you.

503
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
So angry, huh?

504
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,440
They made me come to help you.

505
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,080
You've finished it all, haven't you?

506
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,320
They sent you to help me?

507
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,200
What about you?

508
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,600
I told them

509
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,960
you wouldn't need my help.

510
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,600
You can do it

511
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
perfectly and happily.

512
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,320
See?

513
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
I'm right.

514
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,560
Good job!

515
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,960
Good job?

516
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,840
Bye.

517
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,080
Li Yanhao!

518
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,120
See, you guys,

519
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,960
I listened to you and went to help,

520
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,080
but she didn't need it.

521
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,080
Alright, then I'll go for a walk.

522
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,440
Walk a long way after a meal,
and one could live long.

523
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,600
Live long?

524
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,320
When you come back, you're doomed!

525
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,840
Young man!

526
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,960
Come here!

527
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,080
(Natural coconut)
Buy a delicious coconut and try.

528
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,680
Alright?

529
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,440
How much is it?

530
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,320
Thirty yuan each.

531
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,600
That's expensive.

532
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,200
Not at all!

533
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,320
Let me tell you,

534
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,600
the people here

535
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,120
all do business honestly.

536
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,960
No one scams customers.

537
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,440
Sure.

538
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,440
It's great.

539
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,720
Don't hesitate anymore.

540
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,320
Buy a coconut.

541
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
I'll tell you a story.

542
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,840
What story?

543
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,320
Do you want to hear a ghost story?

544
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,720
Thirty, right?

545
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,552
Correct.

546
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,720
Here.

547
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,920
Alright.

548
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,840
Then have a taste.

549
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,080
It's really tasty.

550
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,120
Tell me the ghost story.

551
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,720
Oh, there is no ghost story.

552
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,080
It was just a joke!

553
00:24:56,736 --> 00:24:57,320
Hey,

554
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,480
how can you do that?

555
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,720
You said you won't scam people.

556
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,840
Well...

557
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,120
Listen to me.

558
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,840
Look over there.

559
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,440
Isn't it very scary?

560
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,720
Is she jumping into the sea?

561
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:26,960
Hello?

562
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,320
Yu Lan?

563
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,960
Where's Li Yanhao?

564
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,080
He went out

565
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,440
and said something about walking

566
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,840
after meals for living long.

567
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,840
What?

568
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,480
I think you can find him by the seaside.

569
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,080
Li Yanhao!

570
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,960
He dared to leave me alone again!

571
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,960
You're dead meat!

572
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,080
I'm not about jumping into the sea.

573
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,600
I just want to stand alone for a bit.

574
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,360
But you

575
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,080
stand on such a dark coast alone.

576
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,040
What's anyone supposed to think?

577
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,080
I need some time to think.

578
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,600
I messed the meeting up this afternoon.

579
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,960
Did your senior give you a hard time?

580
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,200
I'm sorry about this afternoon.

581
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,840
Actually, you don't need to apologize.

582
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,600
It's my fault not being better prepared.

583
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,080
You've already done well enough.

584
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,200
You are one of the most hardworking

585
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,120
people that I know.

586
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,600
Since we were kids,

587
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,960
I've changed a lot, right?

588
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,920
When we were kids...

589
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,720
Oh, you remember our childhood?

590
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,360
The first time we met,

591
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,720
I recognized you instantly.

592
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,080
Then

593
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,240
why did you pretend not to recognize me?

594
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,720
It drove me crazy wondering all day.

595
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,840
What were you wondering about?

596
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,720
I...

597
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,240
I was just thinking,

598
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,960
why you don't remember

599
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
the things back then.

600
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,960
Could it be caused by

601
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,080
an illness

602
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,240
or a car accident?

603
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,600
Or perhaps there's some other reason

604
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,080
that led to amnesia?

605
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,720
I didn't forget about childhood.

606
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
Nor did I fall sick.

607
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,080
But I did have a car accident
when I was little.

608
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,480
That's when my parents passed away.

609
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,360
I'm sorry.

610
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,840
After that,

611
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,480
I moved in with Gu Ran's family.

612
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,200
She is my cousin.

613
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
They were all kind to me.

614
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,320
But I still felt

615
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,720
like I didn't belong.

616
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:01,960
(Natural Coconut)

617
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,200
Hey, what are you doing?

618
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
You!

619
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,600
I changed a lot after that.

620
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,600
I told myself

621
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,200
that nobody in this world could help me.

622
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,600
I could only rely on myself.

623
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,720
So when I was in high school,

624
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,240
I started doing part-time jobs,
like online translation.

625
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,600
I earned scholarships every year.

626
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,240
I never asked for a penny from anyone.

627
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,080
In my first year of university,

628
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,840
I began to do social practice.

629
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,840
I worked hard
to be the student union president

630
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,720
and tried very hard
to make this Film Festival a success.

631
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,320
I've done all this

632
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,240
to prove

633
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,600
that I can live well on my own.

634
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,440
Actually, you've done well enough.

635
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,600
Look, at school,

636
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,080
you are admired by all the boys.

637
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,240
Without you, this festival

638
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,840
wouldn't have gone so smoothly.

639
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,360
Right?

640
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,360
The Film Festival

641
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,480
has already become city-wide in scale.

642
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,720
It has grown beyond my control.

643
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,720
I decide to step down.

644
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,440
Why?

645
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,600
I am a bit

646
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,600
tired.

647
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,720
Hey, miss.

648
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,440
Do you know that man

649
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,800
or that woman?

650
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,720
I know them both.

651
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,080
You like him, don't you?

652
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,080
How did you know?

653
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
I'm not blind.

654
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,440
This is the coconut he bought.

655
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,600
He only took one sip.

656
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,320
Good. I'm a bit thirsty now.

657
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,840
Actually, there's nothing
I can't tell you now.

658
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,600
My initial reason
for joining the Film Festival

659
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,080
was because of you.

660
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,320
To get closer to me, right?

661
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,360
You must work hard.

662
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,600
Among all the contestants,

663
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
I believe in you most.

664
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,320
I will do my best.

665
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,920
I think Li Jiatong really likes you.

666
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,720
You'd make a good pair.

667
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,840
She is such a good girl.

668
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,600
You should cherish her.

669
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,200
After talking to you today,

670
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,720
I feel much better now.

671
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,440
Me too.

672
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,080
It's also a closure

673
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,120
for the little Li Yanhao.

674
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,840
By the way,

675
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,600
we are all at Xu Xiangdong's place,

676
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,720
including Gu Ran.

677
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,240
You coming?

678
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,720
No.

679
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,960
I have to go back

680
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,960
and talk with Kang Yide.

681
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,840
Okay.

682
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
Then I'm leaving.

683
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,960
Take care.

684
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:01,840
Bye-bye.

685
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,440
Bye-bye.

686
00:31:05,108 --> 00:31:08,864
(Small Wooden Stool)

687
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,120
Sad?

688
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,720
It's not too late to chase her now.

689
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,840
You scared me.

690
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,840
Why are you here?

691
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,080
Why can't I come?

692
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,360
You and the president can come,
but I can't?

693
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,080
That's not what I meant.

694
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,920
Then what do you mean?

695
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,320
If you leave me behind again,
you're dead meat.

696
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,360
Dead meat!

697
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:32,960
Ouch!

698
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,320
- Dead meat!
- Alright, alright.

699
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,240
I apologize!

700
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,080
That's better.

701
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,600
She just left.

702
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,080
Why didn't you escort her? It's late.

703
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,200
Because you come.

704
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,360
If you hadn't come,

705
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,080
I'd have caught up to her.

706
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,840
You mean it's because of me?

707
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,320
What do you mean? Be clear!

708
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,960
(Seafood Mini Hotpot)

709
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,600
Right.

710
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,720
Right about what? Explain it!

711
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,960
What's there to explain?

712
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,320
Actions speak louder than words.

713
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,960
How did you get it?

714
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,120
You bought it. The vendor gave it to me.

715
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,120
I've finished it.

716
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,600
You finished it?

717
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,240
Then why give it to me?

718
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
To mask the stinky fish smell on you.

719
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,440
How do you know the smell

720
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,240
is from me?

721
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,440
I'm not a fool as Xiao Rang.

722
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:18,960
I knew

723
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,240
it was you instantly.

724
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,960
Stinky fish! Stinky fish!

725
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,080
Eat it.

726
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,720
Here comes the wine.

727
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,960
Can you move it farther away?

728
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,080
It makes me want to vomit.

729
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,240
You deserve it.

730
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,840
For drinking so much in the afternoon,

731
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,720
it should be here to make you nauseous.

732
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,840
Our great cameraman is awake!

733
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,320
I'm sorry about this afternoon.

734
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,080
Only apologizing to him?

735
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,960
Look at what you've done to my back!

736
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,080
Don't look at me. I'm fine.

737
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,320
The situation was so tense.

738
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,440
A little hurt was normal.

739
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,080
But the injuries on you
were probably my fault.

740
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,320
Then let me down a bottle

741
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,360
as an apology to everyone.

742
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,240
A bottle? Are you crazy?

743
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,320
Alright.

744
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
I announce

745
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,720
that from tomorrow,

746
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,840
our holiday is officially over.

747
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,720
Return to school

748
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,960
and get ready to finalize our film.

749
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,720
Three days from now,
we officially start shooting!

750
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
Great!

751
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,840
Let's celebrate it.

752
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,960
Cheers!

753
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,480
Cheers.

754
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,240
Sir,

755
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,600
just let me resign.

756
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,840
