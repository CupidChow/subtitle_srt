81
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
What do you mean by that?

Look at the abrasion.

130
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,960
It's too serious.

131
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,760
Go to the hospital.

132
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,920

Was it that bunny girl?

142
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,200
No. We bumped into each other
while running.

143
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,920
It'll soon heal.

144
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,560
I'm really fine.

145
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,080
Hurry. Let go. I'm really fine.

146
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,400
You can still laugh?

147
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,480
Such a lousy job.

148
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,360
We got no experience,

149
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,280
just ending up hurt.

150
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,800
Wait.

151
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
This...this is normal.

152
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
I used to work with a production crew.

153
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Just one day,
eight people broke their ribs.

154
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,080
What drama?
Let's find it and take a look.

155
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,480
Such a big accident occurred.

156
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,960
This drama can't be aired, right?

157
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,800
These eight people

158
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,520
kept looking for troubles with the crew.

159
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,520
How did it end?

160
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,800
I settled it.

161
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,240
How?

162
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,240
One hundred thousand yuan for each one.

163
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,080
One hundred thousand?

164
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,080

165
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,680
Awesome.

166
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,800
One hundred thousand yuan!

167
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,800
What do you know?

168
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,240
That's why I say
making movies costs money.

169
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,960
Money can solve problems.

170
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,920
So the next step.

171
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,520
The next step.

172
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,920
You three were deceived like this.

173
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,120
Still have the nerve to eat?

174
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
Go to class. Get moving.

175
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,680
It's time for lunch.

176
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,920
Lunch? Go.

177
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,680
I'm here for lunch.

178
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,240
You go, too.

179
00:08:48,352 --> 00:08:49,040
Alright.

180
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,480
Bye.

181
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,480
Why no lunch
just because we were deceived?

182
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,680
I came for lunch.

183
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,480

184
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,240
Take Big Head and Blackie to meet me

185
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,480
at the canteen right now.

186
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,480
Don't ask. Just bring them here now.

187
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,040
What's the plan next?

188
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,880
I think we should

189
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,240
go and ask that bunny girl.

190
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:19,232
She doesn't look like a bad girl.

191
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,440
Oh, my.

192
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,720
Doesn't look like a bad girl.

193
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,480
Look at how miserable we are. Still go?

194
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,600
Is it possible that

195
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,360
the bunny girl was threatened by those

196
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,160
evil forces?

197
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,680
She had to deceive us.

198
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,120
We should go save her.

199
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,240
A hero rescues the beauty.

200
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,360
I think

201
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,560
you are not suited to be a photographer.

202
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,720
You should do screenwriting,

203
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,800
so good at making stuff up.

204
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,650
(Money Transfer)

205
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,480
I have accurate intuitions.

206
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,480
Accurate?

207
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,040
Tell me when?

208
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,600
What's your opinion?

209
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,920
Make money.

210
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,120
Make money.

211
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,800
To produce good works,

212
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,720
we need money

213
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
for hiring actors,

214
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,240
and staff,

215
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,320
and renting venues,

216
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,800
and equipment.

217
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,240
Equipment?

218
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,920
We already have.

219
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,560
Put away the trash in your hands.

220
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,160
I mean professional equipment.

221
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,440
Creating a masterpiece
requires big production.

222
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,240
Big production requires a lot of money.

223
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,680
I just want to shoot some short videos.

224
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,600
But those look cheap.

225
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,480
But my skills shine this way.

226
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,800
Your skills need financial support.

227
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,120
Think about that new technology,

228
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,560
and images from good technology.

229
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,480
Come here a bit.

230
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,680
What's wrong?

231
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,120
What's wrong?

232
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,880
It's too sunny.

233
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,480
No, you...

234
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,360
Go on.

235
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,560
Where was I?

236
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,920
Make money.

237
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,680
Right, make money.

238
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,480
He gets it.

239
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
To make money,
you have to have money, right?

240
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,240
Only when you have money, can you...

241
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,680
If you don't have money, you... Right?

242
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,800
Yanhao, I have high hopes for you.

243
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,680
You have the talent
to be a great director.

244
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,680
What do you need?

245
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,160
A good work.

246
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,680
After you finish this work,

247
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,560
you can win awards, the prize money,

248
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,360
and everyone's recognition, right?

249
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,040
We two will help you with all our might.

250
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,680
What is needed?

251
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,920
Investment.

252
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,680
What's investment? It's money.

253
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,040
So, what do we do now?

254
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,480
We've just got to make money.

255
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
It's weekend tomorrow.

256
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
I'll take you two

257
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,480
to make money.

258
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,240
Look.

259
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,360
I still have some things to do.

260
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,120
You have half a day to prepare.

261
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,600
At 7 AM tomorrow,

262
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,680
we'll meet at the gate.

263
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,320
Then I'm leaving.

264
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,480
You won't drink the water?

265
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,440
I'll throw bottles away.

266
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,000
I...

267
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,880
See you at 7 AM tomorrow.

268
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,680
Did you get it?

269
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,560
The canteen serves braised pork.

270
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,320
I specially chose here for you.

271
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,160
Pretty nice, huh?

272
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,000
Very nice.

273
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,120
If it's not enough, you can have more.

274
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,320
That would be great.

275
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,040
Stop for a moment. Check it.

276
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,320
Auntie.

277
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,440
More braised pork.

278
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,680
You do have big appetites.

279
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,920
It's the fifth serving.

280
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,680
They can really eat a lot.

281
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,320
Serve it first.

282
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
I'll pay later.

283
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,560
No worry. You can have all these.

284
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,920
So supportive of my business.

285
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,800
Really?

286
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,120
Sure.

287
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,560
Next time,
I'll bring all girls in my class.

288
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,480
Okay.

289
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,680
Stop for a while.

290
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,560
Have you seen clearly who they are?

291
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,320
Isn't it Hua and his men?

292
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,120
What's up?

293
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,800
Hua?

294
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,480
You know him?

295
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,040
We drank together before.

296
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,360
Not very well acquainted.

297
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,880
They always make

298
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,120
prank videos.

299
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,240
Just play tricks on pedestrians
and then flee.

300
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,480

301
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240

394
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,160
He's already in position.

395
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,320
The hidden camera?

396
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,560
Hua said it's ready.

397
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,600
When they get to the innermost place,

398
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,600
you pretend to be possessed by a ghost.

399
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,480
Make it convincing.

400
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,120
Don't worry.

401
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,560
This is my forte.

402
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,160
All the props are ready.

403
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,720
Sir,

404
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,960
what's the deal with all this?

405
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,080
None of your business.

406
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,440
Tell me, or I'll quit.

407
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
Alright, no big deal.

408
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,440
I confessed to the girl who's coming

409
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,080
multiple times, but I were rejected.

410
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,560
She likes thrilling stuff.

411
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,200
When she's totally freaked out,

412
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,960
I'll rush in to confess to her again.

413
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,840
You just shoot another video

414
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,320
and it can go viral again.

415
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,200
What if you fail again?

416
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,560
Why don't you think of
something good for me?

417
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,360
Where is she?

418
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,200
Right here.

419
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,240
This...

420
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,600
You've got good taste.

421
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,480
What's it about?

422
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,680
Nothing.

423
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,600
Wait, is this place okay?

424
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,480
Don't you trust my choice?

425
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,360
What's her job?

426
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,560
Tour guide?

427
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,600
I don't need her.

428
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,600
I can go by myself.

429
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,080
I heard this place is quite scary.

430
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,080
It's good to have companions.

431
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,720
You're not going?

432
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,840
I'll wait outside.

433
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,200
I'll leave such a thrilling adventure
to you two.

434
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,720
Hurry up.

435
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,080
Do you know why I'm here today?

436
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,080
How can I know if you don't tell me?

437
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,440
I'm here to find something.

438
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,080
So what?

439
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,200
I'm not scared, anyway.

440
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,960
I didn't say you would be scared.

441
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,320
It's just that it is very weird today.

442
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,840
Lots of things will be out and about.

443
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
How do you know it's weird here?

444
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,200
Because

445
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
since I was young, I can see

446
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,200
ghosts.

447
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,440
Let's just go back.

448
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,320
You come back here.

449
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,080
I'm not done yet.

450
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
How can you leave now?

451
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,440
What... What else will you do?

452
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,960
Well, I will find...

453
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,200
Ghost.

454
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,600
Ghost!

455
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,600
Don't be scared.

456
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,600
Are you sure?

457
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,720
There's nothing there.

458
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,720
Check it again.

459
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,840
It's really there.

460
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,960
Check it again.

461
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
The ghost is over there.

462
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,840
Ghost! Ghost!

463
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,840
I'm just kidding. There's nothing.

464
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,720
Take a good look.

465
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,600
Is it there?

466
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,600
Nothing, right?

467
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
Ghost!

468
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,600
You are so timid,
yet trying to frighten others?

469
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,960
I just had a smoke.

470
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,960
What's the situation?

471
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,080
You must be Hua, right?

472
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,320
She fainted from fear.

473
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
Are you crazy?

474
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,320
My eyes.

475
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,840
Come out. Stop hiding.

476
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,080
Take this.

477
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,200
You filmed those prank videos, right?

478
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,200
Do you think you're really that funny?

479
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,320
Naive.

480
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,720
Who are you? What's it to you?

481
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,200
None of your business.

482
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,080
Let me ask you.

483
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,840
Are there videos of Li Yanhao in here?

484
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,200
What video? I don't know.

485
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,960
This is mine now.

486
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,840
If you make prank videos again,

487
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,600
you're done.

488
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:20,840
Let's go.

489
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,600
Mr. Feng.

490
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,560
Is it done?

491
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,080
Of course.

492
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,200
Done in a short time.

493
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:34,960
This disguise

494
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,600
would make ghosts shiver.

495
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,600
Right.

496
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,600
Tomorrow, film a set of that...

497
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,320
Cosplay videos, right?

498
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,200
Right, right.

499
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,600
It's a piece of cake.

500
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,600
This place is weird indeed.

501
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,560
-I'll check the video.
-I'll drive.

502
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,720
Why so late?

503
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,440
So early. I didn't get enough sleep.

504
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,560
Such a weekend

505
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,720
was ruined by you.

506
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,200
There is a saying

507
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,440
that the early bird catches the worm.

508
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,080
Where do we make money?

509
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,960
You'll know upon arrival.

510
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,440
First, let's clarify.

511
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,960
We don't peel shrimps for anyone.

512
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,320
Would I ask you to do that?

513
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:29,960
Besides,

514
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,440
it's not a team task.

515
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,440
Are you ready?

516
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,200
Alright, let's go.

517
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:36,960
Let's go.

518
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,320
Wait for me.

519
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,200
Look. Look.

520
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,960
She truly masters the art of hype.

521
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,840
Yeah.

522
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,200
Look how she shows her curves.

523
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,840
Just for men.

524
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,440
Let me tell you.

525
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,320
These girls

526
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,840
dressed in schoolgirl outfits

527
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,440
might look all innocent,

528
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,720
but are not decent.

529
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
Schoolgirl outfits

530
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,080
are used to seduce the men.

531
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,320
Choosing attire is personal freedom.

532
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Gossiping about and bad-mouthing others

533
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,080
is so low-class.

534
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,840
You can be educated.

535
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,600
Looks can be covered up.

536
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,960
A bad character is hard to change.

537
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,720
You...

538
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,440
Forget it.

539
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,960
I won't stoop to your level.

540
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,200
You're not welcome.

541
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,080
Please leave here.

542
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,840
Who are you then?

543
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,840
You became the student union president

544
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,720
because of men, didn't you?

545
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,720
This is none of your business.

546
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,840
Please leave.

547
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,720
Is everyone here?

548
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,680
This Film Festival we'll hold

549
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,680
may seem like just another event.

550
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,440
But it's actually creating a platform
for students from Art Department

551
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,840
and film enthusiasts

552
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,440
to explore more possibilities.

553
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,720
We're trying to find a more coherent way

554
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,200
of understanding the world
through our own lens.

555
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,080
And this way will transform,

556
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,200
becoming incredibly powerful.

557
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,600
That's my stance.

558
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,440
Now, let's hear

559
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,320
what you think

560
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,600
and discuss this together.

561
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,720
You arrived late.

562
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,200
Lunchtime has passed.

563
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,480
Get to work now and then have dinner.

564
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
Another one is drunk?

565
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,560
Okay, I got it.

566
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,320
Don't save detergent for me.

567
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,960
Remember.

568
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,320
Flies slip when they land.

569
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,680
Mosquitoes do the splits.

570
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
Okay, get to work.

571
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,440
It's just a piece of cake.

572
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,320
I've handled

573
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,680
sixteen weddings alone before.

574
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,200
Let's go.

575
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,360
Well, Yanhao.

576
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,680
That one is yours.

577
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,320
Xiao Rang, you come here.

578
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,200
I'll take this. Hardest to clean.

579
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,320
Look, there's a pot here.

580
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,120
Clean it up.

581
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,080
Clean it up.

582
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,920
Mr. Dong.

583
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,960
We will make movies.

584
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,040
Why are we washing dishes here?

585
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,080
That's right.

586
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,320
You want to make movies.

587
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,440
What's required then?

588
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,800
Resonating with audience.

589
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,920
How to create resonance?

590
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,200
By experiencing life.

591
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,120
Washing dishes
is a way to experience life.

592
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,040
Not on an empty stomach.

593
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,560
You had a bun this morning.

594
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,680
We've been on an empty stomach till now.

595
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,800
Director Yanhao, great to see you.

596
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,920
I'm your fan.

597
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,800
When can you create a masterpiece?

598
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,320

599

I like you the most
when you carry a camera.

600
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,360
You need this detergent
to remove your grease.

601
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,080
Okay, stop.

602
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,480
What the heck is this?

603
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,360
Stop it.

604
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:34,960
Stop it.

605
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,320
Listen to me.

606
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,800
We're a team now.

607
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,840
So we gotta have that team spirit.

608
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,920
And we are always the fattest.
