=Episode 14=
(Look at Me!)

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,560
Xiao Rang.

63
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,360
Last night I saw you
staring at the book like this.

64
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,840
What were you doing?

65
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,920
You don't get it.
It's called instilling.

66
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,480
In case it didn't work,

67
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,560
I even placed this book

68
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,840
under my head when I slept.

69
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,280
So when I was sleeping,

70
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,000
the knowledge

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,640
would keep flowing into my mind.

72
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,200
Now my head is full of knowledge.

73
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,760
What will you do if you fail the exam?

74
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,200
Don't say such inauspicious things.

75
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,480
Listen. This method

76
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,560
has been passed down

77
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,040
by a revered senior in our school.

78
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,920
It always works.

79
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,680
Which senior?

80
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,920
I'm unaware of this.

81
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,640
Mind your own business.

82
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,960
Write. Take your time.

83
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,840
Anyway, there's still plenty of time.

84
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,360
You don't study well usually.

85
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,520
Now you can't finish writing.

86
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,080
Give it to me.

87
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,360
Alright, stop frowning.

88
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,240
Maybe

89
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,840
the professor will let you pass.

90
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,960
How can I pass?
I didn't even finish writing.

91
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,840
Even if I am lucky, it's no use.

92
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,560
I heard

93
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,840
that you placed the book there

94
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,400
and absorbed it.

95
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,840
to get the knowledge into your mind.

96
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,520
Huh?

97
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,080
He placed the book under his head

98
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,960
to absorb it at night.

99
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,960
Listen.

100
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,680
I've been studying for so many years.

101
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,240
I've never heard of such a thing.

102
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,928
Stop talking. You know what?

103
00:05:20,928 --> 00:05:21,800
I was deceived

104
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
by the so-called seniors just like you.

105
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,120
How did you do?

106
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,960
I did fine on the exam.

107
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,360
Why hasn't Ren Ze finished his exam
and come out?

108
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,400
The art students'

109
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,960
exams always take three to four hours.

110
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,520
What if they want to use the toilet?

111
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,360
They can just go.

112
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,640
They each paint on their own.

113
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,120
Alright, no more chatter.

114
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,280
I'll review the content
for tomorrow's exam.

115
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,960
I will give you a tip.

116
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,960
Before tomorrow's exam,

117
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,640
go find the proctor.

118
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,280
And then?

119
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,640
Kowtow three times.

120
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,080
He might be happy and let you pass.

121
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,280
- Scram.
- I'm leaving.

122
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,840
Scram now.

123
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,360
He's so annoying.

124
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,640
What's on your mind?

125
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,120
Nothing much.

126
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
I just feel time goes by so fast.

127
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,640
Suddenly, it's the final exams.

128
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,280
And what's on your mind?

129
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,280
Maybe I should go to the teacher

130
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,400
and kowtow three times to him.

131
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,040
You...

132
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,120
Listen. You still have to review.

133
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
Don't resort
to these opportunistic tricks.

134
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,040
Reviewing is the true path, you know?

135
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,200
I'll review.

136
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,480
I'll go back and study.

137
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,480
Go ahead.

138
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,920
I'm off.

139
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,680
Bye.

140
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,200
Why are you here?

141
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,200
Move over there.

142
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,520
As far as I know,

143
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,280
the students who don't do well on exams

144
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,920
all love to come here and space out.

145
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,960
Did you fail the exam?

146
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Who said that?

147
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,360
I did quite well.

148
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,760
I don't believe you.

149
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,520
What are you doing alone here?

150
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
I'm just thinking

151
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,040
how fast time flies.

152
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,480
The final exams are here so soon.

153
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,280
Many things have happened
during this time.

154
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,760
Many things have happened?

155
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,640
Good or bad ones?

156
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,120
Both, I guess.

157
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,680
Well, the good thing
must be meeting me, right?

158
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,920
And the bad one?

159
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,480
It's also meeting you.

160
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,200
I'm off. Bye.

161
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,640
Where are you going?

162
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,680
I'm making a beautiful thing happen.

163
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,920
I'm in.

164
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,712
It's been a while.
Haven't you figured it out yet?

165
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,120
He is going to propose.

166
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,920
It's an important life event.

167
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,920
I need to think it over.

168
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,640
Stop fiddling with your fingers.

169
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,640
You're the one who's proposing.
Think, will you?

170
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,040
If I had an idea,

171
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,640
I wouldn't have come to you.

172
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,480
Two fools.

173
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,400
Tell me.

174
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,200
What's her favorite thing?

175
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,960
She likes us

176
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,960
to study hard

177
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
and not fail any exams.

178
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,560
Thing.

179
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,920
I mean, a thing.

180
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,200
Is failing an exam a thing?

181
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,040
How would I know?

182
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,360
Why don't you ask him?

183
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,760
I don't know either.

184
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,480
I've been with her for so long.

185
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,280
She's never asked me
to give her anything.

186
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,040
Wait.

187
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,960
She's never asked you.

188
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,200
So you never gave her anything?

189
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,200
Another dumb guy.

190
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
What's with 'another'?

191
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,800
You tell me.

192
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,160
Here is my advice.

193
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't overthink for now.

194
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,560
Just go straight
to the last step, the proposal.

195
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Have you bought the ring?

196
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,480
I've prepared the ring.

197
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,440
The main thing is how to propose.

198
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,880
As far as I know,

199
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,480
a proposal must be a surprise.

200
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,360
How do you know that?

201
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,720
I... I've learned it from movies.

202
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,920
Don't interrupt.

203
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,040
Here's the thing.

204
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
First,

205
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,320
you must make the proposal a surprise.

206
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,040
Second, you must be sincerely earnest.

207
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,720
You're fine in that aspect.

208
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,000
And you need to dress up more handsomely

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,880
to show you take it seriously.

210
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,920
Also, you need to showcase your talent.

211
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Do you have any talents?

212
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,680
Talents?

213
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
I can recite Pi.

214
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,440
Over 10,000 digits

215
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,600
after the decimal point.

216
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Anything else?

217
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,320
Else...

218
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,160
I am a doctor.

219
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,040
When performing surgeries on patients,

220
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,240
my hands are very steady.

221
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,160
Wait, bro.

222
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,680
Are you proposing or forcing a marriage?

223
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,360
Forget it. We can skip the talent part.

224
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,360
You can make an entrance directly.

225
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,160
Once you enter,
I will set the atmosphere

226
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,600
and play the music for you.

227
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,880
Then you can walk up to her stylishly,

228
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,440
take out the ring, and kneel to propose.

229
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,040
Kneel?

230
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,320
On one knee or both knees?

231
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,160
Why both knees?

232
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,040
I think kneeling on both knees
is steadier.

233
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:03,600
No.

234
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,040
A proposal must be on one knee, alright?

235
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Let me show you.

236
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,320
Let's pretend she's your girlfriend.

237
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,440
So when the time comes,

238
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,920
walk towards her with deep affection.

239
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,440
Kneel down on one knee before her.

240
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,000
Then hold the ring in your hand,

241
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,680
offer it to her, and ask,

242
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,440
"Will you marry me?"

243
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,240
I will.

244
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,040
See? It's done.

245
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,600
Right?

246
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,040
But if you kneel on both knees,

247
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,480
it will look weird. It'll be like...

248
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,360
Grandma, I have come to see you.

249
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,920
Right? It will have such an effect.

250
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,680
Grandson,

251
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,440
I've missed you too.

252
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,680
Grandma,

253
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,440
why did you die so early?

254
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
Grandson.

255
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,600
Stop that. I was just joking.

256
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,920
I... I was demonstrating for him.

257
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,360
See?

258
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,720
The effect is different, right?

259
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,880
Right?

260
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,320
It seems like you've made a point.

261
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,800
Right? Then let's do it this way.

262
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Let's first consider what we'll do...

263
00:11:13,812 --> 00:11:14,944
(Gu Ran)

264
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,720
Hello?

265
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,560
(Communication)
Join me in weightlifting in the gym.

266
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,240
What do you mean, 'Weightlifting'?

267
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,120
I'm failing my exams.

268
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,160
I have no time for that.

269
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,680
Do you care about anything serious?

270
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,560
I won't go.

271
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,440
Hello?

272
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,800
Good for you, daring to hang up on me.

273
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,480
I...

274
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,160
Quite manly, huh?

275
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,320
Xiao Rang,

276
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,320
you're done for.

277
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,320
What would you like to eat?

278
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,040
It's my treat.

279
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You're treating me?

280
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,440
Do you have money?

281
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,720
My dad transferred his case-dough
to me secretly.

282
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,240
Treating you to a meal is no problem.

283
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,000
That's a pity.

284
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I really can't eat today.

285
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,040
I have an exam tomorrow.

286
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,680
Are you sure?

287
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,600
Then you'll miss it for good.

288
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,360
Wait.

289
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,040
Why are you so eager to treat me today?

290
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,160
Something's off.

291
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,440
What do you mean?

292
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,920
Well,

293
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
you rehearsed with me
for Wu Zhihui for so long.

294
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,920
Isn't it right for me to treat you?

295
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,920
Just because of that?

296
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,560
Nothing else?

297
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
No need for the meal.

298
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,920
Just repeat the part

299
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,000
you showed Wu Zhihui

300
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,880
this afternoon.

301
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,920
Which part?

302
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,360
The 'marry me' part.

303
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,480
Well... That...

304
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,320
Well...

305
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,600
What?

306
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,600
Showing him is okay.

307
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,320
But I can't do it myself.

308
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,040
Will you do it?

309
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,720
How should I put this?

310
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,680
Will you do it or not?

311
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,560
Stop that.

312
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,320
I have a phone call coming in.

313
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,000
A phone call.

314
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,120
It's my dad.

315
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,440
Hello, Old Li

316
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,600
Yanhao,

317
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,040
I want to ask you something.

318
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,000
About the case-dough I gave you today,

319
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,320
can you lend it to me first?

320
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,600
I urgently need it.

321
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,000
The thing is,

322
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,480
I want to buy a gift for your mom

323
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,000
to give her a surprise.

324
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,120
Well, Old Li,

325
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,040
the given money is like splashed water.

326
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,600
How can you ask for it back?

327
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,800
If I return it,

328
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,240
how am I supposed to eat?

329
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,160
Should I starve?

330
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,040
Let Xiao Rang
buy you meals for two days.

331
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,440
Just hang in there.

332
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,560
When I get some money from your mom...

333
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,000
Wait.

334
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,040
Who are you with now?

335
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,480
Hello, Mr. Li.

336
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,880
I am Li Jiatong.

337
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,160
I'm his best friend.

338
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,720
Yes, she's my classmate.

339
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,360
What 'classmate'?

340
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,680
Mr. Li, we're more than that.

341
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,120
I am also his girl...

342
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,000
How about this?

343
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,600
I'll transfer the money to you.

344
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,000
I'll hang up first.

345
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,160
What was that?

346
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,360
Look how scared you got.

347
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,720
You...

348
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,320
Tell me.

349
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,880
Why couldn't I talk with your dad more?

350
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,600
You two don't know each other.

351
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,600
That would be awkward.

352
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,560
Awkward? I don't think so.

353
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,480
So you're giving the money back?

354
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,680
I have no choice.

355
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,160
Didn't you say you would treat me?

356
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,040
I will. Well...

357
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,480
I'll treat you.

358
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,040
Let's go.

359
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,880
That's my son.

360
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,920
She couldn't be his girlfriend,
could she?

361
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,880
Good for you, brat.

362
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,240
She's quite pretty.

363
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,160
Who's pretty?

364
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,880
You.

365
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,120
You're the prettiest.

366
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,680
You're even prettier with this scarf on.

367
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,720
Like a supermodel.

368
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,600
Then take a photo of me.

369
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,480
Okay.

370
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,720
Okay.

371
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,240
Turn on the filter.

372
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
You're pretty.

373
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,720
You look great without it.

374
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,720
You're so pretty.

375
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,000
Say it.

376
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,920
Say what?

377
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
I taught you yesterday.

378
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,920
I-I forgot.

379
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,880
Marry you.

380
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:11,880
Right.

381
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,000
Will you marry me?

382
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,800
I will.

383
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,160
Kiss here. Kiss her. Kiss her.

384
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,480
You are really something.

385
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,360
Ganging up to fool me, huh?

386
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
Whose idea was it? Tell me.

387
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,120
It has nothing to do with me.

388
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,320
It was all Li Yanhao's idea.

389
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,920
He insisted we distract you for a bit.

390
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,720
Look at him.

391
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,480
He's evil.

392
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,600
Even his burps stink.

393
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,040
Isn't it quite a surprise?

394
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,160
Proposing in the exam room.

395
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,480
It was your idea?

396
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
How is it, Ms. Jiang?

397
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,360
Has it met your expectations?

398
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,880
Met my expectations?

399
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,160
It's called forcing, alright?

400
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,320
It's not that bad.

401
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,960
What matters is the result.

402
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,480
Right?

403
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,720
Stop smiling.

404
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,360
You're either silent usually

405
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,360
or suddenly throw

406
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,600
such a huge s...

407
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,840
surprise on me.

408
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,720
He taught me all of this.

409
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,200
For the proposal,

410
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,840
he practiced with me for a long time.

411
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,960
The final exams are today.

412
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,600
And you had spare time
to rehearse with him yesterday?

413
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
I have already memorized

414
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,960
the review materials by heart.

415
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,440
It's a big event, after all.

416
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,360
Is that so?

417
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,320
If you dare fail the exams,

418
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,600
I'll make it hard for you.

419
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,240
And you.

420
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,600
What's wrong with you?

421
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,480
You hardly finished

422
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,960
the last major question yesterday.

423
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,720
It's because I was fooled

424
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,960
by the so-called experiences
of the seniors.

425
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,864
What experiences?

426
00:17:56,864 --> 00:17:57,440
Well, he tried

427
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,480
to instill the knowledge

428
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
in the book into him.

429
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,960
Don't listen to his nonsense.

430
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,360
So do you think I can pass?

431
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,480
Barely, I suppose.

432
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,840
I took a glance at your paper.

433
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,480
Really?

434
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,840
I was anxious.

435
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,440
I didn't sleep a wink all last night.

436
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,560
Is that so?

437
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,480
You were worried about the exam results?

438
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,600
If you keep fooling around,

439
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
you'd better be careful.

440
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,720
Alright, go out, all of you.

441
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,080
Bye.

442
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,720
Come back here.

443
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,240
What are you going out for?

444
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,480
Proposing in public

445
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,840
was quite hard for you, wasn't it?

446
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,320
Initially, it was indeed quite scary.

447
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,320
But then I felt that just one kneel

448
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,080
would be okay.

449
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,440
There were a lot of people.

450
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
So I didn't let you kneel for too long.

451
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,200
Now it's just the two of us.

452
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,320
Propose to me once more.

453
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,480
But... the ring is already on you.

454
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,320
I need to redo it?

455
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,320
Hurry up.

456
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,320
D-Did you kneel like this just now?

457
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,320
Pretty much.

458
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,320
Are you serving the Empress Dowager
with her clothes and makeup?

459
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,080
Pretty good.

460
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,480
I'm here to get something.

461
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,960
You guys continue.

462
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,200
Ms. Gao, I...

463
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:20,720
What is this?

464
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,320
Schedule.

465
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,320
So professional?

466
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,440
Professional?

467
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,200
That's for sure.

468
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,600
What is the schedule?

469
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,440
It's our short movie's filming schedule.

470
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:28,960
Bro,

471
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,200
the vacation is days away.

472
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,960
Have you decided when the filming starts

473
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,200
and what to film?

474
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,960
Also, shouldn't we have a talk

475
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,080
about the budget?

476
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,320
So, how much money do we need?

477
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,440
Check the list.

478
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
It's the money we have.

479
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
Tens, hundreds, thousands,
ten thousands...

480
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
It's 18,925.8 yuan.

481
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,840
Is that enough?

482
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,080
Sure.

483
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,480
This is all the money
we've earned from hard work.

484
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,840
And of course,

485
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,320
we can still film if it's not enough.

486
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,200
Where's the script after so long?

487
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,080
We're about to start.

488
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,320
You don't even have a script.

489
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,960
I have a rough idea for the script.

490
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,200
But I still need a breakthrough.

491
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,600
That's easy.

492
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,720
We can help you with that.

493
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,440
But we need to speed up the progress.

494
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,840
I can't spend my entire summer

495
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,840
helping you film a short movie, right?

496
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,080
Yes, you're right.

497
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,200
But as you know, scriptwriting

498
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,320
requires inspiration.

499
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,600
And inspiration...

500
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,840
I can't help you with inspiration.

501
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,960
Figure it out yourself.

502
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,600
But

503
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,440
I've written it.

504
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,080
The script must be done
by the first week of the summer.

505
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,480
Then, plus the time
for filming, post-production,

506
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,840
and adjustments,

507
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,840
we must finish filming before July 15th.

508
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,600
Otherwise, we won't be able to do it.

509
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,840
Understood.

510
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,440
Also, no matter what happens,

511
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,320
this schedule mustn't be changed.

512
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,720
Your script can be crap.

513
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,840
But it must exist.

514
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,080
Then, what should I do?

515
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,720
Make money.

516
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,840
Li Jiatong,

517
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,440
come out.

518
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,320
Ms. Zhao?

519
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,040
It's the first time I've seen a student
come to the classroom

520
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,600
to practice when the exams end.

521
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
Ms. Zhao, look at me.

522
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,440
How am I doing?

523
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,080
Quite well.

524
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,320
But I think

525
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
you still have a lot of room
for improvement.

526
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,840
Overall, your performance is normal.

527
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,320
That's good.

528
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,080
I'm relieved.

529
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,840
By the way,

530
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,840
the Beijing training camp
is starting soon.

531
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,440
When do you plan to set off?

532
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,480
I...

533
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,720
I'm not ready yet.

534
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,840
That's true.

535
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,200
You just finished the exams.

536
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,440
You should rest for a few days.

537
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,080
Ms. Zhao,

538
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,320
can I go next year instead?

539
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Next year is a different year.

540
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,320
It won't be the same.

541
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,320
I promised a classmate

542
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,480
to help him film a movie.

543
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,960
He's participating
in the school film festival.

544
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
What movie are you talking about?

545
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,960
It's no point in attending

546
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,200
a lousy film festival.

547
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,720
Have you forgotten

548
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,840
what I told you?

549
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,080
No, I haven't.

550
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,080
Then why are you not focused?

551
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,200
Sending you to Beijing for the training

552
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,080
is to keep you in shape

553
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,600
and not lose your skills
during the summer vacation.

554
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,600
I won't.

555
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,320
Don't think being the top in the class

556
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,200
is enough for you.

557
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,960
Going to Beijing

558
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,600
is for you to gain more experiences.

559
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,080
You need to know
there are many better dancers out there

560
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,200
for you to learn from.

561
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,080
I know.

562
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,320
But I've already made the promise.

563
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,320
To whom?

564
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,440
A classmate.

565
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,960
A male classmate, right?

566
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,960
Do you have feelings for him?

567
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,200
I...

568
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,080
No.

569
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,448
Hello?

570
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,600
Director.

571
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,320
Alright, I'll be right there.

572
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,720
Bye, Ms. Zhao.

573
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,200
Lu.

574
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,200
What's wrong?

575
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Are you okay?

576
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,440
She must be drinking black coffee
to suppress her appetite.

577
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,480
She's not eating properly.

578
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,960
We've already finished the exams.

579
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,200
Besides, you've gotten so thin.

580
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,440
Exactly, Lu

581
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,840
There's really no need for this.

582
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,720
It's for the training camp
in Beijing, right?

583
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,200
Ms. Zhao has chosen Li Jiatong.

584
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,360
Don't push yourself too hard.

585
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,840
It breaks our hearts to see this.

586
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,320
You guys go ahead.

587
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,600
I want to be alone for a while.

588
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,480
Lu, please don't feel bad.

589
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,440
We're all friends.

590
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,600
It doesn't matter who goes.

591
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,960
Li Jiatong has better conditions.

592
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,360
Fortune favors her.

593
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,080
Sometimes there's nothing you can do.

594
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,240
No, Lu.

595
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,320
That's not...

596
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,840
That's not what we think.

597
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,960
Don't take it to heart.

598
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,080
She just thinks that...

599
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,840
Are you two really foolish
or just pretending?

600
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,200
Do you have to stab me where it hurts?

601
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,600
No.

602
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,200
Here's what I think.

603
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,320
Upon return from Beijing,

604
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,200
she'll surely teach us
what she's learned.

605
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,440
So we'll learn those things

606
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,840
sooner or later.

607
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,080
Just eat and drink well this summer.

608
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,080
Take care of yourself.

609
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,600
You keep talking about Li Jiatong.

610
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,840
In your eyes,
am I always inferior to Li Jiatong?

611
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,080
No, it's not like that.

612
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,200
I can't stay here anymore.

613
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,200
Wait.

614
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,360
What happened?

615
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,080
I've told you not to say it.

616
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,080
I asked you to look at me.
Why wouldn't you?

617
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,440
- Why?
- I looked at you.

618
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,960
I asked you what's wrong.

619
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,200
I'm speechless.

620
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,600
I'm truly speechless.

621
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,200
I was telling the truth.

622
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,080
It was for her own good.

623
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,720
I heard you two were competing.

624
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,600
Yes, and I lost.

625
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,840
Given what you said,

626
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,360
I've started to like you.

627
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,200
Sir, I've finished the exam.

628
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,320
Sir, I've finished the exam as well.

629
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,200
How do you plan to spend the summer?

630
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,840
I'll help Li Yanhao
finish filming the movie first.

631
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,960
What about you?

632
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,040
I'll be going on a sketching trip
with the girls.

633
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,840
I'll also properly run

634
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,600
our family's gallery.

635
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,720
After all, you don't have an advantage
in this respect.

636
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,720
Maintain your advantage.

637
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,080
You're something, Ren Ze.

638
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,440
Liu Lu.

639
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,080
Ms. Zhao.

640
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,440
I need to talk to you.

641
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,080
Okay.

642
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,840
The exams are over.
Why don't I see you happier?

643
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,840
Well,

644
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,960
maybe it's because of the pressure

645
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,320
brought by the recent exams.

646
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,080
Do you feel that

647
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,600
as the class president, if you

648
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,720
don't do well in the exams,

649
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,320
you'll be laughed at?

650
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,080
I...

651
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,080
I'm your class teacher.

652
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,840
I know the students

653
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,200
in my class very well.

654
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,840
By the way, I called you here

655
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,840
to tell you

656
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,320
about the training camp in Beijing...

657
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,320
I know.

658
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,720
This year's spot
has been given to Li Jiatong.

659
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,080
Yes, I wanted her to go.

660
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,200
There was only one spot.

661
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,840
But I've noticed
that you have been working very hard

662
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,960
and made great progress.

663
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,440
So I have applied for another spot
from Beijing

664
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,360
so that you two can go together.

665
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,840
We'll go together?

666
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,600
That's right.

667
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,720
Don't you usually like to compete

668
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,600
with Li Jiatong?

669
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,360
I hope
that during this study trip to Beijing,

670
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,200
you two can have competition too.

671
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,080
I'll go together with her?

672
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,360
May I have your attention?

673
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,840
The participants in the Film Festival

674
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,720
will finish the works

675
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,200
during the summer vacation.

676
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,360
I will also stay at school
for the entire summer.

677
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,920
I wish all of you
a happy summer vacation.

678
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,960
Bravo.

679
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,600
I'm really curious.

680
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,720
You and Mr. Lei
don't share the same surname.

681
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
And you don't call him 'Dad'.

682
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,920
What's going on?

683
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,600
I've said before. It's my own business.

684
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,120
I guess so.

685
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,360
But Mr. Lei has increased our pay
by thirty percent.

686
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,440
For someone as stingy as him,
he raised our salary

687
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,840
because of you, right?

688
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,360
Mr. Lei isn't here right now.

689
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,240
Well, I'm not here to see him.

690
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,240
The bartender, either.

691
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,720
Go to the bar. Get yourself a beer.

692
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,240
I'm driving. No drinking for me.

693
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,080
I came to ask you about your movie.

694
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,680
You're even more anxious.

695
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,360
Are you still working on the movie?

696
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,840
I'm working on it.

697
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,920
I want to end it at the seaside.

698
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,240
I haven't decided how.

699
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,480
The seaside is good.

700
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,600
But if you don't go to the seaside,

701
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,360
how will you capture the seaside views?

702
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:12,960
Right?

703
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,120
Then it's settled.

704
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,320
I will take you to the seaside
for inspiration.

705
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,080
Don't.

706
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
Last time you said to take us
to a film crew.

707
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,120
It turned out to be a makeshift group.

708
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,840
If you take us to the sea,

709
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,240
I wonder what the trouble will be.

710
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,200
It's different now.

711
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
This time, I'll take you

712
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,720
to a nice place

713
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,600
where the views are great
and the people are outstanding.

714
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,720
Most importantly,
it's conducive to your creativity.

715
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,040
Alright then.

716
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,120
Everyone has been exhausted
from preparing

717
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
for the exams after all.

718
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,720
We can take the opportunity to relax.

719
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,360
What do you say?

720
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,840
I'm fine either way.

721
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,600
We're having fun together.
Why aren't you happy?

722
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,040
Where are you going?

723
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,800
We are

724
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,200
going nowhere.

725
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,440
Do I get to be part of it?

726
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,320
Aren't you going home
for the summer vacation?

727
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,120
My aunt is handling a movie thing
at school.

728
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,080
I don't have to go home.

729
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,120
Your aunt...

730
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,240
Yu Lan lives at your home?

731
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,120
That's right.

732
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,120
She's been living with us
since her parents died.

733
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,480
It wouldn't be convenient for us,

734
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,920
four men, to take you, a girl.

735
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,960
What are you doing

736
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,840
by sending me back?

737
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,240
Is there some kind of conspiracy?

738
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,560
Besides, you guys won't manage

739
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,440
without me.

740
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,960
What conspiracy could we possibly have?

741
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,480
The four of us
are going out for inspiration.

742
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,200
Why are you going?

743
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,120
To keep an eye on you.

744
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,720
I'm telling you.

745
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,320
If you dare not take me with you,

746
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:29,960
I'll kill you.

747
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,120
I just remembered

748
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,720
that you hung up on me earlier,

749
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,600
and it wasn't solved.

750
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,440
Come with me.

751
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,240
Stop it. Listen to me.

752
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,480
I can beat you.

753
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,600
I don't want to beat a girl.

754
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,840
Don't push your luck.

755
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,480
Is it fun?

756
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,840
No.

757
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,080
You don't find it fun?

758
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,920
Look at you, a bunch of bachelors
watching others

759
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,920
flirting and teasing.

760
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,960
And you aren't having fun?

761
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,840
Get back to work if you're done here.

762
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,360
Clean up this place
before the customers arrive.

763
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,600
Don't make me dock your pay.

764
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,240
Since you're here, have a drink.

765
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,960
I'm driving. No alcohol for me.

766
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,960
Wait a moment.

767
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,200
Come here to see me tomorrow.

768
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
I have a surprise.

769
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,200
I'll go to the sea.

770
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,320
I have no time for it.

771
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,200
I'll wait for you.

772
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,240
Let's see tomorrow.

773
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,720
You little rascal.

774
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,200
Ren Ze,

775
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,680
why aren't you going in?

776
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,240
I'll just wait here.

777
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,480
The equipment is inside.

778
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,080
I can give you a check-up.

779
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,240
I can't stand the smell
of the disinfectant.

780
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,960
Alright, then I'll go in first.

781
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,840
If you need anything, come to me.

782
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,720
Okay.

783
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,600
Dr. Zhou.

784
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,480
I'd like to ask for a favor from you.

785
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,120
This place is quite unique.

786
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,360
You wouldn't want me
to be your model, would you?

787
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,440
I can't do that.

788
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
When you usually paint...

789
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,920
You can just keep your clothes on.

790
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,600
Alright then.

791
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,240
Then you better paint well.

792
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,080
Tell me.

793
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,800
What are your requirements for me?

794
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,840
N-No particular requirements.

795
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,960
Just strike a comfortable pose.

796
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,600
Don't be so nervous.

797
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,200
I'm not nervous.

798
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,680
You're sweating.

799
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,688
It's my...

800
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,200
first time drawing a female.

801
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,680
Then let's get started.

802
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,472
Okay.

803
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,040
(It's no point in attending)

804
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,240
(a lousy film festival.)

805
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:20,960
(Going to Beijing)

806
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,600
(is for you to gain more experiences.)

807
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,680
Hello, Ms. Zhao.

808
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,080
Hello, Li Jiatong.

809
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,560
Come to the dance studio.

810
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,600
I'm coming right away.

811
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,240
Do you know why I'm seeing you so late?

812
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,920
I don't know.

813
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,960
Do you know why I have to meet you here?

814
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,080
I don't know.

815
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,360
Alright, now follow my instructions.

816
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,800
Stand in the center of the light.

817
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,040
Look straight ahead.
Chest out and head up.

818
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,960
Get into position.

819
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,800
Five, six, seven, eight.

820
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,600
I know you keep training
after your exams

821
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,320
to not fall behind
during the summer vacation.

822
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,840
That way,
you don't have to go to Beijing

823
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
for intensive training.

824
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,240
Right?

825
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
Ms. Zhao, I...

826
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,200
I just want to help Li Yanhao
make a good movie.

827
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,720
I know you like him.

828
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,240
But you are only a freshman.

829
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,600
You should know which is more important

830
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,720
between love and academics.

831
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,600
You know what?
I went to college in Beijing.

832
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,360
Back then, my dream

833
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,600
was to become a famous dancer.

834
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,200
Later, I met my current husband.

835
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,440
For him,

836
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,800
I gave up my lead role in the troupe

837
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,120
and returned here

838
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,800
to become a dance teacher.

839
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,600
I don't regret it after all these years.

840
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,800
But sometimes I do wonder

841
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,840
if I had stayed there

842
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,720
and continued dancing on stage,

843
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,200
whether that version of me

844
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,720
would be the real me.

845
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,920
But Ms. Zhao,

846
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,200
I feel like I still have many chances.

847
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,640
If you want to succeed,

848
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,360
you have to seize every chance.

849
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,400
Do you know how important

850
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,800
this training camp is?

851
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,400
Professors from all the major colleges
will be teaching.

852
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,240
It will be very helpful
for your future improvement.

853
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,200
Ms. Zhao, I...

854
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,240
Is he your boyfriend?

855
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:28,800
No.

856
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,720
Is he pursuing you?

857
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,240
No.

858
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,200
Has he confessed to you?

859
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,880
Then I think you can pack up
and prepare to go.
