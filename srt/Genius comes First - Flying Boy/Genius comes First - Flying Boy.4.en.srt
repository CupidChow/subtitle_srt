00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,320
This take is good enough, right?

43
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,600

from within.

00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,600
see that fear inside you.

56
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,240
Like, to dilate pupils.

57
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,320
Do you get it?

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,080
No, I mean...

59
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,800
To dilate pupils.

60
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,240
Not enough. More.

61
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,320
That's not it.

62
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
Why don't you get it?

63
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,080
Director, show me how to dilate pupils.

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,720
Fine, forget it.

65
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,440
Anyway, you're wearing contacts.

66
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,680
Just mind your expression.

67
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,800
Like you're in extreme fear.

68
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
In extreme fear, okay?

69
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,800

72
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,600
No way.

73
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,600
When he falls down,
your camera should follow.

74
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,680
Why did you stand still?

75
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,800
How am I supposed to do it?

76
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,960
What about the actress?

77
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,600
Can't you just edit it?

78
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,520
What?

79
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,240
I've told you

80
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,680
I am a director pursuing perfection.

81
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,960
We are filming a horror film.

82
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,040
That immersive feeling
will be gone with the edit.

83
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,720
Oh, my.

84
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,800
What immersive feeling?

85
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,440
You just don't know how to film.

86
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,080
Fine.

87
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,440
Film it your way.

88
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,080
Let's see if...

89
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,320
What? Again?

90
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,040
No more.

91
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,520
This is the fifth take. No more.

92
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,600
You can't direct,

93
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,720
and you can't film.

94
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,600
So you're just fooling me around, right?

95
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,600
Who can't film?

96
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,160
You.

97
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,720
You do it.

98
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,800
Look at my makeup.

99
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,320
I quit.

100
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,440
Can you take the shot?

101
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,880
My makeup is wasted.

102
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,080
You think you look good?

103
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,520
Does he look good?

104
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Take a look.

105
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,680
Give him a close-up.

106
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,720
What's with me?

107
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,320
What's with her?

108
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,080
What's with her?

109
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,960
Dancing?

110
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,320
Well, if we can't do it today,

111
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,520
maybe tomorrow.

112
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,400
Don't get worked up.

113
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,400
All of you have to film today.

114
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,880
- Shut the door.
- Shut it.

115
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:30,680
Shut it.

116
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,520
Let's go. Move.

117
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,240
Why do you make a film?

118
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,160
Like you don't care about your life.

119
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,720
I just don't care about my life.

- Bro.
- No.

131
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,808
Buy some flowers.

132
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:24,360
Get lost.

133
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,480

Go up.

This person is sick.

158
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,640
Exactly.

159
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,920
The toilet is nearby.

160
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,480

You are...

It doesn't matter.

00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,200
Like filming short videos?

168
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,200
Not exactly,
I'm thinking of making a film.

169
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,200
Exactly, I can tell

170
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,080
you are a director.

171
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,480
You can tell that?

172
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,640
Moreover,

173
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
I can tell

174
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,440
you have potential

175
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,360
to make a great film.

176
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Really?

177
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,920
Really.

178
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,920
Just from how you shot videos
with your phone.

179
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,200
The angle and adjustment.

180
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,440
I can imagine

181
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,440
the serious look you have

182
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,320
sitting behind the monitor.

183
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,040
Thank you.

184
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,480
Let me introduce myself.

185
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,440
I'm a director scout

186
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,120
who specializes in finding new directors

187
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,320
like you.

Director scout?

189
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,320
I've never heard of it before.

190
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,200
Because you haven't
entered the industry.

191
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,400
There are many new directors
like you nowadays.

192
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,200
What do you need? A chance.

193
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,880
That's why you need
talent scouts like us

194
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,120
to go discover you,

195
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,560
then you'll have the chance...

196
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,080
Right?

197
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,880
That's great.

198
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,000
T-Thank you.

199
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,400
Alright then, see you.

200
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,640
Okay. Pleased to meet you.

201
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,760
See you.

202
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,640
Thank you.

203
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,640
Then I'm leaving.

204
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,368
You...

205
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,880
Sorry.

206
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,640
I didn't get your contact yet.

207
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,096
Here.

208
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,632
- Okay.
- My business card.

209
00:09:21,632 --> 00:09:22,200
Okay.

210
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,760
Keep it well.

211
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,760
I know you can do it.

212
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,440
Alright, goodbye.

213
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,200
Goodbye.

214
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,216
(Xu Xiangdong)

215
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,320
Xu Xiangdong.

216
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,120
Xu Xiangdong?

217
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,320
The decor

218
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,880
of this store seems ordinary,

219
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,320
but it holds hidden surprises.

220
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,640
This is my Happy Hometown, do you know?

221
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,120
If it weren't a bit pricey,

222
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,320
I'd eat here every day.

223
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,376
Really?

224
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:45,880
Really.

225
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,000
Then I must try it out.

226
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You're sure to love it.

227
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,200
Waitress.

228
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,840
Here you are.

229
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,640
Here I am.

230
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,520
Haven't come in days,

231
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,440
I've been craving it.

232
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,200
Your girlfriend?

233
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,840
My good friend.

234
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,880
Let's see what to eat.

235
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,320
I'll pass.

236
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,200
You take a look.

237
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,880
I'll have ten silkworm chrysalises,
ten grasshoppers,

238
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,440
two kidneys,

239
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,440
and stinky tofu.

240
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,200
No problem.

241
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,320
Just order whatever you like.

242
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,440
It's okay. I'm on a diet,

243
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,520
so I won't eat for now.

244
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,760
Is there that new deep-fried scorpion
on the menu?

245
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,440
Yes.

246
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,560
Do you want to try it?

247
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,440
It's really tasty.

248
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,760
It's fine. I'll take it step by step.

249
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,904
Alright, that's all.

250
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:28,440
Okay.

251
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,080
Please hurry up.

252
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,120
No problem.

253
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,440
I think you don't need to lose weight.

254
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
You're not fat.

255
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,560
Besides, the silkworm chrysalis

256
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,120
is a high-protein food,

257
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,280
particularly good for girls.

258
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,000
It won't make much difference

259
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,080
by not eating one meal.

260
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
All are served.

261
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,560
Thank you.

262
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,640
Tell me if you need more.

263
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,280
- Alright.
- Enjoy.

264
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:50,840
Alright.

265
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,120
You first.

266
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,440
- It's fine, you first.
- Or it'll get cold.

267
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,400
I have to go to the restroom.

268
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,760
Okay, I'll wait for you.

269
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,080
I can't start eating
before my guest does.

270
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,760
You are back early.

271
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,080
Why are you primping here?

272
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,320
I'm leaving right away.

273
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,080
Right.

274
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,080
Help me with the roll call.

275
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,960
No way.

276
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,880
I'll treat you to a meal.

277
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,520
Why are you here?

278
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,520
I...

279
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,760
Just passing by.

280
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,200
Since I'm already here,

281
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
why don't you buy me a coffee?

282
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,760
I'll have that coconut latte.

283
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,640
Sure.

284
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,384
(China Merchants Bank Deposit Card,
Balance: 31 yuan)

285
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:38,336
(Coconut Latte: 32)

286
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:39,219
(Checkout)

287
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,200
Well,

288
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,440
the coconut taro latte is also sweet.

289
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,560
How about Americano?

290
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,080
I can't sleep if I drink Americano.

291
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,000
The coconut latte can be without sugar.

292
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,960
Okay.

293
00:12:55,891 --> 00:12:58,432
(Transfer me five yuan.)

294
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,640
The internet is a bit stuck.

295
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,520
I'm sorry.

296
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,520
No rush.

297
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,760
Done.

298
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,080
Right.

299
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,760
I heard you're going to film something.

300
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,080
Right.

301
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,080
I can help.

302
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,520
I still don't know what to film.

303
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,640
You can film me.

304
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:25,880
Film...

305
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,000
I mean

306
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,760
I can be your lead actress for free.

307
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,760
Stop joking. I'm just starting to learn.

308
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't know anything.
How dare I film you.

309
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,640
It's fine, I did it before.

310
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,440
I can teach you.

311
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,640
A call.

312
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,016
(Xiao Rang)

313
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,440
Hello, Xiao Rang.

314
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,560
You messaged me

315
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,880
to give you five yuan, what for?

316
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,680
Send me the link if you buy something.

317
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,440
I'm a bit tight on money recently.

318
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,080
I get it.

319
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,080
Well...

320
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,760
Do you see any changes in me today?

321
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,280
Don't you girls like to take selfies?

322
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,280
Just take selfies.

323
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,152
Your coffee is ready,
and I'll go get it.

324
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,200
Take selfies.

325
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,000
It can't fly without the wind now.

326
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,320
You can run to help it fly up.

327
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,000
Are you ready?

328
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,560
Let's go.

329
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,440
As the dream lover
of a billion young men,

330
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,440
today I must take the step

331
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,120
full of confidence.

332
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,000
Do you know what fate is?

333
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,880
Fate is that you saw me,

334
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,200
and I also happened to see you.

335
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,520
Wait, who are you?

336
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,120
It doesn't matter.

337
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,520
What matters is
that I've taken a liking to you.

338
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,080
I now command you

339
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,640
to fall for me immediately.

340
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,760
I-I don't think we're a good match.

341
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,080
Strange. Why can't we fly it?

342
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,000
We're not a good match.

343
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,640
Why?

344
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,880
Don't be discouraged.

345
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,400
Did you get that?

346
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Yes, I got it recorded.

347
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,400
But this doesn't feel quite right.

348
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,560
Why?

349
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,640
I think it's quite good.

350
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,160
The domineering female is popular now.

351
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,160
But I want to film others,

352
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,440
not myself.

353
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,800
To film it with a selfie stick,

354
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,280
it's different from what I expected.

355
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,680
So what do you want to film?

356
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,800
Actually, I don't know either.

357
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,280
I want to film something with a story

358
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,680
and fun.

359
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
Anyway, not like this.

360
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,800
What should I film?

361
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,920
I got it.

362
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,160
We could film something inspiring.

363
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,280
That's a good idea.

364
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,560
Tell me more.

365
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,760
We could film some girls without dreams

366
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,640
and goals,

367
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,920
made a difference through dance.

368
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Find dreams and purpose in dancing.

369
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,800
How's that?

370
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,640
That's a nice idea.

371
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,640
Well,

372
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
this seems quite difficult.

373
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
I don't know.

374
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,920
I'll think it over later.

375
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
What's the difficulty?

376
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
Come on.

377
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,280
We could film it now.

378
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,040
Give me the phone.

379
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,560
Hello, Qian.

380
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,920
Wake the girls up.

381
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,920
Right, do me a favor.

382
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680

dating guides online are fake.

Why don't any of them work?

404
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,160

Oh my.

422
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,040
Look how fat you filmed me.

423
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,800
You've filmed my arms

424
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,280
even more robust.

425
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,920
And you didn't capture

426
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,040
my long legs.

427
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,800
I didn't bring them out today.

428
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,680
But he filmed me...

429
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,520
You looked the best.

430
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,680
Good.

431
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,680
Well done.

432
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,080
Let me see.

433
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,520
You filmed quite well.

434
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,200
Not bad.

435
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,160
This guy must be sick.

436
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,680
He's blind.

437
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,920
Don't say that.

438
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,560
It's his first time filming.

439
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,440
With no experience.

440
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,400
Please give him another chance

441
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,800
and film another one?

442
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,000
Wait, where

443
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,160
all your theories have gone?

444
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,000
All go in vain?

445
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,560
When filming girls,

446
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,160
you have to film them from a low angle

447
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,200
so the legs look longer.

448
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,000
You're so tall, and yet
you filmed them like this.

449
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,160
See for yourself.

450
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,560
Enough.

451
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,520
Save me some face.

452
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,040
What is it called?

453
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,800
An empty talker.

454
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,440
You are the one.

455
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,000
Do you want a beating?

456
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,200
You film it then.

457
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,760
Alright.

458
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,560
How about I treat you all
to milk tea tonight?

459
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,280
And fried chicken.

460
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,000
Okay?

461
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,680
Let's do it again.

462
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,440
Okay, you film one.

463
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,320
Let's see what you can do.

464
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,000
Come on.

465
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,000
Girls.

466
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,200
Mr. Xiao said,

467
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
he'll film one for you

468
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,560
and he can film better than me.

469
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,000
Can I trust you?

470
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,200
No problem. He said he can do it.

471
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,920
Then you have to delete

472
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
the previous one.

473
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,080
Okay, no problem.

474
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,920
Let's do it again.

475
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,280
Okay, one more.

476
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,520
Okay, thank you.

477
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,400
Come on.

478
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,440

I've exercised enough today.

This is a great idea.

505
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,440
We've worked out today.

506
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,320
Director.

507
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,320
You should treat us to a meal.

508

509
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,000
Sure, no problem.

00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,920

Let's all keep fit.

513
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,680

517
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,000
Li Yanhao has to do the editing.

518
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,640

519
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,080

00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,800
suggested eating hot pot.

523
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,000
Three meals.

529
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,800
I bought you milk tea,

530
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,680
with little sugar.

531
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,520

534
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,560
- I'll treat you to hot pot.
- Wait, she just now...

535
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,280
No need.

536
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,280
We have things to do.

537
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,920
You two stay, and we're leaving.

538
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,160

- Let's go.

539
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,320
Bye.

540
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,520
You keep these two.

541
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,200
Okay, thanks.

542
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,320
Did you speak ill of me again?

543
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,520
What?

544
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,800
Then why do they all leave?

545
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,040
They've gone to eat.

546
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,160
You have spoken ill of me.

547
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,520
You never say anything nice.

548
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,040

549
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,760
What? I didn't say anything about you.

550
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
What can I say about you?

551
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,280
Let's go. We should go back.

552
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,200
I promised
to send them the edited video.

553
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,560
I have to study how to edit it.

554
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,040
Not for you.

555
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,080
Buy it yourself.

556
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,560
So I am the clown.

557
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,080

558
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,040
Leave me the straw.

00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,320
Li Yanhao.

560
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,040
You are despicable.

561
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,200
I've put in much,

562
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,440
yet you don't leave me a straw.

563
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,080
Hold on.

564
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,040
What?

565
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,080
I'll go edit the video.

566
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,160
Wait, sit down.

567
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,200
Here's the thing.

568
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,800
Help me analyze

569
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
which part went wrong.

570
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,160

571
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,280
the girl I've been chatting with.

572
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,280
And I prepared carefully.

573
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,560
I bought her roses.

574
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,200
I took her to fly a kite.

575
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,000
And I took her

576
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,320
to the restaurant I love.

577
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,760
It couldn't be that

578
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,200
Happy Hometown, right?

579
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,800
Exactly.

580
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,000
Did you order something
like grilled grasshoppers,

581
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,760
grilled silkworm chrysalis,
and stinky tofu?

582
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,320
Of course, I did.

583
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,200
It's my first time treating her.
I have to order something good.

584
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,440
You're amazing.

585
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,200
I think you really are dumb.

586
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,040
Let me tell you.

587
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,680
You take a girl out on a date,

588
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,280
ordering things like grasshoppers,

589
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,640
silkworm cocoons and stinky tofu.

590
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,920
No girls like eating these.

591
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,440
Feel it.

592
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
Is there wind today?

593
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,680
Yet you took her to fly a kite.

594
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,800
I have already shown

595
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,640
my utmost sincerity.

596
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,640
What else can I do?

597
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,760
Do you think it's because of

598
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,160
my hairstyle?

599
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,000
Look, isn't it?

600
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,640
You are like a QR code.

601
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,320
I can't know what you are if I don't scan it.

602
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,920
Really.

603
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,160
I know it's no use telling you.

604
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,800
Let me tell you...

605
00:26:59,280 --> 00:26:59,920
I loved you.

606
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,520
What's wrong with you?

607
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,424
If you film, take me with you.

608
00:27:03,424 --> 00:27:04,040
No way.

609
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,880
Why not?

610
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,280
If I didn't save you this afternoon,

611
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,160
those girls would have left long ago.

612
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,280
When you filmed them,

613
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,560
they all had a worried look.

614
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,280
After I filmed them, they smiled.

615
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,080
Besides, you being a director,

616
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,200
that is a long and difficult journey.

617
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,280
But with me supporting you,

618
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,160
it's different.

619
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,640
You aren't fighting alone anymore.

620
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,680
And I can not only film,

621
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,680
I can also...

622
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,200
If the actresses are tired,
I can tell them jokes

623
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,080
to cheer them up.

624
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,000
I can also care about them.

625
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,520
I can treat them to meals and such.

626
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,080
So that's your plan.

627
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,200
Listen.

628
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,880
Give up.

629
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,320
I can't film recently.

630
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,080
No more.

631
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,920
Don't, you have to film.

632
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,160
You could be a good director.

633
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,000
I trust you.

634
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,440
Alright, let me show you.

635
00:27:49,939 --> 00:27:51,072
(Wallet: 2.2 yuan)

636
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,000
How?

637
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,560
With you?

638
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,040
Maybe you should tell your parents.

639
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,320
They might support you.

640
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,160
Forget it.

641
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,920
Let's go. I have to edit the video.

642
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,560
Come on.

643
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,680
I have to edit the video.

644
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,640
Take my next week's

645
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,560
living expenses, okay?

646
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,800
Let's discuss it.

647
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,680
Living expenses are
1,000 yuan per month.

648
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,080
I can ask Dad for more.

649
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,200
Then it'll be 1,200 yuan per month.

650
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,440
It'll be over 7,000 yuan
for half a year.

651
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,680
I'll spend 600 yuan a month.

652
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,200
No, 500 yuan.

653
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,080
A bun in the morning.

654
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,800
Then it'll

655
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,400
be 500 yuan.

656
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,680
Then I could have...

657
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,440
Red packet money.

658
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,520
Red packet money is 1,000 yuan per year.

659
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,440
There'd be 20,000 yuan
for these 20 years.

660
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,160
That should be enough.

661
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,920
This is unreliable,

662
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,200
but at least it's useful.

663
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,200
What is missing now is a crucial person.

664
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:32,960
(Xu Xiangdong, Personal Studio)

665
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,440
The foundation of art

666
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,040
exists in moral character,

667
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,800
the human nature,

668
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,280
and the diversity of people.

669
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,280
It reflects reality,
but should rise above life.

670
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,400
So, art is the venting
of noble sentiments.

671
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,040
Yes, it is a venting.

672
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,440
If you want to have
this practical opportunity,

673
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,800
then you should be ready

674
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,400
to devote yourself to art, understand?

675
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,920
Yes.

676
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,080
I have long been ready.

677
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,000
Come on, Mr. Dong.

678
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,080
It's peeled, have some.

679
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,000
This does not catch my fancy.

680
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,320
Then why did you bring me
to eat this here?

681
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,280
I brought you here to let you know

682
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,800
all labor in the world is difficult.

683
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,760
Your work with me is no big deal.

684
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,680
If you want to be
an independent director,

685
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,680
you have to fund the film yourself.

686
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,520
I can help you connect
with some resources,

687
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,160
and do some other work.

688
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,440
Okay.

689
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,040
How much money do you get?

690
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,440
No matter how much money you have,

691
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,880
we can film anyway.

692
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,280
We professional producers

693
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,400
are here to help you
solve all these problems.

694
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,080
Mr. Dong, amazing!

695
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,320
The more money, the better.

696
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,280
Yes.

697
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,920
I'll take a call.

698
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,760
Mr. Qin.

699
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,800
Okay, I'll come over.

700
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,560
Okay.

701
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,400
I have taken on a big job.

702
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,080
Well,

703
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,400
you think it over carefully.

704
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,920
As professional producers like us,

705
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,800
how do we help you new directors

706
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,400
on the way of becoming great directors?

707
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,440
Remember,

708
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,080
the more money, the better.

709
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,280
Got it.

710
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,080
I'm leaving.

711
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,800
Take care.

712
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,640
You lost.

713
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,320
About the money thing,

714
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
to be honest,

715
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,040
I really don't have any.

716
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,000
Maybe I'll write you an IOU.

717
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,000
What?

718
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,440
Is our family this poor now?

719
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,880
We have always been poor.

720
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,520
That's the norm.

721
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,920
Well, you saved

722
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,680
my red packet money.

723
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,040
Where's the money now?

724
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,680
Young man.

725
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,400
You don't know the cost of living.

726
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,520
Your mom and I
have been working hard for years,

727
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,080
and we need the red packet money
to make ends meet.

728
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,880
Dad.

729
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,320
If you didn't say it,

730
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,280
I'd still have a little hope.

731
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,440
It's all gone now.

732
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,040
Don't have any hope on me.

733
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,800
Why do you need so much money?

734
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,760
Got a girlfriend?

735
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,000
Got a picture?

736
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,560
Let me take a look.

737
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,160
I'd like to have a girlfriend.

738
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,160
But with our family's

739
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,320
and my condition,

740
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,080
don't ever dream about it.

741
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,200
I've told you

742
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
not to be shy

743
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,920
and be confident.

744
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,200
Whether you have money or not,
just go for it first.

745
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,160
What is going on?

746
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,560
Just tell me the truth,

747
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,280
I can consider

748
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,080
sharing with you my private savings
I've stashed

749
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,560
over the years.

750
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,560
How much?

751
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,000
20,000?

752
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,800
What? 20,000?

753
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,400
Five more to go.

754
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,640
We're playing chess here.

755
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,320
Be careful.

756
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,680
Right.

757
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,440
20,000 yuan?

758
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,640
Not that much.

759
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,440
2,000 yuan will do.

760
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,800
Total 200 yuan.

761
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,800
I'll keep 100 yuan.

762
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,280
150 yuan.

763
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,520
Not a cent less.

764
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,680
150 yuan.

765
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,800
Stop it.

766
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,920
It hurts.

767
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,200
Dad.

768
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,920
You're my dad.

769
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,800
Support me now.

770
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,800
Now I'm in need of money.

771
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,200
The more, the better.

772
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,440
I'm begging you.

773
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,520
What are you muttering?

774
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,760
Come to have a meal.

775
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,400
Alright.

776
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,800
Let me tell you.

777
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,040
Don't think you can

778
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,320
challenge your dad.

779
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,360
Just 100 yuan.

780
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,800
Let's eat.

781
00:34:38,355 --> 00:34:39,840
(Kang Yide)

782
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:46,800
Hello.

783
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,360
I've finished reading your proposal.

784
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,560
There's a part

785
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,280
I think you need to revise a bit.

786
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,080
Go ahead.

787
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,160
About the horror film feature,

788
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,840
I don't recommend you do it.

789
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,640
The domestic horror films

790
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,640
are all inferior.

791
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,440
And the audience is mostly girls.

792
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,680
The visuals aren't good. Don't do it.

793
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,080
But many people

794
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,400
like watching this kind of films.

795
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,360
Wait.

796
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,360
I did a market survey.

797
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,520
Just listen to me.

798
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,680
This is a thankless task.

799
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,840
Don't waste time and effort

800
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,600
on such stuff that only girls watch.

801
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,080
Okay, I got it.

802
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,840
I'll think about it.

803
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,000
Just a suggestion.

804
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,800
It's up to you.

805
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,920
Bye then.

806
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,080
Okay.

807
00:35:46,323 --> 00:35:48,832
(Map of Binjiang University
Film Festival)

808
00:35:51,155 --> 00:35:54,208
(Horror Film)

809
00:36:08,531 --> 00:36:09,120
(Hua)

810
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,520
I'll take a call.

811
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,440
Hello, Hua.

812
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,280
How many people?

813
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,040
What job is it?

814
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,800
Filming?

815
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:25,840
Alright.

816
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,560
Then we'll arrive at 10 PM.

817
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,680
It's already this late.

818
00:36:34,464 --> 00:36:35,080
Scan the code.

819
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,200
I don't clean that one.

820
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,184
Mom, no more.

821
00:36:37,184 --> 00:36:37,760
I'm leaving.

822
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
Take this.

823
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:38,840
Dad, I'm off.

824
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
I bought it for you.

825
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,040
Come on. Hurry.

826
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,840
Eat it on the way.

827
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,600
- No, Mom.
- Be good.

828
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,200
Take it.

829
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,280
I really can't take it.

830
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,840
Mom, you keep it.

831
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,080
Honey. Hurry.

832
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,560
Share with your classmates.

833
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,360
Stop it.

834
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,400
- We'll be late.
- Study hard.

835
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,440
Dad, drive safely.

836
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,040
Okay.

837
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,440
(Why is it so hard)

838
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,600
(to start making a film?)

839
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,200
Hello.

840
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,320
I have a filming task for you.

841
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,000
Really?

842
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,840
Can you handle the horror film?

843
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,400
I can as long as

844
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,360
you need.

845
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,600
Not just you.

846
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,320
I also need a cameraman.

847
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,360
Camera...

848
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,360
No problem.

849
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,200
I have a cameraman.

850
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,320
Alright.

851
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,200
(It seems my dream to make a film)

852
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,080
(is about to take the first step.)

853
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,200
Let me tell you.

854
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,280
We're filming a horror film today.

855
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,360
What matters the most

856
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,840
is the atmosphere.

857
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,080
So there aren't many lines.

858
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,600
Well, Cameraman, come on.

859
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,520
Director.

860
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,840
Let me tell you.

861
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,280
You will follow the lead actress,

862
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,320
coming from behind.

863
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,760
Mind your rhythm.

864
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,600
Keep the focus.

865
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,440
Rest assured.

866
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,080
Well, Actress.

867
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,320
Here.

868
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,600
Director, I am here.

869
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,600
Later on, you will

870
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,840
walk in from the door.

871
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,360
Here is the spot you stop.

872
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,040
As you walk along this way,

873
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,920
you'll see
that the lantern is on fire first,

874
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,840
then the marble will roll down

875
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,080
from the stairs.

876
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,080
And then,

877
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,080
there will be a drop of blood
dripping into a cup.

878
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,880
Once you look up,

879
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,000
the drop of blood falls on your face.

880
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,600
And then you will

881
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,560
be very scared

882
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,800
and start to back away.

883
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,040
Meanwhile,

884
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,000
you'll suddenly see
this mannequin behind you.

885
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,800
And then the mannequin's head
will suddenly fall off,

886
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,840
and Mr. Ghost will fall

887
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,280
to right in front of you.

888
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,200
Dilate your pupils and scream loudly.

889
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,760
Convey this emotion.

890
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:51,800
Try to scream.

891
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,920
You give it a try.

892
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,600
Well,

893
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,280
you think it over, okay?

894
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,600
Mr. Ghost.

895
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,520
Mr. Ghost.

896
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,080
Mr. Ghost.

897
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,360
Xiao Rang.

898
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,640
Where's...?

899
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,440
Oh my.

900
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,000
Director, I'm here.

901
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,760
Pretty good.

902
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,520
Well then, let's rehearse.

903
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,320
Miss, come on.

904
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,120
Let's rehearse.

905
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,200
My neck.

906
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,800
Cut!

907
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,200
Director.

908
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,880
This take is good enough, right?

909
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,080
Not good.

910
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,200
We have to do it again.

911
00:39:53,888 --> 00:39:54,560
Xiao Rang.

912
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,080
What's wrong?

913
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:55,760
What?

914
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,672
What did you film?

915
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,200
What's wrong?

916
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,280
Can you do it or not?

917
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,080
What's with her?

918
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,080
Dancing?

919
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,120
All of you have to film today.

920
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,360
- Shut the door.
- Shut it.

921
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,320
Shut the door.

922
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,760
Is this enough?

923
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,080
Everyone who came today was a coward.

924
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:31,840
