I can't make it.

45
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,640
Director.

46
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,480
I'm here.

47
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,640
You are late already.

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,280
Don't.

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,480
Make an exception please.

50
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,640
For this exam,

51
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,840
we've sacrificed our rest time

52
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,760
to proctor you.

53
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,480
You don't take it seriously.

54
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,680
You really don't.

55
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,920
No, I take it seriously.

56
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,360
Director!

57
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,560
Do you? How?

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,040
I...

59
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,640
Look, my foot and hand are in.

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,760
You can't count me as late.

61
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,480
Ms. Gao, I am here.

62
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,120
Director.

63
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,760
You got up early

64
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,480
just to proctor him.

65
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,760
Please make an exception and let him in.

66
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,680
Let him in, please.

67
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,280
Thank you, Director.

68
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,400
Hurry up, come in.

69
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,760
You're dressed quite thin.

70
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,920
This is to show you

71
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,480
I didn't bring a cheat sheet.

72
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,640
Stop the nonsense.

73
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,280
Sit down to take the exam.

74
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,560
I have no pen.

75
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,760
Why did you even come?

76
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,640
I left in a hurry.

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,840
Director, I have one.

78
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,840
Hurry.

79
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,360
Okay.

80
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,280
What's wrong?

81
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,040
Need to use the restroom again?

82
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,200
No, no.

83
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,280
Y-Yesterday,

84
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,840
I've reviewed too much.

85
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,800
I've forgotten

86
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,840
the formula.

87
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,520
You don't know this?

88
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,240
I bet you definitely can't
pass this time either.

89
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,520
Time's up.

90
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,360
Apart from the last major question,

91
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,840
you scored 60 points.

92
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
Then does it mean I've passed?

93
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,240
I've told you before,

94
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,240
you must reach 85 points

95
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,400
to avoid being expelled.

96
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,400
Miss.

97
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,120
The last major question

98
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,040
has 25 points in full.

99
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,080
Can you guarantee

100
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,120
you will get full points?

101
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,640
Miss.

102
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,800
Whether I can or not,

103
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,960
it's up to you.

104
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,520
Ms. Gao.

105
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,040
I haven't been late for your classes,

106
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,280
nor have I slept through them.

107
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,520
You've seen my efforts.

108
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,800
Right, when I went to revise yesterday,

109
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
Director even saw me

110
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,800
and encouraged me.

111
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,520
Right, Director?

112
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,920
He is quite diligent.

113
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,800
This time, for the sake of Ms. Jiang,

114
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,240
(Final marks: 85)
I'll make you pass.

115
00:06:20,736 --> 00:06:21,520
Yes!

116
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,080
Yu Lan, come here.

117
00:06:50,688 --> 00:06:52,474
(Binhai University Film Festival)

118
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,800
This is our newly-made proposal.

119
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,120
You're quite efficient.

120
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,360
Just now, my mentor met me.

121
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,080
We had a meeting
with the rest of our school.

122
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,960
And

123
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,800
I mentioned the Film Festival to him.

124
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
What's the result?

125
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,800
Guess what happened.

126
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,400
He thinks that

127
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,520
although our school is strong,

128
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,080
right now, it does not have

129
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,680
the foundation and atmosphere
to host the Film Festival.

130
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,680
However,

131
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,120
under my persistent persuasion,

132
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,520
he agreed to give us support.

133
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,640
Really?

134
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,360
Really.

135
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,800
Thank you, senior.

136
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,080
I will find a time
to thank you properly.

137
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,520
Don't mention it.

138
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,560
Yu Lan.

139
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,400
You

140
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,360
are promoted by me.

141
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,240
You can make this happen.

142
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,680
It is also what I want to see.

143
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,520
I've read the proposal

144
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,360
you revised.

145
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,240
It's quite innovative.

146
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,080
Thank you.

147
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,960
But this is not enough.

148
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,360
You need to make more effort.

149
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,240
Now,

150
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,240
I won't always be by your side,

151
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,560
helping you.

152
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,400
I hope you can do it on your own.

153
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,680
The student union has many members.

154
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,360
We work hard together.

155
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,360
How does it feel?

156
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,280
I mean, how does it feel
to be the president?

157
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,280
The feeling of dominating others.

158
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Is it good?

159
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,080
I've never thought about
dominating anyone.

160
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,840
The student union

161
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,640
has made decisions democratically.

162
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,360
It's because you are too democratic

163
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,440
that the work efficiency is very slow.

164
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,440
Understand?

165
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,880
I'll think of ways
to improve the work efficiency.

166
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,320
Alright, I trust you.

167
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,240
Look at the way you're dressed.

168
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,240
Are you going

169
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,480
to do the line dance?

170
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,120
Do I look old this way?

171
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,800
How should I put it?

172
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,560
It looks a bit too old.

173
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,120
That's what I want.

174
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,600
What's wrong with you?

175
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,680
For what?

176
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,800
You choreographed a dance for grannies,

177
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,240
and want to feel the vibe?

178
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
What? I...

179
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
How about this?

180
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,800
Enough.

181
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,360
You are dressed like my mom.

182
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,480
Oh my.

183
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,880
Hello, ma'am.

184
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,320
Ma'am?

185
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,360
Wu Qianqian, take a good look at me.

186
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,120
With this look,

187
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,120
I thought you were Liu Lu's mom.

188
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,240
It's the weekend.

189
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,680
Are you going to

190
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,560
date the elderly?

191
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,040
What?

192
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,680
Yes, she is.

193
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
No.

194
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,800
I'm going to find Li Yanhao.

195
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,920
You going to be his mom?

196
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,160
You always go to him,

197
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,120
yet there's no progress between you two.

198
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,800
Wait.

199
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,120
Who said I always go to him?

200
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,680
She did.

201
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,800
Not me.

202
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,680
You're not any better.

203
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,680
Take us both with you this time.

204
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,720
We can help you out.

205
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,600
Well, I'm not going.

206
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,360
You guys eat and drink.

207
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,480
I'm on a diet.

208
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,480
Then you shouldn't go either.

209
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,680
Don't listen to her.

210
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,160
She has never eaten less.

211
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,360
This time, with our help,

212
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,040
you will definitely succeed.

213
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,920
Definitely?

214
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,800
You don't understand.

215
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,560
This can't be rushed.

216
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,120
I have to get close to him step by step.

217
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,360
Then, I'll be the leading actress
in his film,

218
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,360
and finally win him over.

219
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,040
Then you should bring us both with you.

220
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,920
L-Listen to me.

221
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,560
I can go with you,

222
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,360
but I won't take a single bite.

223
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,480
You won't?

224
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,920
I don't believe it.

225
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,240
Alright, let's all go together then.

226
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,800
Okay.

227
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,680
Monitor.

228
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,040
I'm not going.

229
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,720
I have to teach tomorrow,

230
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,160
so I need to prepare today.

231
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,480
Dear.

232
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,120
Let's go together.

233
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,680
No.

234
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,040
Monitor, just give in to us.

235
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,040
I'm not going.

236
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,160
I have work to do tomorrow.

237
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,040
You guys go ahead.

238
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,920
Don't bother me.

239
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,680
The only reliable one won't go,

240
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,800
and the two of you unreliable folks
are going.

241
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,480
You two

242
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,480
must be reliable today.

243
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,120
Absolutely.

244
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,680
Let's go.

245
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,680
Like, now?

246
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,240
Wait for me.

247
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,920
Come on, bro.

248
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,480
Congratulations on passing the exam,

249
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,920
and avoiding being expelled.

250
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,920
Is it boring
just the two of us drinking?

251
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Xu Xiangdong is coming.

252
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,800
Then it's even more boring.

253
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,040
Us three men?

254
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,240
Li Jiatong is coming too.

255
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,360
Why does she

256
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,360
like to join us so much?

257
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,560
You have to be grateful.

258
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,680
Did you forget

259
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,360
she helped us clear our names?

260
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,800
That's true.

261
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,800
What's this?

262
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,920
Why choose this place?

263
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,160
It must be expensive
to drink here, right?

264
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Rest assured.

265
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,920
My treat.

266
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
Don't trust him.

267
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,560
He was five yuan short
for coffee yesterday

268
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,800
and asked me to send him money.

269
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,160
Your voice message.

270
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,800
Hear it out.

271
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Very flattering.

272
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,360
How dare you!

273
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,600
I'll grill you, believe me.

274
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,680
Alright.

275
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,040
Listen to me.

276
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,040
This meal

277
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,600
is funded from the movie fund.

278
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,800
You're so generous?

279
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,600
Well, I think

280
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,680
we should celebrate
for the future great director,

281
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,560
Li Yanhao.

282
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,560
Something's wrong.

283
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,920
Fishy.

284
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,600
You're up to no good.

285
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
Are you trying to fool us

286
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,920
to go to work again?

287
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,600
Don't talk nonsense.

288
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,720
Come on.

289
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,320
Here, cheers.

290
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,120
Why don't you wait for me?

291
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
This...

292
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,680
Excuse me, madam, you are?

293
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,120
Don't you recognize me?

294
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,480
Wait, what are you doing?

295
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,720
Why are you dressed like that?

296
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,680
Your hair...

297
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,920
Does it make me look old?

298
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,240
Do I look old?

299
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,680
What do you want to eat?

300
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,120
Feel free to order anything.

301
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,360
50 lamb kebabs, please.

302
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,680
10 chicken wings.

303
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,560
Okay.

304
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,040
Well...

305
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,680
Ordering that much?

306
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,000
It's so expensive.

307
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,120
You don't get to ask a beauty

308
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,560
out for a meal every day.

309
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,040
You don't eat something that greasy,

310
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,560
right?

311
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,040
How about I get you some fruit?

312
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,000
Maybe durian?

313
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,360
Cherries?

314
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,320
Sure.

315
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,480
Go buy some fruit.

316
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,800
Durian, cherries.

317
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,680
Go on.

318
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,240
Where's the dance video?

319
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,680
Exactly.

320
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,360
We were dancing

321
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,040
under the sun for so long.

322
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,360
Where's the video?

323
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,240
Well,

324
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,920
I've treated you to hot pot.

325
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,560
We agreed on four meals,
but we've only had one.

326
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,040
We should rest for several days.

327
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,560
We could eat it every day.

328
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,240
Alright.

329
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Let me tell you.

330
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,680
After I finished my exam,

331
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,680
in the afternoon,

332
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,560
I edited the video for you.

333
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,920
Here, take a look.

334
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,360
It's filmed pretty well.

335
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,040
This movie is nice.

336
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,000
Look.

337
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,480
How? Tell me about it.

338
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,040
I've started brainstorming a script,

339
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,560
so I need to watch more of these

340
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,480
for inspiration.

341
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,800
And this film is excellent,

342
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,480
very appealing.

343
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,480
More appealing than me?

344
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,560
You are neither appealing

345
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,040
nor unappealing now.

346
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
You don't look good at all.

347
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,480
You...

348
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,800
Li Yanhao, I...

349
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,680
Just kidding.

350
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,040
Wait.

351
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,920
I'm curious

352
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,800
why you are dressed like this today.

353
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,680
Don't you know why?

354
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,480
I...

355
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,560
Is it because that day in the canteen,

356
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,040
I said the heroine in my film
is an old lady,

357
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,360
and then you get dressed up like this?

358
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,040
What else?

359
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,360
Wait.

360
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,040
I was just joking.

361
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
Joking?

362
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,120
Well,

363
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
I should order you some pig brain.

364
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,120
You...

365
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,800
I don't care if you're joking.

366
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,240
Anyway, I'm already dressed in this.

367
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,480
Even if the heroine is a nanny,

368
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,680
it has to be me, okay?

369
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,680
But I haven't written the script yet.

370
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,360
If the leading actress

371
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,680
will be

372
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,560
a mature lady,

373
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,920
then you couldn't play her, right?

374
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,480
I can't?

375
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,240
How?

376
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,680
Let me ask you.

377
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,240
Can I be your leading actress now?

378
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,480
Let's talk about it later.

379
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,120
But you are quite versatile.

380
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
Right.

381
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,920
Tong is our class belle.

382
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,920
Yes, that's settled then.

383
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,240
B-But you've

384
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,240
never played the leading actress before.

385
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,680
If you don't have much experience...

386
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,560
Sounds like
you've been a director before.

387
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,160
And, I've played the leading actress.

388
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,360
When we shot that promo,

389
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,240
I kicked you when you came over.

390
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,360
Alright.

391
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,240
Tentative, all right?

392
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,040
You are the tentative leading actress.

393
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,800
But I have to tell you.

394
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,320
If the script I write

395
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,880
or some issues come up,
and you no longer fit,

396
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,320
I might have to change...

397
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,360
What?

398
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,040
Change...

399
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,440
the leading actress.

400
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,120
Let me tell you.

401
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,880
If you can't do it,
I'll change the director.

402
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,360
Well...

403
00:17:07,328 --> 00:17:09,120
(Lei Yonghao)
(Come out for a drink tonight.)

404
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,840
(No.)

405
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,440
Li Yanhao.

406
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,680
Let me ask you.

407
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,840
You can stay at this school

408
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,800
and make a film,

409
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
am I the person
you should be most thankful to?

410
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,600
Do I deserve the most credit?

411
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,320
Yes, it's you.

412
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,960
That sounds better.

413
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,720
Wait.

414
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,480
There is someone
who deserves more credit than you.

415
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,720
Well, exactly.

416
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,440
Right?

417
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:50,960
Who is it?

418
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,840
I can't tell you.

419
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,080
I am going to the restroom.

420
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,960
You guys drink.

421
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,320
Don't avoid me.

422
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,560
I'll go too.

423
00:18:21,856 --> 00:18:26,153
(Can't put down the wine
just to have a good talk with you)

424
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,720
Li Yanhao, let me ask you.

425
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,200
I'm already
the leading actress of your film.

426
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,560
When

427
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,440
can I be
the leading actress of your life?

428
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,240
Wait.

429
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,040
You're drunk.

430
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,120
I am not.

431
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,040
Okay, I admit

432
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,360
your acting is quite good.

433
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,920
Enough, let's stop.

434
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,800
I know I'm good.

435
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,920
Then what should I say?

436
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,240
You should say

437
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,040
when I can be
the leading actress of your life.

438
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,600
You know?

439
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,800
What are you doing?

440
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,920
N-Nothing.

441
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,920
I'm explaining the role to him,

442
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,720
stimulating Li Yanhao's potential.

443
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:12,960
What?

444
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,200
Shouldn't he be the one
explaining the role to you?

445
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,920
Well...

446
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,920
I can also explain
the role to the director.

447
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,360
Right?

448
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,320
Right.

449
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,320
Right.

450
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,920
Right, you can try it out too.

451
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,600
No need.

452
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,920
You two are doing great.

453
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,720
Go on.

454
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,320
Come on, let's drink.

455
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:39,960
Come on.

456
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,080
How did she fall asleep?

457
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,600
Why aren't you drinking?

458
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,200
I'm not drinking.

459
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,080
Tired from acting?

460
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:46,960
Listen.

461
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,080
Just now, they...

462
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,720
Xiao Rang!

463
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,960
Are you going abroad later?

464
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,600
Yes.

465
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,080
My parents are also abroad.

466
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,200
Maybe we can go together.

467
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,560
Then it's settled.

468
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,320
Deal.

469
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,920
Come on.

470
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,680
But there's a place I want to go now.

471
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,560
Where?

472
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,480
Make a guess.

473
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,800
Are you going into my heart?

474
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,320
Xiao Rang, you are so corny.

475
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,480
Is it?

476
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,600
Why don't you go into my heart?

477
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,920
Maybe go into my heart.

478
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,920
I'll drink as a penalty.

479
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,360
The stuff online is ridiculous.

480
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,040
He wants to go into her heart.

481
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,920
Here's the fruit.

482
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,320
The durian is sold out.

483
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,120
The cherry shop is closed.

484
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,360
Only these are left.

485
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,840
And these.

486
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,680
Just like this, okay?

487
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,800
No problem.

488
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,120
Come on. Hurry.

489
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,840
See? This camera moves...

490
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,320
Absolutely.

491
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,600
Look at the composition.

492
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,600
Look at the composition and texture.

493
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,120
Great artists.

494
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,600
Filming here?

495
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,800
Of course.

496
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,120
Let's go.

497
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,120
Xia.

498
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,720
You're also filming?

499
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,440
Yes.

500
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,920
I am preparing for the Film Festival.

501
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,960
Director,

502
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,440
did you choose your leading actress?

503
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Not yet, I'm still looking.

504
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,680
Am I suitable?

505
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,920
Then come for an audition.

506
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,600
I...

507
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,840
Director, you go ahead.

508
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,720
We're leaving.

509
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,680
How was it?

510
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,040
How much did we spend on the meal?

511
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,240
880 yuan.

512
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,920
How much?

513
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,800
How much do you have left?

514
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,840
120 yuan.

515
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,120
Well, we need to make money.

516
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,680
I think the movie fund is enough.

517
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
I have instant noodles.

518
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,560
But tomorrow,

519
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,120
we must start making our film.

520
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,680
But we can't film on an empty stomach.

521
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,680
Never mind.

522
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,040
Notify everyone

523
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,800
we'll have a meeting
over dinner tomorrow.

524
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,560
Everyone?

525
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,840
Plus the leading actress,

526
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,840
there are only four.

527
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,560
Let me tell you.

528
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,560
You are in my turf now.

529
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,120
The boss here is...

530
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,120
Why isn't the bar
open for business today?

531
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,504
Is the bar closed
because we haven't come

532
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:11,040
(Closed)
to work for Mr. Lei?

533
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,560
Business is usually good here.

534
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,040
And it's the weekend now.

535
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,240
There would be many customers.

536
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,120
Exactly.

537
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,120
Go drink.

538
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,920
Drink, let's drink up.

539
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,800
Stop embarrassing yourself here.

540
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,120
Let's go.

541
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,560
She is really embarrassing.

542
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,040
I'm not.

543
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,560
If you don't come to me,

544
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,240
I'll come to you.

545
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,440
What?

546
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,560
Don't you welcome me?

547
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,040
It's the weekend.

548
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,240
You should be in your bar.

549
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,120
I knew you would say so.

550
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,680
The bartender asked for a week off,

551
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,040
so I

552
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,800
took a day off.

553
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,800
It's rare

554
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
that you don't want to make money.

555
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,120
I can always make money.

556
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,040
But now...

557
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,800
Now is the time for me to create.

558
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,840
And I remember

559
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,920
you don't like to see me painting.

560
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,440
So you can leave now.

561
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,920
I'm really tired today.

562
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,440
Auntie, you know what?

563
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,080
It was quite a last minute today.

564
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,560
Fortunately, we worked well

565
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,480
and scored 13 points in one minute.

566
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,040
That's how we won the game.

567
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,440
Are you studying
in the sports department?

568
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,440
You've spent all day
with a bunch of boys.

569
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,440
Do you have a girl friend?

570
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,560
They are all too weak.

571
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,120
When I'm with them,

572
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,680
I have to protect them.

573
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,800
It's so troublesome.

574
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,240
Luckily, I have you
to take care of me here.

575
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,720
You are the best.

576
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,680
Have you taken a shower?

577
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,920
No, why?

578
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,960
Go take a shower. You're all sweaty.

579
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,560
Go, go.

580
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,440
At this very moment,
I truly envy Xu Xiangdong.

581
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,440
He doesn't go back to the dorm,

582
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,200
but his rented place.

583
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,560
How happy!

584
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,520
If we were to rent a place,

585
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,080
after drinking, we could just

586
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,200
invite you all to our place.

587
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,000
We are all adults.

588
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,680
Don't need to go back before 10 PM.

589
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,520
What do you want to play
at this late hour?

590
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,160
Like,

591
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,960
poker.

592
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,560
Enough.

593
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,840
Just walk them back.

594
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,560
I have to work on the script later.

595
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:06,960
Alright.

596
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,480
Then you walk with them.

597
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,080
I need the restroom. I'll go back.

598
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,960
Then I'll take my leave.

599
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,560
Bye.

600
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,440
Where are you going?

601
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,680
Back to the dorm, where else?

602
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,720
What for?

603
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,680
The film is about to start.

604
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
To work on the script.

605
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,680
That's a deal then.

606
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,240
From today on,

607
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,720
I'm the leading actress of your film.

608
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,120
Yes.

609
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,120
Do you think I'm looking

610
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,680
like a leading actress?

611
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,240
Let's go.

612
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,440
The dorm is closing.

613
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,560
Don't dilly-dally.

614
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,080
Let's go.

615
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,720
Alright.

616

that before fishermen set out to sea,)

but they still choose to set off.)

618

(I am different.)

619
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,840

620
