Just a dream.

39
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,720
Get up.

40
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,240
Why aren't you getting up?

41
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,320
After you.

42
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,680
I studied late into the night,

43
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,120
and continued to edit the video.

44
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,280
Went to bed at dawn.

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,840
Ask for a day off for me.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,200
I'm also exhausted.

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
Then let's just sleep.

48
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
Whose class is it?

49
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,480
I asked whose class is it?

50
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,560
Ms. Gao's, I think.

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,360
Get up. Hurry.

52
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
Why?

53
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,000
Didn't you want to take a day off?

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No day off.

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,640
Exam's tomorrow.

56
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,360
I'm hoping Ms. Gao goes easy on me.

57
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,720
I wouldn't dare miss her class.

58
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,920
Quick, quick.

59
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,840
You go. Ask for a day off for me.

60
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,720
I fear her not.

61
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,720
Get up.

62
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,120
Quick, get up.

63
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,200
Li Yanhao, what's your problem?

64
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,480
Hurry up, or we'll be late.

65
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,280
Quick, come on.

66
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,120
Ruin my sleep and then ask for a ride?

67
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,720
Give me a lift.

68
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,480
That guy was handsome.

69
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,440
Hurry up. We'll be late.

70
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:06,920
Quick.

71
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,280
We won't be late. Don't worry.

72
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,920
Quick!

73
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,640
- Hello.
- Watch it.

74
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:17,248
=Episode 7=
(Am I Your Leading Actress?)

75
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,280
(Media express public opinion)
How was last night's chat with Kang?

76
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,080
Get any good tips?

77
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,280
Pretty good.

78
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,160
And?

79
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,960
And I might have to work overtime
this weekend

80
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,560
to finish up a Film Festival plan

81
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,080
for my teacher next week.

82
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,840
Once I get the process nailed down,

83
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,880
it's all about the school.

84
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
I didn't ask you that.

85
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,720
I asked how things went
between you two last night?

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,160
What about us?

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,560
He is your go-to guy for any favor.

88
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,280
Don't you have any other feelings
towards him?

89
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,560
Nope.

90
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,080
An Ran.

91
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,720
If you wanna talk, come to the podium.

92
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,320
The place we went last time

93
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,520
was pretty good.

94
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,400
Let's go there again.

95
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,120
Exactly.

96
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,560
Even though that place
is a bit old-fashioned,

97
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,880
the vibe is nice.

98
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,720
The key is, it's on someone else's dime.

99
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,320
Such a pity that
there were no handsome guys.

100
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,600
Right.

101
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,320
- Handsome guys.
- What a pity.

102
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,520
Slacking off instead of practicing?

103
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
Let me ask you seriously.

104
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,080
Do you have feelings for that Xiao Rang?

105
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,440
Wu Qianqian.

106
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,240
What... what's it?

107
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,880
She doesn't like that Xiao Rang.

108
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,440
She clearly likes that Li...

109
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,600
Li Yanhao, right?

110
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,960
What are you talking about!

111
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,400
You like Li Yanhao?

112
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:36,800
I...

113
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,800
Why do you like him?

114
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,800
Last time
when he helped us shoot the video,

115
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,840
he was clumsy, silly, and goofy.

116
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,880
Why do you like him?

117
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,120
As you say so,

118
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,960
I think your brain is fine.

119
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,400
That guy... yeah, he seems a little off.

120
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,280
Totally.

121
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,440
Kind of weird, huh?

122
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,960
Seems like he hasn't dated much.

123
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,560
Right.

124
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,880
A total nerd, I guess.

125
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,960
No way.

126
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,080
You've dated?

127
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,120
I...

128
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,560
You've dated?

129
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,960
Never dated. What's this about?

130
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,720
You're flustered.

131
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,240
I...

132
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,680
- You like Li Yanhao.
- Yeah. Exactly.

133
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,600
It's Li Yanhao.

134
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,400
- Right, Li Yanhao.
- Li Yanhao.

135
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,120
I like you.

136
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,400
You just slacked off

137
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,720
the moment I stepped away, huh?

138
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
One hundred big jumps.

139
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,720
Jump.

140
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,840
Hurry up.

141
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,560
The cafeteria's gonna be packed again.

142
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,400
Right away.

143
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,400
Ms. Gao.

144
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,400
Ms. Gao.

145
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Such a great class.

146
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,400
Compliments won't help.

147
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,000
If you don't get at least 85,

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,120
you're out of here next semester.

149
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,720
Please, Ms. Gao.

150
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,560
I've been studying quite hard recently.

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,600
It's just...

152
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,720
Just what?

153
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,120
The volume of questions is overwhelming.

154
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Could you possibly...

155
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,280
Don't even think about it.

156
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,320
Concentrate on studying.

157
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,560
Ms. Gao.

158
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,840
I've been performing quite well
lately, haven't I?

159
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,400
At least not sleeping in class.

160
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,000
Still playing with phones.

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,400
I saw it, you know.

162
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,720
If you don't change,

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,560
wait for your retake next semester.

164
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,560
Please don't, Ms. Gao.

165
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,400
I promise I won't play with phones.

166
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,280
You've been behaving
quite well recently.

167
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,400
Just not sure
how much you've truly learned.

168
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,120
Ms. Gao.

169
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
For my retake tomorrow,

170
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,880
could you go slightly easy on me?

171
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,560
I promise I'll ace the final.

172
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,120
Let's see how you perform.

173
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,720
See ya, Ms. Gao.

174
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,840
Time to eat.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,600
Peng.

176
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Do you think being a director
is a good way to pick up girls?

177
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,920
That's why there is so much gossip
in the showbiz!

178
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,280
You're quite early.

179
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,160
It's that you're late.

180
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,960
You don't know.

181
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,280
The teacher insisted we stay.

182
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,400
What could we do?

183
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,040
She just kept praising us.

184
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,400
When you say that,

185
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
do you believe it?

186
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,160
Yes, I do.

187
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,840
Xiao Rang, let me ask you.

188
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,720
Does the word "praise"

189
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,080
even possibly have anything to do
with you?

190
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,040
You have no sense of humor at all.

191
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,280
How can you be a director, eh?

192
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,160
You can't even act.

193
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,600
Director? I'm off to get food.

194
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,280
Want anything? I'll go.

195
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,160
Two buns.

196
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,720
- Alright.
- This noon,

197
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
I got a side gig.

198
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,520
Mr. Dong.

199
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,480
When it comes to making money,
never forget us.

200
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,160
This job today doesn't need

201
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
too many hands.

202
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,160
Besides,

203
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,480
the money we've made

204
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,600
is almost enough.

205
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,520
Yes, yes, yes.

206
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,160
Once I finish my retake,

207
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,840
we'll start filming right away.

208
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,720
Good enough.

209
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,520
Go ahead.

210
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,520
Two buns?

211
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:38,960
Two buns.

212
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,600
Good.

213
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,040
Alright.

214
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,920
Two meat buns.

215
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,840
Do you think I've got what it takes
to be a director?

216
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,520
You wanna be like Li Yanhao.
Make movies.

217
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,160
Woo Feng Xia.

218
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
I mean,

219
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,400
what's with your potty mouth, man?

220
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,720
Me? Why potty?

221
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,280
Which part?

222
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,520
Aren't I better in every way?

223
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,720
Right, right. You're the best.

224
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,360
However, I think,

225
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,160
Feng Xia shouldn't be that hard to get.

226
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,720
You know, you've got it all.

227
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,400
Money, and more money.

228
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,960
If I were you, I would've won her over.

229
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,600
I just want her

230
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,160
to chase after me.

231
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,600
Zheng Nan.

232
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,920
Be realistic, okay?

233
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,720
Having dreams and having delusions
are two different things.

234
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,720
Let's go to sign up.

235
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,400
Sign up?

236
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,080
Where is he?

237
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,280
He took a side gig at noon,

238
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
and left.

239
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,400
I can't believe him.

240
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,280
To him, only money matters.

241
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,960
We made a killing on that movie fund.

242
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,600
He won't even spring
for some decent food.

243
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
You are just a food snob.

244
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,200
Want decent food?

245
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Buy it yourself.

246
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,400
I just don't have money.

247
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,080
Right.

248
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,360
He said that our movie fund

249
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,400
is almost enough.

250
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,080
We can start shooting soon.

251
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Really?

252
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,400
That's great.

253
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
Well, when we shoot the movie,

254
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,200
will there be lots of girls
coming to watch?

255
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,160
Dude, it's a big moment in my life.

256
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
Can you be more serious?

257
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,200
What are you thinking?

258
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,520
What's so funny?

259
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,520
We're about to film our movie.

260
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,400
Really? That's good news.

261
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:13,760
Isn't it?

262
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,600
Who's the heroine?

263
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,520
It's mine.

264
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,960
I'm asking. Who is the heroine?

265
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,400
We haven't written the script.

266
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,600
How would I know?

267
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,600
I'm telling you,

268
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,720
it must be me.

269
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Well, not necessarily.

270
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
It may be an auntie.

271
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,200
Give it to me.

272
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,080
I've eaten it already.

273
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,840
I don't mind.

274
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,640
Want more? Get yourself another serving.

275
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,720
Those three girls in your class,

276
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,640
are they seeing anyone?

277
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,640
Those three?

278
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,080
You're not into them all, are you?

279
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,520
What are you talking about?

280
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,200
Am I that kind of person?

281
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,160
Well, well.

282
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,720
I...

283
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,960
I like the petite and cute type.

284
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,760
Nobody I know of.

285
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,280
There is one you know.

286
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,400
I think Zirou is pretty good.

287
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,840
Forget about her.

288
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,400
She's going abroad.

289
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,200
You two, no chance.

290
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,520
Really?

291
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,080
Really.

292
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,600
That's great.

293
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,720
My parents are abroad.

294
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,520
Then we will be like a family.

295
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,400
We can look after her.

296
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
I'll check it for you?

297
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,280
You've gone too far.

298
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,600
What?

299
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,480
What what?

300
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,400
If you want it, get it yourself.

301
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,080
Why always take mine?

302
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,160
Yours is mine, isn't it?

303
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,960
Besides, can't we just share a plate?

304
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,720
How can we share a plate?

305
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,400
Why not?

306
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,160
Fine, even if we can,

307
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,520
one plate won't be enough for us.

308
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
I don't want to argue.

309
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,960
I'm leaving.

310
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,080
Stupid man.

311
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,520
That...

312
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,520
What's that?

313
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,080
Is it possible that

314
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,400
this girl has a crush on you?

315
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
Are you crazy?

316
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,640
She's a guy.

317
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,600
She came to look for me
in the men's room last night.

318
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,520
Really?

319
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
That's too scary.

320
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,640
So do you think

321
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,160
she has a crush on me?

322
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,280
If this is the case,

323
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,280
it is indeed unlikely.

324
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,960
Right.

325
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,400
Eat your food. Don't overthink.

326
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:35,840
Okay, okay.

327
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,520
It's enough.

328
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,160
Eat it yourself.

329
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,720
Where's your elective?

330
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,720
Complex building.

331
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,400
But I don't feel like going.

332
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,840
I wanna find a quiet place

333
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,160
to review for the retake exam.

334
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Gotta take those electives.

335
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,080
Don't wanna be short on credits later.

336
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,400
It's okay.

337
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,080
I've already asked for leave.

338
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,720
Pass this retake exam first.

339
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Okay, go for it.

340
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,400
Go for it.

341
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,200
Go for it, Yanhao darling.

342
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,840
Yanhao darling.

343
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,280
Go for it, come on!

344
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,200
Come on!

345
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,960
Director Zhang.

346
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
No class this afternoon?

347
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,960
Yep, free for two classes.

348
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,520
I'm gonna find a quiet place

349
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,760
to polish up

350
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,720
our Film Festival plan.

351
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,960
Keep it up!

352
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,760
Looking forward to your Film Festival.

353
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,960
Great thanks to our university

354
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,960
for the support.

355
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,840
Sure. We must support it.

356
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,960
Full support.

357
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,080
Thank you, Director.

358
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Then, I'm off.

359
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,200
Okay, okay.

360
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,600
Stop.

361
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,080
Director.

362
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,720
Why skip class?

363
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,200
I'm... going to review.

364
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,080
Review?

365
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,520
You review?

366
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,400
Retake's tomorrow.

367
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,600
I must review.

368
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,080
Others review on campus.

369
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,760
You rush outside.

370
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,840
Are you kidding me?

371
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,760
I'm not kidding. It's true.

372
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,600
Look at my review materials, look.

373
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,760
Review materials, aren't they?

374
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,720
That's more like it.

375
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,080
Well, Director,

376
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,160
I'm off now.

377
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,080
Catch you later!

378
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:24,840
See ya.

379
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,160
I'll be the invigilator tomorrow.

380
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,760
Alright.

381
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:00,960
Hello?

382
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,160
Where are you?

383
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,160
Auntie.

384
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,840
I'm hitting the gym.

385
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,280
Weren't we supposed to meet
this afternoon?

386
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,840
Why'd you stand me up?

387
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,280
I forgot about it.

388
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,160
I have no class this afternoon.

389
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,520
Just wanted some exercise.

390
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,400
How about tonight?

391
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,720
I'll join you tonight for the weekend.

392
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,720
Okay, Auntie.

393
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,520
That's it. I'll keep exercising.

394
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,840
Bye.

395
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,160
Hello, what would you like to order?

396
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,960
A glass of water first, thank you.

397
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,280
You can also scan the code to order.

398
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,400
Okay.

399
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,365
(Insufficient Balance)

400
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,720
Oops.

401
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,760
Help! Send me some pocket money.

402
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,080
(Help! Send me some pocket money.)

403
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,240
Fine, beg me.

404
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,280
Darn you.

405
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,480
Hurry. It's urgent.

406
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,400
Cursing at me?

407
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,640
No deal.

408
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,080
I beg you, please.

409
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,880
How about this?

410
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,640
Give me a seductive smile.

411
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,960
Piss off.

412
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,080
I'm in a hurry right now, darn it.

413
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,120
Sir, here's your water.

414
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,160
Have you ordered?

415
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,760
Still on it.

416
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
Or you can just tell me

417
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,000
what you like.

418
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,640
So, I have to order
if I wanna sit here, right?

419
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,640
Yes.

420
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,960
This area is for customers only.

421
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,760
Hurry up. It's really urgent.

422
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,400
Bro, I'm begging you.

423
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,120
Sir.

424
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,760
You're not borrowing now, are you?

425
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,160
Desperate for just coffee.

426
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,880
Bro, I'm begging you.

427
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,120
Well,

428
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,760
five yuan can beat a man.

429
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,000
We meet again.

430
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,000
You're here for coffee too?

431
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,640
This place is nice.

432
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,880
I... I come here often for coffee.

433
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,240
I just ordered an Americano.

434
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,960
Uh, ma'am.

435
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,240
For my Americano,
no sugar or milk, please.

436
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,760
Americano doesn't come with
sugar or milk.

437
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,640
Would you like to join me?

438
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,640
We may discuss the Film Festival.

439
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,480
Okay.

440
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,760
You really love juice?

441
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,880
I saw you drinking juice
at the bar yesterday.

442
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,360
Juice is good for health.

443
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,880
Right, right, right.

444
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,640
Juice, of course, is good for health.

445
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,240
No wonder your body looks great.

446
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,480
I mean, height.

447
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,640
We're almost the same height, right?

448
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,120
As a participant in the Film Festival,

449
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,360
do you have any thoughts or advice?

450
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,640
No.

451
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,240
But as

452
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,760
one of the many contestants,

453
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,880
I will do my best.

454
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,240
Actually, not many people
have signed up.

455
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,120
Besides you, there are two others.

456
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,760
It shouldn't be.

457
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,880
Is it because

458
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I tore down the poster
and affected the promotion?

459
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
Why did you take the poster?

460
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,120
I... I wanted to...

461
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,000
I wanted to put this poster

462
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,360
up on the wall to motivate myself.

463
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,520
But... but I only took one.

464
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,880
It shouldn't affect much, right?

465
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
If you want the poster,

466
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,120
go to the student union.

467
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,000
Don't do this again.

468
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,120
Be assured, I won't.

469
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,640
I'm thinking, maybe, I should

470
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,760
apply to join the student union.

471
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,120
You didn't have lunch with us.

472
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,000
Where did you go?

473
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
I went back to the dorm.

474
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,480
I didn't see you in the dorm.

475
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,520
Can't I go out for a bit?

476
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,760
Shady.

477
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,640
You don't hang out
with us anymore, do you?

478
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,360
I don't hang out with you?

479
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,080
Didn't we drink together last night?

480
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,120
You're not right.

481
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,760
Why?

482
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,640
Did you go to meet Li Yanhao?

483
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
Did you?

484
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,000
Yes, yes, yes.

485
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,760
Just admit it.

486
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,760
Why fear?

487
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,760
This Li Yanhao

488
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,120
doesn't seem reliable to me.

489
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,360
Although he saved you before,

490
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,240
we helped him

491
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,000
make that dance video,

492
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
in the scorching summer.

493
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,640
The video hasn't even been edited yet.

494
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,120
He...

495
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
He's busy studying.

496
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,000
Exams are coming up.

497
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,240
He's no time to edit the video.

498
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,480
Once he has time,

499
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
he'll surely finish editing
and send it to me.

500
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,640
You guys haven't been together.

501
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,760
You're already defending him.

502
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,000
If you two really are together,

503
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,640
you might just forget all about us.

504
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,880
Wu Qianqian.

505
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,120
I mean,

506
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,120
you ardently defend him.

507
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,760
His leading actress
in that Film Festival

508
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,880
has to be you, right?

509
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,520
Wu Qianqian, why are you so gossipy?

510
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,640
Have you read the assigned textbooks?

511
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,280
Study well. Read well.

512
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,760
Don't wait until the exams.

513
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,640
Or the teacher will

514
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,760
say you're just like an idiot.

515
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
Why insult me?

516
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,640
I'm not.

517
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
If you were the student union president,

518
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,240
what methods would you use

519
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,600
to get people to sign up?

520
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,600
First of all,

521
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,160
publicity should be strengthened.

522
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,600
You see, it's the Internet era now.

523
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,720
Almost no one reads the posters anymore.

524
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,760
We've also promoted it

525
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,640
on the WeChat account and campus forum.

526
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,360
But the WeChat account
needs to have a wide reach.

527
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
So, online and offline publicity

528
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,360
should go hand in hand.

529
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,600
First, share it via the WeChat account
and Moments.

530
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
For offline promotion,

531
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,720
posters should be displayed on weekends.

532
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,480
Also, roadshows.

533
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,120
Go on.

534
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,480
For the roadshows,

535
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,120
you may invite students from,
say, the dance department,

536
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,080
the arts department,

537
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,600
and your media department,

538
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,760
to help.

539
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,480
Gather all of them

540
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,240
and put on a live show.

541
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,480
Like a talent showcase.

542
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,240
The purpose here
is to attract attention.

543
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,880
Leave the rest to me.

544
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,520
I'll make a live claim

545
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,000
as a contestant.

546
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,240
Tell them the bar for the Film Festival

547
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
just isn't that high.

548
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,120
That's a bit of a publicity stunt.

549
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,880
We do have some live performance.

550
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,240
But I never thought of

551
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,160
using roadshows for publicity.

552
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,080
Well, I thought of it.

553
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,280
So,

554
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,120
I really wanna join
the student union to help.

555
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,240
Okay.

556
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,640
Then after the Film Festival,

557
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,880
I'll consider your joining.

558
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,880
It's a deal.

559
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,080
Your suggestion is excellent.

560
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,120
I'll integrate it into the plan.

561
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,160
Thank you.

562
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
Then, it's my honor as well.

563
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,960
I'm leaving.

564
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,240
Yu Lan.

565
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,720
Did you live in Nanzhou City
when you were young?

566
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,360
What's the matter?

567
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
No, nothing.

568
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,880
I lived there until college.

569
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,480
No, I never lived there.

570
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,360
Okay, alright, see you then.

571
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,960
I'll find a place to study.

572
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,280
Xiao Rang.

573
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,280
Bar?

574
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,720
You're crazy, bro.

575
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,360
I have a retake exam tomorrow.

576
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,720
I'll get some food,

577
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,000
and return to the dorm to study.

578
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,840
Right, tell Xiangdong

579
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,760
to keep

580
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,600
today's earnings.

581
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,240
No need to put it in the movie fund.

582
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,960
Alright.

583
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,280
Okay, hanging up now.

584
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,960
Don't show off to me.

585
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
Li Yanhao is not coming.

586
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120
He has an exam tomorrow.

587
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,640
And no need to put the money
in the movie fund.

588
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,600
How can that be?

589
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,600
It must

590
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,360
go to the fund in full.

591
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,360
Alright, I'm now drawing in customers.

592
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
You know what.

593
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,120
This Nezha costume really suits you.

594
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,760
Keep up the good work. See ya.

595
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,360
I...

596
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,480
You.

597
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,720
I really think this outfit of yours

598
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,480
looks much better than his.

599
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,240
It particularly suits you.

600
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,840
Simply tailor-made for you.

601
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
Where is the straw hat outfit
I wore yesterday?

602
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,960
It got dirty. I washed it.

603
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,360
Don't you think
this outfit particularly suits you?

604
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,280
From now on, wear this every day.

605
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,960
What if this outfit also gets dirty?

606
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,760
Then just work naked.

607
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
Wanna make money?

608
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,480
Stop with the nonsense.

609
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
Get busy.

610
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,480
You.

611
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,480
Shake behind the counter.

612
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,720
Let me tell you something.

613
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,640
Someone gave me a suggestion today.

614
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,240
He said, the Film Festival
can be promoted via roadshows.

615
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,000
Come help me, will you?

616
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,280
I don't have time.

617
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,120
After classes, I have to
go play balls and hit the gym.

618
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,240
Besides,

619
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,280
so many people
in the student union can help.

620
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,720
My absence won't matter.

621
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
It does matter.

622
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,600
What we lack is someone like you,

623
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,840
strong, sturdy and capable.

624
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,360
Seeking my help for tough tasks?

625
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,120
I'm even less keen to go.

626
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,120
You're a member of the media department.

627
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,000
Don't skip such a great opportunity.

628
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,120
Gym every day.

629
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,720
Wanna go to the sports department?

630
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,960
Auntie.

631
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,880
I'm only a junior.

632
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,240
Practice is not that necessary.

633
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,480
I started doing practical work
during my first week.

634
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,600
Right.

635
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,360
Who can match up with my goddess auntie?

636
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,360
So meticulous.

637
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,640
Was it Kang Yide who gave you this idea?

638
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,280
What's on your mind?

639
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,760
Nothing.

640
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,360
Look.

641
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
You must go, anyway.

642
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,480
I'm doing the roadshow promotion

643
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,760
next week.

644
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,880
It's outdoors.

645
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,720
You must come.

646
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,600
How about this?

647
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,000
Whether I go or not is up to God.

648
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,360
If I can make the shot, I'll go.

649
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,360
If not, then I won't.

650
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,000
Go ahead, I believe in you.

651
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,880
God's choice.

652
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,240
What is this?

653
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,720
Hanging by the beam?

654
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,480
Need a needle?

655
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,000
If you doze off, I will prick you.

656
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,600
How's it?

657
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
Feel the piercing prick.

658
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,480
Mr. Lei made you

659
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,000
dress up as Nezha because I didn't go?

660
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,120
Don't mention it. All night.

661
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,360
This whole night,

662
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,480
customers couldn't even
look me in the eye.

663
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,280
Do you think this looks good?

664
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,760
What taste is it?

665
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,880
I was thinking about
adding girls on WeChat.

666
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,000
What a daydream.

667
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,080
Alright, go wash up.

668
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,000
Not tonight.

669
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,600
Tired as heck.

670
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,640
Leave it tomorrow.

671
00:30:36,864 --> 00:30:38,864
(Sunset Square Group Chat:
Tong, where are you?)

672
00:30:38,864 --> 00:30:40,736
(Where are you? Let's grab a drink.
Such a boring weekend night.)

673
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,760
Wait.

674
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,000
You're something, Li Yanhao.

675
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,080
