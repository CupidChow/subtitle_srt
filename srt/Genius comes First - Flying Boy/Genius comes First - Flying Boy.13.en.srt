Don't stay here.

69
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,600
Come on. Let's go and check on it.

70
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,160
What's the big deal about a nude guy?

I think this student union president
really makes you dumb.

Nothing's been this much fun
since the uni was founded.

73
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,600
Come and witness it with our own eyes.

74
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,776
Let's go.

75
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,720
Chop chop. Take it off.

76
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,440
Exactly.

77
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,720

78
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,200

88
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,720
Take it off.

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,520
- Right.
- Off.

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,640
We've been waiting for ages.

91
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,760
Exactly.

92
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,720
Take it off.

93
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
Chop chop.

94
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,720
Take it off.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,920
Hurry up.

96
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,320
- Take it off.
- Off. Quick.

97
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,000
Wait.

98
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,480
Since everyone is here,

99
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,640
how about we all engage?

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,160
How would you like to engage?

101
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,760
I'll be the model.

102
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,160
You two paint. How about it?

103
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,920
No problem. Go ahead.

104
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:27,080
She?

105
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,320
She wants to be the model.

106
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,200
Don't just stand there. Help.

107
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,720
What is it? Cover up?

108
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,320
What is it?

109
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,720
- That's it?
- What for?

110
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,320
What is this?

111
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,000
This outfit...

112
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,760
I've heard that painters

113
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,040
hate two items.

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,000
Mirrors and sequins.

115
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,040
Let's start.

116
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,000
Fine. Bring it on!

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,880
This is interesting.

118
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,768
Quite interesting.

119
00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:57,360
So funny.

120
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,200
Look at this vest.

121
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,520
So bright.

122
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,320
Why didn't you come today?

123
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,200
I got hurt.

124
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,600
Where? Let me see.

125
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
My leg... hurts.

126
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
My back hurts too.

127
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,800
My neck. Look at it.

128
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,320
Then I'll take you to the infirmary.

129
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,320
Infirmary?

130
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
No, no, no.

131
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,640
I'm not going there.

132
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,480
Why not?

133
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,480
I'm fine now.

134
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Already?

135
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,040
I'm so happy to see you.

136
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,200
Once I'm happy, all the pains are gone.

137
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,760
Let's watch the contest.

138
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,160
It's done?

139
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,720
I'm done as well.

140
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,320
Then, how do we decide on the winner?

141
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,040
As we discussed,

142
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,200
by voting.

143
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,760
How about voting by show of hands?

144
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,200
It's okay with me.

145
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,920
If there's no better way,

146
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,040
I suggest

147
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,880
a more ancient way to vote.

148
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,040
Distribute your pens to the audience.

149
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,200
Give your brush to the one you prefer.

150
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,480
Fine with me.

151
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,320
Let's just do it this way.

152
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,480
Then I'll distribute the pens
to everyone.

153
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,320
Everyone, start voting now.

154
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,560
- Okay.
- Good.

155
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,840
- Good.
- Good.

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,520
Good.

157
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,880
Jiatong. Jiatong. Jiatong.

158
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,440
Don't you want to make money?

159
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,120
Do you have any idea?

160
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,560
Work as bartenders at Qinghong Bar.

161
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,400
We are already bartenders there.

162
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,440
Isn't that where you work?

163
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll ask Mr. Lei to give you a raise.

164
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,680
A raise?

165
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,080
Wait.

166
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Why would Mr. Lei listen to you?

167
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,880
Yeah, why?

168
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,080
He...

169
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,000
is my dad.

170
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,840
Really?

171
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,960
You two don't resemble each other.

172
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,400
You don't have the same last name.

173
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,960
That's my business.

174
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,000
It's a deal then.

175
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,440
You'll work as bartenders at night.

176
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,760
During the day, I can paint portraits
in the square

177
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,320
to earn some money.

178
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,320
Then I can set up a stall beside you

179
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,560
selling plush toys.

180
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,000
We can also take some pictures

181
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,400
or short videos for visitors,

182
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,200
as keepsakes.

183
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,280
I can accompany...

184
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,640
you all.

185
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,280
I'll put on my performance costume

186
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,640
and perform.

187
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,560
No way.

188
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,080
Men should earn the bread.

189
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,400
You don't get involved.

190
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,560
What's it? Don't believe me?

191
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,120
Once I start, I'll

192
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,280
probably make more money

193
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,880
than you guys.

194
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
More money, more.

195
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,640
Alright.

196
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,320
Well, cheers to the movie fund.

197
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,440
Cheers.

198
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,120
Good.

199
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,080
Cheers for us.

200
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,760
- Cheers.
- Come on.

201
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,760
Cheers. Cheers.

202
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,352
Cheers.

203
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:08,880
Go for it.

204
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,680
Are you here to show off your victory?

205
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,440
I'm not that bored.

206
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,080
Actually, I'm also curious about

207
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,000
what your gallery would look like.

208
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,440
So I came to have a look.

209
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,440
You won today.

210
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,320
But it means nothing.

211
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,840
Of course.

212
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,960
You are still you. I'm still me.

213
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We are still classmates.

214
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,120
Go to the same studio.

215
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,000
To me,

216
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,560
I just painted a picture

217
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,680
in front of a bunch
of bored audience today.

218
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,080
If it weren't for you,

219
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,080
I would never do such a silly thing.

220
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,640
Actually, I feel like

221
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,200
the two of us were like

222
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,400
two monkeys being teased today.

223
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,080
Quite ridiculous.

224
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,640
From the first day we met,

225
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,120
I had an inexplicable dislike for you.

226
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,080
Not strange.

227
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,280
Many people feel this way.

228
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,200
Especially when I see your face,

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,680
I just want to

230
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,520
trample you underfoot.

231
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,400
But after seeing your drawings,

232
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,560
I am convincingly

233
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,440
disabused of that thought.

234
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,760
Did your father beat you often
as a child?

235
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
How did you know?

236
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,960
I recognized my past self in your gaze.

237
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,440
Irritable, angry, arrogant.

238
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,200
Hate everything.

239
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,280
I just hate you.

240
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,080
Why should you excel me?

241
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,680
Since I was a kid, whatever I did,

242
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,560
I was always number one.

243
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,880
You know?

244
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,000
As long as I didn't do well, even once,

245
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,080
my father would pick up anything

246
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,320
in his reach

247
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,120
and hit me with it.

248
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,560
That pain.

249
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,680
So from a young age,

250
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,760
I was required to do my best,

251
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,880
and be most excellent.

252
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,000
I would compare with every friend

253
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,680
around me.

254
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,120
That's the only way
life has meanings to me.

255
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,000
I won the first place in piano

256
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,760
and equestrian contests.

257
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,440
Even for getting into this university,

258
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,960
I was the top one.

259
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,680
Let me ask you.

260
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,000
Why should my paintings
be less good than yours?

261
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,880
I think it's the saddest thing
in the world

262
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,640
to always compare with others.

263
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,520
When I was very young,

264
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,120
my parents got divorced.

265
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,760
I lived with my father.

266
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,560
He was busy making money.

267
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,840
Never really took care of me.

268
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,320
Every time I saw him,

269
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,400
I would get beaten.

270
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,400
So in my memory,

271
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,200
only when he gave me money

272
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,560
did I feel that he was my father.

273
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,960
He is old now.

274
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,880
He bought this gallery for me.

275
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,840
But I'm not happy at all.

276
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,640
Do you know why?

277
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,640
Because I know he did it

278
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,120
not for me.

279
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,680
It's just to make him feel good

280
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,080
in front of others.

281
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,440
My dad was an alcoholic when I was kid.

282
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,440
Every time he drank too much,

283
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,840
he would beat my mum and I heavily.

284
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,560
Then, my mum jumped off a building.

285
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,520
I left that home.

286
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,000
I survived on the streets,

287
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,120
painting portraits for others

288
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,840
with my immature drawing.

289
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,080
Perhaps it was at that time

290
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,960
that I truly understood how to paint.

291
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,000
Didn't know you've been through this.

292
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,200
I can finally understand you.

293
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,280
If it were me,

294
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,440
I would probably be even more annoying.

295
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,680
Cheers to the disgraceful past
and bad-tempered fathers.

296
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,000
One day I will defeat you.

297
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,080
Wait and see.

(Make Money for Movies)

299
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,880
Two hours passed.

300
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,640
And yet no one came.

301
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,680
This is the reality.

302
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,080
Maybe we are here too early?

303
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,400
People are still sleeping.

304
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,520
I forgot that today is the weekend.

305
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,000
People may still be in bed.

306
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,000
How could we make such a basic mistake?

307
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,680
Make Money for Movies?

308
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,200
You guys are really going all out.

309
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,120
How about it?

310
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,840
See our determination to win?

311
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,760
To win or not, I've no idea.

312
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,640
All I know is that till now,

313
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,760
not a penny earned, right?

This student.

315
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,880
You can become our first customer.

316
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,080
Let me introduce.

317
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,680
We offer one-stop Moments services.

318
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,920
First, choose a toy.

319
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,800
Isn't it cute?

320
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,920
Then we will take a photo of you.

321
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,560
While the photo is being edited,

322
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,080
our artist will draw

323
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,440
an awesome portrait of you.

324
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,040
Then, you can post the photo

325
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,280
in your Moments.

326
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,800
The portrait can be your profile.

328
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,680
will definitely be exclusive.

329
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,800
I find it dull.

330
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,400
No, no, no.

331
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,160
We're doing it for making movies.

332
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,320
Just give it a try.

333
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
We don't charge you.

334
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,040
Just promote it for us

335
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,280
in the Internet or Moments.

336
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,440
Alright then.

337
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,280
Draw me nicely, okay?

338
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,320
Rest assured.

339
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,680
The brush has a beauty filter.

340
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,680
Posted it on Moments
and the campus network.

341
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,640

00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:05,920
That's right.

381
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,000
Take a photo.

382
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,520
Come on.

383
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,920
- Come on.
- This one.

384
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,800
This is good.

385
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,920
Come on.

386
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,000
But no one takes it for us.

387
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,880
The key distinction
between man and animals

388
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,520
is that man knows how to use tools.

389
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,760
(Make Money for Movies)
Come on.

390
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,880
Get ready.

391
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,040
Three, two, one, cheese!

392
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,760
Has the person selected for Beijing

393
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,880
been chosen yet?

394
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,640
It's definitely Jiatong.

395
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,080
I think the class head has been
working hard lately.

396
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,040
Perhaps it's her.

397
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,080
Did you forget that

398
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,560
during class earlier,

399
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,800
Ms. Zhao called Li Jiatong over
for some quiet talk.

400
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,440
It must be about this matter.

401
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,680
By the way, Li Jiatong dances

402
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,160
much better than the class head.

403
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,000
That's right.

404
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,760
Pity for the class head.

405
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,400
Exactly.

406
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,200
Working so hard.

407
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,640
Just unable to
match Li Jiatong's talent.

408
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,640
Could you two be louder?

409
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,400
I...

410
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,000
Class head, you heard us?

411
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,880
Cla...class head.

412
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,400
We're not saying you're not good.

413
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,000
Who are you two to judge me here?

414
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,080
You, just eat all the time.

415
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,520
And you, just play.

416
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
Look at your dance.

417
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,560
I'm even ashamed to judge.

418
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,000
I know I'm not talented.

419
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
So I just give up then.

420
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Is this your excuse for not trying hard?

421
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,280
You deserve the poor dancing.

422
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,320
You deserve the rows behind.

423
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,640
You...

424
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,520
I...

425
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
I keep eating.

426
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,640
Mind your own.

427
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,040
Class is over.

428
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,840
Lunchtime.

429
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,320
What's the rush!

430
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,400
I'm telling you.

431
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,520
Failing major finals
in your freshman year

432
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,880
can get you drop out.

433
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
You'd better be serious.

434
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,080
Miss, don't be angry.

435
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,280
We'll pass. No worry.

436
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,760
Right, we are all confident.

437
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,760
Miss.

438
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,800
Even the last two are confident.

439
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,200
We're even more confident, right?

440
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,680
Exactly.

441
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,320
Alright.

442
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,320
I don't want to see anyone

443
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,640
of our class drop out next year.

444
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,280
Class dismissed.

445
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,880
Why are you here again?

446
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,080
To see you.

447
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,320
What's the use of coming to see me?

448
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,760
Do all that's needed.

449
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:43,080
I...

450
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,000
What?

451
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,000
Always like this.

452
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,000
Don't come here again.

453
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,000
Hello.

454
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,920
Hello, I...

455
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,440
Hey there, I'm Li Yanhao.

456
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,160
He is Xiao Rang.

457
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,760
Right.

458
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,560
We are the top students in our class.

459
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,880
Mrs. Jiang likes us the most.

460
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,440
I just saw you chatting with her.

461
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,440
You are special someone of her, right?

462
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,640
Special, right?

463
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,560
I'm her boyfriend.

464
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,080
We've known each other since college.

465
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,800
I've always liked her.

466
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,520
I know she likes me too.

467
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,320
I want to propose to her.

468
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,520
Worried that Mrs. Jiang
might dislike it?

469
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,400
Right.

470
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,800
How about this.

471
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,400
Wait until we finish our exams.

472
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,760
Then, based on your personality,

473
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,800
we'll develop
a holistic training program for you.

474
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,520
How is it?

475
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,760
No way.

476
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,640
Before your final exams,

477
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,920
if I haven't proposed yet,

478
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,320
she'll break up with me.

479
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,080
Is it that serious?

480
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,880
Yes, it is.

481
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,080
That must be scheduled immediately.

482
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,200
Alright, same time tomorrow.

483
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,560
Let's meet in our dorm 414.

484
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,040
Okay.

485
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,880
I'll leave it to you.

486
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,640
Trust us.

487
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,160
Take care.

488
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,880
Any good idea?

489
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,080
Listen.

490
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,800
It's a secret.

491
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,880
I shouldn't have asked you.

492
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,800
Who cares to know.

493
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,080
I heard you won that match,

494
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,560
and are now a bit famous on campus?

495
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,000
You are well-informed.

496
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,280
These persons

497
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,280
are my informants on campus.

498
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,400
Know everything about you.

499
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,520
So what?

500
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,560
You're not interested in my painting.

501
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,760
Who said that?

502
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,440
Mr. Lei.

503
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,320
I've done all the work.

504
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,080
Done?

505
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,560
Then get out.

506
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,000
Don't be late tomorrow.

507
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,080
Or I'll cut your pay.

508
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,560
Why are you looking at him? Get out.

509
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,400
You're as mean as ever.

510
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,280
A good boss needs to be mean.

511
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,520
You just speak to your dad in this tone?

512
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,000
Because when I was young,

513
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,160
you spoke to my mom this way.

00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:49,600

526
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,200
Want more practice.

527
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,400
For the Beijing trip?

528
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,160
Doing your practice at the last minute.

529
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,200
Didn't you have fun

530
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,400
making videos with Li Yanhao before?

531
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,080
Well,

532
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,520
now that you're going to Beijing,

533
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,760
so you just start working on it?

534
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,080
Liu Lu, what is it exactly?

535
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,880
Why do I feel that

536
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,080
you've changed lately?

537
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,040
Have I upset you?

538
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,920
I've always been this way.

539
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,200
I know why.

540
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,920
Is it because

541
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,680
I got the chance to go to Beijing,

542
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,520
not you?

543
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,760
So you're mad at me?

544
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,800
This is why.

545
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,880
I'm not going to Beijing.

546
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,320
Ms. Zhao will surely let you go.

547
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,800
Please, don't be mad at me.

548
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,920
Don't be mad at me.

549
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,880
Li Jiatong.

550
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,920
- What do you mean by that?
- I...

551
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,520
Is it an insult?

552
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,200
Do you think I can get the chance

553
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,680
only when you drop it?

554
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,040
I... I don't mean that.

555
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,280
I really don't mean that.

556
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,800
Eat up.

557
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,520
If it weren't for your sweet talk,

558
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,560
at such late hours,

559
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,000
I would've kicked you out.

560
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,160
I went to the library

561
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,920
studying too late.

562
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,200
The dorm's locked.

563
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,320
You went to the library?

564
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,400
Weightlifting there?

565
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,000
I went there to study.

566
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,760
What for?

567
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,080
Wanna turn to literature?

568
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,320
Final exams are in a few days.

569
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,560
I need to prepare, alright?

570
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,080
After I pass the exams,

571
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,320
I'll continue exercising.

572
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,560
I suggest you switch your major.

573
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,880
The sports department
needs talents like you.

574
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,880
I can call the head
of the Sports Department.

575
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,560
Let's discuss your major switch.

576
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,400
What do you think?

577
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,800
Why not transfer me to
the Library Management Department?

578
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,280
Then Xiao Rang will have to drop out
in a few days, right?

579
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,640
Am I that annoying?

580
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,760
A little.

581
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,880
Auntie.

582
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,800
Think carefully before speaking.

583
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,400
Still a little.

584
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,520
Auntie!

585
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,200
Slow.

586
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,760
The wine is finished.

587
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,760
I'm off.

588
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,040
Stay and chat with me.

589
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,800
No topics between us.

590
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,000
If it weren't for those free drinks,

591
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,040
I wouldn't come here.

592
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,640
Isn't it natural

593
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,040
for a son to drink his dad's wine?

594
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:43,880
Right.

595
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,200
I'm helping Li Yanhao on a movie.

596
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,000
I know.

597
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,440
I support you whatever you do.

598
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,640
When I used to paint,

599
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,880
I didn't see you so supportive.

600
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,520
Doesn't matter.

601
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
Film-making needs money.

602
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,520
Increase their pay.

603
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,560
No problem.

604
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,560
Next time, back to the old house,

605
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,280
can we have a drink together?

606
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,000
Free wine. Pay rise agreed.

607
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,560
Still this attitude.

608
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,000
Auntie.

609
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,160
I'll share your bed.

610
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,160
Auntie.

611
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,880
I've even found a boyfriend.

612
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,640
When will you find one too?

613
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,200
I'd better not trouble others.

614
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,080
You've troubled others enough already.

615
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,560
What are you talking about?

616
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,000
Besides,

617
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,680
it would be a real blessing

618
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,200
if anyone can win over
my goddess auntie.

619
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,040
I haven't thought about these.

620
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,920
As for you,

621
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,400
how come you're suddenly with Xiao Rang?

622
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,640
I'm puzzled, too.

623
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,760
When he was beaten up

624
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,640
and pinned under me,

625
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,560
I had an inexplicable feeling.

626
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,920
Why?

627
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,280
Tell me about you.

628
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,040
Among these guys around you,

629
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,200
anyone attracts you?

630
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,640
Kang Yide? Li Yanhao?

631
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,640
Or someone else?

632
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,400
Why Li Yanhao?

633
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,880
Don't you know
that he enters the Film Festival

634
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,280
just to get close to you?

635
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,440
I don't.

636
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,560
Look.

637
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,000
Li Yanhao,

638
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,880
the worst student in the class,

639
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,040
wants to make movies.

640
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,520
If it's for money,

641
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,200
he spent all his savings

642
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,920
helping the little girl.

643
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,640
If it's for fame,

644
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,760
our Film Festival

645
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,280
is not that influential, is it?

646
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,280
So he has only one purpose.

647
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,920
You.

648
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Stop the nonsense.

649
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,400
If you have to choose one,

650
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,080
I guess you would choose Kang Yide,
right?

651
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,640
Why do you say that?

652
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,800
It's said that

653
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
able men and beauties are natural match.

654
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,400
You two are typical

655
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,520
able man and beauty.

656
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,640
It's against nature
if you're not a couple.

657
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,640
I really haven't thought about these.

658
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,880
But recently, Kang Yide

659
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,000
has indeed helped me a lot.

660
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,320
Li Yanhao.

661
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,880
Li Yanhao has also given you
considerable support.

662
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
Right, I heard from Xiao Rang

663
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,640
that you two were classmates

664
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,560
in the primary school.

665
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,200
This can't be true, can it?

666
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,640
Shouldn't be true.

667
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,080
I've never heard you mention this.

668
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,320
Why are you so gossipy?

669
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,920
Go to sleep.

670
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
We have classes tomorrow.

671
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,520
(Dong, we still need money.)

672
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,440
Ms. Li.

673
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,800
Why are you dancing here

674
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,760
at midnight?

675
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,760
If you didn't know me,

676
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,160
you'd have screamed in terror.

677
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,160
What are you doing?

678
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,280
I just want to practice a bit more.

679
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,800
- Haven't you practiced all day already?
- I...

680
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,000
Listen, the exam is coming.

681
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,360
If you're wasted,

682
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,840
you won't even be able to take it.

683
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,120
Then for the sake of not being wasted,

684
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,320
I'll listen to you.

685
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,280
Go to sleep.

686
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,360
Sleep. Sleep.

687
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,520
Will you do it yourself, or I help?

688
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,040
I'll do it myself.

689
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,360
Hurry up.

690
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,880
Are you sure

691
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,120
no one will see us here?

692
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,760
Then paint quickly.

693
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,920
My retake's approaching.

694
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,080
I have to go and study.

695
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,840
So much work to do.

696
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,400
