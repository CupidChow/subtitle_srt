00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,640
yet still watching those films?

194
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,880
You are a college student,

195
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,880
but still can't slack off
in your studies.

196
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,200
Yes, you are right.

197
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What you said is right.

198
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,240
Right.

199
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,120
You and Xiao Rang

200
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,800
are notorious now.

201
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,120
Your dorm mates even moved out now.

202
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,640
Yes.

203
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,800
Only the two of you are here.

204
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,880
Don't do anything weird.

205
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,760
No, never.

206
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,320
Never.

207
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,320
I'm leaving.

208
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,560
Bye.

209
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,320
Wait.

210
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,000
Well...

211
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm really impressed.

212
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,760
I wonder why your dorm is so clean.

213
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,120
So all the mess is in here.

214
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,760
Wait, why...?

215
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,440
You...

216
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,000
Give me the phone.

217
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,240
Phone.

218
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,320
Here's my contact.

219
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,320
I don't want to stay any longer.

220
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,200
Take care.

221
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,880
I've come to pick you up, bro.

222
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,880
What's going on?

223
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,680
What's going on?

224
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,520
Super handsome.

225
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,080
Really?

226
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,640
I know. I also find him very handsome.

227
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,760
What an idol.

228
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,240
So handsome.

229
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,760
The Hooligan Duo. Let's go.

230
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Let's go.

231
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,120
Come on.

232
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,440
Head to the infirmary.

233
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,760
Mr. Xiao, go ahead.

234
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,240
Go.

235
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,560
Cheer up.

236
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,240
What's wrong?

237
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,960
It's Yu Lan.

238
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,000
Got charmed again?

239
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,400
Tell me, how can I get to know her?

240
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,520
That's simple.

241
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,320
Just walk up to her now and tell her.

242
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,240
My name is Li Yanhao.

243
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,200
Forget it.

244
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,320
I'm notorious now.

245
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,400
It would scare her away.

246
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,560
Nice shot!

247
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,800
I'm done.

248
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,680
I'll hit the gym.

249
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,240
Yu Lan.

250
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,640
Let's go.

251
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,440
So she likes guys who play basketball.

252
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,680
When I've recovered,

253
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,680
I'll show off in front of her.

254
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Forget it.

255
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,680
Look at those guys on the court,

256
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,000
they look like professionals.

257
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,520
We can't beat them.

258
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,800
But actually, if you want to see Yu Lan,

259
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,960
it's not that difficult.

260
00:14:35,648 --> 00:14:38,880
Tonight at 7 PM, there's a reading event
she organized at the Complex Building.

261
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,200
How did you know?

262
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,640
I'm well-informed.

263
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,760
Why the rush?

264
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,640
Hurry up.

265
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,520
Come on, hurry.

266
00:14:50,163 --> 00:14:52,032
(Infirmary)

267
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,120
Don't fight next time.

268
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,800
Miss, how do you know I fought?

269
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,400
You could fool Ms. Jiang,

270
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,960
but not me.

271
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,000
Right.

272
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,120
Dr. Zhou is not only
skillful in medicine,

273
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,560
but also with excellent observation

274
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,200
He said he slipped on a banana peel.

275
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,240
Who'd believe that?

276
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
It's impossible.

277
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,000
After this, I'll apply medicine on you.

278
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
No, thank you.

279
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
I have recovered.

280
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,440
Look.

281
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,120
You two, be careful.

282
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,560
You two are known as Hooligan Duo...

283
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,880
Alright, come back in three days.

284
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,440
Okay.

285
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,520
Don't you want it treated?

286
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,440
I don't need it.

287
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,800
I don't want to be like him,

288
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,120
screaming out.

289
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,800
Sorry, Miss.

290
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,320
See you.

291
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,000
Don't.

292
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,240
Don't see me again.

293
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Why did you run?

294
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,120
You wanted to prick me.

295
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,000
Of course, I ran.

296
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,680
Look at you.

297
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,080
You are still afraid of needles.

298
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,560
It won't kill you.

299
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,240
Stop it.

300
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,440
There are so many people.

301
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,440
If we don't go back now,

302
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,240
we'd be gawked at.

303
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,640
Don't worry. We can solve it one day.

304
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
But before that,

305
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,440
I have to see my Yu Lan.

306
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,320
Hurry, come on.

307
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,880
Hurry.

308
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,800
Go.

309
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,320
Five, six, seven, eight.

310
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,200
Stretch it out.

311
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,960
Okay, take a break.

312
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,320
(Go to the rooftop tonight.
Dare to be late, and you're dead.)

313
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,120
Li Jiatong.

314
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,320
Come have a chat.

315
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,200
- Look good?
- Yes, so cool.

316
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,160
Like a silly groom eager to marry.

317
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,640
You just can't say anything nice.

318
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,000
We're going to a reading event.

319
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,520
I have to dress up formally.

320
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,280
I don't know if it's formal.

321
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,160
But I'm sure

322
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,520
it looks weird.

323
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,400
What do you suggest?

324
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,280
Listen.

325
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,200
What you wear is not important.

326
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,280
What's wrong
with wearing a vest and shorts?

327
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,880
What's important is your thought.

328
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,640
Just take your notebook

329
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,800
and go in front of Yu Lan,

330
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
then kneel down and say. Lan,

331
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,640
I've finally found you.

332
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,800
My son, get up now.

333
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,520
Hey you!

334
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,640
Can't you say something useful?

335
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,880
If I wear a vest and shorts,

336
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,520
she would think I'm really a hooligan.

337
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,400
How about this?

338
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,520
Alright.

339
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,160
You've really upgraded me
from a harasser

340
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,120
to a stalker.

341
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
I think it's quite good.

342
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,920
I told you to tell her directly.

343
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,520
But you don't.

344
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,280
What do you want?

345
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,120
There's no need

346
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,440
to wear a mask, right?

347
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,560
What?

348
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,760
Who are we now?

349
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,920
Hooligan Duo.

350
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,880
Beauties abound in the reading event.

351
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,640
We

352
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,160
might scare them off.

353
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,000
That makes sense.

354
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,120
Hurry up.

355
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,160
Or we'll be late. Hurry.

356
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,120
Films bring us joy and dreams,

357
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,120
also reveal truth and suffering.

358
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,800
They don't solve problems,

359
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,280
nor provide answers.

360
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,120
But that's the film.

361
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,680
Over there.

362
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,400
I thought it starts at 7 PM.

363
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,320
Why has it started?

364
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,280
You got it wrong.

365
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,400
Great films allow our lives

366
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,920
to extend across various dimensions.

367
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,280
Through the light in the darkness...

368
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,800
How could you get this wrong?

369
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,520
Listen.

370
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,160
You made me an hour less
to see my goddess and shall be punished.

371
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,400
What?

372
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,040
We have the opportunity
to transcend the boundaries

373
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,800
of time and space,

374
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,320
weaving beautiful dreams.

375
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,040
Excuse me.

376
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,160
Thank you all for attending
today's reading event.

377
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,440
I have news to tell you.

378
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,680
The Binhai University Film Festival
has begun.

379
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,640

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,400
come to me at the student union.

383
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,400
Eat it, I made it myself.

384
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,040
Have you washed your hands?

385
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,120
Several times.

386
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,120
They're clean.

387
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,440
Very well.

388
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,520
It is a bit hot.

389
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,400
Hot.

390
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,680
Why are you dressed up?

391
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,280
And you dressed me up like a freak.

392
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,280
What you wear doesn't matter.

393
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,000
You're just afraid I would

394
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,040
steal your thunder.

395
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,520
Narrow-minded.

396
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,400
What's more,

397
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,160
you can never steal my thunder.

398
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,040
Get lost.

399
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,120
Hooligan Duo.

400
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,680
Fortunately, I ran fast.

401
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,160
Or, we would be gawked at again.

402
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,680
How dare you say so!

403
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,640
You're dressed up,

404
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,800
so we got recognized.

405
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,160
What's wrong with it?

406
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,320
It's because I'm charming, okay?

407
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,760
It's not about what I wear.

408
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,440
Charm?

409
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,320
You...

410
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,520
Forget it. Not your fault.

411
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,120
It's my fault for being notorious.

412
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,800
I have things to do. Bye.

413
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,880
What's up?

414
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,320
You're making me pay again.

415
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,680
Sorry, I'm late.

416
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,200
What took you so long?

417
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,920
I've told you

418
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,280
you'll be dead if you're late.

419
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,160
Where's your phone?

420
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,440
I came in too much of a hurry,

421
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,280
so I forgot it.

422
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,640
In a hurry?

423
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,880
To see me?

424
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,000
Stop it.

425
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,760
What's the matter?

426
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,120
I wanted to clear your names.

427
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,680
Really?

428
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,160
Do you have a way?

429
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,440
But now, with this attitude of yours,

430
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,160
never!

431
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,400
Don't.

432
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,880
Wait.

433
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,400
I'm begging you. Help me.

434
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,800
Well...

435
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,320
I don't

436
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,000
have one now.

437
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,920
But if I were to be happy,

438
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,640
I might have one.

439
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,640
When can you be happy?

440
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,760
It depends on you.

441
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,640
Me?

442
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,320
Think hard

443
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,440
what to do to make me happy.

444
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,120
I...

445
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,880
Alright, don't bother.

446
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,320
How about this?

447
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,160
You treat me to dinner tomorrow night.

448
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,800
I might be happy
after I have a good meal.

449
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160
What?

450
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,440
I can treat you to a meal.

451
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,160
What to eat?

452
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,280
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

453
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,400
Think it hard

454
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,800
about what I love to eat.

455
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,800
Love...

456
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,160
Li Yanhao.

457
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,800
Think hard about it tonight.

458
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,680
I'm leaving.

459
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,200
Li Yanhao.

460
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,680
I trust you.

461
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,880
I'm off, bye.

462
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,440
Must be those rice noodle rolls
that upset my stomach.

463
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,400
Who is it?

464
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,520
(Cool Guy Falls for Me)
Hey. I have a very popular novel here.

465
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,000
I think you will need it.

466
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,800
Are you insane?

467
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,280
This is wonderful.

468
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,200
I've read it.

469
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,880
How about I sell it
to you at a discount?

470
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,800
I'm reading it right now.

471
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,280
Impossible. Don't lie to me.

472
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,760
Turn the book to page 24.

473
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,800
Chapter three.

474
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,880
Long Dingtian slowly took off his coat,

475
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,280
revealing his beautiful muscles.

476
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,920
It makes Hua Xiaoyao drooled.

477
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,880
It is true.

478
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,880
I didn't lie to you.

479
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,040
Besides, if you've read it,
why are you selling it to me?

480
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,400
Hey.

481
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,440
Good things must be shared.

482
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,400
We should help each other.

483
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,160
I don't need it. Leave now.

484
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,160
Never mind.

485
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,520
Hey.

486
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,760
Did you bring any tissue?

487
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,680
I did.

488
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,320
Then give me some.

489
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,920
I can't. Go back and get your own.

490
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,440
Wait.

491
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,280
Good things should be shared.

492
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,160
We should help each other.

493
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,200
I bought this with money,

494
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,120
I can't give it to you.

495
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,120
How much? I'll buy it.

496
00:24:03,136 --> 00:24:04,880
One yuan per piece.
How many do you want?

497
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,520
Jacking up the price on the spot?

498
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,400
One yuan can buy a whole pack.

499
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,440
Forget it, I'm leaving.

500
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,120
Wait, I'll buy it.

501
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
Give me two pieces.

502
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,520
Scan the code. Total four yuan.

503
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,520
I didn't bring my phone.

504
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,000
I can't scan the code.

505
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,560
Then I can't give you the tissue.

506
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,200
Then I can't get my phone.

507
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,800
Then I can't give you the tissue.

508
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,280
Then I can't get my phone.

509
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,280
If you don't give me...

510
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,640
You have no tissue.

511
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,000
Don't bother, I'm leaving.

512
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,040
Wait, bro.

513
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,120
Bro.

514
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,200
You call me bro now.

515
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,520
I was just kidding.

516
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,200
I can't ask you for money
for the tissue.

517
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,040
Go handle it.

518
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:40,920
I'm leaving.

519
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,280
May you have peace, bro.

520
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,160
Why are you back so fast?

521
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,800
Who did you meet?

522
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,760
Li Jiatong.

523
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,760
What does she want?

524
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,880
She doesn't help us.

525
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,680
She said she would find a way.

526
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,000
Then tell her to hurry up.

527
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,640
She doesn't clarify it for us,

528
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,320
then you can't get to know Yu Lan.

529
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,040
I'm not in a hurry.

530
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,320
I haven't figured out
how to face Yu Lan yet.

531
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,520
Bro.

532
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,400
I am in a hurry.

533
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,040
I've been chatting online with a girl from the design department.

534
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,280
She doesn't restore my reputation,

535
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,200
then I can't make a love confession.

536
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,160
You are talking that mean.

537
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,760
Even if she clarifies it,

538
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,680
you won't succeed.

539
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,280
Anyway, do something.

540
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,640
Did you hear me?

541
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,640
Go brush your teeth.

542
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,320
No way.

543
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm going to study my chess game.

544
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,320
Okay, class is over.

545
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,880
Zheng Nan.

546
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,120
Collect all the summaries
by next Tuesday

547
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,200
and hand them in to me.

548
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,400
Alright, Miss.

549
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,080
Only Li Yanhao didn't submit last week.

550
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,400
Li Yanhao, what's going on with you?

551
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,320
You have to submit it.

552
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,680
Okay, okay.

553
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
Don't worry, Miss.

554
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,440
Hurry up.

555
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,640
Class is over.

556
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,320
Class is over, wake up.

557
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,680
Let me snooze longer.

558
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,520
You snored and ground your teeth

559
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,160
last night.

560
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,400
I didn't sleep at all.

561
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,520
Who snored?

562
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,520
Then I'm leaving.

563
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,440
I have an appointment.

564
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,200
You'll eat by yourself.

565
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,440
Thank you.

566
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,400
Consider you are so obedient.

567
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,936
Find me at the rooftop
at noon the day after tomorrow.

568
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,280
I will think of a solution.

569
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,200
I promise to handle it well.

570
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,320
How about tomorrow?

571
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,320
I have classes tomorrow.

572
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,680
Okay, deal.

573
00:26:53,248 --> 00:26:55,000
The day after tomorrow,
at noon, rooftop.

574
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,160
Don't fool me.

575
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,000
If you fool me,

576
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,280
I'll make you drink it all.

577
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,120
If you dare to do so,

578
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,640
I'll pour it all over your head.

579
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,920
Everyone, turn your books

580
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,440
to Page 248.

581
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,160
Today we are going to study

582
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,880
Section Two of Chapter Twelve,

583
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,760
the connotation
of library target management.

584
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,040
To the concept
of library target management,

585
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,680
we can understand it
from the following four aspects.

586
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,160
Please make a note of this.

587
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,040
(Come to my dorm after class.)

588
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,280
(We'll meet at the rooftop
this afternoon.)

589
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,760
(Just come.)

590
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,280
And the one who sets the goals...

591
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,160
Superiors and subor...

592
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,000
(Alright.)

593
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,320
What's wrong?

594
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,880
Nothing, I just feel a bit unwell.

595
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,200
Unwell?

596
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,280
Then I'll take you to the Infirmary.

597
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,120
I know Dr. Zhou.

598
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,520
No need. I've been there in the morning.

599
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,880
She said it's a common gastroenteritis.

600
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,120
But I can't go
to the rooftop this afternoon.

601
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,880
How about you wait for a few more days?

602
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,560
It's no big deal.

603
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,680
Your health matters.

604
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,560
You should take care.

605
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,160
Then you take a rest.

606
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
I'll come to you later.

607
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:37,800
Here you are.

608
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,520
What's this?

609
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,520
Pork porridge.

610
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,760
How did you know

611
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,320
I like pork porridge?

612
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,880
I didn't know.

613
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,520
When I had gastroenteritis,

614
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,520
my mom gave me this.

615
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,520
So sweet.

616
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,760
Get well soon.

617
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,000
You have to clear my name.

618
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,520
Here you are.

619
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,280
What a fool.

620
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,120
Remember to take the medicine.

621
00:29:26,568 --> 00:29:29,201
(School of Arts and Communication)

622
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,760
Principal Wang,

623
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,320
leaders and teachers
of various departments,

624
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,120
nice to meet you.

625
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,200
I am Yu Lan,
the student union president.

626
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,880
Today's meeting

627
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,800
is to tell you about

628
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,040
the preparations

629
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,280
and the promotion

630
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,680
for the Film Festival.

631
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,200
The definition of this Film Festival is

632
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,200
a fair, just, and open competition.

633
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,560
The theme

634
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,280
is to give the films
back to the audience.

635
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,160
These oysters are good.

636
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,000
Qian.

637
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,440
You should stop.
Miss Zhao told you to lose weight.

638
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,280
You're being sick.

639
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,440
Don't eat this.

640
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,800
Let me tell you.

641
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,120
We have been taking turns
to take care of you,

642
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,200
and we've become thinner.

643
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,680
Today, our main focus is

644
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,680
to nourish.

645
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,200
Right.

646
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,680
I should be the one to nourish myself.

647
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,160
Have some grasshoppers.

648
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,320
Tasty.

649
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,400
No, thanks.

650
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,800
I've recently learned
some nourishing methods.

651
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,760
Let's get it.

652
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,400
Let's go.

653
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,760
Can't wait, hurry up.

654
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,680
Let's go, move it.

655
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,800
I might as well eat some grasshoppers.

656
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,280
Let's hurry back.

657
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,280
Stop it. Just go back.

658
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,160
- Let's go.
- Go.

659
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,880
Let's go.

660
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,680
- Alright.
- I...

661
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,680
Let's go.

662
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,200
I'm not watching anymore.

663
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,280
This is hardly the end.

664
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,680
By the staircase,

665
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,560
there's even
a severed head falling down.

666
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,520
Oh my, I'm so scared.

667
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,680
(Tomorrow, go to the rooftop
to shoot a clarification video.)

668
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,800
Xiao Rang.

669
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,640
Come on.

670
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,280
She finally remembers it!

671
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,040
Xiao Rang.

672
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,040
Tomorrow is the good day
for us to clear our names.

673
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,640
Get excited. Play the music.

674
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:44,160
(Get a Girlfriend)

675
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,040
Move a bit.

676
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,160
Well, hello, I am Li Jiatong.

677
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,680
This is Li Yanhao,

678
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,400
and this is Xiao Rang.

679
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,160
These two are the infamous Hooligan Duo.

680
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,520
However,

681
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,680
things are not as you think.

682
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,520
Li Yanhao

683
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,400
got misunderstood because of me.

684
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,640
And Xiao Rang

685
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,800
got misunderstood for helping Li Yanhao.

686
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
I hereby clarify

687
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,280
things are not as you think.

688
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,520
They are both nice people.

689
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,680
So, after going through this,

690
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,520
the three of us
have become best friends.

691
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,040
And I hope you

692
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,920
will no longer misunderstand them.

693
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,400
Come closer.

694
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,160
Come closer.

695
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,680
My neck.

696
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,080
At least give me a hand.

697
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,560
Oh my.

698
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,440
You are amazing.

699
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,840
You just hit me

700
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,040
like a bomber.

701
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,800
You...

702
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,320
He...

703
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,080
Move.

704
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,040
Let's go, Bomber.

705
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,200
I've clarified for you.

706
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,320
and you treated me so?

707
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,320
