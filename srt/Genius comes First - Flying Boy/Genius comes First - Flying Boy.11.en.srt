No!

165

The entire school are your fans.

168

171
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,600
I'd like to ask a question.

172
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,240
It's about this drama.

173
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,680
What story does it tell?

174
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,880
Since you are my big fan,

175
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,800
I'll tell you secretly, you know.

176
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,960
But the plot must not be disclosed.

177
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,544
Definitely.

178
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:53,120
Keep a secret?

179
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,680
Sure.

180
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,240
A secret.

181
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,800
Certainly.

182
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,720
The story tells

183
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,000
that after aliens invaded Earth,

184
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,320
when the X country is at a loss,

185
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,600
our valiant Northeastern people

186
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,720
defeated them with local cultural arts.

187
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,320

190
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,080
I wrote the script myself.

191
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,520
You must unleash your imagination.

192
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
But this kind of script,

193
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,160
from the audience's perspective,

194
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,680
wouldn't it seem a bit far-fetched?

195
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,520
What do you know?

196
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,560
It's a mix of martial arts, comedy,
and skits.

197
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,720
A new style of film.

198
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,840
As a ninth-generation pioneer director,

199
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
I guess, only I dare
to make something like this.

200
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,440
Director, I think you're right.

201
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,840
By the way,

202
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,800
about the three corpses...

203
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,680
Can I see

204
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,080
their playback?

205
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,720
Corpses?

206
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,320
What's there to shoot with them?

207
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,280
Why do you want to see that? Ridiculous.

208
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,560
Then, if we don't shoot them,

209
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,960
why are they needed?

210
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,240
See, you don't get it.

211
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,120
Filming requires focal points.

212
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,800
The script says there are three corpses.

213
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,080
Even if I don't shoot them,

214
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,400
there have to be three in place.

215
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,160
Understood?

216
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,800
Otherwise, it feels like

217
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,120
something is missing.

218
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,560
Right, what is it called?

219
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,520
The soul.

220
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,680
Right, the soul.

221
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,520
Then, did the three corpses

222
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,240
act well or not?

223
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,320
I mean, about the soul,

224
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,880
did they have it?

225
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,840
Are you kidding?

226
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,600
What a terrible performance!

227
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,000
One idiot even laughed.

228
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,960
What a joke!

229
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
Back in my younger days,

230
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,400
I would knock their socks off.

231
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
Really interesting.

232
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,560
You three.

233
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:22,000
Are you...

234
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,680
We three, yeah,

235
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,160
we are your big fans.

236
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,240
F-F-Fans.

237
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,320
Fans?

238
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,880
You three are zombies!

239
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,800
Assistant Director!

240
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,680
Get them out!

241
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,880
Quickly!

242
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,120
- Oh, no.
- Get them out!

243
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,720
Assistant Director!

244
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,680
Get the three guys out!

245
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,520
Throw them out.

246
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,080
It's all your fault today.

247
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,400
A waste of time!

248
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
How much are we supposed to make today?

249
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,480
250 yuan each.

250
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,960
Yeah, we're the real fools now.
[*The number 250 means fools in Chinese]

251
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,360
Look,

252
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,840
I took you there mainly for learning

253
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,080
and to earn a bit as well.

254
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,360
It should be a win-win.

255
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,600
But you messed it all up.

256
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,600
Mr. Dong,

257
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,200
you always say good words
about yourself.

258
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,280
Did you really want us to learn?

259
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,760
Wasn't that just for you to make money?

260
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,080
I don't want to learn from
that director.

261
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,920
You know what he said to me
about his script?

262
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,200
A mix of a comic, a skit,

263
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,960
dancing and singing.

264
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,640
Total nonsense!

265
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,080
Even Xiao Rang is better.

266
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,480
You're not complimenting me, right?

267
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,360
Young man, you don't understand.

268
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,480
If you want to produce good films,

269
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,160
you have to humble yourself and learn.

270
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,600
Oh, right.

271
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,920
I've returned your DV camera.

272
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,520
The tape inside is at my place.

273
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,360
I'll give it back.

274
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,160
Just connect that device to your phone,

275
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,040
and you can see it.

276
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,080
That's professional.

277
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,280
Getting more professional.

278
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,040
Now you know bringing that to me.

279
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,280
I have always been professional.

280
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,760
Mr. Dong,

281
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,040
is that director

282
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,960
really your buddy?

283
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,400
He said he didn't know you.

284
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,080
Of course we are.

285
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,360
That director is just a small fry

286
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,960
in our circle.

287
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,920
A small fry.

288
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,760
Sure, we trust you.

289
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,080
Especially with

290
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,520
how he's paying us 250 a day.

291
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,360
Very trustworthy!

292
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,200
Mr. Dong,

293
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,520
how about you

294
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
wash your face carefully?

295
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
I really want to learn

296
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,640
how you can use your sincere face

297
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,760
to talk big.

298
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,640
Really.

299
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,400
To talk big?

300
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,160
Okay.

301
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,760
Come on!

302
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,040
- Come on!
- Pour it on me.

303
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,360
- Go ahead!
- So cold!

304
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,920
Hey!

305
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:34,912
Stop it!

306
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,760
Why not paint?

307
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,160
Not in the mood.

308
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,480
Did I bring you here to see the scenery?

309
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,400
But now,
I just want to enjoy the scenery.

310
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,720
Alright.

311
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,760
Artistic mood is very important.

312
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,520
You can skip today.

313
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,840
But remember to make it up next week.

314
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,960
You don't have the mood to paint today?

315
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,080
Look, in our class, we are

316
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,760
among the most brilliant ones.

317
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,640
Why is it that every time we talk,

318
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,640
we ended up arguing?

319
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,040
I don't think you have anything

320
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,960
to do with "brilliant".

321
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,480
Oh, come on.

322
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,640
Your arrogance

323
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,400
brings you a vibe of a master.

324
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,080
Okay.

325
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,720
Let's settle this

326
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,280
with a fair competition.

327
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,112
Dare to?

328
00:11:58,112 --> 00:11:59,480
There is nothing to compete.

329
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
You win.

330
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,480
That won't do.

331
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,960
My goal is to defeat you

332
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,200
in front of the whole school.

333
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,640
For a sense of achievement.

334
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,960
Defeat me publicly?

335
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,640
Right, dare or not?

336
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,080
Not interested.

337
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,040
Don't be a coward.

338
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,040
How about this?

339
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,200
I'll give you a chance

340
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,840
to defeat me

341
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,640
in front of the whole school, okay?

342
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,040
Ridiculous.

343
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,640
I'm even less interested.

344
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,920
You wait.

345
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,960
I will make you

346
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,640
compete with me willingly.

347
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,720
I heard what Huang Shan said.

348
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,520
I think you should accept it.

349
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,080
His paintings are only sold because of

350
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,040
his father's promotion.

351
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,640
I don't want to rival him.

352
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,280
All the more reason for you to compete.

353
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,920
Let everyone know

354
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,920
the path he's taken is wrong.

355
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,200
Director Wang sent me two movie tickets

356
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,520
for tomorrow night.

357
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
Who will go with me?

358
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
I'm not going with you.

359
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,360
Two men watching a movie together?
So weird.

360
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,520
Fine.

361
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,640
What about you?

362
00:13:18,484 --> 00:13:18,760
(Free Tickets
from Binhai University Cinema)

363
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,400
(Free tickets)
Aren't these from our school?

364
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,760
Director Wang has a partnership
with our school.

365
00:13:26,944 --> 00:13:27,480
Moreover,

366
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,920
today we did on-site practice.

367
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,360
Tomorrow we'll have film analysis.

368
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,520
Take a look quickly.

369
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,640
And then you can start

370
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,920
our movie project.

371
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,200
Hurry up, okay?

372
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,600
I know.

373
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,920
Tomorrow we'll see the movie.

374
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,360
After that, we'll make a movie.

375
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
We had a main course today.

376
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,960
We forgot to attend it.

377
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,480
Mrs. Jiang asked us
to go to her office tomorrow.

378
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,840
Oh, no. Totally forgot it.

379
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,080
So what do we do?

380
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,360
How would I know what to do?

381
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,080
Order more oysters.

382
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,360
No way.

383
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,520
You've ordered so much.

384
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,640
We didn't make any money today.

385
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,520
And there is highway costs, water bills,

386
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,040
lost wages, and food expenses.

387
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,960
Spent a bunch already.

388
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,920
Let's walk back home tonight.

389
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,200
Alright, we'll definitely go.

390
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,520
Mr. Lei called me.

391
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,760
He said that he's reopened

392
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,040
and asked us to help him.

393
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,400
This time he offers
a slightly higher pay.

394
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,080
Want to go?

395
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,840
Yeah!

396
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,040
With so many pretty girls there,

397
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,640
I might sooner get a girlfriend.

398
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,360
We'll see about that.

399
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,600
If the movie fund

400
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,520
turns out to be enough,

401
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,200
I need to focus on our script.

402
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Suit it yourself then.

403
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,920
We will go tomorrow.

404
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,640
Okay, let's go.

405
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,200
But I have an important thing
next morning.

406
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,360
What is it?

407
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,480
Showing my true strength

408
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,160
and fighting for the honor of us three!

409
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:53,952
(You Rong Boxing)

410
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,920
Stop right there.

411
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,640
I'm not done yet. Rematch!

412
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,920
Great. Don't drop the ball.

413
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,480
Alright, shoot!

414
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,480
Shoot!

415
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,280
Shoot!

416
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,080
Good.

417
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,920
Li Yanhao.

418
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,400
Terrible shot.

419
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,520
Li Yanhao.

420
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,200
Yu Lan?

421
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,600
Why are you here?

422
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,760
I saw you filming so intently,

423
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,720
so I came here.

424
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,480
When working, I must always focus.

425
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,160
Then I'm relieved.

426
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,480
I was worried that after the meeting,

427
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,480
you'd be down and out.

428
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,200
No way.

429
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,720
I'm a strong man.

430
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,480
How could I be defeated
by just a few words?

431
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,040
What have you shot? Let me have a look.

432
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,920
Nothing, just random shots.

433
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,640
Okay then, keep going.

434
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,520
I'm leaving.

435
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,480
Wait a minute.

436
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,000
Let go.

437
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:23,280
Let go!

438
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,000
I won't let go.

439
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:24,880
Let go!

440
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,600
No way.

441
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,280
Tell me, did I win or not?

442
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,000
You won nothing!

443
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,240
How's it going?

444
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,120
Quite beyond my expectations.

445
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,360
Although it's not quite a movie yet,

446
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,240
I can see your imagination

447
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,640
and the things you want to express.

448
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,480
There must be imaginations.

449
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,880
My script is still in progress.

450
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,120
Creation, you know,

451
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,000
requires boundless imagination

452
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and unlimited design.

453
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,640
What kind of story do you plan to write?

454
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,480
I'm thinking of
combining horror, musical,

455
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,000
martial arts and fantasy into one.

456
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,640
Among all the contestants,

457
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,120
maybe only I dare to do that.

458
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,520
Sounds a bit "juvenile".

459
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,880
Right?

460
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,120
I agree.

461
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,880
Actually, a few days ago,

462
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
when I went to learn at a film crew,

463
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,000
the director told it to me.

464
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,360
I didn't think it's good, either.

465
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,360
You went to learn with a film crew?

466
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,480
Oh, right.

467
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,000
During that day,

468
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,360
I noted down what I thought was useful

469
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,360
all in this notebook.

470
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:51,904
(Film)

471
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,720
Your notebook

472
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,280
is quite unique.

473
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,400
Isn't it?

474
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,080
Hello?

475
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,080
Kang?

476
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,720
Alright, I'll come right away.

477
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,240
Uh...

478
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
That's okay. Bye.

479
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,840
Let's watch a movie together.

480
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:40,960
(You Rong Boxing)

481
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,120
Match's over. You still sneak attack me!

482
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
Dishonorable!

483
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,840
I must teach you a lesson.

484
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,080
You didn't let go first.

485
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080
But honestly,

486
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,480
I've never been so close
to a boy before.

487
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,480
Isn't that normal in boxing?

488
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,280
Besides, Li Yanhao and I

489
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,600
used to wrestle in the mud

490
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
shirtless every day.

491
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,720
But you are both boys!

492
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,000
You see yourself as a girl?

493
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,760
You...

494
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,640
You want another beating?

495
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,160
Calm down, girl.

496
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,720
You are a beauty rivals everything.

497
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Sorry.

498
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,280
Can't make it up anymore.

499
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,760
But honestly,

500
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,960
you do have some manliness.

501
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,600
Right? I knew it.

502
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,480
You have sheen eyes.

503
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,600
Just for that word,

504
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,080
today's beating was worth it.

505
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,160
I'm leaving.

506
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,240
You have a girlfriend?

507
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,280
No.

508
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,240
Well, now you do.

509
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,400
What?

510
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,640
Just for being my human punching bag

511
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,960
and your perseverance,

512
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,840
I like you.

513
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
From today, you accompany me
in fitness boxing.

514
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,960
Or we could start dating today.

515
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,080
Alright, no more nonsense.

516
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
I'm off to take a shower.

517
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,000
Keep my stuff safe.

518
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,280
Your pancake.

519
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,080
What are you thinking?

520
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,520
Listen to me.

521
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,760
Okay.

522
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,840
I think I've got a girlfriend.

523
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,720
What?

524
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,080
I think I've got a girlfriend.

525
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,280
Who is it? Who's so unlucky?

526
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,960
The boxing queen,

527
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,080
Gu Ran.

528
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,600
Wow, seriously?

529
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,400
That's awesome.

530
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,280
Your face...

531
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,240
Bro,

532
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,640
didn't you

533
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,840
sacrifice yourself for me?

534
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,160
Bug off.

535
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,080
She even asked me to date tonight.

536
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,080
Nice!

537
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,080
The closer you are with Gu Ran,

538
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,000
means

539
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,720
I'll see Yu Lan more often, right?

540
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,080
But I have a feeling

541
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,400
that she just wants someone to box with.

542
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,160
Do you think my peaceful days are over?

543
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,960
No. It's a good thing.

544
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,280
You with Gu Ran, and I with Yu Lan.

545
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,480
A happy family.

546
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,240
Isn't that perfect?

547
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,400
Are you listening to me or not?

548
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,280
What did you say?

549
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,640
Did you forget your vow

550
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,760
when you entered college?

551
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,880
To date 100 girls!

552
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,720
This is a good start.

553
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,600
But the first one
shouldn't be the end of me.

554
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,960
Be content.

555
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,280
At least you got one.

556
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,600
Oh, no more eating.

557
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,760
Mrs. Jiang wants us.

558
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,640
Let's go.

559
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,240
You, hand the test materials

560
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,160
to the whole class.

561
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,960
All the test questions are in here.

562
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,400
Alright, you can go back.

563
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,160
Okay.

564
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,840
Hurry up.

565
00:23:27,795 --> 00:23:28,736
(Department of Library Management)

566
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,840
Are you alright?

567
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,280
Ran into my nemesis.

568
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,640
Mrs. Jiang gives you this.

569
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,880
I've always following her words.

570
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,640
You've studied too much to be an idiot!

571
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,880
No,

572
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,280
he's sleeping too much!

573
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:57,960
Mrs. Jiang.

574
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,640
Tell me,

575
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,160
why did you skip class yesterday?

576
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,240
We were doing social practice yesterday.

577
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,960
What social practice?

578
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,120
More important than the major courses?

579
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,120
Final exams are less than a month away.

580
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,880
Write an explaining report.

581
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,240
If you fail the exams,

582
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,280
prepared to be excelled.

583
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,400
Don't worry, teacher.

584
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,240
We will pass the exams.

585
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,760
With such a great teacher like you,

586
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,480
we will certainly strive to stay.

587
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,520
Cut the flattery.

588
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,480
How's the preparation going?

589
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,760
Don't worry.

590
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,480
Everything is under control.

591
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
Xiao Rang, what's wrong with you?

592
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:31,880
- I...
- He...

593
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,000
He's fine, teacher.

594
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,000
Don't lie to me.

595
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,400
He's in love, I think.

596
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,760
Who is it?

597
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,120
A boxing queen.

598
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,640
Boxing? From our department?

599
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,240
No. You don't know her.

600
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,120
Then she must be very charming

601
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,520
to have him spellbound.

602
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
She slapped... Look at his face.

603
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,640
Okay.

604
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,760
Teacher.

605
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,480
Do you have a boyfriend now?

606
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,480
Stop gossiping?

607
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,640
No.

608
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,760
We think that someone as elegant

609
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,760
and beautiful as you

610
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,640
must have an outstanding boyfriend.

611
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,120
Cut the sweet talk.

612
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,640
Back to the classroom.

613
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,240
Goodbye, teacher.

614
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:13,880
Wait a moment.

615
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,520
Let me make myself clear.

616
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,120
You can do social practice,

617
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,240
and also the Film Festival.

618
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,240
You can also date.

619
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,240
But you must not skip classes.

620
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,880
And you must not fail exams, got it?

621
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,480
Yes.

622
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,520
Go.

623
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,360
Goodbye, teacher.

624
00:25:28,691 --> 00:25:30,080
(Department of Music,
Department of Library Management)

625
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,000
What are you doing here?

626
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,400
I've come to bring you flowers.

627
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,480
I'm at work,
and you're bringing me flowers?

628
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,520
You always say I'm not romantic.

629
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,880
See, I'm trying to be romantic.

630
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,480
You...

631
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,360
What kind of flowers are these?

632
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,880
They looked pretty nice,

633
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
so I bought them all.

634
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,400
Look, they haven't bloomed yet.

635
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,240
Put them in water.

636
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,120
They'll bloom for at least half a month.

637
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,240
Can't you be a bit more...

638
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,880
These are carnations.

639
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,480
Carnations are for patients or elders.

640
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,240
Carnations.

641
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,760
Do I look like an elder to you

642
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,240
or do I look like a patient?

643
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,120
I didn't know that.

644
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,760
You...

645
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,120
Just go.

646
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,240
I don't want to see you.

647
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,880
Xiao Rang.

648
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,480
What's wrong?

649
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,000
Class is over. Date with me.

650
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,120
Are you being so direct?

651
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,120
Who has time to dilly-dally?

652
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,760
Let's go.

653
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,600
You boys

654
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,120
all like straightforward girls, huh?

655
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,480
Not me. I certainly don't.

656
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,360
Really?

657
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,120
What're you doing?

658
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,880
We're in hallway.

659
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,640
Don't do that.

660
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,480
There's no one here.

661
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,240
What're you doing?

662
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,640
(Department of Library Management,
Office)

663
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,224
Nothing.

664
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,520
This is my teacher.

665
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,760
Li Jiatong, from the dance department.

666
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,760
This is the leading actress

667
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,760
of my film.

668
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,400
We were rehearsing just now.

669
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,640
Yes, rehearsing.

670
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,240
You can date in college.

671
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,000
But you can't neglect your studies.

672
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Sure, sure.

673
00:28:03,136 --> 00:28:03,760
You two,

674
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,000
stop standing in the corridor,

675
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,360
find a better place.

676
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,880
Use the flowers as props.

677
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,000
Good luck!

678
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,360
Your teacher is quite nice.

679
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,480
It's all your fault.

680
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,640
She has misunderstood us.

681
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,640
I don't care.

682
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,520
Why do you care?

683
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,600
How could I not care?

684
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,360
If this gets out,

685
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,120
how can I pursue Yu...

686
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,360
p-p-pursue other girls?

687
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,240
With me, the leading actress,

688
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,400
you want to pursue others?

689
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
What

690
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,880
does this have to do with you?

691
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,240
We are classmates.

692
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,000
Just cooperate for a movie.

693
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,240
No way we go any further.

694
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:53,880
You!

695
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,880
I really want to open up your head

696
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,000
and see what's inside.

697
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,120
Silliness in the head
is also an illness.

698
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,360
The flower is perfect for patients.

699
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,120
I think it suits you.

700
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,760
Take it.

701
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,720
Although you are the director,

702
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,480
and I'm the leading actress,

703
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,760
if we want to cooperate well,

704
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,640
we need to build some rapport.

705
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,480
What rapport?

706
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,240
For instance, when I

707
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,880
ask you a question,

708
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,760
I'll say, "Question!"

709
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,120
And you say, "Answer!"

710
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,760
Understood?

711
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,000
Question!

712
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,488
Huh?

713
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,760
You should say, "Answer!"

714
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,760
Question!

715
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,400
Answer.

716
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
The timing is off.

717
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,600
Next time I say it,

718
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,120
you immediately say "answer", got it?

719
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,360
What's with the 'hey'? Say "Answer"!

720
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,360
You didn't say "Question" yet.

721
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:00,880
I.

722
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,880
Alright.

723
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,520
Question!

724
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,640
Answer!

725
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
Question!

726
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,160
Answer!

727
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:09,880
- Question!
- Answer!

728
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,520
Great.

729
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,240
Pretty obedient, huh.

730
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,760
Then I'll be going first.

731
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,000
Bye!

732
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,640
- Question!
- Answer!

733
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,360
Question!

734
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,640
Answer!

735
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:36,160
(Sunset Glow Dance Group)

736
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,144
(Where to go tonight?)

737
00:30:38,144 --> 00:30:39,520
(Mu Zi Rou: The bar. Get pissed.
Okay? My dear monitor.)

738
00:30:39,764 --> 00:30:44,832
(Liu Lu: I will follow you.)

739
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,760
Where are you going tonight?

740
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,120
Tonight...

741
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,120
Xu Xiangdong will take me to a movie.

742
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,880
Two men watching a movie together?

743
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
We are going to learn.

744
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,480
Less nonsense.

745
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,240
Tell me, are you abnormal or not?

746
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,880
Why am I abnormal now?

747
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,480
I'll tell you again.

748
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,880
We are going

749
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,080
to study and observe.

750
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,120
Got it?

751
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,120
Then let me help you.

752
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,480
If you bring me along,
you two won't seem weird.

753
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,120
How about it?

754
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,640
Why laughing? It's decided then.

755
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,640
Take the flowers and go now.

756
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,000
Go!

757
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,592
Movie time!

758
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,880
(There's a free movie premiere tonight.)

759
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,080
(Come together with me.)

760
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,880
(I'm at the principal's office.)

761
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,280
(Discussing the Film Festival tonight.)

762
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:56,880
(Okay.)

763
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,000
Who goes on a date

764
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,760
at the gym equipment area?

765
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,640
You PE majors are really strange.

766
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,000
I've told you many times.

767
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,360
I'm not from the PE department.

768
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,480
I study media.

769
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,360
This is my first date.

770
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,360
Where do people usually go on dates?

771
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,760
Usually, dinner, shopping, or a movie.

772
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,120
We've already eaten, and walked around.

773
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
Then let's watch a movie.

774
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,160
Come on, let's go.

775
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,760
Why hasn't he come yet?

776
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,240
You come so late.

777
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,240
Why are you here too?

778
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,480
Why can't I be here?

779
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,640
Watching a movie,

780
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,000
how can you not take me?

781
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,000
The flower...

782
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,640
- The flower is...
- Prop.

783
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,640
Props given by the teacher.

784
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,760
Okay.

785
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,520
Where's Xiao Rang?

786
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,520
Probably being sweet with someone now.

787
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,240
Are you jealous?

788
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,520
What? Jealous?

789
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,360
Where to go?

790
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,640
The back.

791
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,640
On a date?

792
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,240
You scared me.

793
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,480
A date? Stop kidding!

794
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
What is the flower for?

795
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,880
- This flower is...
- Prop, you see.

796
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,880
Mrs. Jiang gave us for filming.

797
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,880
True.

798
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,120
Why are you here?

799
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,120
Dating?

800
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,360
The flowers suit you.

801
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,480
- Here, take it.
- No.

802
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
Keep it for yourself.

803
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,480
This guy looks quite funny.

804
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,480
Don't talk.

805
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,520
If you don't get it later, don't ask me.

806
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,200
