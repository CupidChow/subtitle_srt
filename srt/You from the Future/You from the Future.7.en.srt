00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,640
I finally finished it.

198
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,090
Check it.

199
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,440
Thank you.

200
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,090
Mr. Qin.

201
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,450
It's late.

202
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,490
Why don't we have dinner together?

203
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,650
No need, Miss Tang.

204
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,410
I have to go to the insurance company

205
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,760
later.

206
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,360
It's so late.

207
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,640
Even if you're a workaholic,

208
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,360
the insurance company is not.

209
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,450
How about having a simple meal?

210
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,880
No need, Miss Tang.

211
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,800
Mr. Qin.

212
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,440
I heard

213
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,280
that a mature man

214
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,570
wouldn't refuse

215
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,760
a beautiful girl's invitation.

216
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,400
All right.

217
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,650
Where shall we eat?

218
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,990
I don't want to go out today.

219
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,890
Why don't I

220
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,700
cook for you

221
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,840
at home?

222
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,320
Tang...

223
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,280
Three.

224
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,040
Two.

225
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,810
One.

226
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:44,640
Miss Tang,

227
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,410
let me do it.

228
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,570
You are a guest.

229
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,690
How should I let you do it?

230
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,640
You just need a rest.

231
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,610
Look.

232
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,660
What do you want to eat?

233
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,360
I'll try my best.

234
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:55,730
Okay then.

235
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,700
The apron is over there.

236
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,240
You can do anything you want.

237
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,170
I'll open a bottle of wine.

238
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,110
There's only so much I can measure

239
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,720
about mass production.

240
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,000
But Starlight...

241
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,540
What was Mr. Shen's state

242
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,540
at the fire scene

243
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,520
and when he interrupted you?

244
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:22,880
At that time,

245
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,960
Brother was in a hurry.

246
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,090
It seems

247
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,880
that Mr. Shen didn't want Xia Mo to know

248
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,980
that he did artificial respiration

249
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,540
at the fire scene.

250
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,050
He should have his concerns.

251
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,700
Mr. Shen

252
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,040
should want to be an unsung hero.

253
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,980
But he did get intimate

254
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,050
with Xia Mo after all.

255
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,410
You should

256
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,300
tell your sister about this.

257
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,480
You mean

258
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,220
Brother was worried that Sister would sue him

259
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,200
for sexual harassment?

260
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,090
Mr. Shen wouldn't have such concerns.

261
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,260
He just didn't know

262
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,530
how to say it.

263
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,360
Danika.

264
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,340
You don't know what to say to Brother

265
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,480
because you're afraid he'll scold you,

266
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,630
so you want me to talk to Sister,

267
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,780
but you don't know what to say either,

268
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,530
right?

269
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,090
We were originally born from the same root,

270
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,570
why rush to harm each other?

271
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,360
Danika.

272
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,240
You should read more books.

273
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,530
Starlight.

274
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,440
Smell it. Does it smell good?

275
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,930
I'm sorry, Sister.

276
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,120
I have no sense of smell.

277
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,980
My vision also relies on infrared heat sensing

278
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,280
and light particle refraction algorithms.

279
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,280
Sorry.

280
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,330
Doesn't it look good?

281
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,880
It looks delicious.

282
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,780
I'll eat it then.

283
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,330
Sister.

284
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,650
I have something to tell you.

285
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,050
Brother was worried about you today.

286
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,720
After the fire last time,

287
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,680
the doctor said

288
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,880
you could have fainting spells,

289
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,040
palpitations, and other after-effects.

290
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,240
When your heartbeat went abnormal today,

291
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,770
Bother rushed downstairs

292
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,890
without waiting for the elevator.

293
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,810
Be careful next time.

294
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,200
I'll feel sorry

295
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,120
if you get hurt.

296
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,370
Shen Junyao.

297
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,410
He...

298
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,460
After Brother found out

299
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,280
what the department supervisor did to you,

300
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,950
he ran

301
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,460
a disk operating system attack

302
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,570
on the entire network at Candy,

303
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,420
causing their network

304
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,280
to be paralyzed.

305
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,490
Brother recovered their network

306
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,120
after the director gave in.

307
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,850
I went too far

308
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,280
with Xia Mo.

309
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,400
The moment the network is restored,

310
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,730
I'll withdraw it.

311
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,000
So,

312
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,520
Brother's good to you.

313
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,760
Starlight.

314
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,370
Do you have anything to say?

315
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,050
I think

316
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,530
you should ask him

317
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,280
to have dinner together

318
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,600
as a return of courtesy.

319
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,090
Come in.

320
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,530
I made some food.

321
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,050
Do you want some?

322
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,090
No.

323
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:01,960
I'm not hungry.

324
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,820
I made a lot.

325
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,760
I can't finish them all.

326
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,530
It's not good to waste it.

327
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,680
Have some.

328
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,360
Okay.

329
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,960
He's a good person.

330
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,720
But his mouth has ruined everything.

331
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,680
Did you make all these?

332
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,720
Yes.

333
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,340
But I haven't cooked

334
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:50,970
for four years in college.

335
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,200
Maybe I'm not used to it.

336
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,360
Try it.

337
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,200
Eat.

338
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,120
Brother,

339
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,570
why aren't you eating?

340
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,700
Although my mom said

341
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,160
I had a talent for cooking since I was a kid,

342
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:25,960
you don't have to be

343
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,930
so shocked.

344
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,100
Did you use soda powder

345
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,120
as starch?

346
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,640
How is that possible?

347
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,840
I was wondering why it didn't stick together.

348
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,660
This dish...

349
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,280
Leave it.

350
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,730
It looks nice.

351
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,050
Dig in.

352
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,810
Mr. Qin.

353
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,280
Miss Tang.

354
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,290
Why did you come downstairs?

355
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,260
You cooked for me.

356
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,410
How should I not see you off?

357
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,960
It'll be impolite.

358
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,130
Fine.

359
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:19,980
I didn't expect

360
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,490
you were not only competent at work,

361
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,599
but also good at cooking.

362
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,680
Actually,

363
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,819
it was me who cooked

364
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,849
when I was

365
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:26,890
with my ex-wife.

366
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,280
Sorry for

367
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,000
reminding you of the sad story.

368
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,720
It's nothing.

369
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,890
Actually, I want to ask you about what you said last time

370
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,560
that due to some reasons,

371
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,530
Mr. Shen

372
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,170
is emotionally…

373
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,200
Sorry, Miss Tang.

374
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,760
As a subordinate,

375
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,680
I really can't tell you

376
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,200
about Mr. Shen.

377
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,920
I understand.

378
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,690
But I just want to know

379
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,050
if things online

380
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,490
are true.

381
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,850
What did they say online?

382
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,370
They say

383
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,740
when Mr. Shen was young,

384
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,160
he had a younger brother.

385
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,410
But his brother passed away

386
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,290
due to a fire.

387
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,130
His parents

388
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,850
got divorced because of this.

389
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,650

00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,680
So you must be careful.

583
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:01,730
Got it.

584
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,920
I'll tell them again.

585
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,670
[Grandpa]

586
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,440
Hello, Grandpa.

587
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,490
Use this one in the middle tonight.

588
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,880
Okay, President.

589
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,160
Junyao.

590
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,320
When are you coming?

591
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,320
Around five.

592
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,810
I was thinking

593
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,850
since you'd bring your girlfriend here,

594
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,240
shouldn't you come earlier,

595
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,340
so that we could

596
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,770
get to know each other?

597
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,680
Grandpa,

598
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,720
I don't think we need to be so deliberate.

599
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,970
What do you mean?

600
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,290
I don't need your opinion.

601
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,360
Take my opinion.

602
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,130
What time should we go then?

603
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,730
I think

604
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,770
two hours earlier.

605
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,720
Grandpa, this afternoon, I...

606
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,720
Hello?

607
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,840
Starlight.

608
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,330
Let's go.

609
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,120
Are we going to find Sister?

610
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,740
[How do you express your weakness with guts? A tough man cries]

611
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,820
[otoMADs Plan]

612
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,190
[Director Shi The otoMADs plan]

613
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,230
[otoMADs Plan]

614
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,160
I've worked along both lines.

615
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,770
Done.

616
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,710
[Shen Junyao: I'm on the rooftop]

617
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,760
I'm on the rooftop.

618
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,210
What is it?

619
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,240
Take a leave this afternoon.

620
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,200
My grandpa wants to see you.

621
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,160
Your grandpa wants to see me?

622
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,400
Why?

623
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:00,940
I...

624
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,830
According to the data,

625
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,300
when a man and woman are about to

626
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,690
move to the next stage of their relationship,

627
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,450
they'll meet their relatives and friends.

628
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,960
It's known as meeting parents.

629
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,820
Starlight.

630
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,040
Don't talk nonsense.

631
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,380
I remember

632
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,450
I told you once.

633
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,400
I remember.

634
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,560
But it's been so long.

635
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,370
Would Grandpa forget

636
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,890
that he wanted to see me?

637
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,760
He just called me.

638
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,570
Do you want to check again?

639
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,320
No, no.

640
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,600
Actually,

641
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,180
I haven't attended

642
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,800
such a formal occasion before.

643
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,280
I'm afraid of

644
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,080
embarrassing you.

645
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,970
You won't embarrass me like this.

646
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,920
I'll wait for you downstairs.
