for two more days.

93
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,780
Because she inhaled too much smoke,

94
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,690
she might have

Do you mean what I did in front of the doctor earlier?

120
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,140
I said that

121
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,650
to prevent the doctor

122
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,810
from discovering my identity

123
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,160

00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,760
I am thinking

156
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,640
if the fact that you suddenly learned to lie

157
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,600

158
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,440
Brother, do you want to ask me

159
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,340
why I have to bind myself

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,210

161
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,500
Miss Xia is not

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,450

163
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,880
If I don't recognize her as my master,

164
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,900
the system will protect

00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,530

00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,810

it's not too late for you

391
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:50,920
to say thank you now.

392
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,060
The doctor said

393
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,490
I'm fine now.

394
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,280
It's just that

395
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,320
I have minor

396
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,570
throat discomfort.

397
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,730
And

398
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:07,740
sometimes...

399
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,260
Systolic blood pressure

400
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,530
is 104 mmHg.

401
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,100
Diastolic pressure is 75 mmHg.

402
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,000
Her blood pressure is normal.

403
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,800
Her heart rate is 82 times per minute.

404
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,670
[Heart rate, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure]

405
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,730
Her heart rate is normal.

406
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,700
Fasting blood-glucose is

407
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,050
3.9 millimoles per liter.

408
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,330
There is a risk of low blood sugar.

409
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,850
Adjustment of the diet structure is advised.

410
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,120
The rest of the scanning result is okay.

411
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,250
She can be discharged.

412
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:24,970
This...

413
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,800
This is so high-tech.

414
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,490
Thanks.

415
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:39,890
Tang Tang.

416
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,290
Xia Xia.

417
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,720
You can't forge the medical record.

418
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,850
I didn't.

419
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,770
All the data are real.

420
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,360
I promise.

421
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,200
Anyway, give the forms to the doctor for me.

422
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,200
I'm going to work.

423
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,960
Thank you.

424
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,010
See you.

425
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,330
Are you free?

426
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,560
I have something to tell you.

427
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,840
I...

428
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,320
Don't worry.

429
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,250
It won't take long.

430
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,060
Starlight and I

431
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,920
will drive you to the company.

432
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,840
Wait for me here.

433
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,690
Let's go.

434
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,960
Starlight...

435
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,250
He likes you very much.

436
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,450
So the standard of this kind of like is

437
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,860
blood type,

438
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,880
sign,

439
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,860
or other

440
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,780
algorithms?

441
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,280
Don't regard Starlight as programmed data.

442
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,600
Starlight is just Starlight.

443
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,570
I'm sorry.

444
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,640
I don't mean anything else.

445
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,930
I just don't understand

446
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,400
this kind of love.

447
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,840
He wants you to come back.

448
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,100
Qin Xiang is on his way

449
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,840
to the hospital.

450
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,240
If you are okay with it,

451
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,180
I'll ask Qin Xiang

452
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,200
to send Miss Tang back

453
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,840
and bring your luggage back.

454
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,460
You have no idea

455
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,170
how dangerous the situation was.

456
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,220
But Shen Junyao

457
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,140
didn't even hesitate

458
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,690
and rushed into the fire.

459
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,050
If we were in ancient times,

460
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,400
you'd have to marry him to thank him.

461
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:33,960
Okay.

462
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,680
Let's go.

463
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,960
I'll take you to the company.

464
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,440
Shen Junyao.

465
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,970
Thank you.

466
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,960
Thank you

467
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,760
for saving me regardless of the danger.

468
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,650
As for Starlight,

469
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,770
I'll keep it a secret.

470
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,530
I will also keep

471
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,040
our promise.

472
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:57,970
Promise?

473
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,160
What promise?

474
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,700
If I meet reporters

475
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,050
or the media,

476
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:04,820
I won't deny

477
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,080
our relationship as a couple.

478
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,920
I'll help you and Stantech

479
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,720
pull through the crisis of public opinion.

480
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,040
So,

481
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,460
you suddenly

482
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,290
changed your mind

483
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,100
because of

484
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,760
what happened last night?

485
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,000
Of course.

486
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,360
After all, you saved my life.

487
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,840
You don't have to.

488
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,080
Starlight is the one who saved you.

489
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,960
It has nothing to do with me.

490
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,400
I...

491
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,800
What did you talk about?

492
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,840
Nothing.

493
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,920
I just asked her to move back.

494
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,120
But when she was on the rooftop,

495
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,840
her mood fluctuated.

496
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,160
Frustration and guilt

497
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,450
alternated.

498
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,700
Did you say

499
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,530
anything that you shouldn't say

500
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,920
to make her sad?

501
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,490
Sad?

502
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,440
Maybe it's because of

503
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,280
the fire yesterday.

504
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,810
Brother,

505
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,440
this is not right.

506
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,170
You don't care about

507
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:29,860
your girlfriend's mood

508
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,640
at all.

509
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,550
You don't want to know why

510
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,800
she suddenly felt guilty.

511
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,860
This is not what

512
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,810
a good boyfriend

513
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:36,640
should do.

514
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,720
Starlight.

515
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,770
Xia Mo and I

516
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,170
are just a contract couple.

517
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,840
This is not related to us.

518
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,420
And we won't be together

519
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,120
after our promise

520
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,330
expires.

521
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,760
There are no true feelings between

522
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,600
a contract couple?

523
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,440
No.

524
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,170
You don't like her

525
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,450
at all?

526
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,840
No.

527
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,050
Don't worry.

528
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,490
I don't like her

529
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,090
at all.

530
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,280
Good morning, Mr. Shen.

531
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,380
The system detected

532
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,130
abnormal fluctuation

533
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,670
in your heart rate.

534
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,480
Do you need medical help?

535
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,360
No.

536
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,250
Thank you.

537
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,690
Your heart rate is nearly 130 per minute.

538
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,740
There's a risk of Paroxysmal tachycardia.

539
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,000
Please check again

540
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,260
if you need medical help.

541
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,930
No.

542
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,640
Get lost.

543
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,240
Okay, Mr. Shen.

544
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,400
Xia Xia.

545
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,720
Are you okay?

546
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,280
Why do you look so pale?

547
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,090
I'm fine.

548
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,490
I got up late today.

549
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,560
I ran here.

550
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,000
Have a candy.

551
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,930
Sweets can promote the secretion of dopamine.

552
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,320
A happy day begins.

553
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,640
Thank you.

554
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,840
Xia Mo,

555
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,620
I thought you could pretend to be diligent

556
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,850
for a few more days.

557
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,740
You're late on the second day of your work.

558
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,160
You didn't even hand in a note.

559
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,490
Do you have any respect for company's

560
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,330
rules and regulations?

561
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,280
Sorry, Director.

562
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,450
I'll hand in my note now.

563
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,440
Director,

564
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,270
Xia Xia just joined the company.

565
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,260
Maybe she's

566
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:24,780
still not familiar with

567
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,300
the leave system.

568
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,200
The company's rules are written in the offer.

569
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,050
Is it the company's fault that she didn't read it?

570
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,720
And you, Ai.

571
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,730
Have you finished the video you should do?

572
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,560
Mind your own business.

573
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,120
Is that what the company pays you to do?

574
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,080
We'll talk about the leave note later.

575
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,960
Have you done the publicity video for T5?

576
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,800
No, right?

577
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,360
What are you waiting for?

578
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,210
Hurry up.

579
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,450
I'll do it now.

580
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,050
All of you...

581
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,610
What low work efficiency!

582
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,330

Why?

585

She's just

586
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,360

590
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,200
How could she cause such trouble?

591
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,160
You're not a gentleman at all.

592
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,770
No one

593

594
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,690
What are you looking at?

595
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,450
I'm talking about you.

What's wrong, Mr. Shen?

Coffee. Coffee.

600
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,800
Coffee is talking. Coffee.

601
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,800
Who is Coffee?

602
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,310

Don't you want to save me?

Put it down.

607
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,570
That's right.

608
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,720
A boyfriend should protect his girlfriend.

609
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,530

I would abide by

613
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,000
the three-month couple contract.

614
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,400
Why are you taking me away?

615
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,140
Mr. Shen,

616
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,740
this suitcase belongs to Miss Xia.

Take it away. Hurry up.

619
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:48,940
Okay. Okay.

Okay. Okay.

It's okay.

623
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,680
Mr. Shen.

624
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,170
Is there anything else that you need me to take out?

625
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:03,770
No.

626
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,720
Nothing.

627
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,730
Mr. Shen.

628
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,640
How about going to hospital?

629
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:11,960
I'm fine.

630
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,520
I'll be fine after some rest.

631
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,020
The psychiatrist said

632
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,360
you needed regular follow-ups.

633
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,220
It's been so long.

634
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,480
You didn't do it once.

635
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,780
If you fall sick

00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,640
I have been fine for such a long time.

638
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,330
Why should I

639
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,570
go to hospital

640
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,730

Don't catch a cold.

644
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,920
I said I'm fine.

645
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,770
No.

646
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,410

647

Why are you

653
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,400
here today?

654
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,690
It's my fault.

655
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:17,860
I forced him

656
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,560
to come here today.

657
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,290
Didn't we agree

658
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,160
to make regular visits?

659
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,050

Yes.

Mr. Shen has been

664
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,120
busy.

665
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,620
So, Mr. Shen has been

666
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,280
under a lot of pressure.

667
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,530
As a result, he's not feeling well.

668
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,280
That's why we came here.

669
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,050
Mr. Shen.

670
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,980
I had hallucinations

671
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,200
in the office today.

672
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,680

673
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,280

674
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,290

675
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,810
The girl everyone's talking about online, right?

676

You two have a close relationship.

677
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,500

But there was a fire last night.

680
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,400
I saved her.

681

Mr. Shen,

682
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,690
we have to be honest.

683
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,080
I'm telling the truth.

684
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,170
Well,

685
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:19,860
it's not likely that

686
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,160
this is a sequela of the shock.

687
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,280
If it's a sequela,

688
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,060
you should have reactions

689
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,010
after you come into contact with fire.

690
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,570
Mr. Shen,

691
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,650
think about it.

692
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,180
When you saved her,

693
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,130
did anything special or unusual

694
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,770
happen?

695
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,000
At that time...

696
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,690
I'll buy you a bottle of water.

697
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,760
She was in a coma.

698
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,880
Before I got her out of the fire,

699
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,640
I gave her

700
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,760
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

701
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,080
I see.

702
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:06,740
Mr. Shen,

703
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,700

704
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,620

and psychological problems,

706
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,680
I think it's very likely that

707
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,970
this is what

708
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,560
caused your stress response

709
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,100
which led to your hallucination

710
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,970
and made you hear voices.

711
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,400
How about this?

712
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,420
I'll prescribe some medicine

713
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,260
to help you sleep.

714
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,330
If you can't sleep at night,

715
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,520
you can take some first.

716
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,420
This medicine should be taken

717

Hello?

777
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,320
Hello?

778
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,010
I was too far away. I didn't hear it clearly.

779
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,410
Does President Shen have any instructions?

780
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,320
Nothing.

781
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,320
Go back to the company first.

782
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,440
Okay.

783
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,550
Next week, the company's having a monthly meeting.

784
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,680
If you're free,

785
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,210
come with me to see my grandpa.

786
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,000
I'll arrive at the company later.

787
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,090
[Lin Heng]

788
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,040
Would you like to have a cup of coffee?
