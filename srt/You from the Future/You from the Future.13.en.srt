00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,650
T5's reservation

196
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,830
is twice as much as expected.

197
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,030
Contact the OEM

198
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,150
to outsource the production of the parts.

199
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,250
But make sure the factory is trustworthy in terms of product quality.

200
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,000
We are putting our hands on it.

201
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,110
We're doing a quality test.

202
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,860
The quality control can't be loosened.

203
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,050
Don't make any mistakes.

204
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:36,630
Okay.

205
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,710
Thank you for your hard work.

206
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,470
That's all.

207
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,290
Ms. Xia.

208
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:00,900
I thought

209
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,310
you wouldn't come today.

210
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,180
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

211
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,230
Thank you.

212
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,910
So cute.

213
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,190
Xia Mo.

214
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,230
although you caused trouble,

215
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,050
luckily, it was solved in time.

216
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:15,990
We didn't blame you.

217
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,670
Sorry, Director.

218
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,430
Sorry for the trouble I caused.

219
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,030
Forget it.

220
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,720
As long as the result is good.

221
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,390
But don't forget to

222
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,790
hand in your leave note.

223
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,750
No problem.

224
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,500
Director, what's the big deal?

225
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,170
Our press conference

226
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,080
couldn't be more successful.

227
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,290
The sales are skyrocketing.

228
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,400
-Yeah.
-That's right.

229
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,160
Maybe

230
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,710
the boss will give you a bonus.

231
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,560
Xia Xia,

232
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,910
treat us to a big meal

233
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,400
to celebrate your raise in salary in advance.

234
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,190
Sure.

235
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,520
The press conference couldn't be held successfully

236
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,430
without your hard work.

237
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,350
How about this?

238
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,510
I'll treat you.

239
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,920
-Really?
-Really?

240
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,070
-That's great.
-No, no.

241
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,670
I'm the one who caused the trouble.

242
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,150
This meal is on me.

243
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,600
Sure.

244
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,630
I'm okay with that.

245
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,020
Also, Xia Mo,

246
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,650
Lin Heng helped a lot this time.

247
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,830
Invite him as well.

248
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,590
Lin Heng.

249
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,550
Lin Heng.

250
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,590
Lin Heng.

251
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,190
I'll try to contact him.

252
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,750
But Mr. Lin Heng

253
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,270
has been busy recently.

254
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,350
He has to eat no matter how busy he is.

255
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,870
It's almost time to get off work.

256
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,970
Okay, let's pack up.

257
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:14,990
We'll set off later.

258
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,030
Okay.

259
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,230
[Xia Mo]

260
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,750
Have you had dinner yet?

261
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,550
The sales of T5 are good.

262
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,870
Thank you.

263
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,900
[Shen Junyao]

264
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,140
[Xia Mo]
[How are you?]

265
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,640
[Xia Mo]

266
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,760
If you

267
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,070
don't want her to leave early,

268
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,290
I need to treat her

269
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,270
with your old attitude.

270
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,350
The most silent but the most caring;

271
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,670
the gentlest

272
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,310
but the most boring.

273
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,590
Silent.

274
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,440
[Xia Mo]

275
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,230
Come in.

276
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,830
Mr. Shen.

277
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,430
What makes you so happy?

278
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,310
Nothing.

279
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,280
The sales of T5 are great.

280
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,310
Shouldn't I be happy about it?

281
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,550
You're right.

282
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,650
By the way,

283
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,640
Here are some of the orders

284
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,610
from the north of China.

285
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,310
Please take a look.

286
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:42,820
If

287
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,820
there is no problem,

288
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,360
we can have dinner together

289
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,670
and talk about the details tonight.

290
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,070
Tonight is fine. I'll leave it to you.

291
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:48,990
Okay.

292
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,310
Mr. Shen.

293
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,360
I want to take a day off tomorrow

294
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,500
to take a walk in the suburbs.

295
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,870
The team building will be held soon.

296
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,870
Let's go together then.

297
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,630
I don't think it's appropriate

298
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,750
for me to take my girlfriend

299
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,480
to the company's team building.

300
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:12,870
Qin Xiang,

301
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,170
I heard that

302
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,340
you and Miss Tang

303
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,220
are getting closer recently.

304
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,310
No, no, no.

305
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,300
Tang Tang and I...

306
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,830
There's nothing between us ... yet.

307
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,430
Really?

308
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,630
Didn't she praise you

309
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,430
for being amazing in bed?

310
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,590
This is really...

311
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,830
It's a long story.

312
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,330
How is it?

313
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,230
What did Expert Lin Heng say?

314
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,590
He didn't pick up the phone.

315
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,910
I guess he's busy.

316
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,990
What a pity.

317
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,310
But it doesn't matter.

318
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,910
You're the star tonight.

319
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,010
Are you still chatting?

320
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,870
Hurry up. The taxi is here.

321
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,240
Let's chat after we get to the restaurant.

322
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,310
Let's go.

323
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,690
It turned out that the whole thing

324
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,950
was a misunderstanding.

325
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,950
So until now,

326
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,190
there has been nothing between us.

327
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,510
At most, we are

328
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,470
flirting...

329
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,190
Flirting.

330
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,990
Flirting?

331
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,640
Then the next phase

332
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,550
should be being in a relationship.

333
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,470
It can be a reference.

334
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,190
You can take a day off.

335
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,600
But you need to write a report.

336
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,640
You need to write down

337
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,510
what you have done every day recently,

338
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,630
starting from...

339
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,130
From

340
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,030
your first meal.

341
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,030
Mr. Shen.

342
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,790
What does my leave have to do

343
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,350
with Tang Tang?

344
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,690
How do I know whether

345
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,950
you have been dating during work time?

346
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,560
Then tonight...

347
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,230
You have to be there.

348
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,830
I'll get the car then.

349
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,420
[Xia Mo]

350
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,670
One word.

351
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,960
A lifetime.

352
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,710
Love for a whole life.

353
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,790
One cup of wine.

354
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,030
Cheers! Cheers!

355
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,190
Come on, Director.

356
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,850
-Let's do it together.
-Come on, Director.

357
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,860
Cheers!

358
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,590
Cheers! Cheers!

359
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:37,670
Cheers.

360
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,250
Xia Mo.

361
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,150
To be honest,

362
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,230
although I envy you a lot

363
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,640
for being the woman who is lucky enough

364
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,470
to be liked by a boss and a dream man,

365
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,950
I'm still very happy for you.

366
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,850
We all know

367
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,430
how hard you work.

368
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,350
Yes.

369
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,090
The idea to increase sales

370
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,290
by asking Lin Heng for help

371
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:01,990
is brilliant.

372
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,270
Awesome.

373
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,990
Thank you.

374
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,920
But I'm not

375
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,550
a lucky girl.

376
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,830
I'm just a worker.

377
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,960
Long live the workers!

378
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,530
Yes.

379
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,370
Come on, friends.

380
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,160
Cheers.

381
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,370
Make our projects

382
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,710
bigger and more successful in the future.

383
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,190
Bigger and more successful!

384
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,110
That's what the CEO always says.

385
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,470
Because she wants to be the CEO.

386
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:29,990
Director.

387
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:30,860
Come on, Director.

388
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:31,790
Director.

389
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,990
Mr. Tan, please come in.

390
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,470
Mr. Shen.

391
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,030
I'm so sorry.

392
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,330
The flight was delayed.

393
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:41,950
Otherwise,

394
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,310
I wouldn't have made you wait for me.

395
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,430
Mr. Tan, it's nothing.

396
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,720
Let's talk while eating.

397
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,550
-Please.
-Okay.

398
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,200
Here, Mr. Tan.

399
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,950
Here's to you.

400
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,210
I'm sorry.

401
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,040
I never drink.

402
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,150
So, I'll drink water instead of wine.

403
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,400
Help yourself.

404
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,990
Cheers.

405
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,030
I hope you can show support and give help

406
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,829
with supply in North China.

407
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,880
T5 wants to expand its market share in North China.

408
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,150
We'll need your help then.

409
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,770
We have to thank Ms. Chen

410
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,270
for setting us up.

411
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:20,930
Didn't she move

412
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,790
to Zhenhai?

413
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,750
Why didn't she come tonight?

414
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,890
Mr. Tan, which Ms. Chen

415
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,030
are you talking about?

416
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,430
Chen Xiangyun.

417
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,070
She told me she's your friend.

418
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,150
I haven't seen her for a long time.

419
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,840
But it's okay.

420
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,950
Since the referee is a common friend of ours,

421
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,930
it's easier for us

422
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:44,790
to work together.

423
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:45,910
Let's eat.

424
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,670
Okay.

425
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:47,870
Brother.

426
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,430
Sister should be in the room next door.

427
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,790
She just recovered.

428
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,290
If she is here because of work

429
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,230
and needs to drink,

430
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,550
isn't it bad for her health?

431
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,950
Do you want to take a look?

432
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,950
Are you talking about your girlfriend

433
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,150
Miss Xia?

434
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,390
You should go and have a look.

435
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,590
I'm fine here.

436
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,870
Mr. Qin is here with me.

437
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,430
I'll go and have a look.

438
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,400
Qin Xiang,

439
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,030
keep Mr. Tan company.

440
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:08,870
Okay.

441
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,270
Wait for me.

442
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,670
Sit.

443
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,150
Here, Mr. Tan.

444
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,270
Here's to you.

445
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,410
You have to say that?

446
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,950
Can't I?

447
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,710
Xia Mo,

448
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,520
you managed to turn the tide this time

449
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,480
and successfully

450
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,470
held the press conference.

451
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,640
I hope you can be more careful

452
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,630
in your work

453
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,230
and improve your performance.

454
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,110
Here's to you.

455
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,910
Cheers.

456
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,440
Director...

457
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,030
What?

458
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,300
Are you still mad at me?

459
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:17,990
Director,

460
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,430
Xia Mo had a fever.

461
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,950
I'll drink this for her.

462
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,710
The toast is to Xia Mo, not you.

463
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,990
Why should you drink for her?

464
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,070
She was sick before.

465
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,190
But she's fine now.

466
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,870
And liquor is good for sterilizing.

467
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,990
Come on, Xia Mo.

468
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,710
Director...

469
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,700
The four of us propose a toast to you.

470
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,370
We can drink.

471
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,350
A toast to you.

472
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,950
Shen Junyao.

473
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,190
Mr. Shen.

474
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,510
Director Shi.

475
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,760
On behalf of Xia Mo,

476
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,670
thank you for your compliment.

477
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:10,990
Mr. Shen.

478
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,950
That's impressive!

479
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,290
Xia Mo can overfulfill

480
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,350
the task of holding the press conference

481
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,910
partially because of your mentoring.

482
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,290
I prepared a small gift

483
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,270
on behalf of Xia Mo

484
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,390
to express our gratitude.

485
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,110
I've paid the bill.

486
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,110
Please continue.

487
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,550
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

488
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,480
Come with me.

489
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,100
Great.

490
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,470
The real version of

491
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,150
"the domineering president falling in love with me".

492
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,310
Eat.

493
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,550
Why are you here?

494
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,790
What did you give to our director?

495
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,630
I'm talking to you.

496
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,680
Shen Junyao.

497
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,190
You...

498
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,590
Xia Mo.

499
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,990
It was Shi Li

500
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,150
who implanted the virus into your computer

501
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,300
♫Looking at the stars in the sky♫

502
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,190
In the USB I gave her

503
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,220
♫The blues are suddenly gone♫

504
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,410
is the CCTV footage

505
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,150
of her tampering with your computer.

506
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,460
♫When you close your eyes♫

507
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,150
How did you find out?

508
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,580
♫Whose figure is it?♫

509
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,190
Because...

510
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:50,030
♫Are you not sleeping either♫

511
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,400
Because...

512
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,320
♫Thinking of someone too♫

513
00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:01,430
♫I like to bicker with you for no reason♫

514
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,000
♫This time I miss you♫

515
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,000
♫I confess♫

516
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,700
♫Meeting you might've been an accident♫

517
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:19,690
♫But I anticipate it every day♫

518
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,350
Shen Junyao, what's wrong?

519
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,750
You are too heavy.

520
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,890
Shen Junyao, are you okay?

521
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:26,430
♫I confess my love to you♫

522
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:21,390
Brother.

523
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,150
Brother.

524
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,080
Sister, don't worry.

525
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,710
He's fine.

526
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,890
He just fell asleep

527
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:26,460
due to

528
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,670
excessive alcohol take-in.

529
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,920
♫I can no longer pretend I'm not in love♫

530
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,630
Let me do it.

531
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:36,370
♫I'm relying on you unconsciously♫

532
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,100
Let's go.

533
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,350
Don't drink if you can't.

534
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,790
I don't need your help.

535
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:50,990
Sister.

536
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,390
I was not trying to show off.

537
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,390
The main logic behind his behavior

538
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,830
is that he's worried about you.

539
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,510
Don't worry too much.

540
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,780
It's true

541
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,910
that he can't drink much.

542
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:03,720
At most,

543
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,360
he can drink a glass of wine.

544
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,790
One glass of liquor is too much for him.

545
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,890
But it's not something that he can decide.

546
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,870
How much alcohol can one tolerate

547
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,310
is decided by one's genes.

548
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,230
He'll be fine after a night's sleep.

549
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,400
When we get home,

550
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,330
I need you

551
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,110
to take care of him.

552
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,870
Because Brother's client is still in the restaurant.

553
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,110
I need to go back.

554
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,110
Okay.

555
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,780
Starlight, slow down.

556
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:36,950
Well...

557
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,150
Slowly.

558
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,270
Sister.

559
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,460
I'll leave him to you.

560
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,190
I'm leaving.

561
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,750
When will you come back?

562
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,310
I'm afraid I can't move him.

563
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,390
I'm not sure about that.

564
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,560
I'll be back

565
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,550
as soon as possible.

566
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,190
Okay.

567
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,030
People are really heavy

568
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,630
when they are asleep.

569
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,790
You're the one who drank and acted cool.

570
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,070
I'm the one who's now taking care of you.

571
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,990
Starlight.

572
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,190
Where am I?

573
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,830
You're home.

574
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,270
You're in your room.

575
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,310
Is Xia Mo back?

576
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,910
Xia Mo?

577
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,590
Isn't she back yet?

578
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,550
No.

579
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:08,670
I need to find her.

580
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,600
How can she drink when she's not feeling well?

581
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,470
So reckless.

582
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,300
Don't move.

583
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,030
Xia Mo is back.

584
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,390
She's right in front of you.

585
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,030
You are lying to me again.

586
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,110
I'm going to find her.

587
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,670
Go to sleep.

588
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,350
Danika.

589
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,270
What are you doing?

590
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,110
Why are you sitting in the car instead of going home?

591
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,070
Tonight?

592
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,190
I shouldn't go home tonight.

593
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,870
Is it because Mr. Shen is drunk

594
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,740
and you don't want to disturb him and Miss Xia?

595
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,150
Yes.

596
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,680
So, I called you

597
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,790
to tell you

598
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,710
no matter what happens tonight,

599
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,150
don't show up.

600
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,320
Starlight.

601
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,570
You talked with Mr. Shen

602
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,590
in the basement

603
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,630
and told him to pretend to be what he used to be.

604
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:08,770
Did you do it on purpose?

605
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,590
What do you think?

606
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,910
How would I know?

607
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,610
I'm using Grandpa and Grandma

608
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,990
as the reference.

609
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,070
After evaluation,

610
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,450
I found only this way

611
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,330
is the most possible way

612
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,710
to let Brother and Sister be together.

613
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,200
Xia Mo.

614
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,830
When did you come back?

615
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,110
I've always been here.

616
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,510
You just

617
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,150
mistook me for Starlight.

618
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,680
He finally sobered up a little.

619
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,950
Xia Mo.

620
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,150
The virus in your computer

621
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,910
was implanted by Shi Li.

622
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,830
I have the evidence.

623
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,070
You just told me the evidence

624
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,550
is in the video stored on the USB drive.

625
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,030
Go to sleep.

626
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,590
But...

627
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,980
But the virus in your computer

628
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,580
was implanted by Shi Li. I have evidence.

629
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,870
Okay, okay.

630
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,150
Go to sleep.

631
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,510
I'll sleep later.

632
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:20,630
Xia Mo.

633
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,830
I have something important,

634
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,580
very important to tell you.

635
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,310
I...

636
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,330
I found that your computer

637
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,440
was tampered with by Shi Li.

638
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,790
Okay, okay.

639
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,110
Go to sleep.

640
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,430
Go to sleep.

641
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,950
I told you I'd call you over when I need you.

642
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,510
Why did you come here without my call?

643
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,310
Shen Junyao

644
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,730
found the evidence

645
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,550
I tampered with Xia Mo's computer.

646
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,470
So?

647
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,840
So, I can't

648
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,950
work at Candy anymore.

649
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:17,820
I can't even

650
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,390
work at any

651
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,740
Jiuyu Group's subsidiary companies.

652
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,200
What should I do?

653
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,110
Director Shi.

654
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,690
Didn't you do all these things

655
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:26,790
by yourself?

656
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,390
Does it have anything to do with me?

657
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,070
I advise you to hand in your resignation letter.

658
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,180
If the president of Jiuyu Group

659
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,820
knows about this,

660
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,440
I guess you will be kicked out of Zhenhai.

661
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,430
Brother.

662
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,710
Brother, are you up?

663
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,150
Are you okay?

664
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,030
Why are you sleeping here?

665
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,360
Do you think your bed is some trove?

666
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,830
Do you think everyone wants to sleep here?

667
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,450
Last night,

668
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,750
I couldn't get you to let go of me.

669
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,050
I was here listening to you

670
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,710
repeating yourself all night.

671
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,470
I...

672
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,390
I'm coming in.

673
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:10,630
Sister.

674
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,480
Brother.

675
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,230
Good morning. I'm home.

676
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,470
Did you just come back?

677
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,830
Mr. Qin was drunk last night.

678
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,310
I was taking care of him.

679
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,110
What happened last night?

680
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,200
After you got drunk last night,

681
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,840
Mr. Qin took care of the client.

682
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,280
After I sent you back,

683
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,190
I went to see him.

684
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,330
So, only Sister knows

685
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,430
what happened

686
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,590
after you got home.

687
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,470
I took care of a drunkard.

688
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,310
What else could happen?

689
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,030
Brother.

690
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,480
You should have a nutritious breakfast

691
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,790
after a hangover.

692
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,350
It is good for your health.

693
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,590
The breakfast is ready.

694
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,430
Do you want to go have breakfast?

695
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,030
Okay, I'll wash up first.

696
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,630
I'll wash up in my room too.

697
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,670
Brother, eat more.

698
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,070
It's good for your health.

699
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,990
[Lin Heng]

700
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,790
Congratulations on the successful close of the press conference.

701
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,630
Do you remember what you promised me?

702
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,970
[Lin Heng]
[What is it?]

703
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:33,790
Well...

704
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,610
Mr. Lin Heng

705
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,990
helped me a lot before.

706
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,560
I told him

707
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,510
to tell me if he needs anything.

708
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,150
What can you do for him?

709
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,150
[Lin Heng]

710
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,310
Go somewhere with me today.

711
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,590
He asks me to go somewhere with him.

712
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,510
I think

713
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,020
we should keep our word.

714
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,510
What do you think?

715
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,070
Since you've decided,

716
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,190
just go.

717
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,990
I'll go then.

718
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,750
Let's eat.

719
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,590
Bye bye.

720
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,030
She really went out?

721
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,160
If you're worried,

722
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,950
you can go with her.

723
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,520
The most silent but the most caring;

724
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,830
the gentlest but the most boring.

725
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:33,990
I can't go.
