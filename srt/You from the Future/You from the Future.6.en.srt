Expert Lin Heng's WeChat account?

14
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,270
He even asked you out for coffee?

15
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,330
Not bad, sister.

when he came to our company last time.

21

Ms. Xia.

29

38
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,730
Is this the real reason

39
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,760
you're rejecting Lin Heng?

40
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,180
Push and pull to the max!

If I keep being silent,

75
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:05,980
it'll be bad

76
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,890
for the reputation of Stantech.

77
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,290
Should we inform Miss Xia

78
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,560
in advance?

79
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,460
If she lets it slip

80
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,280
in front of the reporters...

81
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,250
If the reporters or the media

82
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,399
comes to ask me about it again,

83
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,459
I definitely won't deny

84
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,570
our relationship.

85
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,370

overcome the crisis of public opinion.

87
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,600

Mr. Shen.

134
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,290
What is the reason

135
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:41,780
for you to announce

136
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,970

137
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:43,720
Why is it so sudden?

138
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,300
Mr. Shen.

When are you going to get married?

140
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,380
Is this official announcement of relationship

141
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,290
related to the business plan

142
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,570

Is this the president's order?

147
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,260
Thank you for making time

Hereby,

00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,720
I officially announce

153
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,250
that my relationship with Miss Xia

154
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,570
is true.

155
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,870
Hurry.

156
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,890
I was silent because I didn't want to occupy

157
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,960
too many public resources.

158
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,540
As general manager

159
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,250
of Stantech,

160
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:14,960
from now on,

161
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,770
I will put more focus and energy

162
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,960
into work

163
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,380
and be determined to develop

164
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,130
more scientific technology

165
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,370
that helps people

166
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,280
and benefits human life.

167
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,530
I politely ask you

168
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,770
to also pay more attention

169
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,660
to the scientific development

170
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,610
of Stantech.

171
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,730
Now begins the Q&A session.

172
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,210
You have 10 minutes. Thank you.

173
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:31,810
Mr. Shen.

174
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,690
It's said that Robot T5 of Stantech

175
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,930
is about to be released.

176
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,970
Is this official announcement

177
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,159
part of the publicity campaign?

178
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,770
They have nothing to do with each other.

179
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,810
Besides,

180
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,620
Stantech relies on technology

181
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,770
to attract people's attention,

182
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,540
not public opinion.

183
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,090
Mr. Shen.

184
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:42,810
How long do you think

185
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,720
your relationship with Miss Xia Mo

186
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,760
can last this time?

187
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,180
Relationship

188
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,360
is a mutual thing.

189
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,640
I want it to last forever.

190
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,920
But the future is unknown.

191
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,659
Are you so pessimistic

192
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:52,460
because of

193
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,000
a failed relationship before?

194
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:54,970
Mr. Shen.

195
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,130
Congratulations on your new relationship.

196
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,370
It is assumed

197
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,330
that you broke up last time

198
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,370
because you were too focused on work.

199
00:06:59,370 --> 00:06:59,840
May I ask

200
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,250
what the specific reason was?

201
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,320
Junyao.

202
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,580
We've been together

203
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,690
for half a year,

204
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,360
but you've never kissed me before.

205
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,250
Today is my birthday.

206
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,090
Can you

207
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,409
give me a kiss?

208
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,080
Let's wait until we get married.

209
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,800
Why are you so conservative?

210
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:51,520
Sorry.

211
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,520
Mr. Shen.

212
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,380
Your case

213
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:02,900
very likely

214
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,610
has something to do with your family of origin.

215
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,420
Is there any solution?

216
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,570
For example, pharmacotherapy.

217
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,410
It's not that simple.

218
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,150
However,

219
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,340
if a woman

220
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,060
that you're willing to kiss

221
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,330
really shows up,

222
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,690
then congratulations.

223
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,580
Not only is she

224
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,290
your true love,

225
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,660
but also an indirect remedy

226
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,340
to the psychological trauma

227
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,810
caused by your family of origin.

228
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,880
I don't want to mention the past anymore.

229
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,940
And I hope

230
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,160
you won't disturb our life anymore.

231
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,050
Please understand

232
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,130
my selfishness to protect her.

233
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:32,890
And don't underestimate

234
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,120
my determination to protect her.

235
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,400
This brat.

236
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,960
It's finally official.

237
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,780
Looks like I'm one step closer

238
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,090
to holding my great grandson.

239
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,960
President.

240
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,610
Mr. Shen's heart rate changed

241
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,400
possibly because of physical fluctuations.

242
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,530
His photism

243
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,330
and phonism

244
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,260
were maybe the sequelae

245
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,170
from the fire.

246
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,630
They don't mean anything.

247
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,840
What sequelae?

248
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,650
It seems that your EQ

249
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,280
is not much higher than Starlight.

250
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,980
But I can't blame you.

251
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,120
You're not human after all.

252
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,220
You don't understand

253
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,220
these complicated things.

254
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,040
It's normal.

255
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,720
I suspect that you're scolding me,

256
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,320
but I have no evidence.

257
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,880
Why would I scold you?

258
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,290
You work hard

259
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,330
to keep an eye on that brat for me.

260
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,320
How am I willing to scold you?

261
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,490
But if Mr. Shen finds out...

262
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,480
That's true.

263
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,450
If he finds out,

264
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,050
you have to

265
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,880
be the scapegoat for me.

266
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,760
I understand.

267
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,100
I'll try my best to hide it

268
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,880
in case Mr. Shen gets mad.

269
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,650
I don't care

270
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,920
if he gets mad.

271
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,570
I'm afraid that if he finds out,

272
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,040
I'll lose my informant.

273
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,120
Then my big plan

274
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,400
will take forever to execute.

275
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,610
I don't think that counts as a kiss.

276
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,200
Starlight.

277
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,960
Brother.

278
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,500
Congratulations on finally admitting

279
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,120
your relationship with Sister.

280
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,930
This is complicated.

281
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:15,930
I won't explain it to you.

282
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:16,690
It's okay.

283
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,440
Human emotions are all complicated.

284
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,000
I trust your choice unconditionally.

285
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,690
The reason I'm calling you

286
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,560
is that I'd like to visit Sister

287
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,080
to tell her this good news.

288
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,400
Can you pick me up?

289
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,010
Didn't I just send you back?

290
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,170
Why do you want to come out again?

291
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,640
Okay.

292
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,570
Wait for me at home.

293
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,480
You scared me.

294
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,890
Where did you go?

295
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,890
I went to the studio.

296
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,050
I saw you were writing,

297
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,080
so I didn't disturb you.

298
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,200

299
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,010
Lin Heng is here?

300

Yes.

302

Have you finished the promotion plan?

306
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,200
Yes, Director.

307
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,200
Why didn't you send it to me?

308
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,640
[Xia Mo, how is the promotion plan of Robot T5 going?
Director Shi, it's ready. I'll send it to you now]

309
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,250
I'm sending it.

310
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,480
The document is a bit big so it's not finished yet.

311

312

directly via a chatting app?

313
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,900
Don't you know you must use business email

314
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,930
for work documents?

315
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,250
When you were late,

316
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,260
didn't I ask you to read the company regulations?

317
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,200
Did you read them?

318
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,410
Last time, you said it's easier to read

319
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,400
if it is sent via a mobile app.

320
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,010
So...

321
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,330
Can you then

322
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,970
send a copy to my phone

323
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,800
after sending it via business email?

324
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,810
Will you die of exhaustion if you just send it one more time?

325
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:38,890
Sorry, Director.

326
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,840
I was inconsiderate.

327
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,490

This outfit

384
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,560
suits Mr. Lin Heng's temperament so well.

385
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,090
Do you get a sense

386
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,930
of being aloof from the world?

387
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,650
Yes, I do.

388
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,020
Xia Mo, listen.

389

00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,520
It's an official announcement, Xia Mo!

395
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,390
Whose official announcement?

396
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,160
Who?

397

[Shen Junyao, the successor of Jiuyu Group, officially confirmed his new relationship!]

398
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,660

399

my selfishness to protect her.

400
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,340
And don't underestimate

401

Help!

408

What kind of miraculous love is this?

409
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,530
This is such big news.

410
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,020
Why didn't you

411
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,010
tell us in advance?

412
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,500

To... to be honest,

I found out just now, too.

415
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,540
You didn't know

416
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,810
he was to have a press conference today?

417
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,800
Could it be

418
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,490
that he wanted to surprise you?

419
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,720
How romantic.

420
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,040
Look.

421
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,200
Mr. Lin Heng went to change his outfit.

422
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,960
He's changing into the next one?

423
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,090
Yes.

424
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,640
Xia Mo is so lucky.

425
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,460
-I envy her so much.
-Indeed.

426
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,100
What a huge blessing!

427
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,080
So lucky.

428
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,170
Mr. Lin Heng, this way.

429
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,570
Be careful.

431

This outfit is so deity-looking.

432
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:11,900
Thank you.

433
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,960
Thank you. This side.

434
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,280
Look. Look.

get dressed.

437
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,850
How I regret it.

438
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,930
Why am I in the Editing Department

439
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,210
not the Production Department?

440
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:31,960
I...

441
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,020
What happened?

442
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,200
Why is the outfit torn?

443
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,500
I... I don't know.

444
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,660
I just slightly pulled it.

445
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,840
The outfit is torn.

446
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:38,920
It's okay.

447
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,900
I'll cover it a little.

448
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,880
We can still shoot.

449
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,660
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin.

450
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,970
Sorry for the trouble again.

451
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,140
Mr. Lin Heng.

452
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,940
I'm really sorry.

453
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,560
The sponsor asked this outfit

454
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,040
to be shot at all angles.

455
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,020
We'll think of a way

456
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,970
to make up for it a little.

457
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,240
Do you have needles and threads here?

458
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,800
How about trying to sew it?

459
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,880
Needles and threads?

460
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,050
I have them.

461
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,610
Can you sew?

462
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,450
You win!

Anyone can sew with needles and threads?

465
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,730
Mr. Lin Heng's outfit came unsewn.

466
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,640
It needs sewing.

467
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,200

I... I can't.

470
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,720
Xia Mo, I've read your resume.

471
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,860
You majored in costume design.

472
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,250
You even made hanfus on your own.

473
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,620
Don't tell me

474
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,400
your hanfus are all made of paper.

475
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,840
Those are nothing but for homework.

476
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,320
This is too advanced.

477
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,490
Young lady, please help.

478
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,580
Please help Mr. Lin Heng.

479
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,240
I really can't.

480

Saving the shoot is like putting out a fire.

485

to take a look at the shoot.

486
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:45,760
Excuse me.

487
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,450
Is Miss Xia sewing the outfit for me?

488
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,410
Yes.

489
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,640
Miss Xia is professional.

490
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,200
She even designed clothing herself.

491
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,960
Miss Xia told me before.

492
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,010
Well...

493
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,640
Thank you, Miss Xia.

494

You're welcome.

00:16:59,140 --> 00:16:59,930
Thank you.

496

Thank you.

Was your action just now

500
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,010
out of jealousy?

501
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,240
But he should be Sister's idol,

502
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,890
not your love rival.

503
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,930
I know.

It can't be.

Today, Mr. Lin Heng

521

is shooting in the studio downstairs.

522

they went to take a peep.

your official announcement video.

To be honest,

I think Xia Mo

529
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,130

140 beats per minute.

577
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,620

583

765
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,380
I know Xia Mo

766
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,650
is your girlfriend,

767
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,660
and you want to protect her.

768
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,760
But this is Candy.

769
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,490
Candy has its own regulations.

770
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,660
Her document

771
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,050
was finished beforehand.

772
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,290
Sorry.

773
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,200
I didn't receive it.

774
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,320
Additionally,

775
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,460
she snuck out

776
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,860
to see Lin Heng's shoot

777
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,720
without finishing her job.

778
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,450
This is considered absenteeism.

779
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,880
What do you think, Mr. Shen?

780
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,290
Listen to yourself.

781
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,410
You were just

782
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,850
asking for trouble.

783
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,210
You knew so well that

784
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,290
many people in your company have feelings for Shen Junyao,

785
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,230
and you are his official girlfriend.

786
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,140
Why did you go sewing

787
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,400
for Lin Heng?

788
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,530
I saw they were in a hurry

789
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,850
and didn't have an outfit for the shoot.

790
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,850
I helped because I was afraid they'd have nothing to publish.

791
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:25,930
See?

792
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,360
You put yourself in trouble.

793
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,360
What should I do now?

794
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,400
The Director is going to issue a notice of criticism across the company.

795
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,280
How can I survive this?

796
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,460
Your Director is definitely

797
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,640
abusing her position for her private grudge.

798
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,680
Xia Xia.

799
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,610
Tell me the license plate number

800
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,480
of your Director.

801
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,680
I'll go to your company soon

802
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,540
and pop the tires

803
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,440
of her car.

804
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,600
Tang Tang, stop it.

805
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:48,740
Do you think

806
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,200
this is not my year?

807
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,200
I was scolded by the Director in the company.

808
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,080
Back home, I guess

809
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,640
I'll be scolded by Shen Junyao as well.

810
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,640
No way.

811
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,720
Didn't he already scold you?

812
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,840
Apart from that,

813
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,810
the fact that he treats you so well

814
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:01,850
all of a sudden

815
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,330
is very interesting.

816
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,140
I hope

817
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,800
you can judge not based on personal emotions.

818
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,140
What Xia Mo did

819
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,560
does not deserve a notice of criticism.

820
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,160
After all this talk,

821
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,360
all you want to is to protect your own person.

822
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,290
I'm just considering it as it stands.

823
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,120
Xia Mo is an employee at Candy.

824
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,860
If she makes a mistake,

825
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,380
as her superior,

826
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,080
I have the right to take actions on her.

827
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,160
Also,

828
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,920
I want to remind you.

829
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,260
Stantech and Candy

830
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,400
are partners.

831
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,020
You have no right to interfere

832
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,200
the decisions of our company.

833
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,530
Are you really going to do this?

834
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,000
Or else?

835
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,000
Starlight.

836
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,330
Contact Danika.

837
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,650
She knows what to do.

838
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:11,800
My computer.

839
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,080
Youyou, there's no signal here.

840
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,240
Why are your computers black...

841
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,160
Hello?

842
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:21,880
Hello?

843
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,450
No signal.

844
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,440
Mr. Shen.

845
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,010
You can attack the network of Candy.

846
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,060
But we're a family with Stantech.

847
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,330
Now you know we're a family.

848
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,410
Isn't it too late?
