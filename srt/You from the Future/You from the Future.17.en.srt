00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,640
[Episode 17]

4
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:56,720
Who are you?

5
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,570
I'm your ex-husband's girlfriend.

6
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,410
Hello, my predecessor.

7
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,900
I hope this won't be

8
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,960
the only birthday we spent together.

9
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,160
I hope I can celebrate

10
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,120
every birthday of yours in the future.

11
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,360
I shouldn't have had this meal.

12
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,010
Now everyone's uncomfortable.

13
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,320
What's going on?

14
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,490
Where is my windshield?

15
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,010
Why is the whole world

16
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,400
working against me?

17
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,040
What kind of crap is this?

18
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,090
Xia Xia,

19
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,010
can your method work?

20
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,010
Why do I think

21
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,530
your mother has already found out?

22
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,360
No, she hasn't.

23
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,290
Because if she had found out,

24
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,680
I would have been dead.

25
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:24,840
But

26
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,620
if I can stay alive

27
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,770
tomorrow and the day after tomorrow

28
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,010
depends on you.

29
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,360
If you're worried,

30
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,320
I can build a data model

31
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,590
to simulate

32
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,740
and find the best solution.

33
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,440
Really?

34
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,530
How long will it take?

35
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,680
Two months.

36
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,770
Forget it.

37
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,050
Two months.

38
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,500
I guess you can't even find

39
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,760
my ashes then.

40
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,130
Tang Tang.

41
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,880
Are you waiting for someone's call?

42
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,010
No.

43
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,240
I'm looking at the time.

44
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,000
Does Qin Xiang really know about this?

45
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,050
Why do I feel that

46
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,160
he acted strange tonight?

47
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:02,900
I've already

48
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,290
told him about

49
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,030
[Qin Xiang]

50
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,280
pretending to be Shen Junyao's girlfriend.

51
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,080
But

52
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,960
he hasn't replied.

53
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,840
Is he angry?

54
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,600
Well,

55
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,100
I'll call him and explain it.

56
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,800
No need.

57
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,130
Let's see when he'll think it through.

58
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,040
Xia Mo.

59
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,620
Auntie.

60
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,360
Here, have some fruit.

61
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,290
Mom.

62
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,760
Thank you.

63
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,360
What are you three doing?

64
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:25,980
We're playing cards.

65
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,760
We're chatting.

66
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,340
Auntie,

67
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,180
we are playing cards

68
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,040
while chatting.

69
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,450
Yes.

70
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,920
Playing cards?

71
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,400
Where are the cards?

72
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,360
We're using our phones to play cards.

73
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:47,220
Phone.

74
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,320
Yes, the phone.

75
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,320
Your phones?

76
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,850
You're not like this

77
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,409
when you're thinking.

78
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,320
Are you really playing cards?

79
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,650
Well...

80
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,530
I'm letting the system play for me.

81
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,960
It's more likely to win this way.

82
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,490
Then what role are you playing?

83
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,530
Don't you think you shouldn't be here?

84
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,050
She's so acute.

85
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,440
Xia Xia.

86
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,280
Your mom used to be a detective, right?

87
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,720
Stop it.

88
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,140
Think about

89
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,330
what we should do tomorrow.

90
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,410
Tomorrow?

91
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,340
Think about

92
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,680
how to survive tonight.

93
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,040
Have you finished your team building plan?

94
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,080
I rushed home,

95
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:39,440
so I haven't finished the plan.

96
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:40,890
Danika.

97
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,340
Finish the team building plan

98
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,460
with Starlight,

99
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,960
including all the activities and prizes.

100
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,180
It's getting late.

101
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,280
I'm going back to rest.

102
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,600
Xia Xia,

103
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,420
should I go back

104
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,460
to have a rest with him?

105
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,780
Stop it.

106
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,650
This is not the right time

107
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,280
for joking.

108
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,210
Not the right time?

109
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,690
Isn't this your idea

110
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,050
to ask me to pretend to be his girlfriend?

111
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:05,500
Then

112
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,450
I'll treat you to a meal.

113
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,810
Do I need you to treat me?

114
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,560
It's his treat.

115
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:09,840
Okay.

116
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,410
What should I do?

117
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,720
What should I do?

118
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,770
Brother.

119
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,200
Did anything happen tonight?

120
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,720
Nothing.

121
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,400
We just had dinner together.

122
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,980
I just received

123
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,050
some complicated emotions.

124
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,960
Did something happen between you two?

125
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,290
What could happen between us?

126
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,280
I am now

127
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,360
Tang Jinxuan's boyfriend.

128
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,770
Miss Tang Jinxuan?

129
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,400
What's going on?

130
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,610
Don't ask.

131
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,570
But...

132
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,880
But things are not like what you think.

133
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,850
Xia Mo told her parents

134
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,810
she asked Tang Jinxuan to move in

135
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,400
because this house is too big.

136
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,360
I'm living here

137
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,920
because I'm

138
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,650
Tang Jinxuan's boyfriend.

139
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,770
So you came down

140
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,160
to run away from Sister's parents

141
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,650
or

142
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,730
to continue to develop

143
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,080
T6 Assistive Robot?

144
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,200
Not now.

145
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,840
I have a lot on my mind now.

146
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,040
Brother,

147
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,090
there's something

148
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,320
I have to tell you.

149
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,330
I've checked the video

150
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,040
of you and Sister

151
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,280
in the archive of Stantech.

152
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,020
There are some problems

153
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,920
with your chat.

154
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,140
For some personal reasons,

155
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,560
I'm very insecure about relationships.

156
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,060
If you think

157
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,659
it's okay for us

158
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:42,420
to break up

159
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,020
in the end,

160
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,620
then I can't accept

161
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,159
this kind of relationship. Do you understand?

162
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,050
You didn't say it clearly.

163
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:47,980
About accepting

164
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,040
or not,

165
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,490
what Sister meant was

166
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,180
that she can't accept

167
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,600
a relationship that may end at any time.

168
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,640
It's not that she can't accept you.

169
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,920
You mean

170
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:01,850
she...

171
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,400
She didn't turn me down.

172
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,300
How is

173
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,010
the team building plan?

174
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,760
The location is at Coastline Park.

175
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,450
Tell the Secretary Office

176
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,600
to take part in tomorrow's team building.

177
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,130
How is the simulation

178
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,320
of assistive robots going?

179
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,440
Didn't you just say

180
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,440
you had a lot on your mind?

181
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,240
Well, I'm good now.

182
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,640
I've run simulations and modeling.

183
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,280
Because there are too many specified divisions

184
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,240
of the assistive robot

185
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,880
and every user may have

186
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,240
totally different needs,

187
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,920
it still takes a very long time for assistive robots to learn.

188
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,340
How about this?

189
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,220
We can launch companion robots

190
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,330
with basic auxiliary functions.

191
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,250
After collecting enough information,

192
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,080
we can upgrade their firmware

193
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,840
to add professional auxiliary functions.

194
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,450
Considering the cost

195
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,330
of R&D and maintenance,

She asked me to cover up for her

406
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,760
and pretend to be Shen Junyao's girlfriend.

407
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,250

I hope you can actively participate in the activities.

419
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,370

after we return to the company.

421

00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,130
I think I said something wrong again.

424

When?

425
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,370
When we're in the parking lot.

426
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,250
After you left,

427
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,040
I explained to Shen Junyao

428
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,780
why

429
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,520
I let him pretend to be your boyfriend.

430
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,530
He was quite happy.

431
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,810
I praised him

432
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,890

when you mentioned contract friend,

437
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,130
he got upset?

438
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,120
I think so.

439
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,940
You are so stupid.

440
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,130
Shen Junyao definitely likes you.

441
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,360
But you mentioned the contract.

442
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,680
Of course he would get angry.

443
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,560
But...

444
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,690
He likes me but he didn't tell me.

445
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,880
Does he expect me to do it first?

446
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,680

00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,440
Mr. Shen.

578
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,840
I'm sorry about yesterday.

579
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,920
I don't care.

580
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,060
But Miss Tang

581
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,280
has been restless all day.

582
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:10,900
Remember to comfort her

583
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,840
later.

584
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,010
I understand.

585
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,770
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

586
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,480
Don't mention it. Let's go.

587
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,440
Now everyone is here. Let's begin.

588
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,560
Tang Tang,

589
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,090
don't be the goalkeeper.

590
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:57,840
You'll get injured easily.

591
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,930
I'm tired both physically and mentally.

592
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,050
It's good to be a goalkeeper.

593
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,020
I don't need to move.

594
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,140
What if

595
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,040
you get hit by the ball?

596
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,250
Stop talking nonsense here.

597
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,680
Go play football.

598
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,680
Mr. Shen is quite good.

599
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,940
But no matter what,

600
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,690
don't worry.

601
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,400
If anyone wants to hit you with the ball,

602
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,660
they'll have to

603
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,560
go past me first.

604
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:46,760
Boss,

605
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,520
the bathroom is all set.

606
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,940
Where else do you want to place this?

607
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,920
Come and take a look in the kitchen.

608
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,850
Make sure

609
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:53,890
to put some rat poison

610
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:54,420
in dark and damp places

611
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,690
in the kitchen.

612
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,210
Leave it to me, Boss.

613
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,640
Mr. Shen...

614
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,440
Tang Tang, I know I was wrong.

615
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,220
You know what?

616
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,260
I lost my phone yesterday.

617
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,340
On my drive here,

618
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,480
I almost got disfigured by the wind.

619
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,600
I know I was wrong.

620
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,640
No.

621
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,700
We've only been together for two days.

622
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,640
But you already dare to be like this.

623
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,410
Qin Xiang, the ball!

624
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,210
Tang Tang, don't worry.

625
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:46,660
I will never

626
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,640
let you get hit.

627
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,480
-Qin Xiang!
-Qin Xiang!

628
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,690
Mr. Qin, are you alright?

629
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:20,520
Qin Xiang!
