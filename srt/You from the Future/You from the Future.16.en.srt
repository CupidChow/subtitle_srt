00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,039
The kitchen is still upstairs, right?

199
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,120
Let me see what's in the fridge.

200
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,049
Aunt.

201
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:37,480
Don't worry.

202
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,169
Your aunt

203
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,200
is warm-hearted.

204
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,210
I'll go buy whatever you want.

205
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,460
No need, Uncle.

206
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,520
There are dishes in the fridge.

207
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,020
It occurred to me that

208
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,040
I still have work to do.

209
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,740
I'm going to work.

210
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,050
You can play billiards here.

211
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,530
Go ahead.

212
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,200
We'll call you when the meal is ready.

213
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,960
Okay, thank you.

214
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,240
When will you be back?

215
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,760
It's inappropriate to ask for leave on the first day.

216
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,780
[Shen Junyao]

217
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,960
Wait until I'm off work.

218
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,330
Why do I feel like

219
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,770
your parents are treating me as a guest?

220
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,410
I didn't want my parents to worry,

221
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,280
so I told them I took the house back

222
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,680
and I live alone.

223
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,240
I didn't expect

224
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,320
they would come to Zhenhai to find me.

225
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,470
Not only did I get rejected,

226
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,920
I've run into her parents now.

227
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,720
It was only a rejection.

228
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,320
I can't give up so easily.

229
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,220
If I really

230
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,410
date Xia Mo in the future,

231
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,480
I'll have to meet her parents sooner or later.

232
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,750
[Qin Xiang]

233
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,090
Hello, Mr. Shen.

234
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:36,800
What can I do for you?

235
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,050
Have Xia Mo do market research.

236
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,880
Market research?

237
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,700
Isn't Xia Mo responsible

238
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,740
for the team building plan?

239
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,320
Did something happen?

240
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,770
Don't ask why.

241
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,160
Just use the fastest way

242
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,210
to give her an appropriate reason

243
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:49,960
to leave the company.

244
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:50,620
Okay, Mr. Shen.

245
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,600
I'll arrange it right away.

246
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,150
Tang Nuan.

247
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,410
I was worried

248
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,410
my new colleague would be more hardworking than me.

249
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,600
It seems that I don't have to worry.

250
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,560
Miss Xia,

251
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,530
I hope I didn't disturb you playing on your phone.

252
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,610
Don't say that.

253
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,520
Miss Xia, go on.

254
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,000
Ask Tang Nuan to keep an eye out for you.

255
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,950
When Mr. Qin comes,

256
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,720
she can warn you.

257
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,030
Why should I keep an eye out for her?

258
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,370
I have to work.

259
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,970
Besides, after my computer broke down just now,

260
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:30,970
all the data disappeared.

261
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,570
Mine is broken too.

262
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,370
Your computer breaking

263
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,890
has nothing to do with me.

264
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,840
Besides,

265
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,880
remember to backup the data next time.

266
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,850
Work hard.

267
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,590
Stop staring at me.

268
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,740
When did I stare at you?

269
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,410
Mr. Qin.

270
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,120
Xia Mo,

271
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,610
I need you

272
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,770
to do some market research.

273
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,610
Put your work on hold

274
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,360
for now.

275
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,130
Market research?

276
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:50,730
Yes.

277
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,730
I emailed you

278
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,090
the address and needs.

279
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,960
After you finish,

280
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,120
you can go home directly.

281
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,410
Maggie.

282
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,640
Help her record this outing.

283
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,360
I'll go right now.

284
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,290
Starlight,

285
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,200
I'll leave first.

286
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,280
Do your work well.

287
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,730
Sister, don't worry.

288
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,490
Leave the company to me.

289
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,640
Everyone, work hard.

290
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,680
Okay.

291
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,570
It's different to have connections.

292
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,000
Exactly.

293
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,270
[Xia Mo]

294
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,570
I'll be home in five minutes.

295
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,690
Aunt, what's wrong?

296
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,840
The food is ready.

297
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,880
Let's go down and eat.

298
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,200
No, thanks.

299
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,720
I'm not done with my work yet.

300
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,080
Are you a robot?

301
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,090
Of course not.

302
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,600
Then it's settled.

303
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,280
People need food.

304
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,720
You'll starve if you miss a meal.

305
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,850
Only robots

306
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,960
don't need to eat.

307
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,010
You're not a robot.

308
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:07,970
How can you not be hungry?

309
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,480
No need to act polite.

310
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,690
When Xia Mo comes back,

311
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,530
she'll blame us

312
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,000
for neglecting her friend.

313
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,060
I will

314
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,290
feel embarrassed too.

315
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,680
Alright.

316
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,650
Come down and eat.

317
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,960
He came down for lunch.

318
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,760
Here, Shen. Have a seat.

319
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,450
Try your aunt's cooking.

320
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:36,810
Let's eat.

321
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,120
Eat.

322
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,810
Okay.

323
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,040
Shen,

324
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,480
try the dishes.

325
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,650
Okay.

326
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,880
Try your aunt's cooking.

327
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:57,890
Thank you.

328
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:58,930
Shen, right?

329
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,810
I saw that you can work

330
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,250
just by sitting in your room.

331
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,280
Are you a writer?

332
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,520
No.

333
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,040
A script writer?

334
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,200
It's not that either.

335
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,120
You're all here?

336
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,410
Daughter.

337
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,490
-You're off work early.
-You're back.

338
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,730
Let me see.

339
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,930
Have you lost weight?

340
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,040
No, Mom.

341
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,400
Mom?

342
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,200
You still know I'm your mother?

343
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,010
Why didn't you tell me

344
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:31,970
that a man is living here?

345
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:32,920
It's such an important thing.

346
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,160
You scared me.

347
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,640
Mom,

348
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,480
it's not what you think.

349
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,760
Then what is it?

350
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,680
Who is that guy?

351
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,700
If I say

352
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,250
Shen Junyao is my contract boyfriend,

353
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,610
my parents will probably

354
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,450
freak out

355
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,480
and disown me.

356
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,090
But if I don't tell them

357
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,250
my relationship with Shen Junyao,

358
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,570
we'll only have to hide it for a few days

359
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,520
until my parents go home

360
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,720
and everything will be fine.

361
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,730
That's right.

362
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,410
Actually,

363
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,040
he's Tang Tang's boyfriend.

364
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,000
Hush.

365
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,010
You shouldn't do this.

366
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,940
Living under the same roof

367
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,210
with your best friend's boyfriend

368
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,520
can easily cause problems.

369
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,770
Mom, you misunderstood.

370
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,100
It's scary to live alone

371
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,560
in such a big house.

372
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,970
I asked Tang Tang

373
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:24,930
to live with me.

374
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,200
Her boyfriend

375
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,360
is here these days too.

376
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,800
That's it.

377
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,250
Look at you.

378
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,640
Tang Tang already has a boyfriend.

379
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,760
What about you?

380
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,850
You're still single.

381
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,240
Don't you feel ashamed?

382
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,810
Mom,

383
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,760
I just arrived in Zhenhai.

384
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,700
You didn't date anyone

385
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,560
in college either.

386
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,120
How old are you?

387
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,770
If you don't get married soon,

388
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,290
you'll get left behind.

389
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,410
Alright, Mom.

390
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,520
Let's eat first, okay?

391
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,480
Mom, let's eat first.

392
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,130
Xia, look.

393
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,040
Your daughter has lost weight.

394
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,460
She looks quite energized.

395
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,680
Right, Dad?

396
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,370
Hurry and eat more.

397
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,640
Eat.

398
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,680
Shen, you too.

399
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,680
Okay.

400
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,740
[Tang Jinxuan]

401
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,340
[Xia Xia Honey]

402
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,400
[Help! Call me back! It's urgent! Hurry up and call me back! Help me, hurry]

403
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,360
Have some beef.

404
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,440
Thank you.

405
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,940
[Tang Jinxuan]

406
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:50,810
Dad, Mom.

407
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,440
I have a work call.

408
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,560
I need to answer it.

409
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:57,920
This girl.

410
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,120
You finally answered the phone.

411
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,930
It's an emergency.

412
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,480
My parents are here.

413
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,180
Isn't it a good thing

414
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,210
that your parents are here?

415
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,440
They can take care of you.

416
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,930
No.

417
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,290
If your parents are here,

418
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,530
what about Shen Junyao?

419
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,680
They’ve already run into each other.

420
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,930
Luckily, I'm smart.

421
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,119
I told them

422
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,680
I live with you.

423
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,849
Shen Junyao

424
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,339
is your boyfriend.

425
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:22,640
Are you serious?

426
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,930
I just started dating Qin Xiang

427
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,099
and haven’t made any progress yet.

428
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:25,740
Now, you already gave me

429
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,720
a new boyfriend.

430
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,740
I really

431
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,730
have no choice.

432
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,740
Tang Tang,

433
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,860
now is the time to prove

434
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,050
if we're best friends or not.

435
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,410
But I’m busy today.

436
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,210
I have dinner with Qin Xiang.

437
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,920
You can come over after dinner.

438
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,970
No matter what time it is,

439
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,760
I'll wait for you at home.

440
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,770
Okay.

441
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,050
By the way,

442
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,380
have you discussed this

443
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,200
with Shen Junyao?

444
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,220
Don't put me in

445
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,210
an awkward situation later.

446
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,480
Don't worry.

447
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,610
I'll tell him.

448
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,410
I'm waiting for you. See you.

449
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,210
Hey,

450
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,610
I need to

451
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,080
discuss something with you.

452
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,970
Haven't you already made your decision?

453
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,000
I have no choice.

454
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,800
I'm really sorry.

455
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,600
Have you ever thought that

456
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,250
if you parents go online

457
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,330
and search our names,

458
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,410
they'll find out something is wrong?

459
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,650
Oh no.

460
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,850
I forgot about that.

461
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,130
What should I do?

462
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,920
I'll go pick Starlight up from the company first.

463
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,900
I'll also have them push down

464
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,200
the posts about our relationship.

465
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:38,760
Uncle, Aunt.

466
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,800
Are you going out?

467
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,120
I'm going out to find a friend.

468
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,240
Be careful.

469
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,040
Okay.

470
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,440
Xia Xia,

471
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,250
what work

472
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,040
does Tang Tang's boyfriend do?

473
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,800
He seems to be

474
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,840
a designer.

475
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,800
He doesn't look like one.

476
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,120
I think this young man

477
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,770
is not easy to get along with.

478
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,810
Really?

479
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,130
It doesn't matter.

480
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,810
He's not my boyfriend anyway.

481
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,720
He won't spend his life with me, right?

482
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,650
That's true.

483
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,580
Be careful when you find a boyfriend

484
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,440
in the future.

485
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,160
Don't be like Tang Tang.

486
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,810
He's handsome but bad-tempered,

487
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,730
so what's the use?

488
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,360
Look at your dad.

489
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,090
Although he's ugly,

490
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,440
he has a good temper.

491
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,480
Am I ugly?

492
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,120
Being ugly is good.

493
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,440
It's safer.

494
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,130
Luckily, my daughter has my genes.

495
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,570
Yes,

496
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,730
the daughter takes after her mom.

497
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,880
By the way, Xia Mo,

498
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,290
is there a market nearby?

499
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,170
Our fridge is empty.

500
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,760
I'll go out and buy some groceries,

501
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,930
so we can cook later.

502
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:13,570
Yes,

503
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,300
I'll take you there.

504
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,680
Okay, let's go together.

505
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,490
Mom.

506
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,360
If I tell Qin Xiang,

507
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,000
will he think too much into it?

508
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,360
Xia Mo

509
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,810
always causes me trouble.

510
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,570
What's wrong?

511
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,330
You don't like the food?

512
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,960
Let's order something else.

513
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,440
No, it's good.

514
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,930
I'm on a diet at night,

515
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,920
so I don't eat much.

516
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,930
How about

517
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,600
we go watch a movie after dinner?

518
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,730
Maybe not today.

519
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,880
I have a date with Xia Xia.

520
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,970
I'm going to stay at her place tonight.

521
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,120
Okay.

522
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,490
I'll give you a ride.

523
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,240
You're the best.

524
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,360
Next time.

525
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,400
I'll definitely watch a movie with you next time.

526
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,520
My mom's cooking smells delicious.

527
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,640
Eat more if you like it.

528
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,210
Bring me a plate.

529
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,250
Coming.

530
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,400
Starlight and I are at the door.

531
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,800
Find a way to distract your parents.

532
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,450
I'll take him back to the basement.

533
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,100
Mom and Dad,

534
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,130
you just arrived today.

535
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,020
How about I show you around

536
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,620
my bedroom?

537
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,810
The food is ready.

538
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,980
Let's eat first.

539
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,320
Yes, eat it while it's hot.

540
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,080
Right.

541
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,490
Brother, are you unhappy?

542
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,370
You can have some sweets

543
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,480
to improve your mood.

544
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,170
No.

545
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,360
Don't think too much.

546
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,380
But your expression

547
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,370
has betrayed you.

548
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,450
Is it because of Sister?

549
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,650
I tested

550
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,840
Xia Mo's attitude towards me today.

551
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,160
She doesn't want to accept me.

552
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,970
-What?
-What's wrong?

553
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,120
There's a rat.

554
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,570
Where is the rat?

555
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,440
It ran to the bathroom.

556
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,170
Why is there a rat

557
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,010
in this house?

558
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:54,760
Yeah,

559
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,810
this building is low and humid.

560
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,410
Rats appear easily.

561
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,540
Dad, take a look.

562
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,260
Dad.

563
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,620
You think your dad can catch rats?

564
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,700
He can't even kill mosquitoes.

565
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,260
Yes.

566
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,130
Mom, you're the best.

567
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:04,940
Let me do it.

568
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,210
Where is the rat?

569
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:06,890
Let me do it.

570
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,530
Look, the rat!

571
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,130
I think Sister

572
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,400
misunderstood your words.

573
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,080
Even if that was a misunderstanding,

574
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,360
what about now?

575
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,300
Why didn't she

576
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,610
tell her parents directly?

577
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,520
Is it embarrassing?

578
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,260
Didn't you

579
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,690
help cover up her lie?

580
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,370
I'm just afraid that confessing my identity

581
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,480
will cause more problems.

582
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,520
Tell me.

583
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,180
If her parents

584
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,080
are greedy people

585
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:27,820
and find out

586
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,200
I'm the CEO of the Shen Group,

587
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:30,810
won't they want to get money from me?

588
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:31,850
Right?

589
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,340
Brother,

590
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,240
you're really bad at lying.

591
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,520
Your unhappiness

592
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,840
is because

593
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,560
Sister didn't confess it to her parents.

594
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,530
My analysis is

595
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,970
Sister just feels like

596
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,000
she was caught red-handed.

597
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,400
Caught red-handed?

598
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,560
Is it because she likes me,

599
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,420
so she didn't dare

600
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,730
confess to her parents?

601
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,360
Why do you think

602
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,540
she feels that way?

603
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,090
Because Sister

604
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,370
didn't tell her parents beforehand

605
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,720
that she's living with you.

606
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,300
Wait.

607
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,130
Get out of the way.

608
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:08,860
Where did it go?

609
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,650
No, no, no.

610
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,130
Really?

611
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,650
Look in there,

612
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,180
in the corner.

613
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,970
I saw it again.

614
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,260
[Xia Mo: They've been diverted, come quickly]

615
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,320
Let's go.

616
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,120
Wait.

617
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,500
Where is it?

618
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,690
It's on the left. Hurry up.

619
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,660
You scared me.

620
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,810
Xia, hurry up.

621
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,940
I'm looking for it.

622
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,020
Over there, Dad.

623
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,050
It's not there.

624
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,160
I'll go get the flashlight.

625
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,860
Mom,

626
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,020
I saw

627
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,810
another big rat.

628
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,930
So scary.

629
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,570
Xia, hurry up.

630
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,340
Where is it?

631
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,520
Another one went in.

632
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,680
You scared my daughter.

633
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,690
Did you catch it?

634
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,330
Mom, I'm fine now.

635
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,610
I'll go get the flashlight.

636
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,840
It's in the kitchen.

637
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,730
Okay.

638
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,840
Thankfully you didn't get discovered.

639
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,780
Otherwise, Xia Mo

640
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,800
will have to think of another excuse.

641
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,480
Brother,

642
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,820
I realized

643
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,080
you've become more interesting

644
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,640
after meeting Sister.

645
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,560
What do you mean?

646
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,210
You're not as cold

647
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,600
as when I first met you.

648
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,770
This only means

649
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:20,850
she caused me

650
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,720
to lose my self-control.

651
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,300
I can't even

652
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:23,970
control my emotions anymore.

653
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,090
Don't worry, Brother.

654
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,680
You will date Sister in the future.

655
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,880
The future is uncertain.

656
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,160
If we don't end up together,

657
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,680
I can only say I don't want any regrets.

658
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:37,970
I'm going upstairs.

659
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,640
Put on your shoes

660
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,760
and recharge.

661
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,090
Right now, the probability

662
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,120
of them ending up together

663
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,250
is 79.83 percent.

664
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:54,740
How long will it take

665
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,000
to reach 100 percent?

666
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,640
Xia,

667
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,320
this rat

668
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,050
really scared our daughter today.

669
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,050
Tomorrow morning,

670
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,450
buy some rat poison

671
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,770
and put some

672
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,730
in every corner.

673
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,400
I bet it'll get rid of the rat.

674
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,720
Don't worry, boss.

675
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,360
Tang Tang is back.

676
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,010
Tang Tang.

677
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:16,800
Xia Xia.

678
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,320
Hello, Uncle and Aunt.

679
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,570
Hello.

680
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,560
Why did you bring him here?

681
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,650
He knows I'm staying here

682
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,450
tonight,

683
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,640
so he wanted to drive me here.

684
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,280
Does he know?

685
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,970
Of course not.

686
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,340
We just got together yesterday

687
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,600
and you did this to me today.

688
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,960
Won't it be a big turn-off?

689
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:35,890
But...

690
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:36,380
Miss Xia,

691
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,820
why don't you go inside to chat?

692
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,930
I'll take my leave.

693
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,580
Okay.

694
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,720
Thank you. Bye.

695
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,200
Tang Tang, Xia.

696
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,360
This is...

697
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,330
This is my colleague.

698
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,260
Colleague?

699
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,520
Why don't you

700
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,730
ask your colleague to come inside?

701
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,450
Hello, Aunt.

702
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,010
You're eating a family dinner,

703
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,160
so I won't disturb you all.

704
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:53,900
Yes.

705
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,680
No need to act so polite.

706
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,150
It's just a simple meal.

707
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,050
Come on.

708
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:57,880
Come in.

709
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,010
Come in.

710
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,540
Don't worry. Take a seat.

711
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,360
Listen to me.

712
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,440
Shen.

713
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:06,460
Aunt.

714
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,660
Where did you

715
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,570
come from?

716
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,500
When I came back,

717
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:09,970
you were all busy.

718
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:10,640
I guess you didn't see me.

719
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,810
Shen...

720
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,170
Mr. Qin, long time no see.

721
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,490
The meal is ready.

722
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,770
Wash your hands and eat.

723
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:24,600
Okay.

724
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,480
Xia Xia and I will go wash our hands.

725
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,120
Xia.

726
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,580
-Go get two chairs.
-Sit.

727
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,770
Okay, right away.

728
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,890
Let me tell you.

729
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,220
my happiness and joy

730
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:34,740
might

731
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,250
get destroyed by you.

732
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,250
No.

733
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:37,900
How about this?

734
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,200
Text Qin Xiang.

735
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,450
At this critical moment,

736
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,640
we can't hide it anymore.

737
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,700
Let me tell you.

738
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,450
If Qin Xiang gets mad at me,

739
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,140
you and Shen Junyao

740
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,690
have to explain it for me.

741
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,200
Of course.

742
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,250
[Qin Xiang Darling]

743
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,360
Don’t just sit there.

744
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,050
Let's eat. The dishes are getting cold.

745
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:39,920
Yes.

746
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,160
We're all family here.

747
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,160
It's just a simple meal. Help yourself.

748
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,400
Come on.

749
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,130
Cheers to all of you.

750
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,260
Thank you

751
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,880
for taking care of Xia Mo.

752
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,090
Thank you, everyone.

753
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,120
Young man,

754
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,530
how old are you?

755
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,240
I'm almost 30 this year.

756
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,290
What do you do in the company?

757
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,240
I work as the general manager's secretary.

758
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,290
Secretary?

759
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,330
Mom, why are you looking at me?

760
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:20,860
Don't you know

761
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,010
why I'm looking at you?

762
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,200
Look at Tang Tang.

763
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,360
She's smart, sensible,

764
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,010
and well-dressed since she was a kid.

765
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,880
Then look at you.

766
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,320
You dress like a little girl.

767
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,580
Tang Tang

768
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,090
has a boyfriend already.

769
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,330
What about you?

770
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,520
Tang Tang,

771
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,160
I wish you and Shen happiness.

772
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,040
Thank you.

773
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,250
Thank you.

774
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,840
I'm not interested in gossip.

775
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,360
But I want to remind you

776
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,340
not to

777
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,290
get hurt again.

778
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,040
Don't worry, Mr. Shen.

779
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,480
Tang Tang is definitely not...

780
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,520
Who?

781
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,570
Tang Jinxuan.

782
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,720
You slept with Xia Mo's best friend?

783
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,610
Mr. Shen,

784
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,640
why do you feel anxious

785
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,460
about me

786
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,890
sleeping with Tang Tang?

787
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,000
I'm not.

788
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,250
I'm thirsty.

789
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,330
I didn't drink water all afternoon.

790
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,200
Let's eat.

791
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Eat something.

792
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,000
Come on. I'm hungry.

793
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,800
Mr. Qin, have some vegetables.

794
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,640
Help yourself.

795
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,760
Mr. Shen,

796
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,320
you too.

797
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,000
Delicious!

798
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,890
Danika,

799
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,260
how is the relationship

800
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,810
between Xia

801
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:32,720
and Junyao?

802
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,010
Starlight said

803
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:34,890
the probability of them being together

804
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:35,260
is already

805
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,010
79.83 percent.

806
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,860
He is

807
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,010
working towards 100 percent.

808
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,730
Starlight is really good.

809
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,920
President,

810
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,620
I don't think

811
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,520
they can reach 100 percent anymore.

812
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:48,920
What do you mean?

813
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,660
Miss Xia's parents

814
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,010
have arrived in Zhenhai.

815
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:51,780
They're currently

816
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,930
in Mr. Shen's villa.

817
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:53,480
What?
