You need to be punished.

195
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,020
Yes.

196
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:07,850
No way.

197
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,970
She was talking to me.

198
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,600
Xia Mo.

199
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,430
Since you're here for team building,

200
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,180
you must

201
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,220
completely

202
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,420
fit in.

203
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,630
Am I right?

204
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,590
Right.

205
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,040
This is inappropriate.

206
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,250
Now, Miss Tang.

207
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,540
Truth or Dare.

208
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,660
Choose one.

209
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,540
I'll choose...

210
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,240
Let me do it.

211
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,570
I'm ok with the choices.

212
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,740
OK.

213
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,320
Mr. Qin saved the beauty.

214
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Truth or Dare.

215
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,350
Which one?

216
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,100
Dare.

217
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,679
OK.

218
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,179
Brave.

219
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,880
The challenge is

220
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,580
choosing one person here...

221
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,040
What?

222
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,240
To confess!

223
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,660
Confess! Confess! Confess!

224
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,780
Confess! Confess! Confess!

225
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,980
Hurry up.

226
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,560
Tang Tang.

227
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:04,890
I...

228
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,920
I was wrong last night.

229
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,630
Last night?

230
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,920
What happened last night?

231
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,910
♫Looking at the stars in the sky♫

232
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,040
Actually,

233
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,120
what I want to say is

234
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,820
♫The blues are suddenly gone♫

235
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,240
that I've been really happy

236
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,780
since I met you.

237
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,070
♫When you close your eyes♫

238
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,520
I miss you every day.

239
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,190
♫Whose figure is it?♫

240
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,900
You're doing a challenge.

241
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,640
♫Are you not sleeping either♫

242
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:28,470
Your challenge

243
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,720
is to talk to me?

244
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,430
Yeah

245
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,920
♫Thinking of someone too?♫

246
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,010
No.

247
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:42,030
♫I like to bicker with you for no reason♫

248
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:35,920
Yes.

249
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,040
Every time I talk to you,

250
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,580
it is a challenge for me.

251
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,990
But it's not a game.

252
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,190
♫This time I miss you♫

253
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,110
I really like you.

254
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,190
♫I confess♫

255
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,890
♫Meeting you might've been an accident♫

256
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,600
I'm really afraid of losing you,

257
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,880
♫But I anticipate it every day♫

258
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,300
even if...

259
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,670
even if sometimes I...

260
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:06,620
♫I confess my love to you♫

261
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,840
Did he finish the challenge?

262
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:03,920
Yes.

263
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,540
It's done.

264
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,370
Well.

265
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:11,110
♫I can no longer pretend I'm not in love♫

266
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,030
I drank too much.

267
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,950
I'm going to bed now.

268
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,150
-Have fun.
-Tang Tang.

269
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,940
D-Don't leave.

270
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,560
♫I'm relying on you unconsciously♫

271
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,400
I'm leaving too. I'm leaving.

272
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,360
Mr. Qin.

273
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,730
Drink your beer.

274
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,520
L-Let's continue.

275
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,220
Cheers.

276
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,680
Tang Tang, I'm not lying.

277
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,760
I lost my phone.

278
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,220
I came even

279
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,220
without installing the windshield.

280
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,340
You bought a new phone

281
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,000
and repaired your motorcycle.

282
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,840
You can say

283
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,250
whatever you want.

284
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:28,960
I have evidence.

285
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,460
Wait.

286
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,280
See?

287
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,650
I didn't even have time

288
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,610
to install the windshield

289
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,360
before I came to you.

290
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,730
I didn't want you to be angry.

291
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,270
I was worried about you for so long.

292
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,800
And you lied to me that you weren't feeling well.

293
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,890
Anyway,

294
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,720
I'm just unhappy now.

295
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,800
What should I do?

296
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,250
Isn't it written in the Book of Love?

297
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,120
I've never been in the car

298
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,780
with no windshield.

299
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,200
Drive me around.

300
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,320
Let me experience it.

301
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,940
Don't experience it.

302
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,270
There's nothing to experience.

303
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,100
It's cold.

304
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,190
Very cold.

305
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,140
Tang Tang.

306
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,640
Women are mostly passive.

307
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,010
When you meet someone you like,

308
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,010
you should confess your love first.

309
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,250
Confess my love?

310
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,610
Nuan, you've got hidden talent.

311
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,860
One more.

312
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,110
One more. One more.

313
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,020
Shen Junyao.

314
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,390
You are here.

315
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,090
Where are Qin Xiang and Miss Tang?

316
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,090
They left.

317
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,170
I guess Qin Xiang went to cheer her up.

318
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,540
Well,

319
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
let's start the next round.

320
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,030
Okay.

321
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,910
OK. Come on.

322
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,280
What's the rush? I'll dance.

323
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,570
Go on. Don't mind me.

324
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,850
L-Let's eat something first.

325
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,640
Okay. Eat.

326
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,140
Xia Mo.

327
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,300
Do you still want to be here?

328
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,800
I have nothing to do.

329
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,460
I'm just feeling the vibe.

330
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,750
Come with me.

331
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,330
I have something to tell you.

332
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,490
Wait for me.

333
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,400
Bye, Mr. Shen.

334
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,440
Mr. Shen.

335
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,300
Why don't you dance?

336
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,050
Go on!

337
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:00,930
Come on. One more dance.

338
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,090
Why don't you dance?

339
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,130
Come on.

340
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:04,880
Let's drink.

341
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,270
Why did you

342
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,350
ask me here?

343
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,300
I...

344
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,300
I have something to tell you.

345
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,290
Go ahead.

346
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,610
What I said to you

347
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,820
in the archive room that day.

348
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,400
That was not what I meant.

349
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,150
Then...

350
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,890
then what do you mean?

351
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,720
I want to say

352
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,630
I think...

353
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,900
It's late.

354
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,390
Go back and go to bed early.

355
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:15,890
You...

356
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,630
What do you mean?

357
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,420
I'm so angry.

358
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,500
How could there be

359
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,960
such a romance killer in this world?

360
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,950
What was he trying to say?

361
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,570
Was he going to confess to me?

362
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,950
I thought it was

363
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,530
so obvious.

364
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,440
He said

365
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,730
it would be cold.

366
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,390
He told me not to get in the car.

367
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:39,850
But why

368
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,810
he didn't say it in the end?

369
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,840
Do you think

370
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,380
he's a Knobhead?

371
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,500
Xia Mo.

372
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,660
Xia Mo.

373
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,370
I'm talking to you.

374
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,660
Why are you spacing out?

375
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,820
Why didn't you comfort me

376
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,940
when I was angry?

377
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,110
I...

378
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,810
I didn't hear it just now.

379
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,060
Xia Xia.

380
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,060
Were you thinking about Shen Junyao?

381
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,590
We are two

382
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,510
miserable girls.

383
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,420
We are

384
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,840
thinking about men here.

385
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,790
I heard that

386
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,870
there's no romance killer

387
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,700
in this world.

388
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,740
It's just that he doesn't love you that much.

389
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,070
Don't say that.

390
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,980
At least Qin Xiang likes you.

391
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
How do you know?

392
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,900
I see it.

393
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,770
And you

394
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,770
like him, right?

395
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,010
This is my first time

396
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,140
seeing you

397
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,010
care so much about a man.

398
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,170
I take every relationship

399
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,460
seriously, okay?

400
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,670
Okay. Okay.

401
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,290
But

402
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,120
you can even feel

403
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
whether I'm serious about my relationship.

404
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,280
Why can't you feel

405
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,780
how Shen Junyao feels about you?

406
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,730
How does he feel about me?

407
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,230
He likes you.

408
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,220
Based on

409
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,850
my extensive experience

410
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,180
of this.

411
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,800
There's no problem

412
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,170
for me to figure it out.

413
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,330
I knew it

414
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,210
when we were eating today.

415
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,710
He was looking at you.

416
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,200
And,

417
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,900
when you were playing the three-legged race,

418
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,070
he kept laughing

419
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,560
when you held him.

420
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,970
We win. We're number one.

421
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,550
Also,

422
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,210
you almost fell down last time.

423
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,880
Shen Junyao couldn't even take care of the game

424
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,420
and went to see you.

425
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,120
Xia Mo.

426
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,370
I'm fine.

427
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,780
Well,

428
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,860
why hasn't Qin Xiang looked for you?

429
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,860
How do you know he is not here?

430
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,720
Tang Tang.

431
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,250
Tang Tang.

432
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,960
Tang Tang. Tang Tang.

433
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,540
It's not what you think...

434
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,619
Miss Xia is here.

435
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,950
I-I...

436
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,410
No need.

437
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,569
You guys continue.

438
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,240
I'll go find

439
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,859
Shen Junyao.

440
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:29,950
[94: The incipience love sees only life, and the continuous love sees eternity

96: You must pretend to be generous in front of your girlfriend]

441
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,260
Hello?

442
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,010
Brother.

443
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,380
I was about to call you.

444
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,540
How was it?

445
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,000
How was it with Sister today?

446
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,660
It's not bad.

447
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,240
The bracelet shows

448
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,030
your emotion index is not high.

449
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,110
Sister is a little anxious.

450
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,440
Did you fail

451
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,560
to confess your love to her?

452
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:08,680
How did you know?

453
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,140
After I checked the chat history

454
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:10,930
in the archive room,

455
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,010
I guessed that

456
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,470
you would confess your love

457
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,970
to her again at the team building party.

458
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,630
Am I right?

459
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,200
I was going to confess,

460
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,910
but I didn't have time to say it.

461
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,740
Why?

462
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,190
Did her friend call her away?

463
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,770
I saw Chen Xiangyun.

464
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,930
It's the team building of Stantech.

465
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,470
Why is Chen Xiangyun here?

466
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,050
I also want to know

467
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,880
why she is here.

468
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,000
Chen Xiangyun is your ex-girlfriend.

469
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,920
Her sudden appearance.

470
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,460
Whatever the reason for that is,

471
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,370
if Sister

472
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,660
knows her identity,

473
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,080
she'll think too much.

474
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,110
Starlight.

475
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,440
What do you think I should do?

476
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,770
According to the search engine,

477
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,310
with your current situation,

478
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,720
you should

479
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,350
talk to Chen Xiangyun

480
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,300
to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.

481
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,930
Although you can't

482
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,050
confess your love to her in time,

483
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,750
at least you need to stop

484
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,840
people to affect

485
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,960
your love.

486
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,500
Okay.

487
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,950
I know what to do.

488
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:30,640
[96: You must pretend to be generous in front of your girlfriend]

489
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:49,980
Junyao.

490
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,270
It's really you.

491
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,970
The receptionist just called me

492
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,100
to say you would come to see me.

493
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,220
I was quite surprised.

494
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,430
Come in.

495
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,340
I'll get you a cup of coffee.

496
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,010
No need.

497
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,080
Then what do

498
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,700
you want?

499
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,160
Don't tell me

500
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,780
you just want to see me?

501
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,900
I'm just curious.

502
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:13,900
Why did I see you

503
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,110
at our team building hotel?

504
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,060
Shouldn't you be abroad now?

505
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,890
I didn't expect you to care about me.

506
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,720
But I don't think

507
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,760
you can control

508
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,970
whether I go back to China or not.

509
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:26,710
Okay.

510
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,420
Let me ask you another way.

511
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,580
Why did you

512
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,580
stay in this hotel?

513
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,080
I have lived in this hotel

514
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,700
since I came back.

515
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,570
As for the coincidence,

516
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,360
it might be fate.

517
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,940
Whether it's a coincidence or not,

518
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,270
I hope you understand

519
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,980
that I have someone I like now.

520
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,930
Please don't disturb

521
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:45,930
Xia Mo's life.

522
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,180
Junyao.

523
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,220
After all, we were once together.

524
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,420
I helped you get a big deal

525
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,630
after I came back.

526
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,290
Do you have to be so ungrateful?

527
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,000
I don't want to talk about the past anymore.

528
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,950
I can quit this deal.

529
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:00,950
But if I know

530
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,530
you did something bad

531
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,740
for Xia Mo,

532
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,320
you'll be responsible for the consequences.

533
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,940
Shen Junyao.

534
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,190
you've changed.

535
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,850
Don't worry.

536
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,050
I didn't follow you and Miss Xia.

537
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,010
I won't do

538
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,010
anything else.

539
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,750
I've moved on.

540
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,830
That's good.

541
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,370
Junyao.

542
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,570
And

543
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,110
our relationship

544
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,820
is not close enough

545
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,320
to let you call me that.

546
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,350
Please behave yourself.

547
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,660
Could it be

548
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,900
the thing that Tang Tang said?

549
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,940
But I don't know

550
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,730
if he is going to confess to me.

551
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,100
It's fine if he is.

552
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,680
If it's not,

553
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,380
it's like I think too much.

554
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,700
Xia Mo.

555
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,990
Why don't you stay in the room

556
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,530
but walk around in the corridor?

557
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,650
Well,

558
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,310
Qin Xiang came to Tang Tang's room.

559
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,100
It's inappropriate

560
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,430
if I'm here.

561
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,590
Well,

562
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,220
go to my room

563
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,010
and take a rest.

564
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,020
I just boiled some hot water.

565
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,850
I'll get you some.

566
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,230
It's not that hot now.

567
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,840
Here, have some.

568
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
Xia Mo, don't move.

569
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,790
What's wrong?

570
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,750
I just saw

571
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,790
there was a cockroach beside the computer.

572
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,660
I was afraid you'd be scared.

573
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,740
Cockroach.

574
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,240
Thank you.

575
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,400
Actually,

576
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,900
I'm not afraid of cockroaches.

577
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,300
