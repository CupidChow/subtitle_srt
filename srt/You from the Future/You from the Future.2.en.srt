I'm not hungry.

579
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,610
As long as you like these dishes.

580
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,280
Yes.

581
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,840
I'm really hungry.

582
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,120
I'm sorry.

583
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,840
I didn't expect you to be a foodie.

584
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,000
Of course,

585
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,410
I'm talented.

586
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,750
Mr. Shen, I'm sorry

587
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,520
for keeping you waiting.

588
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,970
It's okay. I just arrived.

589
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:35,930
Have a seat.

590
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:46,890
Mr. Huang.

591
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,320
This is...

592
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,360
This is Tang Jinxuan, Miss Tang.

593
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,610
Let me introduce,

594
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,280
this is my girlfriend.

595
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,970
Xia Mo.

596
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,640
Mr. Shen,

597
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,610
I didn't expect you to have a girlfriend

598
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,120
with such a full schedule.

599
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,090
I didn't want to make it public,

600
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,370
but now that the reporter found this,

601
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,400
then there's no need to hide it.

602
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,330
But the news will be over soon.

603
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,420
The president

604
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,410
will be very happy

605
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,360
if he knows this.

606
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,560
He hasn't contacted me yet.

607
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,880
I guess he didn't know it.

608
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,490
Hello, President.

609
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,330
Is everything going well?

610
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,600
As you ordered,

611
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,140
I'm trying to get Mr. Shen

612
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,530
and Miss Xia together.

613
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,660
Not only did you propose

614
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,280
a three-month couple contract,

615
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,880
but also stopped him

616
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,250
to sue those entertainment reporters.

617
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,090
Good job.

618
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,080
The past

619
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,770
was too much for him.

620
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,130
Even now,

621
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,010
he still doesn't believe

622
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,320
in a relationship between a man and a woman.

623
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,520
Don't worry.

624
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,020
The smart computer will help the master

625
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,160
to heal his heart.

626
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,320
I just have one grandson.

627
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,570
He does not make it easy for me.

628
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,840

Creater of smart computer(Danilk): Shen Kun]
