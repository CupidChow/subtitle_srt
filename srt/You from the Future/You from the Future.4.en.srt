00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,530
Yes.

196
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,400
That's the name.

197
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,680
That's his girlfriend.

198
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,200
Do they have a conflict?

199
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,490
It's normal

200
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,530
for a couple to bicker.

201
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,610
But

202
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,610
as you're so thoughtful,

203
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,700
shouldn't you

204
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,600
help your brother?

205
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,600
Help?

206
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,840
Why are you so slow-witted?

207
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,490
Your IQ and EQ

208
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,200
are not as good as Danika's.

209
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,960
Okay, I got it.

210
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,240
I'll talk to you at the office.

211
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,570
You need to care more about him.

212
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:09,970
Grandpa,

213
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,530
I have something to deal with in the company.

214
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,560
I'll visit you another day.

215
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,200
Okay.

216
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,130
Get back to work.

217
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,170
You must pay attention

218
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,160
to T5's launch event.

219
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,770
Besides,

T9

221
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,920
still needs to be improved.

222
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,690
Especially in terms of EQ.

223
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:22,690
Improve it.

224
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,810
Go.

How's your work,

227
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,370
my little babe Xia Xia?

228
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,080
Although I'm tired,

229
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,480
I'm happy.

230
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,770
I'm working hard.

231
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,250
Dear Tang Tang,

232
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,480

can you run an errand for me?

236

Fetch my luggage.

237
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,050
I'll stay at your place tonight.

238

What's wrong?

245
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,220
Do you have an eyebrow pencil?

246
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:33,930
Lend it to me.

247
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,800
It's urgent.

248
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,920
Eyebrow pencil?

What do you need it for?

250
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,140
Don't ask so much.

251
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:38,780
Do you have it?

Hurry up and lend it to me.

That's not important.

Are you done using the eyebrow pencil?

This won't do.

302
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,050
What's the use of just shouting?

303
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,240
Go there and ask for an autograph.

You caused trouble on your first day at work.

318

Are you done with your work?

319
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,250
Does the company hire you

320
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,690
to pay for you to be a fangirl?

321
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:48,740
I...

322
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,520
What?

323
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,960
You are the loudest in the whole company.

325
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,170
Go back to work.

326
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,570
Let's go.

327
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,160
You had a bad fall.

328
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,610
Are you really okay?

329
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,400
I'm fine.

330
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,530
I'm going to work.

331
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,970
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin Heng.

332

I'm sorry.

334
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,810
No.

335
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,810
Everyone is cute

336
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:16,640
and passionate.

337
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,810
Let's talk in the office.

338
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,280
Our boss is waiting for you.

339
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,320
This way.

340
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,850
Mr. Lin Heng,

341
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,140
you are the most popular star

342
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:24,930
on Candy.

343
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,240
I've been longing to meet you for so long.

344
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,600
You flatter me.

345
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,970
I'm just an internet celebrity not worth mentioning.

346
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,000
You dominate our front page

347
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,900
every few days.

348
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,800
How can you say you're not worth mentioning?

349
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,480
You're being too humble.

350
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,410
Fine.

351
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,400
Let's not joke around anymore.

352
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,170
First of all,

353
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,300
welcome to

354
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,250
to join Candy.

355
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,520
I hope we can

356
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,170
have a better cooperation

357
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,440
in the field of content output.

358
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,560
Of course.

359
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,650
By the way,

360
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,940
I saw a girl

361
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,010
at the door.

362
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,440
I felt familiar.

363
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,200
After thinking about it,

364
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,060
I've seen her several times

365
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,170
at the Hanfu Exhibition.

366
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,340
What's her name?

367
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,120
Which department does she work in?

368
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,680
She seems to be called…

369
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,930
Xia Mo.

370
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,600
Xia Mo?

371
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,480
She must be new here.

372
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,100
I remember Director Liao

373
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,080
mentioned her once.

374
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,090
She's very good at

375
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,450
the content about Hanfu

376
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,160
and ACGN of ancient China.

377
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,180
Plus, she's an employee

378
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,080
of Candy.

379
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,660
When we shoot the videos,

380
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,960
if she's there,

381
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,480
I think the effect will be better.

382
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,410
No problem.

383
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,360
I'll arrange Xia Mo

384
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,360
to shoot with you.

385
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,640
Thank you.

386
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,370
You're welcome.

387
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:33,980
I think Mr. Lin Heng

388
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,880
is more handsome than in the video.

389
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,300
And I think he is super nice.

390
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,280
Don't you think...

391
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,360
Yes, he's so gentle.

392
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,250
Hush.

393
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,320
Xia Mo.

394
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,000
Hello, Mr. Cheng.

395
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,460
Later,

396
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,600
Mr. Lin Heng will go to the studio to shoot.

397
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,720
Go with him.

398
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,020
Are you asking me to be in charge of

399
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,920
Mr. Lin Heng's video shooting?

400
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,290
Did I hear it right?

401
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,480
Yes, it's you.

402
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,690
Is there a problem?

403
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,720
No, no.

404
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,640
No problem at all.

405
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:03,980
OK.

406
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,119
I'll leave it to you then.

407
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,119
Work hard.

408
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,599
Don't embarrass the company.

409
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,839
Leave it to me.

410
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,000
I promise I'll complete the mission.

411
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:21,290
What kind of luck is this?

412
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,440
She is the Goddess of Fortune herself!

413
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,650
Not only does she have a domineering CEO,

414
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,359
but she's also favored by the perfect prince charming.

415
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,800
Jealousy makes me grimace.

416
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,080
Xia Mo, treat us to something good.

417
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,930
Yes, you must.

418
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,100
-Yes.
-Let me inhale some of your luck.

419
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,050
Inhale.

420
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,000
My treat.

421
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,610
Order whatever coffee you want.

422
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,490
Wait for me.

423
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,340
Thank you.

424
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:38,970
Thank you.

425
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,060
Ten lattes are ready.

426
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,640
Take care.

427
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,360
Thank you.

428
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,280
Lin Heng!

429
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:04,890
Shh.

430
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,480
I'm not very famous,

431
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,800
but near Candy,

432
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,450
some people can recognize me.

433
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,670
Miss Xia,

434
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,680
show some mercy.

435
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,400
Mr. Lin Heng,

436
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,120
what would you like to drink?

437
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,920
I'll buy you coffee.

438
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,070
Because of me,

439
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,410
you're already buying coffee for your colleagues.

440
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,330
How could I

441
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,360
ask you to buy me drinks too?

442
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,880
Hello.

443
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,040
Two cups of latte.

444
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,290
Drink here.

445
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,040
Okay.

446
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,840
If you're not busy,

447
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,800
have a coffee before you go up, okay?

448
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,520
Sure.

449
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,490
Because the human-machine interaction

450
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,750
has iterated,

451
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,060
T5's production costs more

452
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,090
than the last generation.

453
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:43,700
What does QOP think

454
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,640
about this?

455
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,850
We've read T5's promotional information.

456
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,200
Currently,

457
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,120
T5's target users

458
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,810
are younger than those of T4.

459
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,720
So we need to

460
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,640
let more young people

461
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,760
know about it.

462
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,210
Ask self-media to evaluate it.

463
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,060
In this way,

464
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,900
we can achieve the advertising effect

465
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,850
of person-to-person spread.

466
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,240
So,

467
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,330
you want to release otoMADs

468
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,280
on Candy?

469
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,080
Yes.

470
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,090
You mentioned Candy last time,

471
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:06,930
so we especially

472
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,780
learned about

473
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,800
the website.

474
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,640
Use the otoMADs

475
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,340
that young people love the most

476
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,520
and that Candy is the best at

477
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,040
as a carrier of content output.

478
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,700
But the plan

479
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,120
is still underway.

480
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,620
We will give you

481
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,520
a satisfying answer.

482
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,080
I wake up early

483
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,810
to embrace the sun.

484
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,520
Make my body

485
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,170
full of sunlight.

486
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,920
The corners of your mouth going down,

487
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,480
you'll lose your direction.

488
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,200
The corners of your mouth going up,

489
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,760
you'll be full of hope.

490
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,210
This plan is approved.

491
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,450
You need to speed up

492
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,420
the cooperation with Candy.

493
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,760
I need to see the proposal as soon as possible.

494
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,730
Did I delay your work?

495
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,840
No, no.

496
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,250
I'm new here.

497
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,410
I don't have much work.

498
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,490
Mr. Lin Heng,

499
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,570
can I have your autograph?

500
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,560
Of course.

501
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,490
Okay.

502
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,160
My prince charming is so excellent.

503
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,920
He is so nice,

504
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,560
and he's such a gentleman.

505
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,410
Excuse me,

506
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,650
can you give this photo

507
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,650
to me?

508
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,010
Sure, of course.

509
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,810
Thank you.

510
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,640
Your name is Xia Mo,

511
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,130
right?

512
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,080
You remember my name!

513
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,770
Thank you, Mr. Lin Heng.

514
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,360
I heard your colleague calling you once.

515
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,400
Xia Mo.

516
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,400
I think

517
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,280
you are a special girl.

518
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,500
I saw you several times

519
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,400
at the Hanfu Exhibition.

520
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,880
In your eyes,

521
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,560
I could see your passion for Hanfu

522
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,690
and the ancient style.

523
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,760
So,

524
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,440
I had a deep impression of you.

525
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,570
I wanted to get to know you.

526
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,960
You met me before?

527
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,120
Actually,

528
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,640
I've been learning how to design Hanfu.

529
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,410
But there are no models.

530
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,560
Plus, many of the designs are concept ones.

531
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,440
So it's hard to make them real.

532
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,200
If you're willing,

533
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,000
I can be your model.

534
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,360
May I have your contact information?

535
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,010
I'll scan your QR code.

536
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,020
Mr. Qin,

537
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,530
your ring looks nice.

538
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,680
You're such a gentleman.

539
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,200
Your wife must be very happy.

540
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,160
We just divorced

541
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,650
recently.

542
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,040
Really?

543
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,370
You're so handsome.

544
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,080
Who doesn't cherish it?

545
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,010
Who can be certain

546
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,720
about a relationship?

547
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,460
I can be certain

548
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,760
about it.

549
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,000
Mr. Qin,

550
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,970
thank you for coming.

551
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,560
It's okay.

552
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,490
It's what I should do.

553
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,730
Miss Tang, you're welcome.

554
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,330
Come in and have some water.

555
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,200
No, no, no.

556
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,970
I have a lot of work to do.

557
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,060
I won't disturb you.

558
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,820
I'm leaving.

559
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,560
Bye.

560
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,330
Am I not charming anymore?

561
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,720
Or is he too slow?

562
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,760
Am I not pretty?

563
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,610
I look very pretty.

564
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,400
I'm sorry.

565
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,260
You spend too much

566
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,090
because of me.

567
00:22:59,090 --> 00:22:59,960
Don't say that.

568
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,260
Let alone 10 cups,

569
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,320
even 100 cups…

570
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,720
100 cups are a bit expensive.

571
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,250
Even 20 cups,

572
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,140
I'm willing to.

573
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,730
If it's 100 cups, I'll buy them for you.

574
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,200
I won't send you upstairs.

575
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,530
Be careful.

576
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,880
Take care.

577
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,680
Shen Junyao.

578
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,810
Why are you here?

579
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,000
Who was that man?

580
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,210
Expert Lin Heng.

581
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,100
He is the person

582
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,330
whose photo you used as the wallpaper of your phone.

583
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,360
I didn't expect you to get

584
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,400
what you wanted after coming to Candy.

585
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,720
I am lucky.

586
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,320
Don't pull a long face.

587
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,740
We're just a contract couple.

588
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,880
Even if we're a real couple,

589
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,890
you can't stop me from fangirling.

590
00:23:58,890 --> 00:23:59,720
You're so straight.

591
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,730
You might not find a girlfriend.

592
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,920
Idiot.

593
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,610
You're not a gentleman at all.

594
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,600
No one wants a boyfriend like you.

595
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,250
If you speak ill of others behind their backs,

596
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,130
keep your voice down.

597
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,300
Or else, even if you can find a boyfriend,

598
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,480
he'll break up with you.

599
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,880
I'll go back to work on it then.

600
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,240
Why is Xia Mo taking so long?

601
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,600
The coffee must be cold.

602
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,690
Didn't Lin Heng go out too?

603
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:38,860
Maybe they met

604
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,410
in the elevator.

605
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,300
Then...

606
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,220
Youyou,

607
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,810
you're too greedy.

608
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:43,580
Xia Mo already has

609
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,730
Mr. Shen of Stantech.

610
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,400
Okay?

611
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,290
They are both charming princes.

612
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,280
How can you let go easily?

613
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,200
Xia Mo.

614
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,240
You're finally back.

615
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,890
Hello, Mr. Shen.

616
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,730
Hello, Mr. Shen.

617
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,760
Sorry to keep you waiting.

618
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,560
Something happened just now.

619
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,360
Coffee.

620
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,490
Mr. Shen is so considerate.

621
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,890
You even carry coffee for Xia Xia.

622
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,600
It's what I should do.

623
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,980
Or what if it spills?

624
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,770
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

625
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,140
This guy

626
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,520
is not so fierce normally.

627
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,930
Why is he so cold to me?

628
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,400
Mr. Shen.

629
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,000
You're here.

630
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,380
Last time Director Liao told me

631
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:12,940
you had been here,

632
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,380
but I failed to…

633
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,080
T5 of Stantech will be launched soon.

634
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,680
QOP is in charge of the publicity.

635
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,740
Today we have agreed on

636
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,010
the cooperation plan today.

637
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,600
Please cooperate with us in the future.

638
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,200
Of course.

639
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,300
They have talked

640
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,240
with us before.

641
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,810
Now the Production Center.

642
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,490
and the Business Center are in charge of this together.

643
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,770
I have no problem

644
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,800
in advertising and promotion.

645
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,210
But have you decided who will be in charge

646
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,280
of making the otoMADs?

647
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,210
Well,

648
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,480
I plan to make Xia Mo do it.

649
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,130
Although she's new here,

650
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,200
I've read her resume

651
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,290
and I'm sure there's no problem.

652
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,650
Right, Xia Mo?

653
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,760
Well...

654
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,010
I...

655
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,570
I'm afraid…

656
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,680
What are you afraid of?

657
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,320
I'm afraid I can't do it well.

658
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,120
Xia Mo.

659
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,740
The company hired you

660
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,960
to train you.

661
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,290
But on the other hand,

662
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,800
we also need you to contribute to us.

663
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,770
Right?

664
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,680
Yes.

665
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,890
But the director

666
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:04,820
just asked me to be in charge of

667
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,400
Mr. Lin Heng's video shooting.

668
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,400
It will take a lot of my energy,

669
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,170
so I'm afraid I can't take care of both.

670
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,040
Then let someone else do it.

671
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,400
From now on,

672
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,090
you'll be in charge of T5's publicity.

673
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,890
How about this?

674
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,780
If Xia Mo can complete

675
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,570
the otoMADs,

676
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:21,460
let her continue her work

677
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,570
with Lin Zheng's shooting.

678
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,620
Don't let the work of Stantech

679
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,880
affect your work plan.

680
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,120
Okay, Mr. Shen.

681
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,000
I'll get going then.

682
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,810
Let me see you off.

683
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,660
This is the real version

684
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,480
of "the domineering president falling in love with me."

685
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,620
Xia Mo.

686
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,100
You're so happy.

687
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,570
You call this happy?

688
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:42,940
I had so much more work

689
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,090
for no reason.

690
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,130
No. No. No.

691
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:45,930
Xia Mo.

692
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,660
Didn't you realize

693
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,120
Mr. Shen is protecting you?

694
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,450
He saw that you were unhappy,

695
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,360
so he immediately said

696
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,660
after finishing the videos,

697
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,200
you could work for Lin Zheng.

698
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,890
He's not that kind.

699
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,290
She doesn't know how lucky she is.

700
00:26:59,290 --> 00:26:59,960

702
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,120
Hey, beauty.

Tang Tang.

704
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,720
Why are you here?

705
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,730
To celebrate our formal cohabitation.

706
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,140
Are you happy?

707
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:23,850
Are you excited?

708
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,920
Yes, I am.

709
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,210
By the way,

710
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,090
did you take my suitcase for me?

711
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,240
Qin Xiang sent it home.

712
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,970
Let's go. I'll take you to a place.

713
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,280
Where?

714
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,380
You'll know when you get there.

715
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,040
Let's talk in the car.

716
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,530
Okay.

717
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:34,940
Come on.

718
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,240
My little princess Xia Xia.

719
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,240
Come in.

720
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,010
Mr. Shen.

721
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,730
Are you off work?

722
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,640
I'll send you home.

723
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,250
Where did you get the coffee?

724
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,360
Downstairs.

00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,320
like this brand?

727
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,010
It used to be fine.

728
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,290
I don't like it anymore.

729
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,480
Send me home.

730
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,980
I'm going to bring Starlight

731
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,090
to meet my grandpa and mom tonight.

732
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:10,770
Starlight?

733
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,520
You brought T9...

734
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,260
I want him

to live a life like a normal person.

736
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,810
Don't tell anyone.

737

Understood.

738
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,980
Please give me a copy

739
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,770
of Starlight's information.

740
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:22,380
I'll backup

741
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,810
the vehicle interactive system of Starlight.

742
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,440
That way,

743
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,900
he can drive you

744
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,930
to and from work in the future.

00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,600

want me to drive you home?

Let me tell you.

770
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,760
Mr. Lin Heng

771
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,730
is so handsome.

772
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,210
Really?

773
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,970
He has a good personality.

774
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:24,650
He's well-educated,

775
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,680
and he sings well, too.

776
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,980
Then I won't be too polite.

777
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,160
I'm going to pursue him.

778
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,120
Come on.

779
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,420
If you do get him,

780
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,520
I'll be happy.

781
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,250
If he's my boyfriend,

782
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,000
why will you be so happy?

783
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,840
Because I can see him often.

784
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,610
Just seeing him is pleasant.

785
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,680
Unlike today,

786
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,100
I just accepted

787
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:40,620
the video shooting work from Mr. Lin Heng.

788
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,600
But in less than two hours,

789
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,220
I was back to my old routine.

790
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,130
Your supervisor

791
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,650
must have given you a hard time.

792
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,880
But

793
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:47,850
this time,

794
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,370
you really should thank Shen Junyao.

795
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,480
He did help me,

796
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,020
but the whole thing

797
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,760
happened because of him.

798
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,290
I really think

799
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,570
since I met Shen Junyao,

800
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,920
I've had the word "unlucky"

801
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,290
engraved on my forehead.

802
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,040
What's so unlucky?

803
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,570
You have legs.

804
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,570
If you can't finish your work,

805
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:03,960
you can sneak out.

806
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,660
There are so many fans of Lin Heng

807
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,110
in your company.

808
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,060
You're not the only one

809
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,010
who is slacking off during work.

810
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,240
What you said

811
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,320
seems to make sense.

812
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,260
Don't think too much.

813
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,200
Enjoy your meal.

814
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:20,920
Tang Tang,

815
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,360
do you

816
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,920
smell anything?

817
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,530
Is something burnt?

818
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,280
No.

819
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,930
Weird.

820
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,440
The kitchen...

821
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,250
The kitchen seems to be on fire.

822
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,540
[House of Shen]

823
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,570
Mom.

824
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,340
From the day I started to

825
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,450
design Starlight,

826
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,700
I've taken him

827
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,880
as my own little brother.

828
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,290
Mom.

829
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,240
Good boy.

830
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,840
Starlight.

831
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,960
I'm usually busy with work.

832
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,400
You should spend more time with Mom.

833
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,660
Don't let her stay

834
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,560
in the hospital alone all the time.

835
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,360
Okay, Brother.

836
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,680
I'll spend more time with Mom.

837
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,850
Grandpa.

838
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,650
What's wrong?

839
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,530
I'm fine.

840
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,370
I'm old.

841
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,860
When I get sleepy at night,

842
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,360
I tend to yawn and have tears.

843
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,080
It's okay.

844
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,250
Let's eat.

845
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,000
Brother.

846
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,170
Miss Xia is in trouble.

847
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,530
Her heart rate is extremely abnormal.

848
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:01,940
Elevated heart rate

849
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,210
can be caused by various factors.

850
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,450
Emotional changes

851
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,240
don't necessarily mean she's in trouble.

852
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,680
According to the Three Laws of Robotics,

853
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,660
Starlight cannot

854
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,570
sit around and do nothing

855
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,320
while a human individual is in danger.

856
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,770
Starlight.

857
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,160
Junyao,

858
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,920
go and check on your brother.

859
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:15,940
Don't let anything happen to him.

860
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,880
Be careful.

861
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,300
Okay.

862
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,050
Hurry up.

863
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,210
There's no water.

864
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,770
What should we do?

865
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,920
Let's go.

866
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,080
Make a call.

867
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,360
There's no signal.

868
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,130
What should we do?

869
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:35,970
Is anyone there?

870
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,080
Brother.

871
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:43,900
Miss Xia is 16 kilometers away

872
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,700
from us.

873
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,840
It will take 20 minutes.

874
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,720
Okay, I got it.

875
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,550
Don't worry.

876
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,200
Sit tight.

877
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,160
What should we do? We can't get out.

878
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,290
Tang Tang, wrap yourself with the blanket.

879
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,620
Count to three and let's charge out together.

880
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,370
What about you?

881
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,840
I have a coat.

882
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,050
Three, two, one.

883
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,760
Three, two, one.

884
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,290
Xia Xia.

885
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,480
We're out.

886
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,770
Xia Mo!

887
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,780
Come out!

888
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,120
Come out!

889
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,180
What stupid phone is this?

890
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,040
Xia Mo.

891
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,050
Xia...

892
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,130
Danika, contact the firefighters.

893
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,840
Xia Xia is still inside.

894
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,800
Brother, stay where you are.

895
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,160
-Starlight. Starlight!
-Don't go in.

896
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,640
What should we do?

897
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,880
