00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,680
really loves her.

With age

8
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,090
President,

9
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,560
Mr. Shen might have guessed

10
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,900
that you had

11
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,730
done the outage that happened last night.

12
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,290
So what?

13
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,020
He didn't come out

14
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,090
to restore the electricity.

15
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,930
He was afraid that his little girlfriend

16
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,360
would be scared of being alone in the dark.

17
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,650
So you didn't really want to cut the power,

18
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,800
but to test

19
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,250
Mr. Shen's love for Miss Xia.

20
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,210
Keep that to yourself,

21
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,480
why did you say it?

22
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,800
Take this.

23
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,640
No. I can't.

24
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,230
If I give it to you,  then it's yours.

25
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:37,680
Take it.

26
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,600
Grandpa gave me this just now.

27
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,370
Since it's from Grandpa,

28
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,520
just take it.

29
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,200
I have money.

30
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,250
We're a contract couple.

31
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,160
What am I thinking about?

32
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,380
Why would I

33
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,400
think about her?

34
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,360

38
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,170
Brother,

39
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,370
why do I feel

40
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,920
your radical mood swings?

41
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,440
Did something happen last night?

42
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,720
Nothing.

43
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,000
Maybe I didn't sleep well.

your heart rate

47
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,480
was racing too.

00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,120
My guess was right.

We're just a contract couple.

57
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,700
Besides,

58
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,170
we've only been living together for 2 weeks.

59
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,450
Don't listen to Danika.

60
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,410
Even if we are a real couple,

61
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,330
it's irresponsible

62
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,100
to do this

63
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,400
in such a short time.

64
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,260
How do you define

65
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,440
a responsible relationship?

66
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,120
Anyway,

67
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,000
it won't be so hasty.

68
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:15,700
Is that because

69
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,760
your parents divorced,

70
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,800
so you don't trust in love?

00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,570
Actually,

breaking up and getting together

73
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,130

77
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,010
Human emotions are complicated.

78
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,920
It can't be manipulated by us.

79

I have feelings for Xia Mo,

81
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:39,860
but it doesn't mean

82
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,960
we can be together.

83
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,940
Did you just admit

84
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,000
you have feelings for her?

85
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,040
No.

86

89
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:50,840
Okay.

00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,880

We'll have a meeting soon.

93
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,450
Done. I submitted them.

94
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,210
But they haven't given me any feedback,

95
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,720
I don't know if I need to revise them.

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,230
Tang Tang, why are you here?

106
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,570
I came to have tea with you.

107
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,800
By the way,

108
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,400
we'll talk about Shen Junyao.

109
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,640

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,530
what happened

112
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,330
to Shen Junyao?

113
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,720
Now you are in a hurry.

114
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,450
I...

115
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,290
You came to me just because of him.

116
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,400
Can't I be curious?

117
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,120
Nothing special.

118
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,930
It's just

119
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,600
Qin Xiang stayed at my house last night.

120
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,810
Really?

121
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,160
When did you start...

122
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,000
What do you mean?

123
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,330
We haven't started yet.

124
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,460
He was drunk last night,

125
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,760
and stayed at my house.

126
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,520
Did you two...

127
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,400
Xia Mo,

128
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,280
I didn't find out

129
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,490
you're actually a mango girl

130
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,250
during 4 college years.

131
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,700
You look green

132
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,080
and harmless,

133
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,040
but you are yellow and dirty deep down.

134
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,720
It's nonsense.

135
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,130
I-I'm just afraid that

136
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,240
you can't protect yourself.

137
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,210
Don't worry,

138
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,880
Qin Xiang

139
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,440
is good at that.

140
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,450
Come in.

141
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,760
Sorry to bother you.

142
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,090
Mr. Shen,

143
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,380
this is the announcement copywriting

144
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,060
of the T5 robots.

145
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,920
Take a look.

146
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,210
You didn't go home last night, right?

147
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,200
Where did you sleep?

148
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,040
Me?

149
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,650
I went home.

150
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,770
I-I slept at home.

151
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,600
When I saw you this morning,

152
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,480
I noticed your hair was a mess,

153
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,720
and you didn't change your clothes.

154
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,200
That's not how you do things.

155
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,000
Last night...

156
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,570
I drank too much last night,

157
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,520
I was totally drunk.

158
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,320
But when I woke up,

159
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,540
it was morning.

160
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,890
I'm not interested in gossip,

161
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,130
but I want to remind you

162
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,410
not to

163
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,400
get hurt again.

164
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,160
Don't worry, Mr. Shen,

165
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,570
Tang Tang is definitely not...

166
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,480
Who?

167
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,450
Tang...

168
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,920
Tang Jinxuan.

169
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,920
Did you sleep with Xia Mo's best friend?

170
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,200
If you said so,

171
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,520
I'm better than him at that.

172
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,010
Fine, that's not the point.

173
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:35,980
The point is

174
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,220
Qin Xiang told me something

175
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,130
about Shen Junyao yesterday.

176
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,210
What is it?

177
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,640
Go ahead.

178
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,240
Actually,

179
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,040
I saw it online before.

180
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,210
Shen Junyao had a younger brother

181
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,409
when he was young.

182
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:50,380
But he died

183
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,159
in a fire.

184
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,780
His mother had depression,

185
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,730
and his father had an affair too.

186
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,620
He grew up

187
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,200
with his Grandpa, Shen Kun.

188
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,080
Is he so miserable?

189
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,720
I can't tell.

190
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,900
So

191
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,690
he has psychological disorder since then.

192
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,100
He was extremely

193
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,160
insecure about affection.

194
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,040
He broke up

195
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,410
with his ex-girlfriend

196
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,530
because they had been together

197
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,810
for half a year

198
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,130
but had no intimate behaviors.

199
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,530
Intimate behaviors?

200
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,760
What do you mean?

201
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,530
Hugging, kissing,

202
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,730
or sleeping together.

203
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:28,700
I guess

204
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,200
they only held hands.

205
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:31,580
Give it to me.

206
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,320
No. No.

207
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,610
Tang Tang,

208
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,880
what does it mean

209
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,880
if they have these behaviors?

210
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,280
What does it mean?

211
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,360
Maybe it means

212
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,570
he really likes someone.

213
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,240
Why are you asking me this so suddenly?

214
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,080
Are you...

215
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,400
Nothing.

216
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
I...

217
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,130
We are just a contract couple,

218
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,600
not even a real couple.

219
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,360
How could it be?

220
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,250
You're right.

221
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,810
But it doesn't matter.

222
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,780
What matters is

223
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,930
I'm here to remind you.

224
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,420
A man like Shen Junyao

225
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,480
who is extremely aloof inside,

226
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,250
they are very

227
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,360
self-centered,

228
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,810
and they don't

229
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,530
consider your feelings.

230
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,130
So,

231
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,420
don't quarrel

232
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,120
with Shen Junyao.

233
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,120
After all, he had a hard life
when he was young,

234
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,200
just let him be.

235
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,640
Mr. Shen,

236
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,970
Tang Tang and I slept together

237
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,970
last night.

238
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,770
Why are you

239
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,200
feel anxious?

240
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,410
I don't.

241
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,530
But

242
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,640
I really don't remember

243
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,570
what happened last night

244
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,010
at all.

245
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,720
But this morning,

246
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,360
Tang Tang said

247
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,920
I'm pretty good at that.

248
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,730
Is it?

249
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,500
No, no.

250
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,400
You are the best.

251
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,360
Mr. Shen is the best.

252
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,980
Get out to prepare the

253
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,980
publicity about T5.

254
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,840
Leave me alone. Leave.

255
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,560
Okay.

256
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,460
I wonder

257
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,920
if Xia Mo will be angry

258
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,080
when she knows this.

259
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,290
Hello?

260
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,400
I have something to tell you.

261
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,170
If you need an apology...

262
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,160
That's not right.

263
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,660
Why do I apologize

264
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,080
for what Qin Xiang did?

265
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,100
Why am I afraid

266
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,530
Xia Mo will be angry when she finds out?

267
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,280
I have nothing to do with Xia Mo.

268
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,840
Impossible.

269
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,860
I won't fall in love

270
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,730
with anyone.

271
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,690
Why didn't I notice

272
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,120
Shen Junyao is self-centered?

273
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,400
Forget it.

274
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,410
Just let him be.

275
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,850
[Unfamiliar number]

276
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,490
Hello?

277
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,570
Who is this?

278
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,520
Boss Shi.

279
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,280
How did it go?

280
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,740
You need to delete

281
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,720
all otoMADs that Xia Mo made

282
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,640
in company e-mail,

283
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,340
and implant virus

284
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,240
in Xia Mo's computer.

285
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,970
When it's done,

286
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,050
I'll pay you 200,000 yuan.

287
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,540
I've sent

288
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,080
the virus zip file to your private email.

289
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,690
You...

290
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,240
I haven't found a chance these days,

291
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,120
but I'll find a way.

292
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,840
You'll have a meeting on Monday morning,

293
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,360
and then you don't have extra time.

294
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,930
If you fail,

295
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,770
I'll expose everything you did

296
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,840
and all the money you received.

297
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,520
No.

298
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,650
Don't.

299
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,350
Don't worry.

300
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,560
I will find a way today.

301
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,620
Someone will come here to

302
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,160
check the cable in 10 minutes.

303
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,010
By then, all the surveillance cameras

304
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,800
in Station C will be switched off.

305
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,080
You know

306
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,720
what to do.

307
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,370
[No difficult work]

308
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,560
You are revising it, Xia Xia?

309
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,000
Good can always be better.

310
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,570
I'll try to memorize it all,

311
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,760
so that I won't be criticized.

312
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,650
Good.

313
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,120
This year, the model of Station C

314
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
will be you.

315
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,480
Hello,

316
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,450
stop your work.

317
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,490
Later,

318
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,620
someone will come to our company

319
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,570
to repair the cable.

320
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,090
So the whole department

321
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,040
has a half day off

322
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,450
this afternoon.

323
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,620
Really, Director?

324
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,480
Really? Did I hear right?

325
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,060
I booked a concert ticket tonight,

326
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,280
I was wondering how to apply for leave.

327
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,100
Director,

328
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,020
you are so nice.

329
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,850
Enough,

330
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,800
hurry up to pack up,

331
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,610
and go home.

332
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,970
Okay, Director.

333
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,850
Xia Mo,

334
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,330
have you revised

335
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,280
your videos and proposal?

336
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,120
Yes, Director.

337
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,610
I've sent them to

338
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,290
your company email, QQ,

339
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,320
and WeChat.

340
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,530
Good.

341
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,760
You've done your work.

342
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,890
You can go back home too.

343
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,040
By the way,

344
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,480
have a good rest.

345
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,260
Don't ever

346
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,210
embarrass us

347
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,410
in front of the staff from QOP,

348
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,490
understand?

349
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,530
Yes.

350
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,330
I'll go back now.

351
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,170
Go.

352
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,000
Goodbye, Director.

353
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,730
Come in.

354
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,800
You're done.

355
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,800
How is it? Is the company good?

356
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,340
I found three weak electricity boxes

357
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,610
which have structure issues.

358
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,040
There are cigarette ends in the stairwell.

359
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,050
This is a security concern.

360
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,080
Who told you to check this?

361
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,520
Then what do you want me to see?

362
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,920
I'll worry about your physical security

363
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,760
because of the fire last time.

364
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,680
Okay.

365
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,210
I'll send someone to check.

366
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,560
By the way,

367
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,220
you promised me last time

368
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,360
that you would tell Sister

369
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,000
you'd break up with her in 3 months.

370
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,170
Did you tell her?

371
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,490
I...

372
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,720
If you don't want to say it,

373
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,130
I can say it for you.

Starlight.

375
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,980
Do you want me

376
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,280
to break up with her?

377
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,640
No.

378
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,530
I want you to recognize yourself.

379
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,690

381
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,560
or 3 months later.

382
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,340
I've located that Sister

383
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,560
is heading home.

384
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,020
If you've done your work,

385
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,290
can you go home early?

386
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,210
As a couple,

387
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,010
you need to clean the house

388
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,800
on the weekend.

389
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,410
I've bought all the tools.

390
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,170
We're just a contract couple.

391
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:52,780
We don't have to do things

392
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,100
like a real couple.

393
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,660
Besides,

394
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,560
there's a maid at home.

395
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,650
And

396
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,180
I don't want to clean the house

397
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,120
with Xia Mo.

398
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,650
Sewing for the whole afternoon,

399
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,080
I'm starving.

400
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,500
I'll go downstairs

401
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,680
to see if there's something delicious.

402
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,490
What are you...

403
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,160
Sister.

404
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:42,880
Starlight.

405
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,640
What happened to him?

406
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,100
Why

407
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,720
is he so unhappy?

408
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,940
Because I wanted him

409
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,210
to do the cleaning together.

410
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,530
He said he was not good at it.

411
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,250
So,

412
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,890
a man like Shen Junyao

413
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,650
who is extremely aloof inside,

414
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,240
they are very

415
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,400
self-centered,

416
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,660
and they don't

417
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,330
consider your feelings.

418
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,290
After all, he had a hard life
when he was young.

419
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,280
Just let him be.

420
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:08,970
That's true.

421
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,640
Sister, what did you say?

422
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,720
Nothing.

423
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,200
I'm going to clean the room.

424
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,849
What did you say to her?

425
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:23,339
She said

426
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,760
she wanted to do the cleaning together.

427
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,330
Do you want to join us?

428
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,160
Sorry, brother.

429
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,370
I need to charge.

430
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,200
You just need to rest.

431
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,210
I'll clean.

432
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,890
I'm afraid you can't clean it up.

433
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,480
Who says I can't?

434
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,050
Stop it. Wipe it properly.

435
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,160
Take a rest after you're done.

436
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,740
I'll wash the sofa cover

437
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,730
after this.

438
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,210
You finally have a weekend.

439
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,160
You should take a rest.

440
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,330
Since it's a big cleaning,

441
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,410
we should clean it up.

442
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,600
I can do it.

443
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,050
♫Are you secretly thinking of me?♫

444
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,770

♫Home is where you are♫

472
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:29,740
The newly established

00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,930
rocker technology development center

474
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,810
by our group has been inspected.

475
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,680
Everything is going well.

476
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,680
The contract for Tianji

477
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,720
has been returned.

478
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,050
I'll let you know

479
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:36,970
after the legal department has passed.

480
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,200
Plus, the staff from QOP are here.

481
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,170
They are waiting for you in the meeting room.

482
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:40,880
Where is Qin Xiang?

483
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,490
Mr. Qin is organizing

484
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,490
related documents

485
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,320
about the smart devices exhibition.

486
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:57,810
Xia Mo.

487
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:58,920
Hurry. We're waiting for you.

488
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,850
T-They're all here?

489
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,760
Yes.

490
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,810
The Director just asked

491
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:03,840
why you haven't arrived yet.

492
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,540
I thought we would start at 10:30.

493
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,760
I don't know what's wrong with me.

494
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,730
I have diarrhea when I'm nervous.

495
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,330
Why are you so nervous?

496
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,290
Just read

497
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,050
the slides.

498
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:15,800
No.

499
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,530
I have to read it vividly.

500
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:18,920
Wait for me.

501
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,200
Hurry up.

502
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:23,880
Let's go.

503
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,240
Mr. Huang, she'll be here soon.

504
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,300
Please wait a little longer.

505
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,840
No hurry.

506
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,120
Coming.

507
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,570
Sorry.

508
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,760
I'm late.

509
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,730
Is everything ready?

510
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,320
Yes.

511
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,530
That's good.

512
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,530
This is an important meeting.

513
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,140
Don't embarrass

514
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,240
our company.

515
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,770
Got it.

516
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,960
Go ahead.

517
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,090
Hello, everyone.

518
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,960
I'm Xia Mo from Station C.

519
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,400
This time, I'm in charge of

520
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,050
the video editing

521
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,090
and proposal.

522
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,330
Next, please

523
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,760
check the videos.

524
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,240
This...

525
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,840
This...

526
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,680
What happened?

527
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,600
Impossible!

528
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,890
How could this happen?

529
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,200
It was right before.

530
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,520
Xia Mo.

531
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,170
Xia Mo.

532
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,280
What are you doing?

533
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,920
Everyone is waiting for you.

534
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:44,890
I...

535
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,160
I don't know what happened.

536
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,970
I can't open

537
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,160
the videos and proposal.

538
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,370
Director, do you have them on your phone?

539
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,320
Xia Mo.

540
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,600
The videos you sent me are corrupted.

541
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,580
What are you doing?

542
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,290
This...

543
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,730
This is impossible.

544
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,720
What do you mean?

545
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,900
All the people

546
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,740
are waiting for you.

547
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,260
And now you're telling me

548
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,610
that the file and videos are corrupted.

549
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,370
You don't know

550
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,520
the T5 robots will be released tomorrow?

551
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,730
I...

552
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,610
Director Shi,

553
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,300
it's not a trivial matter

554
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,560
that the videos and file are corrupted.

555
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,320
Let's cancel the meeting first.

556
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,280
I'll contact Stantech

557
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,780
to discuss the strategy for

558
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,170
the T5 press conference at 8 a.m. tomorrow.

559
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,770
Mr. Huang.

560
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,890
You're in big trouble.

561
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,170
Xia Mo, what happened?

562
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,540
Didn't you just say it was okay?

563
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,040
Yes.

564
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,120
Check what's going on.

565
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,000
Why can't I open it?

566
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,010
Is it okay?

567
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,570
It was fine before.

568
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,000
Mr. Shen,

569
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,100
I need to check

570
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:54,730
the details of the T5 press conference

571
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,770
with you.

572
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,870
[Mr. Huang]

573
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,930
About the entry order of the attendees,

574
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,010
what should we...

575
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:05,880
Hello.

576
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:06,920
Mr. Shen.

577
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,020
I have an emergency

578
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,810
to report.

579
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,580
Our T5 press conference

580
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,930
might not be carried out as scheduled.

581
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,930
Mr. Huang,

582
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,420
this is our first cooperation

583
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,840
with QOP.

584
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,880
I know, Mr. Shen.

585
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,140
It's mainly because

586
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,250
the videos and proposal that Station C made

587
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,810
were corrupted.

588
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,530
So...

589
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,240
What?

590
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,620
Lock it down.

591
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,720
I'll go to Station C now.

592
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,730
The meeting is cancelled.

593
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,530
I'll let you know.

594
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,880
What's going on?

595
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,210
Why didn't he take me?

596
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,680
[Xia Mo]

597
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,220
[Starlight]

598
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,290
Brother,

599
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,440
something's wrong with Sister.

600
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,960
I've figured out the reason.

601
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,420
This time,

602
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,260
her sentiment index of depressing

603
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,530
is higher than ever.

604
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,080
She even has physiological reactions.

605
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,370
Her blood pressure is increasing,

606
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,400
the surface temperature of her skin is dropping,

607
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,730
and the catecholamines secretion is increasing.

608
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,640
Go straight to Station C.

609
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,960
We'll meet downstairs.

610
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,260
Before the meeting,

611
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,760
I've emphasized again and again

612
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,080
about the completion of the videos.

613
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,570
You told me you've done all the work.

614
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,200
This is the result of your work.

615
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,200
Sorry, Director.

616
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,730
It's my fault.

617
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,040
Of course it is your fault.

618
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,210
Look at them.

619
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,220
Look at

620
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,620
how busy they are now.

621
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,890
It's all your fault.

622
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,730
Director,

623
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,970
Xia Mo wouldn't want

624
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,570
to make it like this.

625
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,620
She edited videos every day,

626
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,930
and stayed up late.

627
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:43,810
Yes, Director.

628
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,360
It's not the time to hold anyone accountable.

629
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,370
We'd better

630
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,170
figure out

631
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,260
how to solve the problem

632
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,300
to make sure the press conference

633
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,360
can go on as planned.

634
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,540
Although Xia Mo

635
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,820
is careless,

636
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,920
when she works...

637
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,420
Shut up

638
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,520
if you can't say something helpful.

639
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,800
This is all my fault.

640
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,640
I didn't check the videos in time

641
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,980
and caused

642
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,930
such a big mistake.

643
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,610
I'm sorry.

644
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,450
Does an apology work?

645
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,490
Did I tell you

646
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,520
when you first joined the company?

647
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:22,960
And about

648
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,040
the work email last time.

649
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,370
Why did you

650
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,880
make mistakes every time?

651
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,210
Those were trivial matters.

652
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,640
Today,

653
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,820
you made such a big mistake

654
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,170
in this important meeting.

655
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,180
Candy

656
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,940
was disgraced,

657
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,730
do you know?

658
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,480
Sorry, Director.

659
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,410
I'm going to edit the videos now.

660
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,570
Re-edit?

661
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,580
It will be released

662
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,440
within 24 hours.

663
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,560
Do you think you are a robot

664
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,530
or they are robots?

665
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,400
Listen, Xia Mo,

666
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,330
even if they accompany you

667
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,800
to work around the clock,

668
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,580
it can't

669
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,530
fix the situation.

670
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,680
Take care of yourself.

671
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,360
Brother.

672
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,500
The videos made by Xia Mo

673
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,360
have been corrupted.

674
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,440
Go upstairs first.

675
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,000
Shen Junyao.

676
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,440
Calm down.

677
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,970
Is your Director here?

678
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,880
Mr. Shen.

679
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,340
Candy has never made

680
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,010
such a serious mistake.

681
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,930
If something goes wrong

682
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:05,800
at the T5 press conference,

683
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,450
I think you know

684
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,250
whose responsibility it is.

685
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:10,940
When there's a problem,

686
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,860
you pass the buck

687
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,800
to the new employee.

688
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:13,810
Is this how

689
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,010
employees from Candy do things?

690
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,450
Candy

691
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,000
has its own rules and regulations.

692
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,600
So I'm thinking

693
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,840
if I should fire Xia Mo.

694
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,060
If this matter

695
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,640
goes to resignation,

696
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,770
you'll start

697
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,130
writing your resignation report.

698
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,640
Come with me.
