What is it?

00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,400
Why do you know sign language?

118
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,720
I only know a little.

119
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,140
But I saw you communicating well

120
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,360
with the little girl.

121
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,040
Actually,

122
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,260
I used to be a volunteer

123
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,040
for a while.

124
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:38,490
I was in charge of communicating with

125
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,480
deaf people who liked the ancient style.

126
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,960
They were smart

127
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,490
and interested in national knowledge,

128
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,610
but didn't dare to talk to others

129
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,800
due to communication problems.

130
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,960
So I wanted to

131
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,360
learn some sign language

132
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,760
to help them.

133
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,010
But it was

00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,720

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,280

179
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,090

180

181
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,160
Just say what you're up to.

182

What about Shen Junyao?

188
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,620

film the video last time

190
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,290

191
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,970
I couldn't say no.

192

214

At that time, even if Shen Junyao gets angry,

215
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,960
it has nothing to do with you.

216

00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:01,970
You must come back.

581
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,840
I'll say goodbye to the director.

582
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,600
Okay.

583
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,690
What's going on?

584
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,530
Why are there cops?

585
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,090
Officer.

586
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,080
-Director. -Director.

587
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,000
Xia Mo.

588
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,480
What I did before

589
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,970
caused you a lot of trouble.

590
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,320
I'm sorry.

591
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,720
You're Xia Mo, right?

592
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,290
We received a report

593
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,540
that Shi Li is suspected of

594
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,000
obstructing the company's order.

595
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,220
We're taking her

596
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:58,970
for investigation.

597
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,340
I hope you can

598
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,490
provide relevant clues later.

599
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,080
I deserve the punishment.

600
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,680
Work hard

601
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,920
in the company.

602
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,650
We will.

603
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:11,970
Let's get going.

604
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,770
Brother,

605
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,200
what did Grandpa tell you?

606
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,810
He told me…

607
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,440
He...

608
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,530
He didn't say anything.

609
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,200
Brother, your heart was racing just now.

610
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,490
Did Grandpa

611
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,370
set a wedding date

612
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,840
for you and Sister?

613
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,560
Stop guessing.

614
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,730
Watch out for the cone, it'll kill your brain.

615
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,290
It's not for me.

616
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,200
It's for you.

617
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,890
I don't want it.

618
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,600
I'm not asking you to eat it.

619
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,130
Sister seems to

620
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,160
be in a bad mood.

621
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,320
Sweets

622
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,730
can make her feel better.

623
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,810
Starlight.

624
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,170
Who taught you all these?

625
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,530
Did you upgrade the system

626
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,440
behind my back?

627
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,500
I've put together a relationship book

628
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,450
based on the messages

629
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,250
people have posted so far on the internet.

630
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,410
I've sent the link

631
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,610
to your email.

632
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,410
You can read it

633
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,520
when you have time.

634
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,770
I don't need it.

635
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:41,800
Xia Mo.

636
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,690
Shen Junyao?

637
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,000
Give me the stuff.

638
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,600
Have something to eat.

639
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,050
Let's go.

640
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,000
Have you heard?

641
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,240
The new secretary-general will take office soon.

642
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,570
The connection that comes out of nowhere?

643
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,800
Don't be so harsh.

644
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,680
We haven't seen her yet.

645
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,820
Maybe

646
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,170
she's very capable.

647
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,680
Capable?

648
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,530
No one would believe that.

649
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,740
I think

650
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,170
she just has a good background.

651
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,320
Otherwise,

652
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,010
how come the board appointed

653
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,290
and transferred her?

654
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,200
Right.

655
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,770
Nuannuan

656
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:03,800
has applied for the promotion of secretary-general

657
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,500
for many times

658
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,480
without success.

659
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,780
But she just took the position

660
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,720
out of nowhere.

661
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,020
I think

662
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,360
she's a plague.

663
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,640
It'll be hard for

664
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,260
Qin Xiang and Maggie

665
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,280
in the future.

666
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,440
Take a look at this document.

667
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,680
It's for today.

668
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,840
Hello, Mr. Shen.

669
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,290
You seem to

670
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,330
have way too much leisure lately.

671
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,690
Then sort out all the market analysis

672
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,140
from T6 to T8

673
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,330
today.

674
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,360
Don't worry about it.

675
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,480
Don't be so nervous either.

676
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,610
Just work like you're at Candy.

677
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,240
Who's in charge of the team building we brought up last time?

678
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,600
We haven't started the plan yet.

679
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,960
But if Xia Mo is free,

680
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,610
she can try to

681
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,330
handle it.

682
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,890
Okay, it's a deal.

683
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,530
Team building?

684
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,720
There are hundreds of people in Stantech.

685
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,930
I haven't been in charge of

686
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,000
such a big event.

687
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,210
I'm afraid I can't handle it.

688
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,330
Miss Xia,

689
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,240
many businesses

690
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,040
at our company

691
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,250
need to be watched.

692
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:19,740
So,

693
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,840
there are batches of team buildings.

694
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,250
Our secretary's office

695
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,160
is one of the first batches.

696
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,370
There will only be

697
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,480
the people you saw just now.

698
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,360
I'm relieved then.

699
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,290
Where do you want to go?

700
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,800
It's up to you.

701
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,280
Wherever you want to go.

702
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,080
Starlight.

703
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:35,930
You and Sister

704
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,810
should sort out

705
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,170
the number and content of the team buildings.

706
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,600
I have something to say to Qin Xiang.

707
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,450
Okay, Brother.

708
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:41,880
Go.

709
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,810
Mr. Shen.

710
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,760
What's the matter?

711
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,480
The report you wrote last time

712
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,610
is not complete.

713
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,130
Some parts are too vague.

714
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,040
I'll need to

715
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,580
talk to you

716
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,570
more about the details.

717
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,600
I see.

718
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,160
Nice clothes.

719
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,520
It's all right.

720
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,690
It's a birthday gift from Tang Tang.

721
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,160
Mr. Shen,

722
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,200
how about this?

723
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,720
I'll write

724
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,050
a detailed report,

725
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,200
including what happened

726
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,490
off work

727
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,560
and at home.

728
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,690
You can read it later.

729
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,440
What do you think?

730
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,040
That'll be great.

731
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,880
Don't mention it.

732
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,200
But Mr. Shen,

733
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,280
Xia Mo coming to Stan this time

734
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,330
is a

735
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,770
rare opportunity.

736
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,610
You can't miss it.

737
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,090
It's not that simple.

738
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,810
Excuse me.

739
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,240
I'd like to ask

740
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,850
where the files of

741
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:11,640
the previous team building events are.

742
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,280
It's all in the file room.

743
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,050
It's right next door.

744
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,090
Go find it yourself.

745
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,160
I have work to do.

746
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,410
I won't take you there.

747
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,800
I'm sorry.

748
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,020
After all,

749
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,640
we're just small, dedicated employees.

750
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,200
We can't do your big job.

751
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,530
If you can't,

752
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,920
just shut up.

753
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,210
Starlight.

754
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,560
I'm new here.

755
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,880
Be polite.

756
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,440
Okay, Sister.

757
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,040
I'll go to the file room.

758
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,980
Stay here and don't make any trouble.

759
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,730
Do you hear me?

760
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,010
Mr. Shen.

761
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,440
A relationship is something

762
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,360
that just has to happen.

763
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,800
There's no other way.

764
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,880
But I heard

765
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,290
that Miss Xia

766
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,760
likes you too.

767
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,320
When? What did she say?

768
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,810
I heard it

769
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,130
when Miss Xia and Tang Tang

770
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,440
talked on the phone last night.

771
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,040
She said

772
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,720
