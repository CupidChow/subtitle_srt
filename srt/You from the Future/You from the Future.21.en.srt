Is Mr. Lin Heng already in the dressing room?

Mr. Lin Heng just arrived.

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,240
He said you don't need to hurry.

11
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,210

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,440
what do you think

16
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,400
of the R&D of T6 robots?

17
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,000
I still want to continue the R&D of T6 robots.

18
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,230
Okay.

19
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,450
I've arranged

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,590
the R&D plan.

21
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,710
Why are you looking at me?

22
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,920
In the past,

23
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,480
I was too stubborn.

24
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,920
I was afraid of taking the consequences of failure.

25
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:55,960
So,

26
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,079
I was against your proposal.

27
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,950
But it's different now.

28
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,350

If you want to do it,

33
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,640
just do it.

00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,690
You are the one to decide

39
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,200
If you really want to thank me...

40
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,960

here?

45
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:33,850
She went to

Why didn't you go with her?

48
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,360
I'm not interested.

49
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,110
Is it because you are not interested

50
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,120

69
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,769

design a piece of Hanfu

71

the Hanfu I designed

175

00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,740
I am already very happy.

196
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,340
Since my dream has come true,

197
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,200
I still want to

198
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,140
focus more on my work.

199
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,380
After all,

200
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,340
I can't rely on my hobby to make a living.

201
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,620
You're right.

202
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,380
I'm going on stage soon.

203
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,500
I'll return the clothes to you

204
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,660
when it's over.

205
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,500
Fighting!

206
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,540
Pan,

207
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,540
take Miss Xia backstage to have a rest.

208
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,420
Okay.

209
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,180
Miss Xia Mo.

210
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,260
Please follow me.

211
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,500
Nice.

212
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,100
So handsome.

213
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,100
So handsome.

214
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,440
It seems that

215
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,590
Mr. Lin Heng

216
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,860
is still very popular.

217
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,670
Next,

218
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,980
let's welcome Mr. Lin Heng

219
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,710
to say hello

220
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,910
to the fans

221
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,450
present here today.

222
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,900
OK.

223
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,860
Hello, everyone.

224
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,650
I'm Lin Heng.

225
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,850
Dear friends,

226
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:26,920
do you think

227
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,700
the Hanfu Mr. Lin Heng's wearing today

228
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,140
is especially beautiful?

229
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,140
Do you think it's beautiful?

230
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,490
Yes.

231
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,200
Then behind

232
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,420
this dress

233
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,700
is a warm story.

234
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,810
Do you want to hear it?

235
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,530
Yes.

236
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,660
Actually,

237
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,010
this Hanfu

238
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:45,790
has a very special meaning

239
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,980
to me.

240
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,170
Today,

241
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,470
I want to thank

242
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,380
a friend of mine.

243
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,700
Without her help,

244
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,150
I'm afraid I can't even

245
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,370
attend the show this time.

246
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,770
To her,

247
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,630
maybe I am a blogger

248
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,130
who is loved by many fans.

249
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,930
But to me,

250
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,670
she is

251
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,060
a very special girl.

252
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,250
Xia Mo.

253
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,020
Xia Mo?

254
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,850
Miss Xia Mo,

255
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,730
where are you?

256
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,090
Can you go on stage

257
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:18,910
and

258
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,690
say hello

259
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,650
to the audience?

260
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,170
Hello, everyone.

261
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,930
I'm Xia Mo.

262
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,330
Mr. Lin Heng told me

263
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,550
that today

264
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,530
he wants to give Miss Xia

265
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,850
a special gift.

266
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,410
What gift?

267
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,690
Xia Mo.

268
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,810
I have long wanted to say this to you.

269
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,490
What's going on?

270
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,040
Who are they?

271
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,850
[Four hours ago]

272
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,490
Starlight.

273
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,620
Enjoy yourself.

274
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,130
I'm feeling uncomfortable with my arms today.

275
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:36,820
I don't think it's your arms

276
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,130
that you feel uncomfortable with.

277
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,180
I...

278
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:41,890
Brother.

279
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,380
Although

280
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,850
Lin Heng's last confession failed,

281
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,480
after analyzing

282
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,410
his personality

283
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,570
and his usual behavior,

284
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,100
I got the result that the probability

285
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,330
of him confessing his love to Sister in the exhibition

286
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,600
is 98 percent.

287
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,690
Don't try to persuade me.

288
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:56,460
No matter what you say,

289
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,800
I won't go.

290
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,960
I remember now.

291
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,390
Isn't he the CEO

292
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,320
of Stantech?

293
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,620
Is he

294
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,680
Xia Mo's boyfriend?

295
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,320
Why are you here?

296
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,770
I'm free,

297
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,610
so I came to see you.

298
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,330
Shen Junyao.

299
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,850
Let's go home.

300
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,810
Xia Mo.

301
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,250
Xia Mo!

302
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,570
Xia Mo.

303
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,280
What's wrong?

304
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,730
Nothing.

305
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,660
I'm afraid Lin Heng

306
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,650
has ulterior motives against you.

307
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,940
I came here

308
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,130
because I was worried that you wouldn't know what to do.

309
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,460
Even if he confesses his love to me,

310
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,800
I won't accept him.

311
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,560
I told you

312
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,060
the two people who are in a relationship

313
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,200
should trust each other.

314
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,100
Why can't you

315
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,320
trust me?

316
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,600
I'm sorry.

317
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,400
I just...

318
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,320
Xia Mo.

319
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,880
You told me

320
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,900
your biggest dream

321
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,080
is to design Hanfu.

322
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,660
I also hope

323
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,680
you can fulfill your dream

324
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,000
through this exhibition.

325
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:04,880
Sorry.

326
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,480
I messed up

327
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,760
this exhibition.

328
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,760
Sister, this is for you.

329
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,240
For me?

330
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,550
A big brother told me

331
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,200
a sister here was angry

332
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,650
and only by giving the sister flowers

333
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,360
can the sister be happy.

334
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,240
I'm not angry.

335
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,080
Sister, don't be angry.

336
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,820
My mom said

337
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,220
girls shouldn't be angry.

338
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,800
Or else, we'll get wrinkles.

339
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,480
Well,

340
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,840
thank you, little girl.

341
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,340
I'm not angry.

342
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,200
Go have fun.

343
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,460
Bye bye.

344
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:38,960
Bye.

345
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,610
Who taught you this?

346
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,040
Is it the Book of Love?

347
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:54,960
I...

348
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,280
But

349
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,280
where did you get this?

350
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,120
It looks nice on you.

351
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,480
Surprise.

352
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,270
It took you four years to design this Hanfu.

353
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:03,900
But Starlight and I

354
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,880
made it very soon.

355
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,160
Good for you.

356
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,200
It's all thanks to Starlight.

357
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:13,480
Is there anything you like?

358
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,839
They're pretty. Thank you.

359
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,650
Handsome.

360
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,900
You're so cute.

361
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,930
Can I take a photo with you?

362
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,599
Sure.

363
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,800
Thank you.

364
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,240
It seems you are very popular.

365
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,520
Brother.

366
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,070
Sister.

367
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,000
Look at your outfit.

368
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,380
If you work hard,

369
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,760
you might become a popular blogger.

370
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,150
According to user statistics,

371
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,600
the possibility of becoming a blogger

372
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,200
with more than 10,000 fans is 0.7 percent,

373
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,610
and more than a million fans,

374
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,490
only

375
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,280
0.039 percent.

376
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,040
Starlight.

377
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,730
Many things

378
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,160
can't only be evaluated by data.

379
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,240
Yes, Starlight.

380
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,320
Appearance matters a lot nowadays.

381
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,710
People want to take photos with you.

382
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,270
It shows that you are very popular.

383
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,480
You probably don't know.

384
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,960
But Brother is more popular than me.

385
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,200
Danika said

386
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,370
six girls

387
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,360
have confessed their love to him this year.

388
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,760
Really?

389
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,680
Why didn't I know?

390
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,240
It looks fun over there.

391
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,070
Xia Mo.

392
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,050
I've never been to

393
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:14,830
such an exhibition before.

394
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,960
Can you show me around?

395
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,270
Aren't you busy today?

396
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,680
You are my only schedule today.

397
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,280
Okay, I'll lead the way.

398
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,440
Why did you tell her this?

399
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,600
According to the data,

400
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,960

401
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,610

402
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,800
closer to each other.

403
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:32,810
Your data are

404
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:33,760
never accurate.

405
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,030
Were my data ever inaccurate?

406
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,760
Not bad.

407
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:02,840
It suits you well.

408
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:10,770
I think this

409
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,800
suits you well, too.

410
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,480
Starlight, what do you think?

411
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:15,880
Brother.

412
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,160
I think this rabbit headband

413
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,790
suits you better.

414
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:20,790
Right?

415
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,040
You have good taste.

416
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:26,720
Hello, Miss.

417
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:27,560
Hello.

418
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,600
How can I help you?

419
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,570
Here's the thing.

420
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,960
I'm a staff member of Tianyu Pavilion.

421
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:31,930
We are

422
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,550
having a make-up competition over there.

423
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,610
We need this young man

424
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,730
to put on make-up for you

425
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,470
in the specified time.

426
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,110
Lastly, we'll take a photo together.

427
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,840
The prize for our first place

428
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,350
is the Hanfu of Tianyu Pavilion,

429
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,150
Crane in the Clouds.

430
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,200
Crane in the Clouds?

431
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,190
Wasn't it out of production long ago?

432
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,760
Looks like you once bought

433
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,950
our Hanfu.

434
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,040
It's true that Crane in the Clouds

435
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,240
is out of production.

436
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,720
But for this event,

437
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,960
we replicated a suit

438
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,210
with upgraded

440

and embroidery.

441
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,960
It's better than the original version.

442
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,110
If you want it,

443
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,320
we can do it.

444
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,150
But you don't know how to make up.

445
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,370
We won't win first place

446
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,510
even if we take part in the competition.

447
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:21,950
Not necessarily.

448
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,000
Where did you get

449
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,790

-I...

452
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,170
I think the glasses go with

453
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,070
his clothes today well.

454
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,590
You still have the mood to buy glasses?

455
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,270
I'm so nervous.

456
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,150
You can really

457
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,830
do make-up?

458
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,000
Of course.

459
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,220
If you say so,

460
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,830
I'm more worried about my face.

461
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:53,970
Okay.

462
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,050
Our game lasts for

463
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,080
only ten minutes.

472
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,710
You even know how to use loose powder to set the make-up.

473
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,550
I know a lot.

are amazing!

Do you like it that much?

488
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,260
Of course.

489
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,540
You have no idea how popular this series was.

490

I fell in love with it

the first time I saw it when I was in college.

495
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,550
I saved my allowance

496
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,820
for half a month, planning to buy it.

497
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,550
However,

I didn't expect that I could

501
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,550
get one suit of it in my life.

502
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,780
As long as you like it.

503
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:08,750
But

00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,790
I need to thank you.

505

For what?

For helping me win it back

507
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,230
of course.

508
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,300
When did you learn to make up?

509
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,230
Why didn't I know?

510
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,430
I can do everything.

511
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,910
It's just make-up.

512
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,860
It's a piece of cake.

513
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,020
I know.

516
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,630
No.

I don't believe it.

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Of course it's true.

It's just that we had to part

00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,970
I haven't even hugged.

582
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,610
In the past,

583
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,590
I didn't dare to

584
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,690
have intimate contact with others.

585
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,810
That's why

586
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,970
Chen Xiangyun broke up with me.

587
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,410
I thought I was going to

588
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,100
live on my own

589
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,770
for the rest of my life.

590
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:50,930
But I met you.

591
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,490
Xia Mo.

592
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,260
You are the only

593
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,050
unexpected variable in my life.

594
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,930
So, I hope that you can trust me.

595
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,180
Others have confessed their love to me,

596
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,210
but I only like you.

597
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,160
♫Looking at the stars in the sky♫

598
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,210
Then...

599
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:19,970
What about the future?

600
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,070
♫The blues are suddenly gone♫

601
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,370
The future?

602
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,320
♫When you close your eyes♫

603
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,450
In the future,

604
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,130
who will you like?

605
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,440
♫Whose figure is it♫

606
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,860
♫Are you not sleeping either♫

607
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,530
Of course it's you.

608
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,770
It can only be you.

609
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,150
♫Thinking of someone too♫

610
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:45,290
♫I like to bicker with you for no reason♫

611
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,330
We're even now.

612
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:51,870
♫This time I miss you♫

613
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,850
♫I confess♫

614
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:59,550
♫Meeting you might've been an accident♫

615
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,520
♫But I anticipate it every day♫

616
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:10,260
♫I confess my love to you♫

617
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:14,780
♫I can no longer pretend I'm not in love♫

618
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:20,210
♫I'm relying on you unconsciously♫

619
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,050
Xia Mo, your dad and I...
