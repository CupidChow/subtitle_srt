I heard you arrived in Zhenhai

00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,270

104
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,120

00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,140
I'd better do it myself.

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,650

118
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,260

119
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,680
Who said that?

120
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,320
Didn't I

121
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,220
make nice food last time?

122
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,290
Starlight isn't here to help you this time.

123
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,740
It's okay if you can't cook.

124
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,480
When my parents first got together,

125
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,410
they couldn't cook either.

126
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,240
I remember

127
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,170
one of them would assist

128
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,490
and the other would cook.

130
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,090
were either too sweet or salty.

131
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,450
But after

138
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:52,930

What can I do for you?

156
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,730
Here's the thing.

157
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,750
There will be a fashion show

158
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,850
at the exhibition.

159
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,050
It's called a fashion show,

160
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,070
but actually,

161
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,330
it's a hanfu display.

162
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,400
I heard that

163
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,409
you also design hanfu.

164
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,820
So I wanted to ask you

165
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,340
if you are willing to bring your hanfu

166
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,409
to the exhibition.

167
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,770
Really?

168
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,330
Can I?

169
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,770
Of course.

170
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,950
Okay, I'm willing.

171
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,820
Please give me some time.

172
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,190
I'll make some adjustments.

173
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,250
Okay, no problem.

174
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:50,980
How about this?

175
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,210
I'll add you on WeChat

176
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,180
and send you the detailed selection process

177
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:54,710
and address

178
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,690
to you.

179
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,070
Okay.

180
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,720
Thank you.

181
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,810
Bye.

182
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,240
I received a call from the ancient style exhibition,

187
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,890
I didn't expect that, after four years,

188
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,000

189
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,490
to exhibit the hanfu I designed.

190
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,100
I'll go sew now.

191
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,290
Have fun cooking.

192
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,760
You designed it for four years

193
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,510
and you're still not done.

194
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,570
It must be quite complicated.

195
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,700

00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,800
this is what you want.

389
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,750
But...

390
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,880
Here.

391
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,800
[Relationship Contract]

392
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,310
Let me ask you something.

393
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,300
Go ahead.

394
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,430
You must tell me the truth.

395
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,230
Go ahead.

396
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:19,579
When have I

397
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,710
ever dared to lie to you?

398
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,010
During the team building last time,

399
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,050
I found that your colleagues

400
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,980
don't like to eat with Xia Xia

401
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,270
or have fun together.

402
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,380
Do they

403
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,630
not like Xia Xia?

404
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,870
Xia Mo came out of nowhere

405
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,110
with a transfer letter from the headquarters

406
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,110
and she's Mr. Shen's girlfriend.

407
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,740
It's normal

408
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,080
for her colleagues

409
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,510
to doubt her work abilities.

410
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,810
How is that normal?

411
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,530
Xia Xia is such a good person.

412
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,950
How can she be excluded?

413
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,030
What should we do?

414
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,810
As the leader,

415
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,270
you have to be responsible for this.

416
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,940
You can arrange for Xia Xia

417
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,390
to do more work.

418
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,910
This way,

419
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,350
her ability

420
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,950
won't be questioned anymore.

421
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,450
Besides,

422
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,060
Mr. Shen will see that she's working hard

423
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,540
and take better care of her.

424
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,390
This is really

425
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,390
hitting two birds with one stone.

426
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,540
I'm talking to you.

427
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,540
Are you listening?

428
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,700
Of course.

429
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,800
This is my mission for you.

430
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,830
I will check on you.

431
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,830
I will complete the mission.

432
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,620
Sister,

433
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,930
you've been sewing clothes

434
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,230
for four hours.

435
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,480
It's getting late.

436
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,270
It's time to rest.

437
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,070
Really?

438
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,700
But I'm not tired.

439
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,710
I'm fine.

440
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,730
You don't feel tired

441
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,020
because your brain

442
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,280
is very excited,

443
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,790
but your body needs to rest.

444
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,200
If your body is too tired,

445
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,230
you'll feel tired in the next few days.

446
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,140
Really?

447
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,420
No wonder every time I stay up late,

448
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,020
it takes days to recover.

449
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:14,950
Okay,

450
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:15,750
I'll listen to you.

451
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,180
I'm going to rest.

452
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,260
I'll get going then.

453
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,690
Remember,

454
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,230
relax yourself before going to bed.

455
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,150
Good night.

456
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:39,870
Brother?

457
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,990
Are you...

458
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,140
Exercising?

459
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,590
I'm exercising.

460
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,990
Sister is going to sleep.

461
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,420
When are you going to sleep?

462
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,720
I...

463
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,500
Maybe later.

464
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,480
According to research,

465
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,920
the time couples sleep

466
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,980
will gradually sync.

467
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,030
I didn't expect

468
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,090
a couple like you and Sister

469
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,320
who don't live together

470
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,790
will also sync your sleep schedules.

471
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,000
Sister can't sleep because she's excited.

472
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,950
What's your reason?

473
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,890
I promised Xia Mo

474
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,080
to make her the hanfu.

475
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,100
But after I learned

476
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,040
that the hanfu is for Lin Heng,

477
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,870
I stopped helping her.

478
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:18,900
Will she think

479
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,710
I broke my promise?

480
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:20,940
Don't worry.

481
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,450
Being jealous

482
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,630
is normal between lovers.

483
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,670
She won't blame you.

484
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,550
Why would I be jealous?

485
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:28,660
Brother.

486
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,070
Since you can't sleep

487
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,020
and Sister's brain

488
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,570
is still excited

489
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,290
and won't be able to

490
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,260
sleep for a while,

491
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,420
why don't you go in

492
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,500
and do some exercises with Sister?

493
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,190
According to research,

494
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,000
couples exercising before sleeping

495
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
is good for sleep.

496
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,980
Exercise?

497
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,820
What exercise?

498
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,860
Starlight,

499
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,690
what inappropriate things

500
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,660
are in your code?

501
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,500
It's aerobics,

502
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,420
like routines and yoga.

503
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,740
What are you talking about?

504
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,820
This kind of exercise?

505
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:58,990
Nothing.

506
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,860
I'll read some books and sleep.

507
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,590
Let's go.

508
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,460
Are you really not going to exercise?

509
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,060
No.

510
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:07,310
Brother.

511
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,090
Thank you

512
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:01,810
for coming here in person.

513
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,460
No problem.

514
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,620
I look forward to working with you.

515
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:04,810
I look forward to it.

516
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,460
Mr. Shen.

517
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,690
Mr. Tan,

518
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,360
sorry to keep you waiting.

519
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,200
It's alright.

520
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,320
Mr. Shen, you're too kind.

521
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,000
T5's great sales

522
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,450
in Huabei District

523
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,890
are all thanks to you.

524
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,630
It was rude of me

525
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,700
to come without telling you.

526
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,860
Have a seat.

527
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,190
The fact that we could

528
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,890
solidify T5's spot in the market

529
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,460
is thanks to your support in the Huabei District.

530
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,200
In that case,

531
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,690
our cooperation talks will go smoothly today.

532
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,240
We want to open up

533
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,460
T5's international market.

534
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,160
As for the capital,

535
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,120
Ms. Chen said

536
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,900
she'll take care of it.

537
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,300
Chen Xiangyun?

538
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:46,860
Yes.

539
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,640
I know that Mr. Shen

540
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,020
had a relationship with her.

541
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,270
But

542
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,460
in business,

543
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,890
it's necessary to work on

544
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,060
the international market for T5.

545
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,060
Mr. Tan might not know of this,

546
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,090
but previously, Chen Xiangyun wanted to buy

547
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:01,880
Stantech's user info

548
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,750
at a high price.

549
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,530
I rejected her.

550
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,240
Also,

551
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,930
we will wait

552
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,130
until we get all of T5's patents.

553
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:07,780
before opening the international market.

554
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:09,730
I see.

555
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,720
Let's continue to work together

556
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,930
for T5's promotions in Huabei.

557
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,330
I don't know

558
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,880
if we can continue

559
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,980
cooperating with the otoMADs?

560
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,220
Of course.

561
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,920
I hope Mr. Tan

562
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,060
can continue to provide support

563
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,620
for the upcoming T6 in the Huabei District.

564
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,250
We are professionals

565
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:30,940
in marketing.

566
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,370
You must have

567
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,710
seen it

568
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,450
with T5 too.

569
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:45,780
Xia Mo.

570
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,580
Mr. Qin.

571
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,180
Do you need something?

572
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,620
Of course.

573
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,660
Here's the thing.

574
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:56,810
The company

575
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,020
has a new project.

576
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,090
This project

577
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,040
is heavily valued

578
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,210
by Mr. Shen and the Board.

579
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,750
After comprehensive assessment,

580
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,330
the company decided

581

such a heavy project.

You just came to the company.

588
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,540
You need more practice.

589
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,950
How can you improve

I won't push it.

Why don't you

595

give the project to me?

at Candy either,

599
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,350
but you did well

600
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,370
with the T5 robot commercial.

601
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,530
The company

602
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:38,930
saw that

you had experience in that project.

616

Since you purposely

617
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,300
came to tell me,

618
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,280
just be straightforward.

President,

620
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,300
since the T6 robot model

When did I say I was against it?

633
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,950
Okay, President.

00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,410
in the company today?

774
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,120
Xia Mo?

775
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,790
I've arranged everything for her.

776
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,310
Other than the project

777
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,740
for the T5 robots

778
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,950
at the exhibition,

779
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,170
she also has to organize

780
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,770
the sales results of T5 in Huabei District,

781
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:12,880

782
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,870
and customer feedback.

783
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:14,860
Oh,

784
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,710
she must also organize

785
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,870
the sales plan for the next quarter,

786
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,190
and inventory of the quarter after that.

787
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,949
She'll be busy for half a month.

788
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,159
I also told her

789
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,060
all these things

790
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,949
will be used by you

791
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:25,949
in next...

792
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,429

793
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:33,670
Mr. Shen,

794
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,920
I...

795
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,270
Did I do something wrong?

796
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,630
You didn't do anything wrong.

797
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:39,739
Take the work

798
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:40,949
you assigned to Xia Mo.

799
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,060
Remember to organize the results

800
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,290
and send them to me.

801
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,150
I need it

802
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,389

803
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,190
Okay, Mr. Shen.
