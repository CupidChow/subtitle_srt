00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,260
That one.

196
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,470
Brother.

197
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,420
Smile.

198
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,080
How is it?

199
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,740
Is it fun?

200
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,580
Let's go.

201
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,530
There's a zipline there.

202
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,530
It can exercise

203
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,570
our balance abilities,

204
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,980
and it is good for cerebellum development.

205
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,190
Let's play that.

206
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,270
After this,

207
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,560
you have to listen to me.

208
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,460
It's so tilting.

209
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,660
Where did

210
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,860
they go?

211
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,740
Be careful.

212
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,400
Brother,

213
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,980
this is not dangerous,

214
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,730
but to avoid

215
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,690
the embarrassment of falling into the water,

216
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,600
you need to follow me closely.

217
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,060
Don't worry. It's okay.

218
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Walk at a steady rate, man.

219
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,540
Don't shake.

220
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,830
Brother.

221
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,570
The guy in the front, don't shake.

222
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,610
Brother,

223
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,280
they're over there.

224
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,400
Are we going there?

225
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,190
No.

226
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,390
Walk faster, Starlight.

227
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,230
I have bathophobia.

228
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,270
Go, go, go.

229
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,680
Brother,

230
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:16,930
do you know

231
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:17,880
it's easy to lose your girlfriend

232
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,260
if you are too proud?

233
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,050
Am I too proud?

234
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,210
You didn't want her

235
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,080
to come to the amusement park today,

236
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,040
but you still let her come.

237
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,080
You would be jealous

238
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,410
when you saw her

239
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,200
with other man,

240
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,030
but you still found

241
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,110
a lame excuse.

242
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:33,980
Starlight,

243
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,820
you should walk faster

244
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,810
rather than talk.

245
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,850
Hurry up.

246
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,020
Brother,

247
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,560
why don't we

248
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,970
call Sister

249
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,930
to tell her about our location.

250
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,720
No, no.

251
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,800
Not on the phone.

252
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,630
Here.

253
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,380
Brother.

254
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:47,920
Please make way.

255
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,460
Brother.

256
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,040
Brother.

257
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,370
Brother.

258
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,200
What's the rush?

259
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,160
I'm sorry.

260
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,200
Your girlfriend was taken away by others?

261
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,320
I'm sorry.

262
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,440
Brother.

263
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,440
I'm sorry.

264
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,480
My brother didn't mean it.

265
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,730
Do you need me to help you up?

266
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,480
No need.

267
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,640
It's not deep anyway.

268
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,340
Brother!

269
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,420
Brother.

270
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,210
Are you in such a hurry

271
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:15,790
because you're afraid that

272
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,750
Sister will be taken away by Lin Heng?

273
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,240
Starlight,

274
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,030
how is Lin Heng better than me?

275
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,070
His family, economic status and social status

276
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
are not as good as yours.

277
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,690
That's right.

278
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,150
But she admires Lin Heng,

279
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,440
so he's better than you at this point.

280
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,170
The strength index increases by 40%.

281
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,420
The wrath index increases by 80%.

282
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,750
The intelligence index decreases by 100%.

283
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,420
Is this how they react

284
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,370
when men are angry?

285
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,410
If you want to play the double-layer carousel,

286
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,860
please follow the instructions of the staff.

287
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,900
To ensure safety,

288
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,110
please don't let

289
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,020
children who're less than 1.2 meters...

290
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,520
Brother,

291
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,600
do you need me to

292
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,640
locate Sister?

293
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,930
But the system can only pinpoint her location

294
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,020
within 50 meters.

295
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,180
Upgrade the system when you're back.

296
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,180
Make sure to

297
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,300
pinpoint the location within 5 meters.

298
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,790
Don't go up and down when it's spinning.

299
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,120
Brother.

300
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,070
They're here.

301
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,190
Did you completely forget

302
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,520
what you said?

303
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,220
Brother,

304
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,680
let's go there.

305
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:55,970
Let's take a look first.

306
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,200
Do you want to know

307
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
what they are talking about?

308
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,900
I can read their lips.

309
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,900
I'm not a peeper.

310
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,860
No need.

311
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,100
Forget it. Tell me.

312
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,800
Hold this for me.

313
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,340
Don't move.

314
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,380
Close your eyes.

315
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,750
Sister asked Lin Heng

316
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,750
to hold the bubble liquid bottle.

317
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,080
Lin Heng asked

318
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,950
her to close her eyes.

319
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:33,990
Brother,

320
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,280
I think we should go there.

321
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,360
I'm afraid it'll be too late

322
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,440
if we don't go there now.

323
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,270
Late for what?

324
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,270
Generally, a boy

325
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,850
asks a girl to close her eyes

326
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,560
means

327
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,810
the boy will

328
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,560
kiss the girl.

329
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,630
What else did they say?

330
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,240
Thank you, Mr. Lin Heng.

331
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,650
I haven't been so happy

332
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,070
in a long time.

333
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,190
Your boyfriend

334
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,270
is really not qualified.

335
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:07,850
Xia Mo,

336
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,310
love is something

337
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,350
that makes both parties happy.

338
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:11,760
If he doesn't know

339
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
how to respect your feelings,

340
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,670
it's meaningless

341
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,880
no matter how good he is.

342
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,910
Do you mean Shen Junyao?

343
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,910
Why do you mention this suddenly?

344
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,280
Because

345
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,810
I like you.

346
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,550
Lin Heng told her that he loved her.

347
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,460
What?

348
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,020
Mr. Lin Heng.

349
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,060
I...

350
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,650
Xia Mo,

351
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,140
if you're happy

352
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,730
with him,

353
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,510
I hope that you are really happy together.

354
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,550
But from what I see,

355
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:05,680
he only knew how to talk tough

356
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,880
and build buzz for himself

357
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,920
in front of the media.

358
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,880
He didn't

359
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,380
care about your feelings.

360
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,200
Mr. Lin Heng,

361
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,740
you misunderstood.

362
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,360
Shen Junyao is not

363
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,110
like that.

364
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Xia Mo!

365
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,820
Shen Junyao.

366
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,690
You are here too.

367
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,270
Mr. Shen.

368
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,680
Long time no see.

369
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,470
I didn't expect Mr. Lin Heng

370
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,390
to be someone

371
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,720
who would defame other's boyfriend.

372
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,510
As her friend,

373
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,920
shouldn't I remind her

374
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,000
that she didn't know someone well?

375
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:42,870
Whether I'm a good boyfriend or not,

376
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,030
it's about us.

377
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,320
I hope you know

378
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,490
the boundary between friends.

379
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,510
Stop arguing.

380
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,640
Mr. Lin Heng,

381
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,260
I think

382
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,630
you misunderstood.

383
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,500
Shen Junyao is nice to me.

384
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,410
Really?

385
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,790
He helped me a lot,

386
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,450
and took good care of me.

387
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,819
Although we're just...

388
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,069
Wow, it's the sound of the roller coaster,

389
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:14,770
I heard that

390
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,810
the roller coaster was very interesting.

391
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,900
Sister,

392
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,480
can you go with me?

393
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:21,260
Okay, I'll go with you.

394
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:21,760
Let's go.

395
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,640
-Wait.
-Wait.

396
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,420
-I'm going too.
-I'm going too.

397
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,600
Sitting in the front seats is too exciting,

398
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,680
let's sit in the back.

399
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,420
Gentlemen,

400
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,370
there are empty seats in the first row.

401
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,500
If you want to play, go sit there.

402
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,450
If you don't want to sit there,

403
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,370
you can wait for the next one.

404
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:07,360
Please.

405
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,010
Put your hands in the overhead lap bars...

406
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:13,760
Please fasten your seat belts.

407
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,220
Thank you.

408
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,300
Pull it to a position that suits you,

409
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,340
and fasten it.

410
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,760
There's a seat belt below.

411
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,380
Put your hands in the overhead lap bars...

412
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,210
Starlight,

413
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,000
pull this down.

414
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,420
Fasten your seat belt.

415
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,860
Don't be nervous. It's nothing.

416
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,900
Is it, Mr. Shen?

417
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:47,830
Starlight,

418
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,250
are you ready?

419
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,090
Don't be afraid, Sister.

420
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,140
We're almost there.

421
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,520
It's so high.

422
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,130
It's so exciting!

423
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,530
Is it fun, Starlight?

424
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:30,920
It's nothing.

425
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,880
Yeah.

426
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,940
-Ladies and gentlemen,
-It's so exciting.

427
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,150
we took

428
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:45,980
many photos of you

429
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,770
when you were playing.

430
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,270
You can take a look here.

431
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,810
You can bring a souvenir home.

432
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,760
Sir,

433
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,970
do you want to take a souvenir home?

434
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,050
We have a lot of photos here,

435
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:53,880
please take a look.

436
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,590
It's too exciting.

437
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,840
Isn't it fun?

438
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,710
There's more.

439
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,580
And these.

440
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,250
Look at that photo.

441
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,080
So ugly.

442
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,200
It's very memorable.

443
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,730
Brother,

444
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,190
let's play something else.

445
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,440
What do you want to play?

446
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,850
I'll accompany you. Let's go.

447
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,640
Don't you want one?

448
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,290
[Sharpshooter]

449
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,030
Sir,

450
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,530
what's the rule?

451
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,570
Twenty yuan per time.

452
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,610
There're 30 bullets in it.

453
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,900
If you hit all of them,

454
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,440
you can get

455
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,440
the biggest doll.

456
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:40,430
Starlight,

457
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,390
do you want to play?

458
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,220
I think I'll miss the target.

459
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,220
Let's do it together.

460
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,390
Brother,

461
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,340
do you play?

462
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,300
I'm an adult...

463
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,500
Xia Mo.

464
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,120
I'll play with you.

465
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,870
Good.

466
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,910
You first.

467
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,190
Let me test the gun for you.

468
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,470
Again.

469
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,960
One, two, three.

470
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,620
Let me do it.

471
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,890
Bingo!

472
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
Shen Junyao,

473
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,460
you're amazing.

474
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,920
Do you want me to teach you?

475
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,500
Sure.

476
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,410
Here.

477
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,900
Bingo!

478
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,820
OK. Again.

479
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,650
Mr. Lin Heng,

480
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:23,890
do you want to play?

481
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,730
Let's play together.

482
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,850
Sir,

483
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,050
please give us a gun.

484
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,180
Okay, pay me 20 yuan. Thank you.

485
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,250
Mr. Lin Heng, I didn't bring any money.

486
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,830
I have.

487
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,910
Here, your gun.

488
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:41,620
Thank you.

489
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,360
Mr. Lin Heng, you paid the bill.

490
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,360
You go first.

491
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
Again.

492
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,480
Good. Again.

493
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,470
Entertain yourself.

494
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,300
-Xia Mo.
-Mr. Lin Heng.

495
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,500
It's okay, Sister.

496
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,420
Mr. Lin Heng

497
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,370
missed all targets.

498
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,200
It's okay. I'll help him.

499
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,160
You guys continue.

500
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,910
OK.

501
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,030
Mr. Lin Heng, don't be discouraged.

502
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:12,780
Come on.

503
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,980
Hold it like this.

504
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,840
Hold your hand here.

505
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,340
Put this one here.

506
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,330
Hold tight.

507
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,370
Look

508
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,280
from here to here.

509
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,110
Let go.

510
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,020
Mr. Lin Heng, focus.

511
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,150
Three, two, one.

512
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,130
I'm amazing.

513
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,710
Mr. Lin Heng,

514
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,250
you're great.

515
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,040
You hit 25 targets in total.

516
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,490
Please register here.

517
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,950
We'll send this doll

518
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,110
to your home.

519
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,190
Mr. Lin Heng, keep up the good work.

520
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,570
Starlight,

521
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,650
let's not disturb Mr. Lin Heng.

522
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:07,980
He's practicing shooting.

523
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,730
Let's go.

524
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,730
OK.

525
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:11,930
Come on, Mr. Lin Heng.

526
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,010
Are you done?

527
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,340
Yes.

528
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,130
Let's go play

529
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:17,960
Sky Sailor later.

530
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,460
Aren't you coming with us?

531
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,290
Mr. Lin Heng has to practice shooting.

532
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,120
Let's go first.

533
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,700
Fighting.

534
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,190
I'll play next time.

535
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,410
Sister,

536
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,620
the roller coaster

537
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,570
was really interesting.

538
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:54,650
Yeah.

539
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,320
I've been yelling all day.

540
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,860
I'm hungry.

541
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,350
Have a seat.

542
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,460
Thank you.

543
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,090
Brother,

544
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,670
Mr. Lin Heng is such a gentleman.

545
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,080
You should learn more,

546
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,700
especially in front of your girlfriend.

547
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,440
Xia Mo,

548
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,770
come here.

549
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,220
I'm so happy today.

550
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,760
I'll bring you here next time.

551
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,000
Buy it if you want.

552
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,450
Can I?

553
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,240
Sister,

554
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,980
I'll go with you.

555
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,770
Remember to bring money.

556
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,940
Don't blackmail me.

557
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,140
The common response to this

558
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,350
should be...

559
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,060
Who's sister is so stingy?

560
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,260
You're the stingy one.

561
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,510
I won't let you eat it if you keep saying this.

562
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:05,920
Starlight.

563
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,410
Why are you two here?

564
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,330
Don't try to fool me.

565
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,610
Did you secretly track me?

566
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,150
But

567
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,020
it wasn't my idea to do this.

568
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,520
Brother asked me to do it.

569
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,770
Shen Junyao?

570
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,470
Isn't he busy with work?

571
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,220
Judging from the situation,

572
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,880
he's been busy with work.

573
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:29,750
But

574
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,710
he cares more about you

575
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,210
than work.

576
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,500
He's worried about you,

577
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,620
so he came to you.

578
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,160
He likes you a lot.

579
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,360
W-What are you talking about?

580
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,270
I'm not talking nonsense.

581
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,310
He really likes you.

582
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,480
But

583
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,060
he didn't have the courage,

584
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,180
and didn't know how to say it.

585
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,880
Stop talking nonsense.

586
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,960
People like Shen Junyao

587
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,080
wouldn't like me.

588
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:58,960
Sister,

589
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,830
I don't know

590
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,120
what kind of people

591
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,410
you're referring to.

592
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,490
But

593
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,400
AI

594
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,940
has great calculation ability.

595
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,860
Besides,

596
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,610
my system has been updated very quickly.

597
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,940
And I have learned a lot.

598
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,020
As the saying goes,

599
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,680
the spectators see the chess game better than the players.

600
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,180
However,

601
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,630
human emotions are complicated.

602
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,500
You can't get a conclusion

603
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,670
through some data.

604
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,750
So,

605
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,660
don't make this kind of analysis anymore.

606
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,200
Would you believe it

607
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,950
if Lin Heng said he liked you?

608
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,940
H-How did you know?

609
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,230
Do you forget

610
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,730
I'm an AI robot?

611
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:42,760
But

612
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,510
even if he likes me,

613
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,010
I won't like him.

614
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,500
I

615
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,590
just

616
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,170
respect him as an idol.

617
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,960
You don't know his past.

618
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,290
He was a blogger who was making videos about neo-traditional content

619
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,570
without many fans from the beginning.

620
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,320
He had no money or support.

621
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,030
He had to face all kinds of problems

622
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,070
and criticism

623
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,320
by himself.

624
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,270
It's really hard

625
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,480
to reach this position.

626
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:05,810
Besides,

627
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,850
I agreed

628
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:07,850
to come out with him,

629
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,300
just because

630
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,510
he took a video for me.

631
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,340
I wanted to repay him.

632
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,250
My dad told me

633
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,540
that we shouldn't owe others.

634
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:19,990
I see.

635
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:27,570
Who misses me

636
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,860
so much at dinner time?

637
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,730
It must be my daughter.

638
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,390
Your daughter?

639
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,640
How dare you mention your daughter?

640
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,550
She has been out for days,

641
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,380
but you didn't care about her.

642
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,130
This kid

643
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,830
is always a troublemaker.

644
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,170
I wonder how's her life

645
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,290
in Zhenhai.

646
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,780
Why is she like you?

647
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,570
You could have

648
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,700
a good future,

649
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,570
but you wanted to go back to your hometown.

650
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,020
You achieved nothing for the rest of your life.

651
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,940
But

652
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,430
your daughter

653
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,390
wanted to go to the big city.

654
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,180
If we had known it,

655
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,430
you should have

656
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,220
stayed in Zhenhai

657
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,670
and tried to get a good job.

658
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,300
It's been years.

659
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,500
Why are you bringing it up again?

660
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,580
I'm just talking about our daughter.

661
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,250
What's the point?

662
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,120
Book two tickets.

663
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:13,950
We will visit her

664
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,360
a few days later.

665
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,440
She only tells good news.

666
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,520
I'm worried.

667
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,860
She's an adult.

668
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,770
There's nothing to worry about.

669
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,180
Don't worry, boss.

670
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,050
I'll book the tickets tomorrow.

671
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,620
Starlight.

672
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,860
What's wrong, Mr. Lin Heng?

673
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,780
I heard you called Xia Mo...

674
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,520
Sister.

675
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,230
What's your relationship?

676
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,350
Since I was calling her Sister,

677
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,930
then we're siblings.

678
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:51,930
Xia Mo never mentioned

679
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,930
that she had a younger brother.

680
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,470
Besides,

681
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,090
you don't look alike.

682
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,420
Since you don't think so,

683
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,540
what do you think

684
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,540
our relationship is,

685
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,960
then it is.

686
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,580
Since you asked me a question,

687
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,870
I'll

688
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,490
ask you a question.

689
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,990
What's your relationship

690
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,150
with Xia Mo?

691
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,610
I like her.

692
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,930
I don't believe it.

693
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,930
Your eyelids didn't change

694
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,510
when you were talking.

695
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,550
And the corners of your mouth slightly went down.

696
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,500
Your breath was short but steady.

697
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,710
These signs reflected

698
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,830
that you were pretending.

699
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,910
I don't know

700
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:34,900
why you lied

701
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,940
about it.

702
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,820
But people

703
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,850
always like to do that.

704
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,890
The movie is about to start.

705
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:45,850
I'll go in first.

706
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,300
Wait.

707
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,250
I'm curious.

708
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,420
Your brother treats you so nice.

709
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:54,830
Does he know

710
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,000
you like Xia Mo?

711
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,530
Maybe

712
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,940
he knows.
