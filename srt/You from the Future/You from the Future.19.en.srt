that easily irritated?

199
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,750
We're friends after all.

200
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,550
I'm worried about him.

201
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,280
Besides,

202
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,430
he helped me a lot.

203
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,150
So

204
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,590
are you going to the hospital to visit him?

205
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,510
Not really.

206
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,880
But it’s okay

207
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,670
for me to send him a message

208
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,620
and ask if he’s okay, right?

209
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,310
Do it.

210
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,110
You’re supposed to.

211
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,080
[Lin Heng]

212
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,059
Mr. Lin Heng.

213
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,350
I heard that your studio caught fire.

214
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,460
Are you okay?

215
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,510
Mission completed.

216
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,620
Let’s continue the search.

217
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,980
Shen Junyao.

218
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,260
Look.

219
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,670
It's so dangerous.

220
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,820
You're too tall.

221
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,780
Let me do it.

222
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,990
Hold this for me.

223
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,780
Wait for me.

224
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,140
Be careful.

225
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,900
Don't worry.

226
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,540
Xia Mo.

227
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,900
You have a call.

228
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,150
Is it my parents?

229
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,600
[Expert Lin Heng]

230
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,300
No.

231
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,570
Please answer it for me.

232
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,300
[Expert Lin Heng]

233
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,780
Hello.

234
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,820
Miss Xia.

235
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,070
What is it?

236
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,500
I'm calling Xia Mo.

237
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,270
Why are you answering?

238
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,480
I’m

239
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,390
with my girlfriend.

240
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,850
Tell me.

241
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,580
What is it?

242
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,070
Please give Xia Mo the phone.

243
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,580
It's between me and her.

244
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,430
You can’t take a message.

245
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,080
It seems

246
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,020
you don’t have anything important to say.

247
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,600
We happen to

248
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,500
have something important to do.

249
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,300
I have to go.

250
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,460
Pan,

251
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,140
go straight to the exhibition center.

252
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,950
Brother.

253
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,140
Miss Xia…

254
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,510
Don't worry.

255
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,620
Xia Mo will help me.

256
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,340
Be careful.

257
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:10,910
Here.

258
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,930
Look.

259
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:12,780
I got it.

260
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,760
♫Looking at the stars in the sky♫

261
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,680
♫The blues are suddenly gone♫

262
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,930
♫When you close your eyes♫

263
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,050
♫Whose figure is it?♫

264
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,470
♫Are you not sleeping either♫

265
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,760
♫Thinking of someone too?♫

266
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,790
The signal is bad.

267
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,700
I told you.

268
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,730
Hello, Mom.

269
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,600
I'm blind.

270
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,680
I need to go to the hospital.

271
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,650
Our first card.

272
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,740
There are 40 cards in total.

273
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,060
We have to work harder

274
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,300
if we want to win.

275
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,820
It's about participation.

276
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:18,780
By the way,

277
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,820
who called me just now?

278
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,220
Mr. Lin Heng?

279
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,860
What did he say?

280
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,770
How is he now?

281
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,500
I hung up.

282
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,780
You hung up?

283
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,430
He must have called me

284
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,390
for something.

285
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:37,980
How could you...

286
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,820
Do you care so much about him?

287
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,100
It's not about whether I care or not.

288
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,600
He's my friend.

289
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,230
And now he...

290
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,420
Will a friend confess to you?

291
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,660
Shen Junyao.

292
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,430
I know

293
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,580
you feel insecure in love

294
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,740
because of your family.

295
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,510
But I hope

296
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,800
you can trust my character

297
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,250
and my attitude towards love.

298
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:05,850
If

299
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,820
your vigilance and suspicion of me

300
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,730
goes beyond your trust in me,

301
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,620
it'll never work

302
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,980
even if we get together.

303
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:19,580
Xia…

304
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,540
You're still looking for it.

305
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,430
It seems

306
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,660
that we will be the first place.

307
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,420
No way.

308
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,090
Zhang Qian has found it?

309
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,020
Where is he?

310
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,060
He...

311
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,440
He ran too fast.

312
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,580
I couldn't catch up with him.

313
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,310
All right, I'll stop here.

314
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,570
Get cracking with your search.

315
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,300
She’s being ridiculous.

316
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,410
-Let's go. -Let's go.

317
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,140
Tang Tang.

318
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,650
Hello?

319
00:12:59,590 --> 00:12:59,950
Okay.

320
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:00,660
Did you find them?

321
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,740
Here you are.

322
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,610
Thank you for your encouragement.

323
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,670
Now I feel

324
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,970
full of power.

325
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,470
Go find more then.

326
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,730
Qin, wait for me.

327
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,450
You're such a flatterer.

328
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,020
Miss Tang.

329
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,540
Bad Shen Junyao.

330
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,930
He went too far.

331
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,250
Should I send a message

332
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,290
to apologize to Mr. Lin Heng?

333
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:52,620
Forget it.

334
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,990
Shen Junyao will get upset

335
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,090
if he sees it.

336
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:57,970
Miss Xia.

337
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,650
Who are you?

338
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,170
I'm Junyao's ex-girlfriend.

339
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,140
My name is Chen Xiangyun.

340
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,980
Ex-girlfriend?

341
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,970
What do you want from me?

342
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,020
I saw the news

343
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,730
about you and Junyao.

344
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,250
So

345
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,730
I want to talk to you.

346
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,340
What do you want to talk about?

347
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,700
Junyao’s grandpa

348
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,250
is the president of Jiuyu Group.

349
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,330
And he’s the president of Stan.

350
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,610
He chose to be with you.

351
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,410
So I'm curious about your identity.

352
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,850
Sorry.

353
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,500
I have no identity

354
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,340
that deserves your curiosity.

355
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,130
I’m just an ordinary girl.

356
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,330
My parents are in my hometown.

357
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,970
Miss Xia.

358
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,410
With all due respect,

359
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,460
there is a huge gap

360
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,410
between you and Junyao.

361
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,410
Will you be happy

362
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,530
with him?

363
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,120
Junyao must be surrounded with

364
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,410
many girls

365
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,310
that either look pretty

366
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,010
or have good backgrounds.

367
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,090
Don't you have any worries

368
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,730
when you're with him?

369
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,810
Ms. ex-girlfriend.

370
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,330
I think you're overthinking.

371
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,100
I think the most important thing

372
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,860
in a relationship

373
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,290
is mutual trust.

374
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:22,970
I believe

375
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,850
Shen Junyao will always like me.

376
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,050
Besides,

377
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,610
if someone wants to sow discord,

378
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,770
Shen Junyao will kick her out.

379
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,380
Since you are so sure

380
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,530
about your relationship,

381
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,320
forget I said that.

382
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,730
Crazy.

383
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,250
Was I wrong?

384
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,860
[It's all my fault. Don't be angry. You don't look good when you're angry]

385
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,360
I can’t believe I met his ex-girlfriend.

386
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,710
Did Shen Junyao

387
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,890
plan this?

388
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,280
Xia Mo.

389
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,650
Shen Junyao?

390
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:49,890
You...

I have something to tell you.

392
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,170
I was too reckless just now.

393
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,880
I didn't consider your feelings.

394
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,280
Actually,

395
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,800
I was wrong too.

396
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,440
I was too harsh.

397
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,200
No.

398
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,930
If someone did this to me,

399
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,920
my attitude would be worse than yours.

400
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,390

in the name of liking you.

403
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,839
That's not what I meant.

404
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,089
I won't do it again.

405

Just tell me

what you want to do.

407
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,030
I will trust you

408
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,680
and support you unconditionally.

409
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,200
Actually,

410
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,800
Mr. Lin Heng

411
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,880
is more like

412
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,610
a mental pillar

413
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,890
than an idol for me.

414
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,740
When I first learned

415
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,160
hanfu design,

416
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,450
I was criticized and laughed at

417
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,160
just like him.

418
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,320
His experience

419
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,320
gave me strength and confidence

420
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,610
to insist all along.

421
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,600
OK.

But I saw

434
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,040
your ex-girlfriend just now.

435

She also told me

436
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,320
there must be a lot of girls

437

around you

438
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,040
since you're so outstanding

439
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,450
and I won’t be happy

with you.

I don't know

442
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,480
why she was here.

443
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,640
But I told her

444
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,600
the most important thing

445
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,720
was mutual trust

446
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,240
and I believe

447
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,720

That's not the point.

The point is

452
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,440
about the question you asked me yesterday,

453
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,010

Are you sure you've thought it through?

00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,600
I was too impulsive just now.

00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,930
the first prize

585
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,390
of this team building event is...

586
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,370
A set of Stantech T4 robot

587
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,230
source codes.

588
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:06,720
What?

589
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,390
Source codes?

590
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,390
What is that?

591
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,150
What's the use of it?

592
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,030
We’ve worked my ass off

593
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,290
for nothing.

594
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,040
Exactly.

595
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,030
Since the source codes can't be leaked,

596
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:19,880
so those who win the source codes

597
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,870
this time

598
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,130
can exchange it for the right to use

599
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,670
a set of property rights under the Jiuyu Group.

600
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,030
Mr. Shen.

601
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:27,950
You're so generous.

602
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,890
Maggie made a fortune this time.

603
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,720
Oh my god.

604
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,310
All right.

605
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,590
I hope you can keep working hard.

606
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,360
This activity has ended successfully.

607
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:35,870
Thank you.

608
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,150
Okay.

609
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,150
Mom.

610
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,070
Dad.

611
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,730
How long has it been

612
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,990
since you guys took a vacation together?

613
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,430
The set ticket for a 7-day trip.

614
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,580
It’s worth tens of thousands of yuan.

615
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,310
This expensive?

616
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,810
Why do you

617
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,170
spend so much money on it?

618
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,190
Silly girl.

619
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,470
Xia, hurry up.

620
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,910
Ask your friends

621
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,710
if anyone wants to go out.

622
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,440
We can sell the tickets to them

623
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,790
at a lower price.

624
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,470
Let me ask.

625
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,400
No, no.

626
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,590
You can't sell this.

627
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,400
You can only use it yourself.

628
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,190
Really?

629
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,020
It's rare that our daughter is so considerate.

630
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,790
Let’s just go.

631
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,830
Look how comprehensive it is.

632
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,670
There's a pick-up service.

633
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,990
It's quite comprehensive.

634
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,430
You want to go?

635
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,150
We just came to Zhenhai.

636
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,390
I was thinking of cleaning up the house

637
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,470
and cooking something nice

638
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,340
for our daughter.

639
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:38,870
Mom.

640
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,260
How old am I?

641
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,580
Besides, the National Day Holiday is coming.

642
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,430
By then,

643
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,900
I’ll go back and do labor for you.

644
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,830
You?

645
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,910
You're just like your dad.

646
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,100
You are both lazy.

647
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,070
Forget it.

648
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,260
I'll go back to my room and pack.

649
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,100
Well.

650
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,900
Tang Tang, Shen,

651
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,470
please take care of Xia Mo.

652
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,230
Don't worry.

653
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:01,950
Uncle, Auntie,

654
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,040
I’ll take good care of

655
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,310
Xia Mo.

656
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,670
Ask her to find a boyfriend.

657
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,100
How old is she?

658
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,030
She’s not ashamed of this.

659
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,740
Yes.

660
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,430
Alright.

661
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,270
I'll go pack up too,

662
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,100
or your mom will nag me again.

663
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,740
Do it well, Dad.

664
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,150
It's finally over.

665
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,800
Aren't you afraid

666
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,070
that your parents will come back

667
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,270
after the trip?

668
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,550
Shut up.

669
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,240
Do you want to find a chance

670
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,860
to pretend to be a couple with Tang Tang?

671
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,350
Can you not bring me along

672
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,020
when flirting?

673
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,230
Should I

674
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,420
call Qin Xiang

675
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,630
and ask him to come to you?

676
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,300
No need.

677
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,100
He's going home to cook.

678
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,640
If there's nothing else,

679
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,340
I'll leave now.

680
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,350
I won’t

681
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,100
disturb you two.

682
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,270
Let me see you off.

683
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,100
Hurry up.

684
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:19,900
Xia.

685
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,180
What's wrong, boss?

686
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,740
We’re going to the beach.

687
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,670
But how can we take photos

688
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,100
without a swimsuit?

689
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,860
Taking photos?

690
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,940
Aren't we wearing swimsuits to swim?

691
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,820
You should've gone to the countryside to farm.

692
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,980
Help me find it.

693
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,060
See if there's a swimsuit at home.

694
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,710
Swimsuits are intimate things.

695
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,380
Can't we buy one?

696
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,220
Besides, you can't wear

697
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,740
our daughter's swimsuit either.

698
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,470
You're starting to dislike me, aren't you?

699
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,440
Who was it

700
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,310
that was clinging to me in the first place?

701
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,460
Buy one?

702
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,060
It must be expensive.

703
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,030
How much will it cost?

704
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,860
Why are you still standing here?

705
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,050
Go find it.

706
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:56,620
Boss.

707
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,340
I'm looking for it now.

708
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,460
Our daughter can't even swim.

709
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,820
Where can I find it for you?

710
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,380
Why don't I check upstairs?

711
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,180
This is the T-series smart home appliance

712
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,460
my teacher developed back in the day.

713
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,990
Why is it in our house?

714
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,180
[The alarm has been lifted]
