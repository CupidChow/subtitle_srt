381
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,790
you'll be full of hope.

382
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,090
Xia Mo, you...

383
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,100
You're leaving tomorrow.

384
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,930
Can't you behave yourself tonight?

385
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
I'm sorry.

386
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,250
Are you okay?

387
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,200
I'm fine.

388
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,120
I saw a man

389
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,870
in the room.

390
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,490
So...

391
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,360
A man?

392
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,230
Brother, I heard a voice.

393
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,810
Don't run around again.

394
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,220
It's time to rest,

395
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,550
so I found a room

396
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,380
to sleep in.

397
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,710
But

398
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,290
I didn't know there was someone in the guest room.

399
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,910
Sorry, Miss Xia.

400
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,200
I scared you.

401
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,870
You are...

402
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,780
You're that...

403
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,360
Starlight.

404
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,440
Come and sleep

405
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,230
in my room tonight.

406
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,100
I'll go wash up now.

407
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,260
Do robots

408
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,710
need to sleep too?

409
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,000
It's none of your business.

410
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,850
Brother, do you want to wash first?

411
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,300
No.

412
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,550
Go ahead.

413
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,200
I saw you got hurt.

414
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,410
Here.

415
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,030
No, thanks.

416
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,180
You're bleeding and you're still denying it?

417
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:00,940
I...

418
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,060
Let me bandage it for you.

419
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,890
If the bleeding doesn't stop,

420
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,310
you have to go to the hospital.

421
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:09,970
You know how to do this?

422
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,510
I learned it from videos on Candy.

423
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:15,880
Sit.

424
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,850
It might hurt.

425
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,390
Hang in there.

426
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,120
Hang in there.

427
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,210
♫Looking at the stars in the sky♫

428
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,130
♫The blues are suddenly gone♫

429
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:59,380
♫When you close your eyes♫

430
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,500
♫Whose figure is it?♫

431
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,920
♫Are you not sleeping either♫

432
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,210
♫Thinking of someone too?♫

433
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:18,350
♫I like to bicker with you for no reason♫

434
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,920
♫This time I miss you♫

435
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,910
♫I confess♫

436
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,610
♫Meeting you might've been an accident♫

437
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,580
♫But I anticipate it every day♫

438
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:43,320
♫I confess my love to you♫

439
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:47,830
♫I can no longer pretend I'm not in love♫

440
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,270
♫I'm relying on you unconsciously♫

441
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:54,930
It's bandaged.

442
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,840
Luckily, the wound isn't deep,

443
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,500
but I think

444
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,540
it's best for you

445
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,380
to get a tetanus shot.

446
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,040
Are you a medical student?

447
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,580
How come you know this?

448
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,740
I often attend

449
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,740
classical Chinese conventions.

450
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,410
Many people

451
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:09,950
bump around and get hurt.

452
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,230
and then I got used to it.

453
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:15,600
So,

454
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,220
you wanted to join Candy's classical Chinese channel,

455
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,180
but you got switched to edit otoMADs.

456
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,510
How did you know?

457
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,300
But if I have to do otoMADs,

458
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,420
then so be it.

459
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,380
At least I can see my prince charming

460
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,580
at Candy's parties.

461
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,080
Prince charming?

462
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,120
It's Lin Hang.

463
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,820
He's super attractive,

464
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,820
especially when he wears the hanfu.

465
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,230
He gives off

466
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,480
a gentlemanly feeling.

467
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,020
He looks a bit

468
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,060
like that robot too.

469
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,680
You mean Starlight?

470
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,380
Where's Starlight?

471
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,170
He's showering.

472
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,250
Showering?

473
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,280
Aren't you afraid he'll rust?

474
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,740
The internal structure of T9 robots

475
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,780
is liquid metal.

476
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,980
The outside

477
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,440
is made of artificial skin.

478
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,520
It won't rust.

479
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,430
Then,

480
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,220
will he short circuit?

481
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:14,970
What do you think?

482
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,920
No wonder you wouldn't let me tell anyone.

483
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,000
If others know

484
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,910
there is a robot

485
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,160
who looks exactly like a real person,

486
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,950
I bet

487
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,650
it will cause social unrest.

488
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,530
It's not that extreme.

489
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,190
I just hope

490
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,390
he can live with me

491
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,520
like a normal person

492
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,890
and not be disturbed by others.

493
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:40,800
Don't worry.

494
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,550
I promise I won't tell anyone.

495
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,000
Even if I move out,

496
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,500
I'll keep it a secret for you.

497
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,330
You may leave if there's nothing else.

498
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,070
[Qin Xiang]

499
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,440
Shen Junyao,

500
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,560
you actually watch my videos?

501
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,270
When did you film it?

502
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,060
Delete it!

503
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,390
Let me answer the phone first.

504
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,050
No.

505
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,720
-I didn't say I won't delete it.
-Delete it.

506
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,420
You...

507
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,800
My waist. My waist.

508
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,490
[Qin Xiang]

509
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,650
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed

510
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,150
is unavailable.

511
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,730
Please try again later.

512
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,090
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed...

513
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,220
[Mr. Shen]

514
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,840
[Mr. Shen, I'll wash the car tomorrow and pick you up at the company]

515
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,500
Brother,

516
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,500
Is Miss Xia bullying you?

517
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,580
Adults shouldn't fight.

518
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,360
I...

519
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,900
I'm playing games with your brother.

520
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,690
If there's nothing else,

521
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,390
I'll go back and rest now.

522
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,180
I won't bother you anymore.

523
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,140
Good night, Miss Xia.

524
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,930
Good night.

525
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,380
Brother, do you want to take a shower

526
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,630
before we sleep together?

527
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,030
You came out?

528
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,150
Don't you want to sleep with Starlight?

529
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,520
It's better to sleep with you.

530
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,180
Why don't you step aside?

531
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,340
Why is he like this?
