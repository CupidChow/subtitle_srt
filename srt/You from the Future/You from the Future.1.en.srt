00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,400
No need.

187
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,880

384
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,560
are you?

385
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,530
These phones were not used

386
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,440
in the company's tests.

387
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,280
Go on.

388
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,410
Second,

389
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,730
give my suitcase back.

390
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,440
And the third thing.

391
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,450
This house belongs to my dad.

392
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,930
The real estate license is in the suitcase.

393
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,170
I can show you.

394
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,570
I'm moving back to Zhenhai.

395
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,960
I'm going to take back

396
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,130
this house.

397
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:48,840
Sure.

398
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,520
The suitcase is downstairs.

399
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,600
I'll bring it upstairs later.

400
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,530
But

401
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,080
I need your help.

402
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,120
What is it?

403
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,770
Post a statement online,

404
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,290
saying you just ran into me

405
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,250
and have nothing to do with me.

406
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,000
I don't want to.

407
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,920
I don't want to be surrounded by reporters.

408
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,330
Okay.

409
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,140
Then let's talk about

410
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,880
the house.

411
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,130
How about this?

412
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,410
The house will expire soon.

413
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:16,940
I won't charge you

414
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,920
the rest.

415
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,010
And then I'll pay you a month's worth of

416
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:19,770
liquidated damages.

417
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,410
And then?

418
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,840
Then?

419
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:23,940
The house was remodeled

420
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,160
for a total of six million yuan.

421
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,180
It cost 25 million yuan

422
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,410
to dismantle all the equipment.

423
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,810
I can give you a discount.

424
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,530
Prepare 30 million yuan

425
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,810
before the end of the month.

426
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,180
30 million yuan?

427
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,320
Are you robbing me?

[Rent Agreement]

429
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,760
The contract clearly states

430
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,360
that I have the first right to renew the contract.

431
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,960
And I've kept all the receipts.

432
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,440
Of course,

433
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,860
if you're willing to

434
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,690
post the statement on the Internet,

Mr. Shen.

439
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,160
Are you sure you want

440
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,460
to salvage

441
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,890

444
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,319

that Miss Xia's statement

453

469
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,130

You don't have to do it.

00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,760
it's just in case.

478

482
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,840
You don't need to post the statement for now.

483
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,760

And

517

he won't charge me for compensation.

518
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,680
He can also give back the house to me.

519
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,410
Do you think I should sign it?

520
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,600
No.

521
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,180
Won't you be his mistress that way?

522

something seems to have happened to his company.

525
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,760
He seems anxious.

526
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,800
And he said

527
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,250
nothing would happen between us.

528

533
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,480
That makes sense. You're the best.

But

539
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,920
I'm afraid of being surrounded by reporters.

540
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,730
I think this neighborhood

541
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,800
has good security.

542
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,640
Why don't

544
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,360
You'll live here?

545
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,490
How much space

546
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,800
can I take alone?

547

And I promise

548
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,480
I won't run around.

549
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,560
What about me?

550
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,690
You...

551
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,360
You are so rich.

552
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,240
You must have more than one house.

553

And it's only for three months.

554
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,560

560
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,330
Isn't the bed big?

561
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,970
This house is much better-decorated

562
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,200
than it was ten years ago.

563
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,080
Of course.

564
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,200
Let me show you

566
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,040

An open kitchen.

569
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,080
It's changed a lot, right?

570
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,360
Isn't the decoration

571
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,120
so fashionable

572
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,200
and classy?

573
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,400
I'm sure you'll like it.

574
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,000
Let's go to the basement then.

575
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:52,880
Look.

576
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,960
Such a big table.

577
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,220
You and my dad

578
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,800
can play billiards

579
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,810
and exercise here.

580
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,080
Such a big wine cabinet.

581
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,770
You and my dad can

582
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,040
have a drink

583
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,680
and share some romance

584
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,810
here.

585
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,890
What does your dad know about romance?

586
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,940
Let me show you

587
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,760
other rooms.

588
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:09,690
Let's go.

589
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:14,890
Mom.

590
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,020
Let me show you

591
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,010
the fourth floor underground.

592
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,530
The fourth floor underground.

593
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,320
Why is the signal cut off?

594
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,770
What happened?

595
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,440
Is there a power outage?

596
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,720
There's no signal either.

597
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,360
Turn on the flashlight.

598
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,330
Good evening, Mr. Shen.

599
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,240
Someone entered B4 in the elevator.

600
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,780
Elevator use is currently suspended

601
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,010
by power control,

602
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,120
but there is no way to prevent the door from being opened manually.

603
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,450
Don't show up.

604
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,720
I'll go back now.

605
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,770
Okay, Mr. Shen.

606
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,440
What a crappy elevator!

607
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,810
It just broke down like this.

608
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,330
I can't open the door.

609
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,690
The elevator is broken.

610
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,960
Is this the exit?

611
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,440
You...

612
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,960
You...

613
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,840
Hello.

614
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,330
Can you let me out?

615
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,920
Didn't you promise me

616
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,920
not to

617
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,890
walk around?

618
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,400
Mr. Shen,

619
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,090
please be generous.

620
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,130
How about this?

621
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,280
I don't want the house anymore.

622
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,530
I won't tell anyone

623
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,650
what happened today.

624
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,360
Miss Xia,

625
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,840
from now on,

626
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,280
the moment

627
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,140
you leave the house,

628
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,280
without my permission,

629
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,100
you'll receive

630
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,050
a lawyer's letter.
