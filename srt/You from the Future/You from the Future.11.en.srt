[Episode 11]

4
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,200
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,560
I didn't expect the video would be damaged.

6
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,680
This is not the time to talk about this.

7
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,970
Stantech has been in charge of

8
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,280
the Web-based technical support for Candy.

9
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,370
So I need to make sure

10
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,610
whether the video on your computer

11
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,570
is data corruption

12
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,890
or physical corruption.

13
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,120
It should be

14
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,520
data corruption.

15
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,170
How did you know?

16
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,810
Because I sent the video

17
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,040
to the director too.

18
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,920
Even if my computer was broken,

19
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,160
she should be able to receive it.

20
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,449
But she said

21
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,400
she couldn't open

22
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,370
the video in the email either.

23
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:14,930
Brother.

24
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,320
There is only one reason

25
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,050
for this.

26
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,420
That is her computer

27
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,320
got a virus.

28
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,060
Take your computer

29
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,930
and go home with me.

30
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,120
We'll wait for you downstairs.

31
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,840
It's okay, Sister.

32
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,800
Let's go.

33
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,450
Xia Mo, where are you going?

34
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,840
Shen Junyao asked me to go out.

35
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,800
Maybe he's trying to

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,980
to get the video back.

37
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,760
Right.

38
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,610
Why haven't I thought of it?

39
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,240
Don't we

40
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,690
have a tech guru here?

41
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,290
Forget it.

42
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,040
I'm done with it.

43
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,390
My hands are sore.

44
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,050
Come on.

45
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,090
You just made up the music.

46
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,300
It took you

47
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:11,920
less than three hours.

48
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,530
How long did Xia Mo work on it?

49
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,120
Exactly.

50
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,840
Don't blame me.

51
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,860
You just made

52
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,960
a cheap special effect too.

53
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,650
Forget it, Xia Xia.

54
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,890
Go get the video back.

55
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,079
Let's go out for a big dinner tonight.

56
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,770
I'm really sorry.

57
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,130
I will try my best

58
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,160
to get the video back.

59
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,850
I'm going.

60
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,240
OK, I see.

61
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,800
Qin Xiang has investigated it.

62
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,290
Candy

63
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,180
has been disconnected

64
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,120
since Friday afternoon.

65
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,320
The specific reason is still under investigation.

66
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,250
If the Internet was disconnected,

67
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,530
the virus couldn't

68
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,720
get in the computer.

69
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,440
There's only one situation.

70
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,930
Someone sneaked into the company

71
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,960
and implanted the virus into Xia Mo's computer.

72
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,360
Don't tell her about this.

73
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,140
We'll talk about it

74
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,400
after the press conference.

75
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,280
Where are we going now?

76
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,250
Home.

77
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,680
Danika.

78
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,100
Perform hardware analysis

79
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,970
and stress testing.

80
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,680
Okay, Mr. Shen.

81
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,610
Do you need me to enter the data world

82
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,050
to conduct an identity test?

83
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:32,650
Yes.

84
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,720
This is so smart.

85
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,320
That's why ¥30 million

86
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,530
wasn't much to ask for in the first place.

87
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,650
Brother's lab

88
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,360
is technically advanced.

89
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,650
The chips

90
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,610
were developed

91
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,530
by Stantech.

92
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,820
Therefore, we can guarantee

93
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,480
that relevant technology won't spread out of the country

94
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,730
or be stolen

95
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,160
by delinquents.

96
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,560
All data are normal.

97
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,220
Only

98
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,010
the videos and the pictures

99
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:07,800
are damaged.

100
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:08,920
Danika,

101
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,370
try data repair

102
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,370
and cache fetching.

103
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,650
Okay, Mr. Shen.

104
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,560
Xia Mo, what are you doing?

105
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,290
Stop looking.

106
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,690
Dan… Danika.

107
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,450
Can you turn off the pictures first?

108
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,680
Sorry, Miss Xia.

109
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,770
I'm not yet authorized

110
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,400
to perform the operation.

111
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:37,409
Danika.

112
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,600
Block the photos.

113
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,650
Just watch the videos.

114
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,730
Okay, Mr. Shen.

115
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,130
Mr. Shen, the video recovery failed.

116
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,280
But I found

117
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,940
a hidden Trojan horse virus.

118
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,970
Virus?

119
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,370
Release the virus.

120
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,480
Okay, Mr. Shen.

121
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:10,980
Experiencing

122
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,120
a DDoS.

123
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,920
Experiencing a ransomware attack.

124
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,040
Activate the firewall

125
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,610
and seal off the Transportation Security Agreement.

126
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,800
Okay, Mr. Shen.

127
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,530
I mean.

128
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,440
Wang.

129
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,090
Why are you so nervous?

130
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,800
President,

131
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,650
there was a major accident

132
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,090
a few days before the T5 press conference.

133
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,720
If it can't make it to the market on time

134
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,000
due to the publicity issue,

135
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,280
and word gets out,

136
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,120
it'll sabotage

137
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,360
Jiuyu Group's reputation.

138
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,560
It's just a video.

139
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,730
What could happen?

140
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,360
Let's wait and see.

141
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,140
But Miss Xia

142
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,280
and Mr. Shen haven't got married yet.

143
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,080
If they break up,

144
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,450
you will...

145
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,010
Bah.

146
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,130
Do you not want to retire?

147
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,010
You're cursing me

148
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,130
with no grandchildren, aren't you?

149
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,290
No, I'm just...

150
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,640
You're just what?

151
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,280
Enough.

152
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,100
Stop nagging.

153
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,900
Come, sit down.

154
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,880
Play chess with me.

155
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:11,730
Okay.

156
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,360
Come on.

157
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,360
You have to make concessions for my Chariot

158
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,640
due to your attitude.

159
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,480
Wait.

160
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,200
Do it for my Cannon too.

161
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,280
President.

162
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,360
Let's begin.

163
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,130
This virus,

164
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,380
if released

165
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,290
under a public network,

166
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,100
can cause widespread

167
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,920
network paralysis.

168
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,420
Many companies

169
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,600
will suffer a huge economic loss.

170
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,490
Unfortunately,

171
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,920
Sister's video can't be retrieved.

172
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,480
I'm sorry.

173
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,130
If I keep the video by force,

174
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,080
the virus will be released.

175
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,800
So I have to delete it.

176
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,560
It's okay.

177
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,540
We're just

178
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,840
taking a chance.

179
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,570
It's nice of you

180
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,440
to help me find the virus

181
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,520
and save the video from getting corrupted

182
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,690
after it's done.

183
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,860
But it's less than 24 hours

184
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,840
before the press conference.

185
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,520
If you can't finish it,

186
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,450
I can.

187
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,160
No matter what it takes,

188
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,380
I will finish the video

189
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,440
at the specified time.

190
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,280
I promise.

191
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,640
Trust me, okay?

192
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:25,920
OK.

193
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,640
I'll go to a meeting with the people of QOP

194
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,860
and ask them to try to delay it.

195
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,810
I'll go back to the company

196

215
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,050

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,530
I'll be right there.

390
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,960
Xia Xia, where are you going?

391
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,240
I just got the food for you.

392
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,800
I don't have time to eat.

393
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,490
I need to go to the equipment department

394
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,290
and go out.

395
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,160
Have you finished the video?

396
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,240
If I succeed,

397
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,600
I don't even need to make the video.

398
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,610
Hold this for me.

399
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,100
Watch out.

400
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,560
He's inside. He won't run away.

401
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,460
No way.

402
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,850
The press conference is tomorrow morning.

403
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,200
I have to edit the video after shooting it.

404
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,450
And I promised Shen Junyao

405
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,840
to give him the video.

406
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,090
You're a couple

407
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,280
of the same mind

408
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,440
so soon?

409
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,380
Stop it.

410
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,250
Let's go.

411
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:42,730
Okay.

412
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:14,319
[Lin Heng]

413
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,690
He is so popular.

414
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,280
He's indeed a celebrity.

415
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:23,569
I'm afraid

416
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,490
only the middle-aged ladies at the supermarket

417
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,720
can match this crowd.

418
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,880
Keep your voice down.

419
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,880
Don't upset them.

420
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,360
I'm praising him.

421
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,090
Stop it.

422
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,320
Get your

423
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
mall-shopping swagger on.

424
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,490
Go!

425
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,680
So handsome.

426
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,650
Look here.

427
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,660
Excuse me.

428
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,360
Excuse me.

429
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,210
See? Look here.

430
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,370
This looks good.

431
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,250
This one is good.

432
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,920
There's something wrong with the posture of this one.

433
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,040
I don't like it.

434
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,040
Let's take two more photos.

435
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,240
It's okay. There's no need.

436
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,690
Let's just use the first two.

437
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,100
Thank you for your hard work today.

438
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,780
Thank you.

439
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,730
We can call it a day.

440
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,700
Thank you.

441
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,970
He is so polite

442
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,360
to every staff.

443
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,490
Why is he so considerate?

444
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,020
He is coming towards me.

445
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,760
What are you dreaming about?

446
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,800
He is…

447
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,920
Mr. Lin Heng.

448
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,640
Miss Xia.

449
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,090
What video are we shooting today?

450
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,080
If the filming equipment

451
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,170
is not enough,

452
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,970
I can borrow it from the staff.

453
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,200
No, no.

454
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,640
I have enough equipment.

455
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,000
I can't thank you enough

456
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,010
for helping me.

457
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,770
Let's talk somewhere else.

458

461
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,690
There are too many people over there.

462
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,970
It's more convenient for us to talk here.

463
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,720
By the way, Mr. Lin Heng,

464
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,650
I've sent the script

465
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,080
to your WeChat.

466
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,500
It's mainly about

467
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,650
a battle

468
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,200
between T5 robots and ancient people.

469
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,520
In the end, T5 robots won a complete victory.

470
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,490
I'd like to invite you

471
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,090
to play the role of the ancient person.

472
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,760
Miss Xia,

473
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,420
this video is not good for

474
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,920
his usual public image.

475
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,080
It's okay.

476
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,960
I want to try

477
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,890
a new style.

479
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,600
It's all right.

480
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,500
I heard that the T5 robot of Stantech

481
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,610
is going public tomorrow.

482
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,400
Miss Xia came in a hurry.

483
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,770
It must be related to this.

484
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,960
So, I will help

485
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,560
if I can.

486
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,050
Thank you, Mr. Lin Heng.

487
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,020
Have you brought

488
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,770
the T5 robots?

489
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,680
No need.

490
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,170
I can add them by Photoshop

491
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,210
after the video is done.

492
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,290
So will you

493
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,050
be the modern person

494
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,530
that uses the T5 robots?

495
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,160
Well...

496
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,760

Your every move

499
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,890
can be noticed and magnified.

500
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,440
Please control yourself from now on

501
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,800
and don't do the flirting thing anymore.

502
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,690
It's not convenient for me.

503
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,100
Didn't you always

504
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,370
attend the ancient-style exhibition?

505
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,320
Why?

506
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,080

00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,000
Brother,

581
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,010
why do you

582
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:19,500
believe

583
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,570
Sister can do it?

584
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,690
Is it because you like her,

585
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,340
so you choose to trust her

586
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,680
unconditionally?

587
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:26,860
Didn't I have the others

588
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,240
alerted?

589
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,040
It's different, Brother.

590
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,560
Your first logic

591
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,300
is to believe

592
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,330
that Sister can finish it.

593
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,370
Your second logic

594
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,080
is to warn

595
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,360
all departments.

596
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,800
Starlight.

597
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,240
People are complicated.

598
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,300
Your algorithm logic

599
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,360
doesn't work at all.

600
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,290
Sometimes

601
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,120
when dealing with problems,

602
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,970
people don't

603
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,050
base their choice

604
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,080
on logic,

605
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,010
just like now.

606
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,330
You know

607
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,280
if Sister can't finish the video,

608
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,450
your pressure of dealing with the public opinion

609
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,450
will increase greatly.

610
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,530
But you're still waiting for her news.

611
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:02,360
Starlight.

612
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,490
Are you trying to trick me?

613
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,560
I'm just making an objective statement.

614
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,800
I'm not trying to trick you.

615
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,960
The Third Treatise on Hidden Weapons and Lawful Stones.

616
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,000
Tang Tang,

617
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,200
look more confident.

618
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,240
Think about it.

619
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,420
You have robots

620
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,490
behind you.

621
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,720
Be confident.

622
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,080
Try again.

623
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,810
Sister, have some water.

624
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,120
You've been speaking all afternoon.

625
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,800
No, thanks. I'm not thirsty.

626
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,440
Miss Xia,

627
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,440
here's the thing.

628
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,130
Actually, Lin Heng has been shooting

629
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,530
for a long time today.

630
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,650
Although we work with

631
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,610
Candy,

632
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,410
we are just

633
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,770
doing you a favor.

634
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,120
There's no contract.

635
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,400
Don't you think

636
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,930
it's enough?

637
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:54,520
It's okay.

638
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,760
Let's finish this first.

639
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,530
Brother, you've already...

640
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,600
It's fine.

641
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,410
Thank you, Mr. Lin Heng.

642
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,960
The last one.

643
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,880
The last shot.

644
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,160
Mr. Big Shot.

645
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,600
It's not too bad to

646
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,280
shoot with a beauty like me, right?

647
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,640
Of course.

648
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,240
It's my honor

649
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,610
to work with Miss Tang.

650
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,690
Let's try another one.

651
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,570
Come on.

652
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,360
I know,

653
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,040
you said so much

654
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,260
just to make me admit I like Xia Mo

655
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,570
in front of you, right?

656
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,000
No, you're not admitting to me.

657
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,200
♫Are you secretly thinking of me?♫

658
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,950
♫Where should we meet?♫

659
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,910
♫Plan it beforehand♫

660
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,010
You're admitting to your heart.

661
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,600
♫I won't let go when the future comes♫

662
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,460
♫The sunshine in the afternoon is lazy♫

663
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,450
♫It's better to have you go hiking with me♫

664
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,770
♫I'm in a rush tomorrow♫

665
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,970
♫You work with me♫

666
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,120
♫I drank half of the coffee♫

♫Imagine we'll be together in the future♫

♫Don't change it in seasons♫

669
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,410
I've never

670
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,510
lived with a girl

671
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,140
under the same roof

672
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,960
for so long.

673
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,290
I don't know

674
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,290
if that means I like her.

675
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,240
I only know

676
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,400
that if she's sad,

677
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,800
I'll be unhappy.

678
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,770
If she is happy,

679
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,000
I'll be in a good mood.

680
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,210
If she argues with me,

681
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,960
I'll feel

682
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,240
irritated.

683
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,280
Brother,

684
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,880
you like her in an unromantic way.

685
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,530
Unromantic?

686
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:31,850
Yes.

687
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,520
Am I unromantic?

688
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,330
The most uncomfortable thing is

689
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,640
Xia Mo always affects my emotions.

690
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,780
This

691
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,010
makes me feel insecure.

692
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,370
It's like being manipulated.

693
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,650
Starlight.

694
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,530
Do you know how it feels?

695
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:50,810
I understand.

696
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,220
Just like you and Sister

697
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:53,900
can control me

698
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,050
and make me do anything.

699
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,590
[Lin Heng exposed new romance? He interacted closely with a mysterious beauty in a film base...]

700
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,280
Starlight.

701
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,010
Look at this person.

702
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,160
After facial accuracy matching,

703
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,980
the probability of the person in the video

704
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,970
being Sister Xia Mo

705
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,650
is 99%.

706
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,330
[Xia Mo]

707
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,160
Hello.

708
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,090
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

709
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:34,840
Qin Xiang.

710
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,410
Ask them to prepare.

711
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,000
Wait for my notice to cancel the press conference.

712
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,000
Thank you, Mr. Lin Heng.

713
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,160
If you need anything,

714
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,200
just let me know.

715
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,410
I'll do everything I can.

716
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,090
No need.

717
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,610
It's nothing.

718
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,040
By the way,

719
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,560
are you free later?

720
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,530
Do you want to

721
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,880
dine together?

722
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,490
I'm so hungry.

723
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,330
Let's eat first, Xia Xia.

724
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,090
I...

725
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,960
If there's something to do,

726
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,280
you can go ahead and do your job.

727
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,290
Miss Tang,

728
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,330
if you don't mind,

729
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,380
let me treat you

730
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,320
for Miss Xia.

731
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,400
Thank you, Mr. Lin Heng.

732
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,600
I'll treat you to a big meal next time.

733
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,410
Deal.

734
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,420
It's quite remote here.

735
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,210
It's hard to get a taxi.

736
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,000
I'll ask Pan to give you a ride.

737
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,920
I'm afraid of causing you trouble.

738
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,080
We're friends, aren't we?

739
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,440
You don't have to be polite to me.

740
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,680
Thank you then.

741
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,960
I will always remember

742
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,730
your great kindness.

743
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,900
I didn't help you

744
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,500
to let you

745
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,600
remember my kindness.

746
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,250
I'll get going then.

747
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,240
Enjoy your meal.

748
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,880
This way, Miss Xia.

749
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,560
Bye-bye.

750
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,050
Mr. Lin Heng.

751
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,170
Since Xia Xia took your car,

752
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,290
you can take my car.

753
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,080
Of course.

754
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,440
This way, please.

755
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,420
Hello?

756
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,330
This is Candy.

757
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,610
I'm Shen Junyao.

758
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,240
Mr. Shen.

759
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,450
Where's Xia Mo?

760
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,570
Xia Mo?

761
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,290
It seems she left at noon today.

762
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,600
She didn't even take a day off work.

763
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,680
Is she not back yet?

764
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:07,960
No.

765
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,200
Okay.

766
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:13,880
Brother.

767
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:14,840
Don't worry.

768
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,180
I just checked

769
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,530
her blood pressure and heart rate.

770
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,770
They're normal.

771
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,410
On the contrary,

772
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,030
your heart rate is a bit fast.

773
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,120
You seem extremely anxious and angry.

774
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,600
I didn't bring the emotion bracelet today.

775
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:28,810
Stop guessing.

776
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,410
I don't need the emotion bracelet.

777
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,130
I can tell from

778
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,320
your expression.

779
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,330
If it wasn't for the fact

780
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,800
that your mind was clouded by anger,

781
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,010
how could you have forgotten

782
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:37,780
that I could locate

783
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,770
Sister?

784
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,370
Are we going to find her?

785
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,170
Let's go.

786
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:56,800
Brother.

787
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,020
I can only locate her within 500 meters.

788
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,160
It can't go farther.

789
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,680
Remember to upgrade the system

790
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,940
next time.

791
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,600
Brother,

792
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,780
there's another primitive way

793
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,160
for mankind.

794
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,640
Use your mouth.

795
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,120
But you know,

796
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,720
those two young people

797
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,480
looked pretty in ancient costumes.

798
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,450
What's the buzzword

799
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,600
for it?

800
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:27,820
C…

801
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,640
Right. They look like a couple.

802
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,600
They do.

803
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,720
You're not young anymore.

804
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,050
Aren't you ashamed?

805
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,240
What's wrong with me?

806
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,320
I was just watching.

807
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,680
They hugged each other

808
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,330
for a long time

809
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,370
and didn't feel ashamed.

810
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,940
You're not being serious.

811
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,600
Get to work.

812
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,570
Where is Sister?

813
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,440
Go home.

814
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,520
Aren't we looking for Sister?

815
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,690
She won't get lost.

816
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,130
They hugged each other for a long time

817
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,160
and didn't feel ashamed.

818
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:07,800
Brother,

819
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,240
Let me get you some water.

820
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,400
No need.

821
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,010
Brother.

822
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,440
It shows

823
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,260
she's moving from the suburbs

824
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,480
to the city.

825
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,490
I'll pick her up.

826
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,560
No need.

827
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:21,800
Okay, Brother.

828
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:22,930
I listen to you.

829
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,770
But

830
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,330
can you answer my question?

831
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,240
Are you angrier

832
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,520
or more worried?

833
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,160
Starlight.

834
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,140
What answer do you want to hear?

835
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,000
I can tell you.

836
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,420
And then

837
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,480
go back and recharge yourself.

838
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,920
Don't just shut down

839
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,120
like other people shut off their phones.
