Brother,

7
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,880
I think your relationship with Sister

8
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,850
has gotten closer.

9
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,890
You're like a real couple.

10
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,289
Really?

11
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,530
Maybe

after pretending to be a couple for almost two weeks,

13
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,570
it's become a natural habit.

14
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,210
The internet says

15
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:21,560
it takes 21 days

will you consider dating for real?

21
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,240
No.

22
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,170
Then I'm going to tell Sister.

23
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,160
I can't let her get used to your existence.

24
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:41,230

It was stolen?

164
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,650
Then call the police!

You're not joking with me, right?

166

Where's Starlight?

167
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,360
I'll ask him.

I think it's nice.

200
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,930
Wouldn't it be better

201
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,280

00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,380
This is a mall.

321
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,640

Have a bite.

328
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,520
No need.

329
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,050
You've never had it, so I bet you don't like it.

330
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,250

338
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,960
is so good about this.

339
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,440
It tastes bad.

340
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,000
Do you want some gum?

341
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,210
Do you have any?

342
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,200
Gum is a business necessity.

343
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,609
Don't move.

344
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,840
Eat it.

What about you?

346
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,360
I'll just buy another pack later.

347
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,520
That's too troublesome.

00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,560

350
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,400
It's getting late.

351
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,800

360
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,120
Yeah.

361
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,880
Is there a problem?

362
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,000
You're attending a family dinner with me.

363
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,770
Look at the clothes here.

364
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,010
Do they match with me?

365
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,240
I...

366
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,130
Xia Mo.

00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,620

I hope you have

370
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,560
a clear understanding of your status.

371
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,650
In other words,

372
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,640
your task.

373
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,850
But I just got here.

374
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,440
I...

375
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,410
It's getting late.

376
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:16,660
If you don't know

377
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,920
how to style yourself,

378
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,200
I'll help you.

379
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,180
The color suits your skin tone too.

380
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,280
Do you like anything?

381
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,050
You can try it on if you like it.

382
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,610
No need.

383
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,480
Look at this one.

384
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,920
The V-neck is so low.

385
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,210
I don't think

386
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,360
I have the body for it.

387
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,480
What about this one?

388
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:56,840
This...

389
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,690
This is not suitable either.

390
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,410
Look how exposed the chest is.

391
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,200
It's not elegant enough.

392
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,370
Grandpa

393
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,330
won't like it.

394
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,180
I didn't expect you

395
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,210
to think from Grandpa's perspective.

396
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,320
Of course.

397
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,690
Filial piety comes first.

398
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,480
I have the traditional virtues

399
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,480
of Chinese culture.

400
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,410
Hello, sir.

401
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,760
How can I help you?

402
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,560
Hello.

403
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,340
We're going to

404
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,490
attend a dinner party tonight.

405
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,740
Please help her choose an outfit

406
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,850
suitable for family dinners.

407
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,610
Also,

408
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,480
try your best to fit her figure.

409
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:24,900
Yes, sir.

410
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,660
We have some promotions recently.

411
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,290
Sorry,

412
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,170
we're in a hurry.

413
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,530
We won't take part in your promotions.

414
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,050
Help her pick out the clothes first.

415
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,280
Yes, sir.

416
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,730
Please take a rest in the VIP room.

417
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,840
I'll take her to try on someclothes.

418
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,450
This way, please.

419
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,010
Thank you.

420
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:36,880
Miss,

421
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,240
let's go this way.

422
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,280
Okay.

423
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,560
This way.

424
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,400
This way, please.

425
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:58,370
Sir,

426
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,400
what do you think about this?

427
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,520
The color is too heavy.

428
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,860
Are there any clothes

429
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,770
with a more youthful style?

430
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,920
Do you like this one?

431
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,200
What about this one?

432
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,810
This one?

433
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,010
[Tang Tang]

434
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,210
[Tang Tang
Mr. Qin, are you free for dinner tonight?]

435
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,410
Mr. Qin,

436
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,530
are you free

437
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,880
for dinner tonight?

438
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:40,360
[Not tonight]

439
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,660
The weather forecast said

440
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,000
it might rain tonight.

441
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,800
I was worried you didn't bring an umbrella.

442
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,840
so,

443
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,480
I brought you one.

444
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,490
[Mr. Shen]

445
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,440
Mr. Shen.

446
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,730
[Qin Xiang]

447
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,000
How are the clothes?

448
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,360
It's time to go.

449
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:12,920
Okay.

450
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:31,150
[Qin Xiang]

451
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,400
Can I take a day off tonight?

452
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,690
A friend asked me out for dinner.

453
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,200
You can do your own thing.

454
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:29,980
Grandpa will probably

455
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,440
chat with Xia Mo until late at night.

456
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,520
[Tang Tang
Mr. Qin, are you free for dinner tonight?]

457
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,640
Where should we meet tonight?

458
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,460
How about

459
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,720
we have hotpot tonight?

460
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,920
Look how beautiful she is.

461
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,250
I'll buy one for you later.

462
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:56,840
Okay?

463
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:57,840
Okay.

464
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,980
She's so pretty.

465
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,620
Yeah.

466
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,770
Gowns need to fit your body,

467
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,810
not a single centimeter more or less.

468
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:21,730
So beautiful.

469
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,210
If only I had her figure,

470
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,200
it'd be great.

471
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,370
No,

472
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,280
I need to lose weight.

473
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,360
You don't need to.

474
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,800
I like you when you're chubby.

475
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,420
Her boyfriend is handsome too.

476
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,400
Look at me.

477
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,800
How do I look?

478
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,880
Not bad.

479
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,090
But

480
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,970
something is missing.

481
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,330
Something is missing?

482
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,520
Don't move.

483
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,120
This one.

484
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,600
Let's go.

485
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,120
Mr. Shen.

486
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,400
Miss Xia,

487
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,320
you look so elegant in this dress.

488
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,450
Thank you.

489
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,840
I think so too.

490
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,400
Let's go.

491
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,200
Get in.

492
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,410
So pretty.

493
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,770
It's too dark.

494
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,410
Mr. Shen,

495
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,860
can you take some photos

496
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,880
of me?

497
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,410
I can't get a full image.

498
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,960
Are you done, Mr. Shen?

499
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,250
I'm not used to your phone.

500
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,880
I'll use mine.

501
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:35,860
Let me see.

502
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,530
I'll send it to you.

504
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,160
You are good at taking photos.

505

They look nice.

507
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,410
Mr. Shen,

508
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,380
if there's nothing else,

509
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,290
I'll get going.

510
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,770
Have a good date.

511
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,600
Please...

512
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,520
Don't make fun of me.

513
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,360
Just a friend.

514
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,010
Really!

515
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,120
Just...

516
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,330
We're just friends.

517
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,610
You can go.

518
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,920
Bye.

519
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,250
Do you have any other gifts?

520
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,820
Can I borrow one?

521
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,280
Didn't I tell you in advance?

522
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,880
Why didn't you prepare anything?

523
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,480
I've been busy with work.

524
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,400
I didn't have time to prepare.

525
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,690
Were you busy with work

526
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,010
or busy eating?

527
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,010
I...

528
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,050
I knew you would forget to buy it.

529
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,090
This is for you.

530
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,600
For me?

531
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,080
What about you?

532
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,220
If I brought gifts

533
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,250
every time I visited Grandpa,

534
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,520
this house
