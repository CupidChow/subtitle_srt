00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,800
[Episode 9]

4
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,770
Mr. Shen.

5
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,840
You're also here.

6
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,880
Really?

7
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,720
We go way back.

8
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,720
We can play golf together.

9
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,120
Nice to meet you.

10
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,300
Cheers.

11
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,800
Cheers.

12
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,440
It's nothing.

13
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,370
Yes.

14
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,770
Later...

15
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,730
This is my business card.

16
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,440
Control your expressions.

17
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,320
Shen Junyao.

18
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,250
This is what you call a family banquet?

19
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,090
There are too many people.

20
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,360
All the people here are directors

21
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,180
of Jiuyu Group's

22
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,400
subsidiary companies.

23
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,220
Doesn't that

24
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,090
count as a family dinner?

25
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,420
Well,

26
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,600
if you say so.

27
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,000
But to those who don't know,

28
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,140
they would think

29
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,000
this is a business tycoon seminar.

30
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,480
There are so many leaders.

31
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,600
I'm glad you are aware of it.

32
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,690
So,

33
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,960
keep a good posture.

34
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,000
Your director is over there.

35
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,450
Go and say hello later.

36
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,360
Mr. Shen.

37
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,770
The president knew you're here.

38
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,770
He said he would come down soon.

39
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,980
Take this upstairs for me.

40
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,490
Okay.

41
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,610
Let's go.

42
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,400
Mr. Shen.

43
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,490
It has been a long time.

44
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,130
It has been a long time.

45
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,720
We met every month before.

46
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,020
But I went on a business trip

47
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,970
for a long time this time.

48
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,760
Let's get together more.

49
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,060
Is this your wife?

50
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,690
Let me introduce.

51
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,079
Xia Mo.

52
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,329
Mr. Zhang.

53
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:28,940
Miss Xia.

54
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,570
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

55
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,260
Mr. Zhang is in charge of

56
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,090
supplying coffee to several big brands.

57
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,000
He has more than ten cafes

58
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,640
in Zhenhai alone.

59
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,200
Miss Xia,

60
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,650
if you have the time,

61
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,640
you can come to my shop Folo Cafe

62
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
and give me some advice.

63
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,240
I'm flattered.

64
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,000
Mr. Zhang,

65
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:45,960
excuse me.

66
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,780
Okay, go ahead.

67
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,880
I'll go over there and say hello.

68
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,730
Excuse me.

69
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:53,800
Mr. Shen.

70
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,570
Xia Mo.

71
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,920
Hello, Mr. Cheng.

72
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,560
Don't call me Mr. Cheng.

73
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,570
My boss is on a business trip.

74
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,960
He asked me to come here

75
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,810
and told me

76
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,480
to be careful of what I say.

77
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,640
It's okay, Mr. Cheng.

78
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,610
Since you're here,

79
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,440
just make yourself comfortable.

80
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,060
The position doesn't matter

81
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,080
in this place.

82
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,210
It's just about business

83
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,010
and cooperation.

84
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,170
This is also the reason

85
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,520
why my grandfather asks us to have a meeting every month.

86
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,800
Yes. Yes.

87
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,399
I just came to say hello.

88
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,880
You do what you got to do.

89
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,330
President Shen.

90
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,090
-Hello, President Shen.
-Hello, President Shen.

91
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,400
-Hello, President Shen.
-Hello, President Shen.

92
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,570
Hello, everyone.

93
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,120
It's our monthly gathering again.

94
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,440
A simple meal

95
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,400
and a small family banquet.

96
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,130
I hope you can enjoy it.

97
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,010
Besides,

98
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,120
I also want to thank you

99
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,610
for your contributions

100
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,800
to Jiuyu Group.

101
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,410
It's what we should do.

102
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,120
Thank you, President Shen.

103
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,650
Grandpa.

104
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,010
Hello, Grandpa.

105
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,980
Today's gathering is more than

106
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,130
a family banquet.

107
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,580
Because I have another thing

108
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,320
to announce.

109
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,890
Let me introduce.

110
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,720
Miss Xia Mo.

111
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:34,890
She is the future wife

112
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,170
of Junyao

113
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,720
and my future granddaughter-in-law.

114
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:39,490
In the future,

115
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,920
if she needs any help,

116
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,930
please show your support.

117
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,960
-Sure. -Sure.

118
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,700
-Congratulations, Mr. Shen.
-Congratulations, Mr. Shen.

119
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,409
Congratulations, President Shen.

120
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,360
Congratulations.

121
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,280
Don't worry.

122
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,090
I'm here.

123
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,040
Hello, everyone.

124
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,290
I'm Xia Mo.

125
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:08,940
Hello, Miss Xia.

126
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,690
-Hello, Miss Xia.
-Hello, Miss Xia.

127
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,570
Now that

128
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,800
you know who she is

129
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,570
and since we are family,

130
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,520
let's

131
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,280
drink a toast

132
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:17,840
to my future granddaughter-in-law.

133
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,320
Cheers!

134
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,120
Mr. Shen.

135
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,810
Hello, Miss Xia.

136
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,650
We should help each other in the future.

137
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,130
The hotpot here is really delicious.

138
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,130
Try it later.

139
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,440
What do you want to drink today?

140
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:37,290
Anything is fine.

141
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,000
I took a leave today.

142
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,080
I'll follow your arrangement.

143
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,880
How about liquor?

144
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,000
Red wine doesn't go with hotpot.

145
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,120
We can't get drunk with beer.

146
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,770
So let's drink liquor.

147
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,240
OK.

148
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,320
Waiter.

149
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,570
We want a bottle of liquor.

150
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,730
Okay.

151
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,680
Actually,

152
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,720
we don't have to get drunk.

153
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,800
I was just kidding.

154
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,860
Look how nervous you are.

155
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,760
You're sweating.

156
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,890
Wipe it.

157
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,690
Thank you.

158
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,640
By the way,

159
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,900
I found that the blog

160
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,820
has been deleted.

161
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,250
Does it mean that everything has been taken care of?

162
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:11,800
Yes.

163
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,260
That blog

164
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,060
involves

165
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,410
privacy of Mr. Shen.

166
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,180
So, after being reported,

167
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,240
the blog was deleted.

168
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,210
That's good.

169
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,600
I was afraid Mr. Qin would run away

170
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,080
in the middle of the meal

171
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,330
and leave me here.

172
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,170
No, no.

173
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,160
Your liquor.

174
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,540
[Barentai]

175
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,640
Enjoy your meal.

176
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,290
Let's

177
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:40,920
have a drink.

178
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,330
Let's eat.

179
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,400
Let's eat.

180
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,880
Here, Xia.

181
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,010
Take a look.

182
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,960
You brat.

183
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,770
Lead the way for your girlfriend.

184
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,610
Grandpa,

185
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,650
our house is not that big

186
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,780
to make her get lost.

187
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,400
So?

188
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,680
It's about etiquette.

189
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,250
Is this okay?

190
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,520
Xia, come here.

191
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,440
Come here.

192
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,810
Come in.

193
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,480
How is it?

194
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,040
Junyao, this...

195
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,800
This is from Xia Mo.

196
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,260
She said this is her first time visiting you,

197
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,210
so it's not good to come empty-handed.

198
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,090
Xia,

199
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:32,620
thank you

200
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,679
for buying me the present.

201
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,460
Did you

202
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,650
tell her

203
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,600
about my hobby?

204
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,740
Didn't you always say

205
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,960
you wanted a new Xiangqi (Chinese chess) set?

206
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,320
Yes.

207
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,200
Nice.

208
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,620
[Cannon]

209
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,490
Do you know how to play Xiangqi?

210
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:52,920
Come on.

211
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,810
Play with me.

212
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,090
I can't.

213
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,000
But my dad is very good at Xiangqi.

214
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,640
He said his teacher was even better.

215
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,700
His teacher even won the Xiangqi championship.

216
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,480
Well, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

217
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,320
No problem.

218
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,640
Come on, let's play.

219
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:05,730
No, no.

220
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,570
It's okay.

221
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,530
Grandpa is not that good at Xiangqi.

222
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,930
I think you two are at the same level.

223
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,840
Don't listen to his nonsense.

224
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,800
He won by luck.

225
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:15,720
I...

226
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,320
What? Am I wrong?

227
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,530
Here, Xia.

228
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,770
No more civilities.

229
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,640
Sit down.

[House of Shen]

231
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,840
Xia,

232
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,570
you were being modest.

233
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,090
Out of these rounds you played with me,

234
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,240
you won twice.

235
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,160
No.

236
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,240
I know you were letting me win.

237
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:40,520
I...

238
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,650
Interesting.

239
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,090
It's not worth it.

240
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,200
Stop talking.

241
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,210
A true gentleman should keep silent while watching a Xiangqi game.

242
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,120
If you talk too much, you are...

243
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,810
What is that?

244
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,480
Donkey!

245
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,450
Listen.

246
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,690
What's wrong?

247
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,330
She's right.

248
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:06,720
Checkmate.

249
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,240
Grandpa, you're so great.

250
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,290
I was just lucky.

251
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,340
It's really tiring

252
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,050
to watch you two play Xiangqi.

253
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,370
You think you can do better? Then you can play.

254
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,240
I...

255
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,320
Grandpa,

256
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,160
how do you want to win?

257
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,850
You can just tell me that.

258
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,210
Are you looking down on me?

259
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,430
How about we make a bet?

260
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,090
Sure. What's the bet?

261
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,890
Let's bet...

262
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,520
If I win,

263
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,060
you and Xia need to

264
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,650
stay here tonight.

265
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,570
Tomorrow morning,

266
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,700
you two should have breakfast with me

267
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,450
before you go back.

268
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,160
OK?

269
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,850
You can't do it, right?

270
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,410
I knew you can't.

271
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,060
Even if you beat me before,

272
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,290
it's because you were lucky.

273
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,600
You can't lose.

274
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,890
Come on.

275
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,280
Set the chessboard.

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,760
Sorry, Miss Tang.

282
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,680
Maybe it's because

283
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,050
I haven't drunk for a long time.

284
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,170
So, I really...

285
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,450
Drink some water first.

286
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,290
Mr. Qin.

287
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,640
It's all my fault.

288
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,960
I made you drink so much.

289
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,640
Wipe it again.

can you stop calling me

Mr. Qin?

294
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,930
That sounds too distant.

295
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,240
Just call me by my name.

296

Then you can call me Tang Tang from now on.

297
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,290

00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,210
more like friends.

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,370
Don't you have friends in the company?

304
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,640

but also my best friend.

Three to zero.

352
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,160
What?

00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,090
Three to zero.

354

Grandpa, you're amazing,

356
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,880
unlike someone

358
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,040
but couldn't play any better

359

than me.

360
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,480
That's right. When I played with him,

361
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,680
I didn't even try my best.

362
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,080
Don't forget

363
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,600
what my bet with Grandpa is.

364
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:46,960

366
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,960
It's late.

367
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,170
I need to rest.

369
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,360
Remember our bet.

00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,010
Tomorrow morning,

371
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,210
if I don't see you in the restaurant,

372
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,520
don't blame me for getting angry.

373

Arrange a room for them.

This will be your room

383

Mr. Shen.

386

Other rooms in the house

387
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:32,970
are used as warehouses

388
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,210
by President Shen.

389
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,660
He has a lot of collections.

390
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,640
I'll stay in the warehouse then.

391
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:37,810
Mr. Shen.

392
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,480
Since it is collections that are in the warehouse,

393
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,520
of course

394
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,120
I don't have the key.

395
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:42,920
How about this?

396
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,570
I'll sleep on the sofa in the lobby.

397
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,280
The lobby is not cleaned.

398
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,400
The chairman has a meeting tomorrow.

399
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,330
So we'll clean the lobby up

400
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,520
tonight.

401
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,450
Well...

402
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,050
You can sleep here.

403
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,890
It's late anyway.

404
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,810
Go to bed early.

405
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,680
Thank you.

406
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,920
It's okay, Mr. Shen.

407
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,450
There are toiletries in the bathroom.

408
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,210
Your clothes are in the wardrobe.

409
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,330
I'll leave you be.

410
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,360
How can I sleep

411
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,050
with only one quilt?

412
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,370
I still have work to do.

413
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,480
Go to bed early if you're sleepy.

414
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:32,760
But...

415
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,080
Miss.

416
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,560
The Zhujiang Garden is here.

417
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,300
Please

418
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,750
send him back.

419
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,140
Do you know

420
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,930
his address?

421
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,970
Let me ask him.

422
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,720
OK.

423
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,330
Qin Xiang.

424
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,480
Qin Xiang.

425
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,980
Where do you live?

426
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,690
I live in...

427
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:00,760
Miss,

428
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,170
don't you know

429
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,120
your boyfriend's address?

430
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,090
I haven't been to his house yet.

431
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,610
I can't drive him home

432
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,320
if I don't know the address.

433
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,610
I want to

434
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,810
take more orders tonight.

435
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,810
So...

436
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,690
Fine.

437
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,560
You can leave first.

438
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,450
I'll figure it out myself.

439
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:18,930
Remember to

440
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,210
give me a five-star review.

441
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:20,610
OK.

442
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,680
Thank you.

443
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,680
Qin Xiang.

444
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,970
Qin Xiang, wake up.

445
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,360
Sit on the sofa.

446
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,730
Qin Xiang.

447
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,680
Qin Xiang.

448
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:46,850
I don't want to drink anymore.

449
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,490
No.

450
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,010
Okay, good boy. We won't drink anymore.

451
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,680
Go to bed and rest.

452
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,920
The bed?

453
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,080
Xia Mo.

454
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,220
Why did you touch my stuff

455
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,200
without my permission?

456
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,880
I just want to take a look.

457
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,640
You were chased by a dog when you were little?

458
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,020
Give it to me.

459
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,600
No.

460
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,420
Did you get caught

461
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,330
by the dog

462
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,500
when you were stealing persimmons?

463
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,680
I'll give you one more chance.

464
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,560
Give it to me.

465
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,730
I haven't finished yet.

466
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,770
No.

467
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,810
Then I'll take it back myself.

468
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,370
No.

469
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,300
Give it to me.

470
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,180
No. No.

471
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,300
-Give it to me.
-No.

472
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:42,780
No.

473
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,530
Give it to me.

You lost again.

486

It seems that you losing to AlphaGo

487
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:03,920
wasn't an accident.

488
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,560
I should ask my brother

489
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,840
to upgrade your system.

490
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:09,930
Oh no.

491
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,720
Something happened to Sister.

492
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,680
Hello?

493
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,250
Brother, are you with Sister?

494
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,530
We're at Grandpa's.

495
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,570
We're not going home tonight. What's wrong?

496
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,240
I just detected

497
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,830
abnormal fluctuation in Sister's heart rate.

498
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,170
Did something happen?

499
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:54,760
Brother.

500
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,280
Hello? Hello?

501
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,650
I'm here.

502
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,490
Is Sister okay?

503
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,010
Just now...

504
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,720
A rat ran into the room.

505
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,970
Xia Mo was scared.

506
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:04,800
But everything's fine now.

507
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,640
Rat?

508
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,170
How can there be a rat

509
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,440
in Grandpa's villa?

510
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,640
Maybe it came in by accident.

511
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,120
It's getting late.

512
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:14,890
I have work to do.

513
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,770
I have to go.

514
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,490
That's good if you're both okay.

515
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,570
Brother, rest early.

516
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,250
Don't stay up late.

517
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,000
Good night.

518
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,250
Did he

519
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,640
want to

520
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,800
kiss me?

521
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:58,810
Xia Mo.

522
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,610
What are you thinking about?

00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:27,130
[House of Shen]

524
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,680
Well...

00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,050
Shen Junyao.

526
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,320
What's wrong?

527
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,840
My dress is wet.

528
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,340
Can you

529
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,720
get me a new one?

530
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,120
Open the door.

531
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,000
Thank you.

532
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,880
How should we sleep with only one quilt?

533
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,770
I haven't finished my work.

534
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,640
I'm not going to sleep.

535
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,840
Go to bed early.

536
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,160
I'll sleep now.

537
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,810
What happened?

538
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,410
Is there a power outage?

539
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,240
Wait for me here.

540
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,130
I'll go out and take a look.

541
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,520
Come back soon.

542
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,770
Are you that afraid of the dark?

543
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,250
I...

544
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,280
I've been afraid of the dark since childhood.

545
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,130
I'll keep you company.

546
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:28,800
You...

547
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,160
Aren't you going out to see what happened?

548
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,490
No.

549
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,530
Tomorrow morning,

550
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,440
the repairman will be here.

551
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,520
Sleep.

552
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,160
I won't do anything to you.

553
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,800
Don't be nervous.

554
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:42,700
Or Starlight

555
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,930
will call me again.

[House of Shen]

557
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,130
What happened?

558
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,000
What's wrong?

559
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:02,840
Nothing.

560
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,450
Mr. Shen.

561
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,290
Miss Xia.

562
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,810
Breakfast is ready.

563
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,610
President Shen wants you to go downstairs for breakfast.

564
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:14,800
Got it.

565
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,850
Well...

566
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,280
Let's wash up.

567
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,000
Grandpa.

568
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,010
The breakfast is so sumptuous.

569
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,090
Of course.

570
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,520
You two

571
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,210
worked so hard last night.

00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,330
You need to eat something good.

573
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,170
Grandpa, you should eat more as well.

574
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,410
Okay.

575
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,840
The light is on. The power is on.

576
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:01,840
Did...

577
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,200
Did the power go out yesterday?

578
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,720
Grandpa.

579
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,360
At first, everything was fine last night.

580
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,970
But suddenly, the lights went out.

581
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,480
Didn't you know?

582
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,490
I am old. I sleep early.

583
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,600
I didn't know there was a power outage.

584
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,680
Were you scared?

585
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,600
No.

586
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,200
Last night,

587
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,880
Shen Junyao was with me.

588
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,930
That's good.

589
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:22,690
Eat more.

590
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,090
Hurry.

591
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,640
Grandpa.

592
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,340
Do you really not know

593
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,450
why the power went out?

594
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,810
How could you say that?

595
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,370
How would I know about the power outage?

596
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,740
You always make me upset.

597
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,320
Right?

598
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,680
You can't shut up even when you're eating.

599
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:38,760
Xia Xia.

600
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,530
If you're free,

601
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,720
ask Junyao to bring you home more often.

602
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,130
I'm always at home alone.

603
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,080
Come and accompany me more.

604
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:47,920
I don't think it's a good idea.

605
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,240
I'm afraid if we come,

606
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,610
there will be a power outage again.

607
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,770
How could you say that?

608
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,440
If there's always a power outage,

609
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,960
how can we live here?

610
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,250
Don't worry.

611
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,490
I'll ask the workers

612
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,120
to examine and repair the circuit.

613
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,010
It's okay.

614
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:00,810
The power won't go out again.

615
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,410
Eat more.

616
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,190
Here, have some fried eggs.

617
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,290
I can't eat too much.

618
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:07,720
Grandpa.

619
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,760
Drink milk.

620
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,240
Don't move.

621
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,480
Eat.

622
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:48,490
Here.

623
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,730
Xia Xia, eat.

624
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,760
Eat more meat. Look how skinny you are.

625
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,570
Eat more meat.

626
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,930
Miss Tang, why are you here?

627
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,820
Didn't we agree to

628
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,810
call me Tang Tang?

629
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,720
Tang Tang.

630
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,000
You got drunk yesterday.

631
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,860
And you wouldn't tell me

632
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,810
where you live.

633
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,400
I have to bring you here.

634
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,320
Miss Tang, last night...

635
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,330
Last night...

636
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:55,880
I think...

637
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,570
I...

638
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,240
I didn't do anything wrong, did I?

639
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,480
You did.

640
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:01,820
Miss Tang, I...

641
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,440
You didn't lie to me last night.

642
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,920
You were indeed amazing

643
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,400
in bed.

644
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,090
Miss Tang, I...

645
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,850
All right.

646
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,610
Let's talk about it later.

647
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:13,900
If you don't

648
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,250
get up and wash up quickly,

649
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,570
you'll be late for work.

650
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,050
Yes.

651
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,040
I have to go to work.

652
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,090
Miss Tang, my...

653
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,240
Coat.

654
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,200
Well, I...

655
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,480
I'll call you later.

656
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,170
You still have 23 minutes.

657
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,450
You stayed in the room alone

658
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,250
with a beauty like me,

659
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,400
but you didn't want to do anything wrong.

660
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,090
This is your biggest mistake.
