00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,520
Xia Mo!

385
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:30,840
Xia Mo.

386
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,130
Starlight,

387
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,250
wet the towel for me.

388
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,200
Shen Junyao,

389
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,720
why are you here?

390
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,730
You have a fever.

391
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,080
Fever?

392
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,240
I'm not burning.

393
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,300
That's because

394
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,200
your entire body is burning.

395
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,360
Starlight,

396
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,520
contact the family doctor.

397
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,650
I already did.

398
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,170
The doctor will be here in about five minutes.

399
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,970
I'll just take some fever medicine.

400
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:05,850
It's okay.

401
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:06,890
Hang in there.

402
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:07,930
The doctor will be here soon.

403
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,840
Maggie,

404
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,740
Mr. Shen wants us

405
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,720
to have dinner together

406
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,640
to celebrate T5's successful release.

407
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,840
I'll get ready.

408
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,620
I didn't expect

409
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,660
Miss Xia's otoMAD

410
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,440
would be so effective.

411
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,890
I forgot some documents.

412
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,920
I'll go get them.

413
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,520
Mr. Qin,

414
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,820
why haven't you

415
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,720
contacted me these days?

416
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,680
I've been busy

417
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,040
these days because of

418
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,120
the new product release.

419
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,840
Your answer makes you

420
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,480
sound like an irresponsible man.

421
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,600
The type that ghosts the girl after sleeping with them

422
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,290
and says he's busy whenever asked.

423
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,000
No, it's...

424
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,160
I seriously was busy.

425
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,640
Just kidding.

426
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,160
I'm here to ask you

427
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,170
if you've seen the video yet.

428
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,000
Yes.

429
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,050
We watched it together.

430
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,090
How do you feel?

431
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,960
Everyone thinks it's good.

432
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,080
Everyone?

433
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,640
I don't care about everyone.

434
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,120
I just want to ask

435
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,360
how you feel.

436
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,690
I think

437
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,400
it's great.

438
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,410
How are you going to thank me?

439
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,780
With Mr. Shen,

440
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,140
I can apply for some budget

441
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,680
as your compensation.

442
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,250
Do you think I did this

443
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,640
for money?

444
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,740
No, no.

445
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,050
That's not what I meant.

446
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,100
I don't want Miss Tang

447
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,120
to work hard for nothing.

448
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,240
That's why I...

449
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,640
I'll stop teasing you.

450
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,250
Look how nervous you are.

451
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,610
You're sweating.

452
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,530
Why don't you treat me to dinner tonight

453
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,440
to thank me?

454
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,330
Think carefully. It's a good bargain.

455
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,200
Can we not drink this time?

456
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,080
Celebrating with a few drinks

457
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,720
is okay.

458
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,000
See you tonight.

459
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,360
Remember not to drive.

460
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,280
Mr. Shen,

461
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,160
for Miss Xia's current condition

462
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,720
we can consider using fever medicine,

463
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,370
but for better results,

464
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,520
it's best to get an IV drip.

465
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,560
Then, IV.

466
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,640
Okay, I'll get it ready.

467
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,320
If it hurts too much later,

468
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,570
you can bite me.

469
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,280
It's not my first time getting a drip.

470
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,400
Don't make a fuss.

471
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,970
I should bite you.

472
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,420
It's all because you misunderstood

473
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,300
Mr. Lin and I

474
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,290
when we filmed the video,

475
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,930
almost ruining my efforts.

476
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,010
It won't happen again.

477
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,040
There won't be an "again."

478
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,450
Three months later,

479
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,770
I'm moving away.

480
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,480
Give me your hand.

481
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,160
Hold tight.

482
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:17,920
It's okay.

483
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,810
Don't be afraid.

484
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,130
Relax.

485
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,880
It's okay.

486
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:31,290
Mr. Shen,

487
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,800
the fever will be gone after the drip.

488
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,170
But

489
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,200
you might have an inflammation.

490
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,210
You must take your medicine on time.

491
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,130
If symptoms return,

492
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,370
I'll take a look again.

493
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,520
Thank you.

494
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,490
Xia Mo,

495
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,130
earlier,

496
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,740
when I carried you back to your room,

497
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,490
I couldn't help it.

498
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,850
I'm sleepy.

499
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,680
I'm going to bed.

500
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,420
I mean,

501
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,130
if I offended you...

502
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:08,800
Well,

503
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,840
the patient needs to rest.

504
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,850
I can't hear anything.

505
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,360
Brother,

506
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,780
what happened

507
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,640
between you and Sister?

508
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,440
Why do you ask?

509
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,610
When you held her just now,

510
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,600
your movements were smooth and natural.

511
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,540
She didn't

512
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,530
overreact either.

513
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,280
According to data analysis,

514
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,320
a man and a woman

515
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,060
will only react like that

516
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,160
after they have

517
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,770
intimate action.

518
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,260
During the fire last time,

519
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,460
I gave her CPR

520
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,320
and kissed her.

521
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,080
No.

522
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,210
Strictly speaking,

523
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,050
that's not

524
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,120
a real kiss.

525
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,380
It is just

526
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,840
medical artificial respiration.

527
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,810
Besides,

528
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,130
Sister didn't know about it.

529
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,080
You probably

530
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,600
never told her either.

531
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,200
So my guess is

532
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,090
your intimate behavior

533
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,120
happened recently.

534
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,560
How is that possible?

535
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,160
The netizens said

536
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,610
brothers should be very close with each other.

537
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,810
Are you really not going to tell me?

538
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,370
Fine.

539
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,600
Just now,

540
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,360
I kissed Xia Mo.

541
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,050
Did you do it accidentally?

542
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,330
No.

543
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,490
I've said what I should.

544
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,740
Don't play the brother card.

545
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,420
Go check

546
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,520
Candy's surveillance footage.

547
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,040
Xia Mo will be hungry after the drip.

548
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,200
I'll make some food.

549
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,530
I finished checking.

550
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,530
The surveillance video shows that

551
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,860
the head of their department, Shi Li,

552
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,000
used Sister's computer.

553
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,520
Are you sure?

554
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,250
Although she did not

555
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,690
implanted the virus video,

556
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,530
she did steal

557
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,890
the computer password.

558
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,570
There's also a video

559
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,380
of the cafe outside Candy

560
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,680
showing Shi Li left the latest on Friday night.

561
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,370
Shi Li.

562
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,060
It seems that

563
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,100
someone will need to leave Candy

564
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,000
because of this matter.

565
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,850
Brother, are you going to cook first

566
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:23,900
or inform

567
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,210
their department head

568
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,640
about Shi Li?

569
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,480
I'll cook first, of course.

570
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,370
[STAN Technology New Product Press Conference]

571
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,640
Take a look.

572
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,480
President,

573
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,040
you're the best.

574
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,250
What's the best about me?

575
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,600
In terms of that,

576
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,200
we should be praising Xia.

577
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,460
This little girl

578
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,770
is the good luck charm for the Shen family.

579
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,240
Just say it.

580
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,280
Stop dawdling.

581
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,200
President,

582
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,170
have you investigated

583
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,730
Miss Xia's background?

584
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,320
Why should I investigate her?

585
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,780
As long as Junyao likes her,

586
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,360
then it's fine.

587
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,640
You...

588
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,420
What era is it now?

589
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,120
You still care about family backgrounds?

590
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,600
Starlight,

591
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,180
is there something wrong

592
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,170
with your recipe?

593
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,060
Why did a pancake

594
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,720
lead to an explosion?

595
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,560
Brother,

596
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,780
any normal person with caution

597
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,160
and common sense

598
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,460
would know that you

599
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,890
can't pour flour into a pan of oil.

600
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,200
Why didn't you alert me

601
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,690
about this dangerous action?

602
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,770
Sorry, Brother.

603
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,090
I wasn't fast enough.

604
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,760
See if the porridge is ready.

605
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,360
The edibility rate qualifies.

606
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,640
What about the steamed eggs?

607
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,770
Qualified.

608
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,090
Ask Xia Mo to come down for dinner.

609
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:12,680
Okay.

610
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,840
Wait a minute.

611
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,450
There's something on your face.

612
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,050
Take care of it.

613
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:22,920
You too.
