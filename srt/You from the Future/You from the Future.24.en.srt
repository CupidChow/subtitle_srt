President.

5
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,050
Lin Heng used an electric baton

6
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,720
to damage the core component of Starlight.

7
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,120
Starlight is gone.

8
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,160
What about the protection program of Starlight?

9
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:49,450
Self-protection program

10
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,340
can only be activated

11
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,240
when Starlight's battery is no less than 20%.

12
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,850
After Starlight found out

13
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,740
Miss Xia was kidnapped,

14
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,440
Starlight canceled the charging mode.

15
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:00,670

21
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,880
in that abandoned factory.

22
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,039
Xingran?

23
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,920
Xingran is still alive?

24
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,670
Hello.

25
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,600

Do you know

28
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:31,920
who kidnapped Xia?

29
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,360
Do you know it or not?

30
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,480
Yes.

31
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,240
Is he Xingran?

32
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:42,920
Yes.

33
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,120
Where is he now?

34
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,310
He's home now, Grandpa.

35
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,560
We were reconciled.

36
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,030
Don't worry.

37
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,200
Tell him to come back. I want...

38
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,080
I want to see him.

39
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,480
Grandpa.

40
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:04,740
You know the old grudges

41
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,720
between us.

42
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,120
I can let go of the past.

43
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,110
But it doesn't mean he can convince himself.

44
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,360
Junyao. Junyao.

45
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:15,960
Xingran

46
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,880
suffered too much.

47
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,079
He grew up in an orphanage.

48
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,550
He took all the burdens alone.

49
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,600
You are his brother.

50
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:27,760
You should help him find closure.

51
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,030
I'll find a chance to talk to him.

52
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,920
Okay.

53
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,560
Fine.

54
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,280
If he wants to come back,

55
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,960
tell me in advance.

56
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,760
I'll bring your mother back.

57

Okay.

I can't sleep.

59
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,310
Once I close my eyes,

60
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:24,190
I can't help thinking of Starlight.

61
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,350
Can I sleep here?

62
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:31,950
Come in.

63
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,150

What time is it?

65
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,790
It's time to get up and go to work.

66
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,790
I'll sleep for another ten minutes.

67
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,440
No.

154
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,390
you wouldn't come back.

155
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,860
How is that possible?

156

163
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
all day since then.

164
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,560
It's so annoying.

165
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,670
She's waiting for you to come back

166
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,140

It is in its testing stages.

178

But

179

180
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,110

181
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,350
The pressure of sales?

182
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,200
Yes.

183
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,710
T6's development cost is higher than T5's.

184
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,550
Its functions are also better than T5.

185
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,750
So, T6's price

186
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,750
should be higher than that of T5.

187
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,630
And there are disabled people

188
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,830
among T6's target consumers,

189
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,940

00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,630
Wait for me here.

195
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,820
I'll go to the meeting room.

196
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,510
Okay, Brother.

197
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,830
Let's go.

198
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,230
Here's the thing.

199
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,830
T5's sales are very good.

200
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,350
I told the staff of the Sales Department

201
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,590
that after T6 is released,

202
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,980
I'll raise their percentage.

203
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,990
But if the sales are bad,

204
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,660
what's the use of raising their percentage?

205
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,500
Don't mention it.

206
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,710
Factories are under greater pressure.

207
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,750
We have to wait for more production when factories shut down.

208
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,620
And if the sales are bad, factories will shut down.

209
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,310
We have to pay the workers even if factories shut down.

210
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,440
How can I

211
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,240
accomplish my KPI?

212
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,260
I think

213
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,950
T6's price...

214
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,180
Everyone,

215
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,900
I have something to say

216
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,990
about T6's R&D.

217
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,030
Stantech's existence

218
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,270
is to provide value

219
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,070
for human technology and life.

220
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,100
Stantech is not a tech company

221
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,470
chasing profits only.

222
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,830
We researched and developed our own chips.

223
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,830
We do modeling

224
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,150
and manufacturing on our own as well.

225
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,860
That's because

226
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,860
we want this company to last long.

227
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,220
We want this company

228
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,590
to bring benefits to the country and the people.

229
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,580
Please remember this.

230
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,660
Do you have any questions? Bring them up.

231
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,700
Mr. Shen.

232
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,600
Regarding sales,

233
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,200
the Sales Department

234
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,260
can't make any promises.

235
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,300
Mr. Shen.

236
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,220
T6 costs a lot.

237
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,830
If the sales are low,

238
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,070
other factories may be shut down.

239
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:13,830
Mr. Shen.

240
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,950
The Publicity Department has made

241
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,300
a whole promotion plan.

242
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,070
If this is the case,

243
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,380
we might need to do it all over again.

244
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,640
I've thought about

245
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,590
what you said.

246
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,750
But I've given you

247
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,860
my answers.

248
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,340
Then, T6's price...

249
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,190
T6 won't follow

250
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,750
any previous sales modes.

251
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,340
Due to the uniqueness of disabled people,

252
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,460
usage of T6 will

253
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,870
adopt a rental method.

254
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,830
Consumers only need to pay

255
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,910
a small amount of money

256
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,870
to keep using it.

257
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,540
Or,

258
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,700
they can use credits

259
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,070
to enjoy discounts

260
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,220
or be exempted from the rent.

261
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:41,740
Mr. Shen,

262
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,790
have you ever thought

263
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,790
if you do this,

264
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,560
how big a loss

265
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,680
it will cause for Stantech

266
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,060
and how bad the performance will be?

267
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,900
I thought about it.

268
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,740
But I still have to do it.

269
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,230
I think this matter

270
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,430
should be handed to the board.

271
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,230
If all shareholders

272
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,180
agree,

273
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,220
I can accept it.

274
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,110
Sorry, Mr. Shen.

275
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,810
Dear colleagues of Stantech,

276
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,030
as

277
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,820
the president of Jiuyu Group,

278
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,180
I will give full support

279
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,950
for T6's

280
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,580
R&D and sales strategy.

281
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,540
As businessmen,

282
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,460
we can prioritize profits.

283
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,140
But as entrepreneurs,

284
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,030
we should know

285
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,980
the responsibilities we shoulder.

286
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,390
It's not only about the family, company, and employees,

287
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,150
but also

288
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,180
about society.

289
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,780
So,

290
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,150
Stantech's

291
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,310
all the plans for T6 robots

292
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,060
don't need the approval of the board.

293
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,220
Shen Junyao has the right to decide directly.

294
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,780
You are all

295
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,100
talents in Stantech.

296
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,800
I'm confident that T6

297
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,380
will become the focus of society.

298
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,580
I'm also confident

299
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,910
shareholders will be satisfied

300
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,930
with the result.

304

[Ten Thousand Miles of Stars Exhibition Studio]

307
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,830
Mr. Lin Heng, is it true that

308
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,670
you are going to retire from the Hanfu model?

309
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,360
Did you just

310
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,310
terminate the contract with the exhibition?

311
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,920
Will you need to pay

312
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,060
high damages?

313
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,000
Were you threatened

314
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,860
or what?

315
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,350
Have you ever thought about

316
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,140
your fans?

317
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,130
I'm sorry.

318
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,410
I let you down.

319
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,830
I chose to retire

320
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,580
for some personal reasons.

321
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,810
It has nothing to do with others.

322
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,370
But I still love the ancient style.

323
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,410
I still love Hanfu.

324
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,060
I hope my fans

325
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,220
don't feel frustrated about this circle

463
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,130
I've done a lot of things

464

You've been warming me up

467
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,220
I thought

00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,730
I could endure the loneliness.

469

470

that I couldn't live without you.

I was suddenly overwhelmed.

476
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,850
I didn't know what to say.

477

479

480
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,660
we hated each other.

482
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,580

♫How can it be like this?♫

574
00:26:53,850 --> 00:27:03,930
♫I feel uneasy without you♫

575
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,520
You're here.

576
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:04,880
Aren't you going to take a look?

577
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:05,840
No.

578
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,160
If I'm here,

579
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,560
I may make people uncomfortable.

580
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,560
This kind of occasion

581
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,470
has a happy and sweet time

582
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,030
for sharing happiness.

583

You're his younger brother.

584
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,360
You are an irreplaceable family.

585
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,120
When a family is together,

586
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,760
they will only be happier.

587
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,110
The past has passed.

588
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,230
The future

589
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,080
is going to be good.

590
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,840
Look, fireworks.

591
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:41,920
That one is beautiful.

592
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:42,720
So big.

Don't worry, Brother.

598
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,870
I'm with him.

599
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:24,790
Dad.

600
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,000
Mom.

601
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,390
Don't you want to stay for a few more days?

602
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,470
No, Xia Mo.

603
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,240
Your dad and I have things to do.

604
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,330
If Shen hadn't

605
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,680
taken us here in a hurry

606
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,400
to attend your proposal ceremony,

607
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:38,960
we wouldn't have come.

608
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,280
How about

609
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,470
staying for two more days?

610
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,430
What do you mean?

611
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,200
Didn't you see

612
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,170
that I kept crying?

613
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,630
I almost bawled my eyes out.

614
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,560
Do you think I haven't cried enough?

615
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,360
Do you want me

616
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:51,930
to be blind?

617
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,000
So you can find a new wife.

618
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,240
No, no.

619
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,470
You worry too much, Boss.

620
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:57,470
Mom.

621
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,190
If you don't work on your temper,

622
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,680
Shen Junyao

623
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,040
will be scared away by you.

624
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,960
Nonsense.

625
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,800
I've always been calm

626
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,230
when I talk with Shen.

627
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,050
Don't drive a wedge

628
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,350
between my son-in-law and me

629
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,430
No, no.

630
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,310
Boss, you worry too much.

631
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,040
Missy.

632
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,070
You imitated me.

633
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,390
I'll teach you a lesson.

634
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:22,830
Mom.

635
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,630
Mr. Shen.

636
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,110
What did you call me just now?

637
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,670
M-Mr. Shen.

638
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,470
I mean

639
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:24,990
what did you call me on WeChat?

640
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,400
Brother.

641
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:39,510
Remember,

642
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,550
call me that from now on.

643
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,950
[House of Shen]

644
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,270
Mr. Lin.

645
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,270
What's wrong?

646
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,470
Are you scared?

647
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,710
I wonder how President Shen would react

648
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,390
when he sees me.

649
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,030
According to my inference,

650
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:43,990
grandpa would be furious

651
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,770
when he sees you.

652
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,710
No way.

653
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:47,880
I think grandpa

654
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,110
has a good temper.

655
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,130
I've studied

656
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,620
the whole history of Jiuyu Group.

657
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,820
President Shen started a technology company

658
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,470
all by himself.

659
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:56,590
He was almost threatened by shareholders

660
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,640
so many times,

661
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,620
and they even shorted it.

662
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,010
But he still

663
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:00,910
controls his company

664
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,110
with an iron fist.

665
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,790
Maybe he only

666
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,750
shows his good temper in front of you.

667
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,990
Starlight.

668
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,830
What's your theoretical basis?

669
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,710
Because

670
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:19,270
Mr. Lin called grandpa President Shen.

671
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,390
If you keep making jokes like this,

672
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,000
I'll tear down

673
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,950
your incubator.

674
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,140
All right.

675
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,380
Let's go in.

676
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,330
Grandpa and auntie

677
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,390
will be anxious.

678
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:31,940
Xingran,

679
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,990
don't feel too pressured.

680
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,110
I'm here.

681
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,180
How about this?

682
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,550
Brother, you and sister go in first.

683
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,630
Xingran and I will go in later.

684
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,270
Let's go.

685
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,300

686
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,590
Grandpa.

687
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,340
Mom.

688
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,180
Hello, Grandpa.

689
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,090
Hello, Auntie.

690
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:06,870
Where is he?

691
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,470
Who is it?

692
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,400
Brat!

693
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,280
It's fine if you wind me up.

694
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:11,960
Your mom is here.

695
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,020
Don't make her worry.

696
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,710
All right, Grandpa.

697
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,030
They're parking.

698
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,830
They'll be there soon.

699
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:18,740
They'll be there soon.

700
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:40,470
President Shen.

701
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,670
Auntie.

702
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,300
Get on your knees.

703
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,260
Do you know why?

704
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,380
It's

705
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,179
to let you know

706
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,639
that everything you thought wrong

707
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,100
and did wrong,

708
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,420
you have to learn to take it yourself.

709
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,030
It's also a way for you to recognize your origin.

710
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,460
From now on,

711
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,540
you are no longer Lin Heng.

712
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,840
I'm not President Shen,

713
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,830
and she's not your auntie.

714
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,780
From now on,

715
00:34:59,400 --> 00:34:59,990
you're

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,740
Shen Xingran.

717
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,980
You are Shen Kun's grandson,

718
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,060
Yu Wanqing's son,

719
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,110
and Junyao's younger brother.

720
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,310
The whole Shen family

721
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,780
will be your backup.

722
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,100
Grandpa.

723
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,900
I'm sorry for making you suffer, my kid.

724
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,830
I'm sorry.

725
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,580
I should've come back earlier.

726
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,590
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

727
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,150
I'm sorry, Brother and Mom.

728
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,110
Xingran,

729
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,620
Come, Xingran.

730
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:56,950
Hurry.

731
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,180
Let your mom see you.

732
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,180
H-Hurry up.

733
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,260
Mom.

734
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,740
A-Are you really Xingran?

735
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,060
Mom.

736
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,820
My son.

737
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,660
I finally found you.

738
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,860
You're still alive.

739
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,350
Mom.

740
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,700
I will be with you

741
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,700
and never leave again.

742
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,700
Grandpa.

Mom.

744
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,620
How about we talk while eating?

745
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,870
We've been starving all day.

746
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,060
Yes.

747
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:47,800
Let's eat. Let's eat.

748
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,230
Xingran, hurry up.

749
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,460
Let's eat. Let's eat.

750
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,720
Sit next to your mom.

751
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,580
Come here.

752
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,220
Go.

753
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,220
Starlight.

754
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,460
Have a seat.

755
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,380
Sit next to me.

756
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,300
Okay.

757
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,180
Here. Here.

758
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:00,820
Here.

759
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,140
Sit down.

760
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,740
Xingran.

761
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,340
What do you like to eat? Just eat it.

762
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,660
Well,

763
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,940
I'll eat.

764
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,740
Grandpa.

765
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,020
Mom.

766
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:33,380
Brother.

767
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,940
Starlight.

768
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,290
Xia Mo.

769
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:37,880
Forgive me

770
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,380
for my willfulness and selfishness.

771
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:40,760
And forgive me

772
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,740
for leaving without saying goodbye as well.

773
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,110
I will take responsibility

774
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:45,860
for the crimes I have committed.

775
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,460
This is a chance to redeem myself.

776
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,340
I look forward to seeing you again.

777
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,630
♫The sunshine in the afternoon is lazy♫

778
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:59,410
♫It's better to have you go hiking with me♫

779
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,910
♫I'm in a rush tomorrow♫

780
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:04,300
♫You work with me♫

781
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,380
♫I drank half of the coffee♫

782
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,660
♫Imagine we'll be together in the future♫

783
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,720
♫Don't change it in seasons♫

784
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:18,130
♫Where is your dream home?♫

785
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,820
♫Mountaintop or seaside♫

786
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:25,940
♫I like warm places filled with flowers♫

787
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,690
♫Swimming, vacation, beaches♫

788
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,390
♫It's difficult to chat and shop♫

789
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,920
♫The romance of security♫

790
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:38,770
♫Are you secretly thinking of me?♫

791
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,490
♫Where should we meet?♫

792
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,120
♫Plan it beforehand♫

793
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,580
♫I won't let go when future comes♫

794
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,620
♫Don't let time drag anymore♫

795
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,740
♫Missing you has no time differences ♫

796
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,770
♫Home is where you are♫
