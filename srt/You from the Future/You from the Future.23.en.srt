00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,060
I'm strong.

197
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,860
I can also help.

198
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,310
You haven't been here several days

199
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,260
and now you're leaving.

200
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,380
All right.

201
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,380
Don't be so sad.

202
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:10,940
Xia Mo,

203
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,300
although we've only been colleagues for a few days,

204
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,690
and I don't have a deep impression of you,

205
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,100
I hope you can understand.

206
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,670
After all, we put all our energy

207
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,980
into work.

208
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,540
Enough.

209
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,660
Xia Mo.

210
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:22,880
Go pack your things.

211
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,780
I'll give you a ride later.

212
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,900
No need.

213
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,860
You and Mr. Shen are busy with work.

214
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,860
I don't have much stuff.

215
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,950
I'll go home

216
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,100
after I'm done packing.

217
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,420
I'll go to Candy tomorrow.

218
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,300
Okay.

219
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,420
I'll get back to work then.

220
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,740
Go ahead.

221
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,260
Come on.

222
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,310
I mean, Tang Tang.

223
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,740
I'm exhausted.

224
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,950
[Unknown number]

225
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,660
Hello.

226
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,820
Miss Xia.

227
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,940
Did you enjoy the couple's contract game

228
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,500
with Mr. Shen?

229
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,180
Who are you?

230
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,370
It doesn't matter who I am.

231
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,170
You just need to know

232
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,560
I have

233
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,590
the couple contract

234
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,090
between you and Mr. Shen.

235
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,780
What are you talking about?

236
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,380
I don't understand.

237
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,600
[Unknown Number, Relationship Contract Agreement]

238
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,050
Do you understand now?

239
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,850
What are you trying to do?

240
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,970
I don't mean anything else.

241
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,730
I just want to talk to you.

242
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,130
I sent you the address.

243
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,200
If you don't want the media

244
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,340
to know this,

245
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,860
come here yourself.

246
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,090
Hello?

247
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,330
The abandoned factory on Jiandongnan Road.

248
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,140
Hello.

249
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,500
Hello.

250
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,270
The abandoned factory on Jiandongnan Road.

251
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:15,890
Okay.

252
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,410
Who are you?

253
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,090
What?

254
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,870
You don't know

255
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,010
who I am?

256
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,540
Hello.

257
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,730
Shen Junyao.

258
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,610
I have Xia Mo controlled.

259
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,490
You have half an hour

260
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,450
to come to the abandoned factory on Jiandongnan Road.

261
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,690
Who are you? How is Xia Mo?

262
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,390
Shen Junyao, don't come over. I...

263
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:44,780
Xia Mo.

264
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,330
Remember,

265
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,370
you only have half an hour.

266
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,170
Hello? Hello?

267
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,120
Danika.

268
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,010
Contact Starlight.

269
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,130
Lin Heng.

270
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,600
What do you want?

271
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,970
Nothing.

272
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,130
I just want to play a game with him

273
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,570
and

274
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,160
torture him by the way.

275
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,850
I said I didn't like you.

276
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,490
It's useless for you to do this.

277
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,250
Xia Mo.

278
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,720
You think too much.

279
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,570
I've never liked you.

280
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,890
-Lin Heng? -Shush.

281
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,450
Your name is Xia Mo.

282
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:31,920
Am I right?

283
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,530
I wish one day

284
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,370
I can wear the hanfu you designed

285
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,090
and take a series of photos with you.

286
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,970
So,

287
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,700
you approached me

288
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,010
for Shen Junyao

289
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,690
in the first place?

290
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,560
You can't say that.

291
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,330
If you hadn't had a scandal with Shen Junyao

292
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,920
from the beginning,

293
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,090
if you hadn't asked me for my autograph,

294
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,380
and let me know

295
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,290
you're my fan,

296
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,099
I really wouldn't have known

297
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,650
how to deal with him.

298
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,530
You won't succeed.

299
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,460
Shen Junyao will find a way

300
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,440
to save me.

301
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,450
Xia Mo.

302
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,650
You don't know Shen Junyao.

303
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,800
He always runs away.

304
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:22,540
When in danger,

305
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,720
he will run away first.

306
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,880
Only 28 minutes left.

307
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,130
Guess

308
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,250
if he'll come?

309
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,720
He's not that kind of person.

310
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,490
Isn't that great?

311
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,800
If he dares to come,

312
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,690
he won't be able to go back.

313
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,200
Danika.

314
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,440
Have you contacted Starlight?

315
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,660
Starlight is still sleeping.

316
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,300
He's only

317
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,640
at 13% power.

318
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,210
Lin Heng.

319
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,560
Shen Junyao has nothing against you.

320
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,650
Why do you

321
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,880
have to do this to him?

322
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,840
Nothing against me?

323
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,640
How could it be?

324
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,290
Xia Mo,

325
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,240
what you don't know is

326
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,210
your boyfriend

327
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,840
looks decent,

328
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,620
but he's actually someone

329
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,280
who only cares about himself

330
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,900
and didn't save

331
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,840
his brother.

332
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,280
Didn't his brother already...

333
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,820
This is the place

334
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,090
where the fire started.

335
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,490
I was trapped there.

336
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,600
But Xia Mo, you know what?

337
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,460
Shen Junyao

338
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,410
could have saved me.

339
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,000
Brother, save me!

340
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,680
Brother!

341
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,200
I'm scared.

342
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,700
I cried

343
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,120
for my brother to save me,

344
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,810
but he ran away in front of me.

345
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,400
Brother!

346
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,840
Save me!

347
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,640
I managed to escape.

348
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,320
I thought I could go home,

349
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,100
but the Shen family

350
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,440
never came to look for me.

351
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,600
Shen Junyao.

352
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,820
Now he has

353
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,200
everything that should be mine.

354
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,940
I will take them back

355
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,000
one by one.

356
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,320
I'll torture him to death.

357
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,010
I'll have him see you

358
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:25,960
fall from the top

359
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,760
but be unable to save you.

360
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,240
Ten minutes left.

361
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,970
He's running out of time.

362
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,320
One minute left.

363
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,920
If Shen Junyao comes now,

364
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,080
and he sees you

365
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,160
fall from the top,

366
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,080
how would he react?

367
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,960
He must remember it for a long time, right?

368
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,440
Xia Mo.

369
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,200
You really came.

370
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,720
Lin Heng,

371
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,580
why did you kidnap Xia Mo?

372
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,960
Of course it's because of you.

373
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,840
But I didn't expect

374
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,840
you would actually come here.

375
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:08,790
Let her go.

376
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,920
Do it yourself if you dare.

377
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,090
Just come at me

378
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:31,650
if you need anything.

379
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,560
Don't hurt her.

380
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,320
That's boring.

381
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,570
I want you to watch

382
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,680
Xia Mo's accident

383
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,170
and make you recall

384
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,130
how it feels to lose your family.

385
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,120
What do you mean?

386
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,230
Xia Mo.

387
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,510
Sister, are you okay?

388
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:33,870
Hurry and hide.

389
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,260
Who allowed you to hurt my brother

390
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,040
and sister?

391
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,050
Starlight,

392
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,550
he is Shen Junyao's brother.

393
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,720
What?

394
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:00,760
Starlight.

395
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:01,950
Starlight.

396
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:03,510
Starlight.

397
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,400
Starlight.

398
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,480
Starlight!

399
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,130
Starlight, hang in there.

400
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,120
I'll contact Danika.

401
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,880
Danika.

402
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,110
Brother, be careful!

403
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,470
Wait for me here.

404
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:29,790
Shen Junyao.

405
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:55,990
Is what Xia Mo said true?

406
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,790
What do you think?

407
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,270
Whether it's true or not,

408
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,790
what's the point?

409
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,950
If you're Lin Heng,

410
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:09,630
I'll never forgive you.

411
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,230
But if you're Xingran...

412
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,470
Shut up!

413
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,790
You don't deserve to say that name.

414
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,030
I know you hate me.

415
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,890
If you want anything,

416
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,030
I can give it to you.

417
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,290
But Xia Mo and Starlight are innocent.

418
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,760
I was innocent

419
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,430
back then too.

420
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,070
Xingran,

421
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,630
back then...

422
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:39,650
I told you.

423
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,310
You don't deserve to say that name.

424
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,110
If you hadn't abandoned me,

425
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,010
would my face have been burned

426
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,200
and disfigured?

427
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,410
Would I have struggled to survive

428
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,240
in Zhenhai alone,

429
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,710
like a plastic bag?

430
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,430
I'm sorry.

431
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,590
I was scared.

432
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:05,950
I was wrong to run away.

433
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,870
But all these years,

434
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,390
Mom and Grandpa have been missing you.

435
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,270
Missing me?

436
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,110
Why didn't they look for me?

437
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,470
Shen Junyao,

438
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,260
did you do it on purpose?

439
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,720
You're afraid that I'd take away

440
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,230
everything you have now,

441
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,110
but I'm going to take everything from you.

442
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,910
No.

443
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:25,730
Because of you,

444
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,550
Mom got depression.

445
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,700
She's still in the hospital.

446
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,090
Dad divorced her.

447
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,750
This family has been completely ruined.

448
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,680
I know it's too late

449
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,510
to say this now,

450
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,810
but we really looked for you.

451
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:36,110
We really did.

452
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,070
Impossible.

453
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,190
Impossible.

454
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:40,950
You're lying.

455
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,270
You're lying.

456
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,030
Starlight is a T9 AI robot.

457
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:45,730
When I made the model,

458
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,290
I designed it

459
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,050
according to what you looked like

460
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:47,610
as a child.

461
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,830
I told you to stop.

462
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,070
I don't ask you to forgive me,

463
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,470
but I really hope you can go back.

464
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,620
Shut up!

465
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,220
Xingran,

466
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,430
come back with me

467
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,620
and visit Grandpa and Mom, okay?

468
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:04,860
I'm not going.

469
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,430
I'm not going.

470
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,390
I'm not going back.

471
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:10,240
We really hope you can...

472
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:10,900
Stop there!

473
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,900
No.

474
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,150
I'll let you feel regret

475
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,710
for the rest of your life.

476
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,550
Xingran.

477
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,550
Shen Junyao.

478
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,850
Why?

479
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,020
Why did you save me?

480
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,620
I don't want to lose you again.

481
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,340
Come back with me to see Mom.

482
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,310
She will be very happy

483
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,150
when she sees you.

484
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,980
You saved me.

485
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,580
Our debts

486
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,620
are cleared now.

487
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,590
I don't want it to be cleared.

488
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,900
I'm your brother.

489
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,500
But after all,

490
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,230
I made so many mistakes.

491
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,590
I'm afraid to go back.

492
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,900
You're not even afraid of death,

493
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,260
but you're afraid of going back to see your family?

494
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,620
I know.

495
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,380
Some things can't be made up.

496
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,820
I don't expect you to forgive me.

497
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,100
But Xingran,

498
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,230
I hope you can

499
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,100
live well for yourself.

500
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,460
If you miss home,

501
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,740
you can come back anytime.

502
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:38,430
Your room

503
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,700
has been saved for you.

504
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,160
Let's go home.

505
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,100
Let's go home.

506
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:24,980
Brother,

507
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,390
is everything settled?

508
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:28,620
Yes.

509
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,470
Starlight.

510
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,140
Brother,

511
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,540
Sister,

512
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,100
I'm sorry.

513
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,660
I lied to you just now,

514
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,180
but you said

515
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,380
a white lie doesn't count as a lie.

516
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,740
Starlight.

517
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,130
The shock just now

518
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,120
damaged my core parts

519
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,020
and the battery group.

520
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,050
I might

521
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,860
no longer be able

522
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,940
to accompany you two.

523
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,100
Starlight.

524
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,540
Starlight.

525
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,360
-Starlight.
-Starlight.

526
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,630
-Starlight.
-Don't worry.

527
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,620
Let's go back to the incubator.

528
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,780
It's futile.

529
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,460
After the core parts are damaged,

530
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,900
it's hard to recover.

531
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:21,980
But before that,

532
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,160
I want to apologize

533
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,290
one last time.

534
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,020
Stop it.

535
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,100
Let's go back and talk.

536
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,780
Actually from the beginning,

537
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,020
I've followed

538
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,900
Grandpa's instructions

539
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,020
to secretly

540
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,620
have you two date.

541
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,500
I never

542
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,890
confessed this to you two.

543
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,940
I hope you won't be angry.

544
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:53,990
I'm not angry.

545
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,530
I'll be angry if something happens to you.

546
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,140
Brother,

547
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,930
take care of Sister

548
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,820
and yourself.

549
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,860
I can no longer

550
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,850
accompany you two,

551
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,180
but seeing you two together,

552
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,330
my mission

553
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,730
has been completed.

554
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:20,530
No.

555
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,900
Starlight.

556
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,530
Starlight.

557
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,130
Starlight.

558
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,340
Starlight, hang in there.

559
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,250
Xia Mo, press the elevator.

560
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,020
Coming.

561
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,700
Hurry.

562
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:55,530
Xia Mo.

563
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,380
Open the upper button

564
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,170
on top of the incubator.

565
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,810
T9 robot detected.

566
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,850
Code name: Starlight.

567
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,260
The core part is damaged.

568
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,170
Start repair?

569
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:16,620
Repair.

570
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,660
The probability of Starlight being successfully repaired

571
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,610
is 50 percent.

572
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,130
If you confirm the repair,

573
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,740
the code will be destroyed

574
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,340
in order to protect the host

575
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,090
if the repair fails.

576
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,850
If the repair is canceled,

577
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,700
Starlight's internal storage will be formatted

578
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,090
and returned to the factory settings.

579
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,610
Please confirm the host's identity

580
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,210
and choose whether to repair it.

581
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,170
Xia Mo.

582
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,140
Starlight has been protecting you

583
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,850
because

584
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,700
you are his owner.

585
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,170
What did you say?

586
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,370
Starlight...

587
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,850
You fell unconscious

588
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,210
at the fire scene before.

589
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,100
In order to save you,

590
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,850
Starlight chose you as his owner.

591
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:20,280
♫Is there inevitability in the world you live?♫

592
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:16,610
Hello.

593
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,850
Can you let me out?

594
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,410
Let's have breakfast together.

595
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,530
The brain will be affected by an empty stomach.

596
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,050
♫Time heals everything♫

597
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,170
Insufficient blood supply

598
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,980
may lead to balding after some time.

599
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:29,540
♫But in the end, I was haunted by memories♫

600
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,930
Brother, go.

601
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:35,300
♫Ever since you appeared, I don't miss the past anymore♫

602
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:43,770
♫The plot is all yours to write, and I compromise to all the rules♫

603
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,690
Shen Junyao,

604
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,260
Starlight was damaged

605
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:50,070
♫That smile, that smile I often dream about♫

606
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,450
because of me.

607
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,140
I don't want him to...

608
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,460
Do you believe in Starlight?

609
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:56,840
♫Is approaching me unknowingly♫

610
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,850
If you trust him,

611
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,250
you'll know what to choose

612
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:02,520
♫I don't want us to always meet in dreams♫

613
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:06,270
♫I'm waiting for you to show up♫

614
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:12,440
♫Sincerely, I threw caution to the wind♫

615
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:20,610
♫Anticipating your appearance in reality♫

616
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,370
Confirm repair.

617
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:25,100
♫Please don't hide or escape♫

618
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,210
Confirmed.

619
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,880
♫Tell me it's not an illusion♫

620
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:34,520
♫Say the sweetest words in the dreamscape♫

621
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:42,389
♫I still remember and hope you'll say it again♫

622
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,820
♫How can it be like this?♫

623
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:57,260
♫I feel uneasy without you♫
