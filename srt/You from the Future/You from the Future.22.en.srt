00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,759
[Episode 22]

4
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,400
Xia Mo, you are a real piece of work.

5
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,039
How long have you known him?

6
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,640
Did you know if he was good or bad?

7
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,680
You have even been living with him.

8
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,800
You hid it from us

9
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,400
and lied to us by acting.

10
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,760
How dare you!

11
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,180
Are you going to piss off

12
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,010
your dad and me?

13
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:06,640
Mom.

14
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,770
I'm not...

15
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,880
Not what?

16
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,199
Auntie,

17
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,650
it's not Xia Mo's fault.

18
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,800
I asked her to do so.

19
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:14,960
Mr. Shen,

20
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,400
you're a big boss.

21
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,010
I don't need you to worry about

22
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,520
how I educate my daughter.

23
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,160
Xia Mo.

24
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,280
Stay away from the big boss.

25
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,560
Bosses nowadays

26
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,870
think they have some money

27
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,100
and they want to

28
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,000
take advantage of girls.

29
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,150
You even asked him to act with you.

30
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:33,990
Be smart!

31
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,880
It's her fault that she lied to us.

32
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,360
Calm down.

33
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,560
-Calm down.
-Go away.

34
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,400
Don't cover for her.

35
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,320
Back then,

36
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,680
you had a falling-out

37
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,400
with his grandpa?

38
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,440
You quit your job and you had to leave here.

39
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:45,970
Was the Shen family

40
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,120
a good family?

41
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,800
It's fine that you act nice

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,870
on other things.

43
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,000
But on the matter of Xia Xia,

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,040
you still want to act nice.

45
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,370
How can you be a father?

46
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,030
Mom.

47
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,520
It's not like that.

48
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,600
Not what?

49
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,520
Go home.

50
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,160
Come home with me now.

51
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,790
Don't ever come to Zhenhai again.

52
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,640
Xia Mo.

53
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,120
You're not going back with me?

54
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,320
Fine.

55
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,079
I'll go back with your dad.

56
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,480
Don't call me Mom anymore.

57
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,079
Lao Xia, let's go.

58
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,680
Mom.

59
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,030
Mom!

60
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,230
Brother.

61
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,010
Sister's mood index

62
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,350
is very low.

63
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,110
It means she's in a bad mood.

64
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,440
In this case,

65
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,600
she can't be alone.

66
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,680
Go upstairs and keep her company.

67
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:55,320
It's useless.

68
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,890
There is only one way

69
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:58,710
to make her happy.

70
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,960
You mean

71
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,670
you want to get her parents' approval?

72
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,310
Why are you here?

73
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,990
I'll go back with you.

74
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,909
You'd better not go to my home.

75
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,510
My mom...

76
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,880
It's all because of me.

77
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,390
Don't worry.

78
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:46,960
I will get their

79
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,040
approval.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,270
Are you done packing?

81
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:58,310
Almost.

82
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,910
Get changed.

83
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,630
I'll wait for you downstairs.

84
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:34,080
Danika.

85
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,310
Navigate to Xia Mo's parents' home.

86
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,310
The schedule has started.

87
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,510
It's 600 kilometers in total.

88
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,320
The estimated driving time

89
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,590
is 7 hours and 21 minutes.

90
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,000
The intelligence assist driving system

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,790
has opened

92
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,070
for the night.

93
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,470
It will automatically take over the vehicle driving rights

94
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,590
in 4 hours.

95
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,310
Please be careful on the road.

96
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,710
Shen Junyao.

97
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:07,670
Don’t worry.

98
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,630
Leave it to me.

99
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,870
Xia Mo.

100
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,260
Xia Mo.

101
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,590
We're here.

102
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,180
You...

103
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,020
You've been driving all night?

104
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,300
I just wanted to clear up the misunderstanding

105
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,700
and get recognition from your parents.

106
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:16,870
Are you tired?

107
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,710
No, let's go.

108
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,820
I wonder

109
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,940
how she is now.

110
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,430
I guess she'll be home

111
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,270
tonight.

112
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,940
You'll know when you see her.

113
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,420
Look at you.

114
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,670
I mean

115
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,630
what you said yesterday

116
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,620
was too harsh.

117
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,159
After all,

118
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:46,790
our daughter likes him.

119
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:47,830
She would be so sad

120
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,710
with your words.

121
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,550
It was not harsh.

122
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:54,980
Dad.

123
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,780
Mom.

124
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,750
Xia Xia.

125
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,550
You're back so early.

126
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,790
Uncle. Auntie.

127
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,550
Shen is here too.

128
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,510
Did you send Xia Xia back?

129
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,980
We came back together.

130
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,440
We left in a hurry this time,

131
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,540
so I didn't bring any gifts.

132
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,590
It's fine.

133
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,660
You don't have to bring gifts.

134
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,390
Zhenhai is not close to here.

135
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,710
Did you drive all night?

136
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,750
Go in and have a rest.

137
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,750
Thank you, Uncle.

138
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,420
Xia Xia,

139
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,570
why are you so immature?

140
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,510
Why did you let the big boss

141
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,470
come here?

142
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,790
This town is small

143
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,640
and shabby.

144
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,630
The road is covered with mud.

145
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,480
Don't stain

146
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,700
the big boss's car.

147
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,020
Mom!

148
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,180
Shen,

149
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,260
your auntie and I are

150
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,570
taking the luggage inside.

151
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,260
Xia Xia,

152
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,750
cut up some watermelon for Shen.

153
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,140
Let me do it, Uncle.

154
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,100
No need.

155
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,270
Take a rest.

156
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,059
Have some watermelon.

157
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,260
Have some watermelon first.

158
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,750
You must be hungry after driving all night.

159
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,740
I guess

160
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,830
my mom will finish cooking soon.

161
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,630
Let me do it. Don't cut your fingers.

162
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,870
Don't worry.

163
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,030
I'm prepared

164
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,990
to face everything.

165
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,830
Your parents

166
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,220
will approve of me.

167
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,580
You eat first.

168
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,420
Is it sweet?

169
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,420
Uncle. Auntie.

170
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,460
Thank you.

171
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,400
You came all the way

172
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,700
to send Xia Xia home.

173
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,370
That's what I should do.

174
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,420
Xia Mo is my girlfriend.

175
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,180
You're the boss of a big company.

176
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,540
You should be very busy.

177
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,260
Since Xia Xia has arrived,

178
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,540
you can go back now.

179
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,980
Mom.

180
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,290
Can you stop doing this?

181
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,260
What did I do?

182
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,540
Xia Xia.

183
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,220
What did I tell you yesterday?

184
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,540
Shen Junyao is nice to me.

185
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,690
And

186
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,620
we've been together for a long time.

187
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,440
You've been together for a long time,

188
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,380
but why didn't you dare to tell

189
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,140
us?

190
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,540
That's because you...

191
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,620
Uncle. Auntie.

192
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,820
It's our fault

193
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,780
that we hid it from you.

194
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,140
I know

195
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,270
you're worried that Xia Mo

196
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,780
will suffer if she's with me.

197
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,500
But don't worry.

198
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,970
I really like Xia Mo.

199
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,400
I will change all my flaws

200
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,350
for her.

201
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,420
Take good care of her.

202
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,820
Xia Mo is my daughter.

203
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,790
How can I not worry about her?

204
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,260
Don't blame me for being cruel.

205
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,670
You and Xia Xia

206
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,060
are totally different.

207
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,620
Besides,

208
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,990
I guess there're many girls

209
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,980
chasing after you.

210
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,200
You don't have to

211
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,700
be together with Xia Xia.

212
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,060
Auntie, I...

213
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,740
Enough, stop talking.

214
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,770
We'll eat lunch.

215
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,700
You go back now.

216
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,820
Lao Xia.

217
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,450
Go in and set up the table.

218
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,420
Mom.

219
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,780
He drove all night

220
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,700
to get here.

221
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,220
It's not safe

222
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,420
to drive back now.

223
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,140
Exactly.

224
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,660
Shen

225
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,810
didn't eat anything

226
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,130
for the whole night.

227
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,580
Stay for lunch.

228
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,020
Thank you, Uncle.

229
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,940
Mom...

230
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,820
It's okay.

231
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,420
Don't mind it.

232
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,580
Her bark

233
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,930
is worse than her bite.

234
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,770
She's just worried about Xia Xia.

235
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,260
I understand.

236
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,060
Lao Xia, what are you doing?

237
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,380
Coming.

238
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,900
Let's go.

239
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:52,940
Here.

240
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,820
Try my mom's cooking.

241
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,810
My mom likes

242
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,860
studying recipes.

243
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,700
Her cooking is delicious.

244
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,010
I can see that

245
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,540
every dish looks and smells so amazing.

246
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,580
You don't have to praise me.

247
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,700
The table is small.

248
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,820
These are just some home-cooked dishes.

249
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,010
The dishes you usually eat

250
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,470
are made by chefs

251
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,460
from high-end restaurants.

252
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,860
I don't think you're used to eating these.

253
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,450
Auntie,

254
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,580
I only eat in the restaurants

255
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,410
when I occasionally have social engagements.

256
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,590
I usually cook

257
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,580
at home.

258
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,140
You can cook?

259
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,900
Of course.

260
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,300
I have eaten it.

261
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,230
I did study some.

262
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,060
But I'm not good at it.

263
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,140
I think I will do better if I practice more.

264
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,940
Okay.

265
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,170
Let him eat.

266
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:34,970
Here.

267
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,810
Try the steamed buns made by your auntie.

268
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,130
Thank you, Uncle.

269
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,410
Let's eat.

270
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,860
Isn't it good?

271
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,100
Uncle.

272
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,690
Auntie's cooking is really good.

273
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,670
How is the robot

274
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,540
in the basement?

275
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,350
The result of the code

276
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,100
you wrote last time has come out.

277
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,270
Now the development of T6 robots

278
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,130
is about to start.

279
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,340
If you have time,

280
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,410
you can go to the company to check.

281
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,690
I'm not going. I'm old.

282
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,610
I can't keep up with you young people.

283
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,060
Uncle,

284
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,070
do you still mind

285
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,290
grandpa's decision back then?

286
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,210
You knew it?

287
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,500
Grandpa didn't agree

288
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,060
because of the situation back then.

289
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,430
Stantech

290
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,850
is strong enough now.

291
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,990
Besides, grandpa

292
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,510
has agreed to

293
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,690
develop T6.

294
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,850
Mom.

295
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,530
Shen Junyao treats me well.

296
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,570
Please

297
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,100
don't be like that again.

298
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,590
Why do you

299
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,410
side with him?

300
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,450
I did it for you.

301
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,140
Do you know

302
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,460
what kind of family they are?

303
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,900
Your dad couldn't handle it

304
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,850
and hid in the countryside.

305
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,570
Who do you think you are?

306
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,130
If you dare to marry him,

307
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,690
you'll suffer in the future.

308
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,410
Mom.

309
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,730
I've seen Shen Junyao's grandpa.

310
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,090
He looks easy to get along with.

311
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,050
Besides...

312
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,070
You won't believe me,

313
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,010
right?

314
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,610
When a girl is of age, she must be married off.

315
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,620
All right.

316
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,530
We're done talking.

317
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,380
Don't say that.

318
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,290
Mom.

319
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,090
It seems that

320
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,050
people change.

321
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,490
Uncle, are you still willing to go back?

322
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,210
Lao Xia,

323
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,250
don't wander around in the yard.

324
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,340
We agreed

325
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,410
to dig for clams.

326
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,420
Let's go

327
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,290
while the weather is good.

328
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,370
Here.

329
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,770
I'll go get changed.

330
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,530
Dad.

331
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,810
Mom.

332
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,130
Where are you going?

333
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,530
To dig for clams.

334
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,050
Now the clams are the best.

335
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,380
You're back.

336
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,260
I have to cook

337
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,250
your favorite food.

338
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,340
How about

339
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,620
you get changed too?

340
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,690
Let's go together.

341
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,840
But...

342
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,930
Why don't we go together?

343
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,930
Sure.

344
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,130
Have some water.

345
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,530
I'll get changed.

346
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,290
You haven't

347
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,090
dug for clams yourself, right?

348
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,340
No.

349
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,050
Right.

350
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,280
A big boss like you

351
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,770
can't do this.

352
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,850
That's why

353
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,850
you and Xia Xia

354
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,450
are totally different.

355
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,490
It's okay, Auntie.

356
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,980
I'll go with you.

357
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,730
No need.

358
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,020
I'm afraid you don't even know

359
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,170
where clams grow.

360
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,360
You'd better stay here.

361
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,490
I can learn.

362
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,730
Uncle.

363
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:43,660
Do you have extra outfit

364
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,380
for me?

365
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,130
Sure.

366
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,130
Let's go.

367
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,290
I'm done.

368
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,410
Let's go now.

369
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,850
Shen Junyao.

370
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,730
How about you do not go?

371
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,810
I'll figure out a way

372
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,680
to let them accept you.

373
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,820
It's my duty

374
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,100
to get their approval.

375
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,730
But...

376
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,360
Xia Mo.

377
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,810
I'm here

378
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,490
not just

379
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,570
to reassure your parents.

380
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,370
I also want you to see

381
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,290
my determination to like you.

382
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,680
Xia Xia.

383
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,700
Hurry up.

384
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,760
Coming.

385
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,450
Go.

386
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,810
Coming.

387
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,130
Stop looking.

388
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,140
Maybe he is

389
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,640
on the way back.

390
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,730
Mom.

391
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,650
Am I wrong?

392
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,369
Don't forget

393
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,800
that he's the boss of a big company.

394
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,410
He doesn't have time

395
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,609
to dig for clams with you.

396
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:10,560
But...

397
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,160
you can't do this.

398
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:14,920
Whether you agree to our relationship

399
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,200
is one thing.

400
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,460
But you can't always ask him to leave.

401
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,290
I'm just worried about you.

402
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,859
Mom.

403
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,240
I'm an adult.

404
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,839
I know

405
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,050
if he treats me well.

406
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:26,609
One time,

407
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:27,750
I had a meal with Tangtang.

408
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,850
It was suddenly on fire.

409
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,690
He rushed in

410
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,650
to save me.

411
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,730
-What? 
-What?

412
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,160
-On fire.
-On fire.

413
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,200
My girl, let me see.

414
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,410
Were you hurt?

415
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,600
No, I wasn't.

416
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,360
Shen Junyao saved me.

417
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,650
See?

418
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,930
Shen is a good kid.

419
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,950
You silly girl.

420
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,890
Why didn't you

421
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,620
tell me right away

422
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,680
after having such a big accident?

423
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,600
I didn't want you to worry.

424
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,770
Do you think I won't worry about you

425
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,570
if you tell me now?

426
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,510
Look.

427
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,730
I'm standing in front of you

428
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,880
safe and sound.

429
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,120
Aren't we talking about Shen Junyao now?

430
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,800
I don't want to talk about him.

431
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,800
Mom.

432
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,500
I'm the one being together

433
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,040
with Shen Junyao.

434
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,820
You don't know

435
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,120
what we've been through

436
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,360
and what happened.

437
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,140
You denied him completely

438
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,970
because I didn't tell you about our relationship

439
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,600
in time.

440
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,600
Don't you think it's too arbitrary?

441
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,920
It's because...

442
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,150
Shen Junyao!

443
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,880
Come here.

444
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,360
Uncle. Auntie. Xia Mo.

445
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,160
I'm here.

446
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,690
So professional.

447
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,170
Are you here for clams

448
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,360
or tunnels?

449
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,800
It's Shen's first time doing this.

450
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:48,880
He's inexperienced.

451
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,160
You'll get it after digging a few more times.

452
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,230
Mom,

453
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,890
don’t look down on the shovel.

454
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,680
How about this?

455
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,810
Let's have a competition.

456
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,050
You and my dad are a team.

457
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,330
I’ll team up with Shen Junyao.

458
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,920
Let's see who can get more.

459
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,200
Whatever.

460
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,440
Sure.

461
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:02,990
Let's go.

462
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:05,920
Let's go.

463
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,240
Where are we going to dig for clams?

464
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,200
Over there.

465
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,290
I was caught by a crab.

466
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,870
A small crab.

467
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,170
It pisses me off.

468
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,250
I especially buried it

469
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,090
to dig it.

470
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:16,840
Really?

471
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,180
A grown girl can't stay by my side.

472
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,110
Just dig here.

473
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,640
Can you do it?

474
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,080
Sure.

475
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,240
Clam.

476
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,800
You'd better come out.

477
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,490
Or I'll drive

478
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,720
my excavator here.

479
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,680
You're smart.

480
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,720
Let me tell you.

481
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,690
There's a secret

482
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,000
to dig for clams.

483
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,150
Not like that.

484
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:07,960
I'll teach you.

485
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,680
You just need to

486
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,150
shovel like this.

487
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,400
Look, there it is.

488
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,560
Am I awesome?

489
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,760
Learn from me.

490
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:27,960
How is it?

491
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,550
Xia Mo.

492
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:29,760
I got it.

493
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,830
I got clams.

494
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,010
Shen Junyao.

495
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,360
You're amazing.

496
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:37,760
Shen Junyao.

497
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,990
You're good at digging for clams.

498
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,920
We can definitely win.

499
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:45,640
What's wrong?

500
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,400
I'm thinking

501
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,690
that if we really win,

502
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,160
will she hate me more?

503
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,080
Don't worry.

504
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,530
Her bark

505
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,160
is worse than her bite.

506
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,450
She promised us

507
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,280
to play this game.

508
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,990
It means she almost changed her mind.

509
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,640
She was just embarrassed to say it.

510
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:01,550
Don't worry.

511
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:02,650
Keep it up.

512
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,150
OK.

513
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:48,720
These two kids

514
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,910
are having fun.

515
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,270
They got a lot today.

516
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:57,760
Is it heavy?

517
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,190
Yes.

518
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,800
Shen.

519
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,510
Girl.

520
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,040
You got so many clams.

521
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,840
Looks like we lost the competition.

522
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,760
They did dig a lot of clams.

523
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,670
I didn't expect him

524
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,750
to do some rough work.

525
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,650
Enough.

526
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,790
It's enough for a few days.

527
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:19,890
Let's pack up

528
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:20,760
and go back.

529
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,070
I haven't taken the clams yet.

530
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,350
-I-I haven't taken the clams.
-Let's go.

531
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,200
Actually, Shen is a good kid.

532
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,550
He's very sincere to our daughter.

533
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,710
You

534
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,110
are a well-known good man.

535
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,630
You think everyone is sincere.

536
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,670
Actually, I didn't agree with them

537
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,430
at the beginning.

538
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,750
After all, you know

539
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,710
what happened between my teacher and me.

540
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:48,920
I was worried that our daughter

541
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,190
would repeat my mistake.

542
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,520
But now,

543
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,150
I think Shen is reliable.

544
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,440
You were obstructive,

545
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,000
but he didn't say anything.

546
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,940
He really

547
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,150
loves our daughter.

548
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,000
Don't always be so tough.

549
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,320
This concerns the lifetime happiness

550
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,630
of our daughter.

551
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,070
What if she finds a bad one

552
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,760
after missing Shen?

553
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,400
Enough.

554
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,430
Stop nagging.

555
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,590
You're giving me a headache.

556
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,030
Pack the things.

557
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,170
Let's go back.

558
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:16,830
Okay.

559
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,510
Let's go.

560
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,950
Uncle. Auntie.

561
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,630
I brought sesame oil and salt.

562
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,750
Put them here.

563
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,620
Shen,

564
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,740
why don't you get changed

565
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,390
and get some sleep?

566
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,170
You didn't sleep well

567
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,190
last night.

568
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,950
Yeah, you need to take a break.

569
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,640
Don't do it.

570
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,580
Right.

571
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,200
Go to my room to rest.

572
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,310
I'll tell you when the meal is ready.

573
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,390
It's okay.

574
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,230
I'm fine now.

575
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:52,550
Uncle. Auntie.

576
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,440
Take a rest.

577
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,470
L-Let me do it.

578
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,110
I told you.

579
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,400
Let's do it together.

580
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,270
I'll help you.

581
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,110
Look.

Should I put this first?

624
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,970
You need to dip the sauce first,
