21
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,720
If the body had been burned
and then sunk into the pond,

22
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,890
the skin would have contracted

23
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,320
and wouldn't have swollen so quickly.

24
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,840
So

25
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,800
the body wasn't burned.

26
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,560
Exactly.

27
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,440
The scholar's cap found
at the arson site

28
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,240
doesn't mean the victim

29
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,840
was there beforehand.

30
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,880
Look.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,840
His robe,

32
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,960
shoes, and headscarf are all missing.

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,320
The killer is clearly trying
to mislead us

34
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,760
by burning these items.

35
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,040
I think the most important thing now

36
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,480
is to investigate

37
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,800
how Fu Miao died.

38
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,680
Since he wasn't burned,

39
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,840
was he drowned?

40
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,800
No.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,280
I just checked.

42
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,220
Although there was water
in his mouth and nose,

43
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,200
his lungs only contained
a small amount of water.

44
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,840
He must have been submerged

45
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,320
in the water after death.

46
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,240
So it wasn't by burning

47
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,320
or drowning.

48
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,480
I've been well-versed
in "Celebrated Cases of Judge Di."

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,040
I've never encountered
such a strange case.

50
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,000
I've read Agatha, Queen,
and Carr's works.

51
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,480
So I've seen all sorts of strange cases.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,760
No matter how bizarre

53
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,080
the killer's tricks are,

54
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,840
everything will make sense

55
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,640
once the truth is revealed.

56
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,920
We just haven't seen

57
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,640
through it yet.

58
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,400
Ms. Xuanxuan,

59
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,480
are you talking
about the "The Last Manuscript"?

60
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,040
It is also about solving cases?

61
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,980
But why have I never heard of it?

62
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,080
Li Ye is running away.

63
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,300
After him!

64
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,040
Why is he running away?

65
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,280
Could he be the killer?

66
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,860
Something is definitely wrong with him.

67
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,320
May I know

68
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,840
if you're Mr. Sun?

69
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,920
You are...

70
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,440
If I may ask,

71
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,960
did Li Ye escape?

72
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,800
Who are you?

73
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,080
I didn't kill anyone.

74
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,160
You better behave.

75
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,720
Zijie.

76
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,840
Trying to run, huh?

77
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,160
I haven't ordered your arrest yet,

78
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,020
but you ran off by yourself?

79
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,640
Why?

80
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,500
Is disguising
as Fox Spirit hard now?

81
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:24,880
Sir,

82
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,620
I didn't kill anyone.

83
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,080
I swear.

84
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,180
Enough said.

85
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,460
Now that the killer has been caught,

86
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,120
we can go back to report on the results.

87
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,800
By the way,

88
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,800
I ran into

89
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,360
Li Ye's classmate just now.

90
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,680
I am Li Ye's classmate.

91
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,680
My name is Sun Yi from Lin Village.

92
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,480
I heard Magistrate Guo is here
to investigate a case.

93
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,020
So I came to report something.

94
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,200
What is it?

95
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,520
Zhao Qiang, Li Ye, and Fu Miao

96
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,500
are the top three students
at the town's academy.

97
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,160
Li Ye ranked last among them.

98
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,960
But the three were very close friends.

99
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,840
However,

100
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,360
I've seen Li Ye report Fu Miao

101
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,400
to their teacher several times
in secret.

102
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,440
Is that true?

103
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,920
What did he report?

104
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,680
He accused him

105
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,620
of being a hypocrite dressed
as a scholar

106
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,240
who violated a widow.

107
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,080
A widow?

108
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,920
According to Sun Yi,

109
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,360
the matter was dropped

110
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,080
because of a lack of evidence.

111
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,600
Regardless of Fu Miao's
personal character,

112
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,960
it's not an excuse
to harm your classmate.

113
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,800
No, that's not right.

114
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,800
What's not right?

115
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,000
Whether it was out
of personal grudge or personal gain,

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,560
he had the opportunity

117
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,180
and the motive to commit the crime.

118
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,920
On top of that, he tried to escape.

119
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,720
There's plenty of evidence pointing
to him as the killer.

120
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
Then how did Fu Miao disappear?

121
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,320
And what about Zhao Qiang
and that house?

122
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,640
How did they vanish?

123
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
About that...

124
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,760
I haven't figured out yet.

125
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,200
Zhao Qiang disappeared without a trace.

126
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,080
Did you already kill him?

127
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,960
Li Ye,

128
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,840
you better tell the truth

129
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,800
and spare yourself
from unnecessary suffering.

130
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,520
Sir,

131
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,440
I really don't know where Zhao is,

132
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,160
and I didn't kill anyone.

133
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,720
If you didn't kill anyone,

134
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,580
why did you run?

135
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,810
Fox Spirit has started to kill!

136
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,640
Sir!

137
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,000
Zhao Qiang?

138
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,600
Don't kill me.

139
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
It's him.

140
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,320
It's him!

141
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
He killed him!

142
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,840
He did it!

143
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,440
It was him!

144
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,560
Don't run!

145
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,360
He killed him.

146
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,320
Has he lost his mind?

147
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,580
What happened to Zhao Qiang?

148
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,320
He has gone mad.

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,040
What is this situation?

150
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,280
I didn't know the people
of Zhao Village were so superstitious.

151
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,960
To think he could actually escape
from the Fox Spirit!

152
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,320
But it seems

153
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,320
he has gone mad.

154
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
Disappear?

155
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,980
He's gone mad,
but he can still find his way?

156
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,720
Keep an eye on Zhao Qiang.

157
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,300
I need to head to Zhao Xiaolin's house.

158
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,520
How long has Xuanxuan been gone?

159
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,760
It's been quite a while.

160
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,560
Why is it dark inside?

161
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,040
Let's go inside.

162
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,640
Xuanxuan, are you here?

163
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,800
Xuanxuan.

164
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,600
Is that you?

165
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,000
Is that Xuanxuan?

166
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,200
Why is she not answering?

167
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,560
Look! She...

168
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,960
She disappeared.

169
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,800
Xuanxuan.

170
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,800
The window is not opened.

171
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,920
Don't you agree?

172
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,200
Something is not right.

173
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,720
That's weird.

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,520
I clearly saw her just now.

175
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,400
But where did she go?

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
I've figured out the killer's method.

177
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,480
Xuanxuan?

178
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,440
I thought...

179
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,560
Weren't you inside just now?

180
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,840
It's all

181
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,040
an illusion,

182
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,080
which is

183
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,520
what we call magic in our time.

184
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,560
What magic?

185
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,520
In your time, this is called a trick.

186
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,440
A trick?

187
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,100
Using tricks to commit murder?

188
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,840
If I can solve this case,

189
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,600
my reputation will spread far and wide.

190
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,160
Hurry and tell me how it happened.

191
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,440
You promised me, remember?

192
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,680
And if the case is solved,

193
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,180
just say it was me who solved it.

194
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,000
What's in it for me

195
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,320
if I tell you?

196
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,120
What do you want?

197
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,100
You'll have to do what I say after this.

198
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,440
Cao Xuanxuan,

199
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,920
don't push it.

200
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,500
I'm a county magistrate, you know?

201
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,200
How can I obey a woman?

202
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,520
If the case is cracked,

203
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,620
you'll be the one
enjoying fame and fortune.

204
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,220
You have nothing to lose here.

205
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,240
Is that so?

206
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,600
But

207
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,060
I'll only obey you when no one's around.

208
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,580
If there's someone else present,

209
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,100
I must still be the one in charge.

210
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,240
It's a deal, then?

211
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:31,960
Deal.

212
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,240
You'll be mine sooner or later.

213
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,480
Just watch how I deal with you.

214
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,400
What did you say?

215
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,380
I said you made so much contribution
with your hard work.

216
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,920
The family will be counting on you.

217
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,880
All right, then.

218
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,260
I'll tell you how it happened.

219
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,920
Follow me.

220
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,680
The shadow you saw

221
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,400
was that thing.

222
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,400
It's pretty simple.

223
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,480
The killer used a thin string
to control the puppet that night.

224
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,040
It was dark in here at that time.

225
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,640
After Zhao Xiaolin entered the house,

226
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,320
she thought the puppet was Fu Miao.

227
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,960
During the time it took to light a lamp,

228
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,520
the killer pulled the puppet
to the ceiling.

229
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,240
That's why

230
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,080
Zhao Xiaolin thought Fu Miao

231
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,520
had disappeared into thin air.

232
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,480
I didn't know such a method existed.

233
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,600
Incredible!

234
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,640
On the night of the incident,

235
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,480
Zhao Qiang went to town
to buy ink and brush.

236
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,680
Li Ye was the only one here.

237
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,840
Then it really must have been him.

238
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,540
Behave yourself.

239
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,120
Sir, look.

240
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,880
(Arsenic)
I found this on him.

241
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,240
Arsenic?

242
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,720
Is this yours?

243
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,480
Tell the truth.

244
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,560
I did want

245
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
to kill Fu Miao.

246
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,400
But he already died

247
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,620
before I made my move.

248
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,800
It wasn't me who killed him.

249
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,920
We have solid evidence.

250
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,060
Why are you still denying it?

251
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,200
Why did you kill Fu Miao?

252
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,080
Did you come up

253
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,480
with the puppet trick yourself,

254
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,740
or did someone teach you?

255
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,240
What puppet?

256
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,640
I don't know what you mean.

257
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,080
I wanted to kill Fu Miao

258
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,900
because he was a wolf
in sheep's clothing!

259
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,200
Explain it.

260
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,240
My childhood sweetheart,

261
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,680
Zhang Qin, had been married

262
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,240
to the Zhao Village for a few years

263
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,720
before becoming a widow.

264
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,440
She is already a woman of misfortune,

265
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,080
who lives alone

266
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,760
raising a mentally disabled child.

267
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,920
That day,

268
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,840
Fu Miao saw her alone at home.

269
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,840
Driven by lust,

270
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,560
he violated her.

271
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,520
Zhang Qin?

272
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,660
It's Madam Zhang.

273
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,990
The one we ran into the other day.

274
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,640
So it was a crime passion.

275
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
No, it wasn't.

276
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,960
I ran

277
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,000
because you suspected me

278
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,080
that day.

279
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,840
He can't be trusted.

280
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,320
Go and check on Zhang Qin.

281
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,440
- All right.
- Yes, sir.

282
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,560
Xiaohua,

283
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,720
go inside and play.

284
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,160
Good evening.

285
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,000
May I know what brings

286
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,560
both of you here?

287
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,080
We are here to ask about Li Ye.

288
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,640
Sir,

289
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,600
I don't really know

290
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,200
Li Ye.

291
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,000
But I heard

292
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,360
you were childhood sweethearts.

293
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,240
He was spouting nonsense.

294
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,540
Then what about Fu Miao?

295
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,120
Don't be afraid.

296
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,940
You only need to tell us the truth.

297
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,320
We'll seek justice for you.

298
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Did Fu Miao

299
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,480
violate you?

300
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,760
No.

301
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,080
He did not.

302
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
Who spoke such nonsense

303
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,100
to tarnish a woman's reputation?

304
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,920
Madam Zhang, calm down.

305
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,120
We have no bad intentions.

306
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,500
We only want to find the truth

307
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,920
to bring the bad person to justice.

308
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,140
There's no such thing.

309
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,160
I still have some needlework to do.

310
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,520
I won't see you out.

311
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,440
Take care.

312
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,480
Listen to me.

313
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,600
We've lost our chance.

314
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,520
I fear she has already
taken precautions.

315
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,260
It will be hard
to put up against her now.

316
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,200
I don't think

317
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,360
she was sent by Guo Zilu.

318
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
I think you were bewitched by her.

319
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,720
If she wanted to harm me,

320
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,640
Zhao Village would be an opportunity,

321
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,260
and she would definitely make her move.

322
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,220
But you saw it yourself.

323
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,560
She is so focused on the case.

324
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,000
Fine.

325
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,120
I won't argue with you.

326
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,720
You're not being rational.

327
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,160
I can't believe Li Ye managed to escape.

328
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,680
It looks like he is the killer.

329
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,740
How about this?

330
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,720
Go and investigate him.

331
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,220
All right.

332
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,340
What's the matter?

333
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,800
Li Ye escaped.

334
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,400
What?

335
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,560
Sir,

336
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Xiaohua is missing.

337
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,520
Sir.

338
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,760
What's the matter?

339
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,680
I think Li Ye took her away.

340
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,860
Why don't you get up first?

341
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,660
Tell us

342
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,480
what happened.

343
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,480
Why are you certain it was Li Ye?

344
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
Actually,

345
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,720
Li Ye is indeed my childhood sweetheart.

346
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,880
The Li family opposed our marriage.

347
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,940
That's why I married
into the Zhao Village.

348
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,400
After my husband's demise,

349
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,840
Li Ye has been persuading me
to give up my child.

350
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,160
Then he'll beg his family
to let him marry me.

351
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,360
But no matter what,

352
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,520
she is still

353
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,560
my flesh and blood.

354
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,680
How could I do that?

355
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:56,375
So I cut off all contact with him.

356
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,600
I didn't expect him to come
to the Zhao Village again.

357
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,640
Li Ye is unbelievable.

358
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,340
No wonder he escaped.

359
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,760
He's a scholar.

360
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,240
Yet, he is so heartless.

361
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,640
Li Ye has escaped?

362
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,320
Then what about Xiaohua?

363
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,760
Calm down.

364
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,920
We'll go and search for her.

365
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,580
Given the situation,

366
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,980
we should find the child first.

367
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,100
Let's search separately.

368
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,560
Let's go.

369
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,420
Let's go, sir.

370
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,400
All right.

371
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,800
Excuse me.

372
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,200
Hello.

373
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,240
Have you seen

374
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,280
a child at this height?

375
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,200
No.

376
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,200
She has big eyes.

377
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,200
No.

378
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,520
Excuse me.

379
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,280
Have you seen

380
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,300
a girl at this height?

381
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,180
Her name is Xiaohua.

382
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,880
No.

383
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,240
Excuse me, mister.

384
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,280
Have you seen...

385
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,760
Excuse me.

386
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,360
Have you seen

387
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,360
a child at this height?

388
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,140
Her name is Xiaohua.

389
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:37,700
No.

390
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,560
Have you seen

391
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,560
a girl this tall?

392
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,300
- No.
- Her name

393
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:42,880
is Xiaohua.

394
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,120
But last night when I woke

395
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,280
up in the middle of the night,

396
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,520
I saw a man

397
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,640
enter Zhang Qin's house.

398
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,840
Could he be the one
who took the girl away?

399
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,400
Thank you for the information.

400
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,280
You're welcome.

401
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,440
It looks like it was Li Ye

402
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,840
who took Xiaohua away.

403
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,820
Then we should go and find more clues.

404
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,940
- Okay.
- Let's go.

405
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
How did the search go?

406
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,480
Have you found Xiaohua?

407
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,200
Not yet.

408
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,360
What about you?

409
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,160
Have you seen Xiaohua?

410
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,120
Did you see her?

411
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,920
Have you found her?

412
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,560
Madam Zhang,

413
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,480
calm down.

414
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,200
We will continue searching for her.

415
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,080
Oh, Xiaohua.

416
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,760
What's going on here?

417
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,000
I have no idea.

418
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,040
Xiaohua?

419
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,800
- Xiaohua?
- Xiaohua.

420
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,840
Xiaohua, what happened to you?

421
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,880
Calm down.

422
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,720
She's still alive.

423
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,600
She only fainted.

424
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,920
That's great.

425
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,320
The marks on her neck

426
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,820
seem to have been caused

427
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,080
by vines or thorns.

428
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:54,920
Mister,

429
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,600
where did you find Xiaohua?

430
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,160
I found her

431
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,160
in a grassy patch.

432
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,040
(Candied hawthorn?)

433
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,920
Let's send Xiaohua to the physician.

434
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,440
All right.

435
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,160
Master,

436
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,480
there's news from the Cao Manor.

437
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,560
They say her sister disappeared

438
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,120
and was never found again.

439
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,800
Cao Xuanxuan in the residence

440
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,920
might actually be her missing sister.

441
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,200
I've heard

442
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,400
something interesting.

443
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,480
The midwife who delivered
the Cao sisters said

444
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,040
Cao Xuanxuan's older sister

445
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,560
had a crescent-shaped birthmark
on her back.

446
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,880
A crescent-shaped birthmark?

447
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,560
(This child is badly injured.)

448
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,360
(Her life isn't in danger)

449
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,880
(but it'll be a while)

450
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,160
(before she wakes up.)

451
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,360
Madam Zhang,

452
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,560
are you home?

453
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,800
Madam Zhang.

454
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,920
Madam Zhang.

455
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,080
Madam Zhang.

456
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,360
Why are you here again?

457
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,600
You call yourselves officials

458
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,480
but you still couldn't catch the killer.

459
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,360
We...

460
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,880
We're here to catch the killer.

461
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,680
I heard a man came

462
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,680
to your house last night.

463
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,540
Was that Li Ye?

464
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,680
Why do you like

465
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,480
to pick on a widow
and her orphaned child?

466
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,960
Xiaohua is already in such a state.

467
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,120
Don't ever come again!

468
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,520
- Madam Zhang!
- Madam Zhang!

469
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,960
It's a man's shoe.

470
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,040
It looks like it belongs to Li Ye.

471
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,240
Are you sure?

472
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,680
Yes.

473
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,400
Go and inform Magistrate Guo first.

474
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,460
I'll go after Li Ye.

475
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
What is this place?

476
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,040
Why are we here?

477
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,120
The killer

478
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,480
should be executed.

479
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,620
I told you

480
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,820
I didn't kill anyone.

481
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,140
The child is innocent
and the law shows no mercy.

482
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,140
What child?

483
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,240
You still won't admit it, huh?

484
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,200
I may have persuaded

485
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,520
Zhang Qin to send Xiaohua
to someone else.

486
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,320
But I wouldn't go so far
as to harm a child.

487
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,000
If you didn't try to kill her,

488
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,240
why is your shoe
at the Zhang family's house?

489
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,600
What are you saying?

490
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,440
My shoe...

491
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,400
Where did your shoe go?

492
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,520
Don't tell me you forgot.

493
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,360
My shoes were supposed to be...

494
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,960
Who picked on you?

495
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,880
Your classmate.

496
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,440
Miss He,

497
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,360
let me explain.

498
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,200
My classmate is Zhao.

499
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:51,960
You...

500
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,120
Miss He,

501
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,160
what are you doing?

502
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
I pretended to get caught

503
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,080
to hear the truth from you.

504
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,240
Miss He,

505
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,260
everything is a misunderstanding.

506
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,340
You don't have to explain.

507
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,040
Go back

508
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,480
and tell Magistrate Guo everything.

509
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,840
Miss He,

510
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,600
I'll go with you.

511
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,120
Let's go.

512
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,200
What are you thinking?

513
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,080
After He Chun brought Li Ye back here,

514
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,680
won't we get to the bottom of the case?

515
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,880
I still have a few doubts.

516
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,960
I still couldn't figure out

517
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,820
how Xiaohua and Zhao Qiang disappeared.

518
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,080
If you put it that way,

519
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,160
it shows Zhao Qiang
and the house's disappearance

520
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,400
is really strange.

521
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,240
Every strange thing

522
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,680
can be explained in the end.

523
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,920
Maybe

524
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,400
it's just a trick to confuse us.

525
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,360
Xuanxuan,

526
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,520
come here.

527
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,440
What is it?

528
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,440
We used to play this game

529
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,560
when we were kids.

530
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,680
Do you remember that?

531
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,760
Guo Zijie,

532
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,960
how can you think about playing

533
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,800
at a time like this?

534
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,880
We have time.

535
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,780
How about you go first?

536
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,360
Come on.

537
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,360
Why should I?

538
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,600
We're not kids anymore.

539
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
The house...

540
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,960
I get it now.

541
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,480
What did you figure out?

542
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
But ancient people

543
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,440
couldn't possibly know these things.

544
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,740
I need to test something out.

545
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,320
Zijie,

546
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,040
I still think she's suspicious.

547
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,840
Heroine, have mercy.

548
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,840
Spare my life.

549
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,360
Tell me

550
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,200
who sent you here.

551
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,000
Tight-lipped, huh?

552
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,160
What are you drawing?

553
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,000
A house.

554
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,240
A house?

555
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,400
All done.

556
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,720
Are you still thinking

557
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,640
about the secret to Zhao Qiang's house?

558
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,600
I think it's pretty simple.

559
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,680
He just used

560
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,400
an optical illusion.

561
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,840
What illusion?

562
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,140
I had someone build this for me.

563
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,080
See

564
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,340
if there's any difference.

565
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,240
Isn't this just a house model

566
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,320
built by a carpenter?

567
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,560
The killer couldn't

568
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,120
have shrunk the inn
and taken it away.

569
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,080
Wait a minute.

570
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,840
How did he do it?

571
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,280
When we saw Zhao Qiang go inside,

572
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,400
he was actually stepping behind a wall.

573
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,680
From our angle,

574
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,280
it just looked like he entered a house.

575
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,960
That's not right.

576
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,120
Think about it.

577
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,680
But Zhao Qiang went in himself.

578
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,520
Couldn't he tell it was just a wall?

579
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,000
Are you saying Zhao Qiang
is behind everything?

580
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:20,960
Exactly.

581
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,320
But what is his motive?

582
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,960
At the time,
only Fu Miao had disappeared.

583
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,760
So you're saying

584
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,520
Li Ye isn't the killer

585
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,600
but it was

586
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,800
Zhao Qiang's doing?

587
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,520
It's possible.

588
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,640
But

589
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,560
I'm more curious

590
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,560
about how he came up with this idea

591
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,000
and pulled it off.

592
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,040
Who cares how he did it?

593
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,760
Just catch the killer will do!

594
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,040
You wouldn't understand.

595
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,360
Why wouldn't I understand?

596
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,840
Xuanxuan.

00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:52,920
Zijie.

598
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,340
I just want to check on her.

599
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,880
Be rational.

600
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,000
Where are you going?

601
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,680
It's already dark outside.

602
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,820
How about going back inside?

603
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,100
I want to be alone.

604
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,040

We're about to leave

643

accuse me

and sentence you.

00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,500
Li Ye is not the killer.

Li Ye,

659
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,880
tell them now.

660
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:53,760
Sir,

661
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,760
Qin told me

662
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,120
the one who bullied her

663
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
was my classmate.

664
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,920
I've always thought it was Fu.

665
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,120
But I didn't expect it

666
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,320
to be Zhao.

667
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,080
That day,

668
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,440
it was Zhao

669
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,920
who helped me escape.

670
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,520
Zhao.

671
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,520
Li.

672
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,920
What are you doing here?

673
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
I trust

674
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
your character.

675
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,460
But that useless official bragged
in front of the Imperial Envoy

676
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,300
that he would solve the case
in five days.

677
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,800
Now that time's running out,

678
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,160
he might pin the blame on you

679
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,340
to save himself.

680
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,880

681
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,640
what

682
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,480
do I do now?

683
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,920
The only option

684
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,280
is to run for it.

685
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,320
All right.

686
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,680

Li,

688
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,080
you should leave here for now.

with the prefect.

690
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,480
When I go back home,

691
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,880
I'll have my father send a letter

692
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,480
to clear your name.

693
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:56,960
All right.

694
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,800
Leave now.

695
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,920
Zhao,

696
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,240
I'll never forget

697
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,520
this kindness.

698
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,080
Say no more.

699
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,640
Leave now.

700
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,340
All right.

701
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,020
It's too late for that.

702
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,120
Hurry.

703
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,640
All right.

704
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,560
Sir,

705
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,640
Li Ye is telling the truth.

706
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,160
He and I have a past.

707
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,600
He thought

708
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,480
Fu Miao violated me

709
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,240
so he tried to poison him with arsenic.

710
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,480
But in the end,

711
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,040
it turned out to be Zhao Qiang.

712
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,160
Even so,

713
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,880
that is just

714
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,200
your side of the story.

715
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,360
Unless we figure out
Zhao Qiang's tricks,

716
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,160
we can't get solid evidence.

717
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,640
The trial is tomorrow.

718
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,040
Let's see what happens.

719
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,460
What are you thinking about?

720
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,600
I have one too.

721
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,320
I have more or less figured it out.

722
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,280
There's only one more thing to do.

723
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,680
Let's go.

724
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,440

Never mind.

734
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,840
I get it.

735
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,040

Li Ye is the killer?

744
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,960
Why are you arresting me?

745

Zhao Qiang,

746
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,400
how dare you lie?

747
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,560
Zhao Qiang,
you killed your classmate, Fu Miao,

748
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,410
while pretending
it was the work of Fox Spirit.

749
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520
Are you still denying it

750
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,540
when it has escalated to this point?

751
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,520
On your knees!

752
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,440
Sir,

753
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,800
what do you mean by this?

754
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,480
The day Fu disappeared,

755
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,560
I was in town buying ink and brush.

756
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,760
How could I have killed him
when I was over ten li away?

757
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,020
Buying ink and brush, huh?

758
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,640
Fine.

759
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,320
Summon Li Ye.

760
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,360
Summon

761
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,920
witness, Li Ye to the court!

762
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,000
Sir.

763
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,680
Li,

764
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,600
perfect timing.

765
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
Tell the magistrate

766
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,540
that I was in town buying ink and brush

767
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,500
the day Fu went missing.

768
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:43,870
You...

769
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,040
You murderer!

770
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,720
You got me into this mess

771
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,420
and now you want me to be your alibi?

772
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,000
I, Li Ye,

773
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,900
at your service, sir.

774
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,720
I want you to answer truthfully

775
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,440
the questions I'm going to ask.

776
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,000
I swear

777
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,520
to tell you everything I know.

778
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,400
Bring the evidence forward!

779
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,080
Li Ye, look at this.

780
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,040
Is this the set of ink and brush

781
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,920
Zhao Qiang bought that day?

782
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:10,840
Yes.

783
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,160
Sir,

784
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,000
I'm certain this is the one.

785
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,120
Zhao Qiang,

786
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,440
come and take a look.

787
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,200
Is this what you bought?

788
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,520
Sir,

789
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,080
this is exactly what I bought.

790
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,640
This proves

791
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,800
I wasn't

792
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,120
in Zhao Village that day.

793
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,880
So, are you admitting you're a fool?

794
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,560
Why do you say that?

795
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,440
That's right.

796
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,000
Magistrate Guo,

797
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,440
why did you say that?

798
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,360
Are you messing with me

799
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,720
just to solve the case?

800
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,040
Sir, calm down.

801
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,520
Summon Mr. Qian Mai

802
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,760
to the court.

803
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,320
Master,

804
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,960
they've caught the killer.

805
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,840
It's Zhao Qiang.

806
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,440
Young Master Zijie
is still questioning him.

807
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,440
I've heard good things

808
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,080
about this Zhao kid.

809
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,360
Could Zijie

810
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,760
have made a mistake?

811
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,960
It shouldn't be.

812
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,480
This won't do.

813
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,880
I don't feel easy about this.

814
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,000
I need to go and take a look.

815
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,960
Master.

816
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,360
Master,

817
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,200
why don't you rest?

818
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,960
It's a huge case.

819
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,760
Young Master Zijie will know

820
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,640
what to do.

821
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,000
Go

822
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,480
and bring Zilu here now.

823
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,920
Yes, Master.

824
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,360
I, Qian Mai,

825
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,000
greet Magistrate Guo.

826
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,040
Qian Mai,

827
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,960
this ink and brush set

828
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,760
has your shop's label.

829
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,000
Take a look

830
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,720
and see if Zhao Qiang bought this

831
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,640
from your store

832
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,000
on the eighth of this month.

833
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,040
Yes, sir.

834
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,120
This is indeed from my shop.

835
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,440
Mr. Zhao did come

836
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,080
to my store this month

837
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,140
to buy ink and brushes.

838
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,120
But

839
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,720
it was on the seventh, not the eighth.

840
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,280
You're lying!

841
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,720
Sir,

842
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,200
don't believe what he said.

843
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,320
But I clearly bought it

844
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,800
on the eighth!

845
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,720
Sir,

846
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,160
I dare not lie.

847
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,960
I clearly remember

848
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,920
this type of brush was sold out
on the eighth.

849
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,720
And Mr. Zhao bought

850
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,800
the last brush on the seventh.

851
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,240
Zhao Qiang.

852
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,680
So, where were you

853
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,200
on the eighth?

854
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,160
Sir,

855
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,880
maybe

856
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,840
I've mistaken the day.

857
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,480
But

858
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,160
this doesn't prove

859
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,200
that I killed Fu.

860
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:52,920
Ah, yes.

861
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,320
It's clearly the work of the demon fox.

862
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,400
That day, I was captured
by the demon fox!

863
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,120
Cao Xuanxuan.

864
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,480
Present.

865
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,140
There's no such thing
as a demon fox causing trouble

866
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,300
or disappearing into thin air.

867
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,640
It's all just magic tricks.

868
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,440
What magic?

869
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,520
A trick

870
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,700
that misleads people.

871
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,320
That day, Zhao Qiang pretended

872
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,080
to go and buy ink and brushes

873
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,720
but snuck into his house instead.

874
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,880
I'm only worried about you.

875
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I told you

876
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,180
messing with the Fox Spirit
will bring big trouble.

877
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,880
What's wrong with me eating
some fox meat?

878
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,040
If I want to eat it, I will!

879
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,100
It doesn't concern you.

880
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,260
Fine, then I won't bother.

881
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,040
Just leave.

882
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,600
Zhao,

883
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,600
Zhao, you're back.

884
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,080
Fu,

885
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,240
come with me quickly.

886
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,380
I have something urgent.

887
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:46,960
All right.

888
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,800
Zhao.

889
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,680
Zhao.

890
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,740
Why are you bringing me out here
in the middle of the night?

891
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,080
Fu,

892
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,040
this isn't the place to talk.

893
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,760
Let's go somewhere quieter.

894
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,280
Miao.

895
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,800
Miao!

896
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:01,920
Sir,

897
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,240
this is how

898
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,640
the disappearance happened.

899
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,300
I didn't know such a thing was possible.

900
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,960
I've never heard of such a thing.

901
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,680
Sir,

902
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,880
she's making it all up!

903
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,200
She doesn't have proof.

904
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,560
It means nothing!

905
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,440
The proof

906
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,160
is the missing house itself.
