Is it possible...

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,040
That there could be two...

24

Two identical people.

25
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,680
It's possible.

26
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Impressive.

27
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,860
That's how it's done.

I have no idea how to.

31
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,320
I can't do this.

32
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,880
- Can you do it?
- No.

33
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
This is amazing!

34
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,520
How is he so good at this?

35
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,200
It's done.

36
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,120
Great!

37
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,440
Make way.

38
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,920
What's your name?

39
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,320
I am Sun Weiyan.

40
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,600
Tell me.

41
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,760
How did you solve it?

42
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,720
What's so hard about it?

43
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,920
It's just

44
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,940
a toy similar to
children's building blocks.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,080
When I was young,

46
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,240
I was skilled with such toys.

47
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,000
For example, the Kongming Lock,

48
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,080
the Nine Linked Rings,

49
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,200
and other similar puzzles.

50
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:33,920
How?

51
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,320
What do you mean?

52
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
The private secretary.

53
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,980
Not impressed.

54
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,720
Why not?

55
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,000
Why are you dissatisfied with me,
Magistrate Guo?

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,400
Look at him, he's so dashing.

57
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,420
He doesn't look like a proper person.

58
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,080
Besides,

59
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,840
even if he's good
at those silly puzzles,

60
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,680
he's not qualified
to be my private secretary.

61
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,360
In the Biography
of Confucius' Disciples,

62
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,260
"Judging by appearance
overlooks true talent."

63
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:58,960
Magistrate Guo,

64
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,800
you must not do this.

65
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,280
You're just jealous
he's more handsome than you.

66
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,000
Step aside.

67
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,160
Are you

68
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,800
saying he's

69
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,600
more handsome than me?

70
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,160
You.

71
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,000
Leave here.

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,680
It's hard to find a true kindred spirit.

73
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,700
Since that's the case,

74
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,740
I shall take my leave.

75
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,200
Wait a moment.

76
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,020
Strict gender barrier
must not be crossed.

77
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,960
Miss, behave yourself.

78
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,440
He doesn't
even appreciate your kindness.

79
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,680
Why are you keeping him?

80
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,360
He can solve a puzzle cube.

81
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,040
Can you?

82
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,340
One day of the five has gone by.

83
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,800
Tomorrow, we'll go to Zhao Village.

84
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,300
Besides him,

85
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,740
do you have any other candidates?

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,440
Becoming my private secretary

87
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,440
isn't entirely out of the question.

88
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,160
But I have to test you.

89
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,680
My private secretary

90
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,740
must possess profound knowledge
of both astronomy and geography,

91
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,560
which is beyond the reach
of ordinary people.

92
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,720
However,

93
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,760
I won't make it hard for you.

94
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,640
I'll ask you something simple.

95
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,400
Tell me, how many

96
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,200
men and women

97
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
are there in Yan City?

98
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,600
Guo Zijie,

99
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,920
you're running
a census just to mess with him!

100
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,360
You can't answer, can you?

101
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,360
If you can't, then get lost.

102
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,120
Don't waste my time.

103
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,000
Yan City oversees five towns

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,100
and twenty-three villages.

105
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,240
Men are counted as "ding".

106
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,480
Women are counted as "kou".

107
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,600
Each "ding" pays 20 coins annually
in taxes.

108
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,520
Each "kou" contributes 2 bolts
of cloth yearly.

109
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,500
Household registration records
may be incomplete.

110
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,930
But the imperial court collects taxes

111
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,880
without exception.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,600
Last year, taxes from "ding" amounted

113
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,440
to 1.8 million coins.

114
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,400
Taxes from "kou" totaled

115
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,320
220,000 bolts of cloth.

116
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,680
This corresponds to 90,000 men

117
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,920
and 110,000 women.

118
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,720
Nonsense.

119
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,960
You've got some skills,

120
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,840
but I still need to test you again.

121
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,520
Just tell me,

122
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,320
how many cases

123
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,820
were reported in Yan City last year?

124
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,480
I don't know.

125
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,720
Guo Zijie, enough!

126
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,020
Human lives are at stake.

127
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,520
Who has time to mess around with you?

128
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,860
If you don't want to use him,

129
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,520
let Imperial Envoy
punish you instead!

130
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:35,920
Xuanxuan.

131
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,640
Fine, I'll use him, okay?

132
00:06:37,901 --> 00:06:40,620
(The Greatest Detective of Yan City)

133
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,220
Young Master Sun,

134
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,400
please try this.

135
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,320
It's this spring's
pre-rain Longjing tea.

136
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,360
Our young master
only managed to get this much,

137
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,620
and he's kept it all for you.

138
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,400
Good tea.

139
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,040
Off you go.

140
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,120
You...

141
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,200
Where did you get this thing?

142
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,760
I tinkered with it for ages

143
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,600
before I solved it.

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,040
That thing

145
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,480
is called

146
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,240
a Rubik's Cube.

147
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,320
A Rubik's Cube?

148
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
I've never heard of it.

149
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,080
But how did you remember it?

150
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,560
I saw her demonstrate it once.

151
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,320
Just once?

152
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,420
No wonder people say you're smart.

153
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,900
If it weren't for your fear
of your elder brother,

154
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,520
you could have
earned an official title.

155
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,980
Why stay in this rundown Yan City

156
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,400
as a lowly official?

157
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,240
Zijie.

158
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,840
Zijie.

159
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
Ying?

160
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,320
Zijie.

161
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
Zijie,

162
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,800
try the pastries I just made.

163
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,240
Who are you?

164
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,040
I am Sun Weiyan,

165
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,240
the new private secretary
hired by Magistrate Guo.

166
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,680
Where's Zijie?

167
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,200
Magistrate Guo

168
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,520
went out for an inspection.

169
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,680
He ordered me

170
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,780
to organize the files here.

171
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,480
Really?

172
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,800
Miss,

173
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,840
you don't believe my words?

174
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,600
When Zijie comes back,

175
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,440
make sure to let him try

176
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,240
the pastries I made.

177
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,760
I put a lot of effort into them.

178
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:15,960
She's gone.

179
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,480
Come out.

180
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,040
That scared me.

181
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,040
Zijie,

182
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,920
is she the match Old Master Guo
arranged for you

183
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,120
after Cao Xuanxuan fell unconscious?

184
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
My father is getting old,

185
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,000
and having no heir is a grave matter,

186
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,680
so I agreed.

187
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,360
But recently, Xuanxuan woke up.

188
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,480
However, after she woke up,

189
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,460
her personality changed drastically,

190
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,000
and she's been messing
with all these strange little gadgets.

191
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,400
I'm wondering,

192
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,920
what if she was sent
by my elder brother?

193
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,280
That would be the end of me.

194
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,520
This Cao Xuanxuan saved your life,

195
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,440
so keeping her in the house is fine.

196
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,720
However,

197
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,680
given the current situation,

198
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,440
my greatest concern is

199
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,600
that your gratitude

200
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,870
might make you reluctant to act.

201
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,600
Zijie,

202
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,720
as an official,

203
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,020
you must never
let compassion cloud your judgment.

204
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,480
I'll test her again.

205
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,720
I still don't trust her.

206
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,240
Leave this to me.

207
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,720
There's no need

208
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,580
for formalities between us.

209
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,880
Young Master Zilu,

210
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,600
I worked really hard

211
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,040
to get this for you.

212
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,200
What kind of useless thing is this?

213
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,840
I can't figure it out at all.

214
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,440
Young Master Zilu,

215
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,200
they recruited a private secretary

216
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
using this method.

217
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,320
They even hired a private secretary?

218
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,640
It's clear that they've been

219
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,200
steadily growing stronger.

220
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,400
Young Master Zilu,

221
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,120
what should we do now?

222
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,880
Understood, Young Master Zilu.

223
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,520
Grandpa,

224
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,560
try this.

225
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,480
I just learned it.

226
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,200
Good.

227
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,720
Who's there?

228
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,160
Mr. He,

229
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,660
Magistrate Guo requests your presence.

230
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,500
Magistrate Guo?

231
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,880
All right.

232
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,480
Please wait at the entrance.

233
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,320
All right.

234
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,160
Chun,

235
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,080
bring me my case.

236
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,640
Go.

237
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Grandpa,

238
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,360
can't you go after eating?

239
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,880
If Magistrate Guo is calling me,
it must be urgent.

240
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,560
I'll be back shortly.

241
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,080
Grandpa,

242
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,160
why must you help that corrupt official?

243
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,240
Chun,

244
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,080
you're still young.

245
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,800
There are things

246
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,900
you don't understand.

247
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,880
Magistrate Guo

248
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,640
is not a bad person.

249
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,880
Wait.

250
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,720
I'll go for you.

251
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,520
You?

252
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,640
Aren't you...

253
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,680
Grandpa,

254
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,960
your health isn't good.

255
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,800
Don't worry,

256
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,680
I can handle it.

257
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,840
Take care of yourself.

258
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
Help!

259
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Kidnapping!

260
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,240
Help!

261
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,040
What's going on?

262
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,760
Something's off.

263
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,000
How could this happen?

264
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,440
Let go!

265
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,560
Xuanxuan.

266
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,080
He Chun?

267
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,120
Wait, Heroine!

268
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Young Master Zilu.

269
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,320
Young Master Zilu.

270
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,600
What is it?

271
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,760
Why are you not sleeping
in the middle of the night?

272
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,680
What's the matter?

273
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,640
Speak.

274
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,000
The mission failed again.

275
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,640
Useless fool!

276
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,880
You can't even handle a simple task.

277
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,280
Young Master Zilu,

278
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,240
we followed your instructions exactly.

279
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,340
We planned to abduct Cao Xuanxuan,

280
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,320
keep her locked up for five days,
and release her.

281
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,300
Who knew...

282
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,280
a group of people would appear halfway,

283
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,720
and then a heroine would show up

284
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,680
out of nowhere.

285
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,840
Who were they?

286
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,640
I...

287
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,280
No...

288
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,160
It wasn't me.

289
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,520
Then who was the heroine?

290
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,680
I don't know.

291
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,120
Good for you, Guo Zijie.

292
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,800
You've got another helper now.

293
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
What should we do?

294
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:26,880
You...

295
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,360
You can keep sleeping.

296
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,580
You can keep sleeping.

297
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,240
Get lost.

298
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:31,880
All right.

299
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,280
I'll leave.

300
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,360
Xuanxuan,

301
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,040
have a seat.

302
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,060
Just sit down.

303
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,200
Who were those people just now?

304
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,920
Did you offend someone?

305
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,400
What nonsense are you saying?

306
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,140
How would I know

307
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,020
who they are?

308
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,180
They even tried to kill me.

309
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,880
Yes.

310
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
When Magistrate Guo

311
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,960
was solving cases before,

312
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,960
he had enemies...

313
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,140
They are here to seek revenge.

314
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:03,480
Yes.

315
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,840
Actually, this is quite common.

316
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,040
Yes.

317
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,320
Well...

318
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,260
You corrupt official.

319
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,320
There must be many people
seeking revenge on you.

320
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,440
Who are you calling a corrupt official?

321
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:10,760
You.

322
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,960
Stop arguing.

323
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,880
Luckily, this heroine saved us today.

324
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,320
Miss,

325
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,400
where did you learn

326
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,780
such powerful martial arts?

327
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,480
Yes, indeed.

328
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,920
Your martial arts are so impressive.

329
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,880
You took down
those people in just a few moves.

330
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,000
Why are you here then?

331
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,080
To solve a case.

332
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,800
I came to take my grandpa's place.

333
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
That's fantastic!

334
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,680
With the heroine here,

335
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,000
I feel so much more at ease.

336
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,680
She's a coroner,

337
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,840
not a bodyguard.

338
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,680
Once we solve this case,

339
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,800
we'll go after those men in black.

340
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:41,880
Then...

341
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,400
We welcome you to join us.

342
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,720
Welcome.

343
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,320
Sir,

344
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,520
you've finally arrived.

345
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
It's because someone is dawdling.

346
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,520
Sir,

347
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,120
it's already late.

348
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,880
Why not rest here for the night

349
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,020
and continue tomorrow?

350
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,600
How far is it to Zhao Village from here?

351
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,320
Not far,

352
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,360
but this is a desolate wilderness,

353
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,840
full of wild beasts and predators.

354
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,680
It wouldn't be safe to travel at night.

355
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,680
All right,

356
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,200
let's make do for the night.

357
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,600
Dear guests,

358
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,160
this is a remote area.

359
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,760
We rarely have visitors.

360
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,400
The inn doesn't have many rooms.

361
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,440
With seven of you,

362
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,060
I'm afraid there won't be enough space.

363
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,720
We'll share a room.

364
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,840
I won't share a room with him.

365
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,200
Please, give me respect in public.

366
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,580
Then you sleep on the floor.

367
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,560
The floor is fine.

368
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,480
Even then, it's still not enough.

369
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,320
Our inn does have a storage room.

370
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,440
It's just over there.

371
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,000
However,

372
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,000
one of you will have to make do with it.

373
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,960
The storage room?

374
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,440
Why are you all looking at me?

375
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,360
I... I'm not going.

376
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,480
I'm known for being timid.

377
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,600
Besides,

378
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,520
I keep feeling like

379
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,400
something's following us
on this journey.

380
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,520
Li,

381
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
you're a grown man.

382
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,320
Why are you being so paranoid?

383
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,120
Right?

384
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,600
You felt it too, didn't you?

385
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,880
I even...

386
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,120
I think I heard

387
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,240
a fox crying.

388
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Wait, you too?

389
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,000
Is it that room?

390
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,600
Yes.

391
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,120
We need to leave early tomorrow,

392
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,600
so everyone should rest early.

393
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,440
Guests,

394
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,320
the other rooms
are still being tidied up.

395
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,000
Please wait a moment.

396
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,520
Oh my.

397
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,840
Dear guests,

398
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
your room is ready now.

399
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,000
Please rest.

400
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,880
What are you doing?

401
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,160
Stop!

402
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,280
Go ahead and sleep.

403
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,320
Listen,

404
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,640
we've already agreed.

405
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,800
You stay there,

406
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,120
you can't come up,

407
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,180
and you're not allowed to peek at night.

408
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,760
Who would peek at you?

409
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:12,960
Here.

410
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,560
You're actually considerate.

411
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,160
You know,

412
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,000
Zhao Qiang is actually quite loyal.

413
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,000
He's also a scholar,

414
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,000
but unlike Li Ye, he's not so frail.

415
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,560
What do you think?

416
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,800
Guo Zijie.

417
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,560
Guo Zijie.

418
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,520
Where could he have hidden that book?

419
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,500
(The Detective Magistrate
of Yan City, Guo Zijie)

420
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,400
(Why is there nothing written?)

421
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,960
(This isn't right.)

422
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,160
(It's different
from what I read before.)

423
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,760
Guo Zijie.

424
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,640
Guo Zijie.

425
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,120
Wake up.

426
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,440
What now?

427
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
I'm trying to sleep.

428
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,680
Look at this book.

429
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,720
Why did you stop writing?

430
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,840
Come on,

431
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,160
let's keep writing.

432
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,760
Write what?

433
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,600
Come on.

434
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,880
Stop sleeping.

435
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,600
Write it now.

436
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,160
Here.

437
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,080
Write what?

438
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,020
Do you even understand
what a case journal is?

439
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,160
Nothing has occurred so far.

440
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,440
No, you...

441
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
What's that sound?

442
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,240
What's the shouting about

443
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,200
at this time of night?

444
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,340
Why aren't they sleeping?

445
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,240
Let's go check it out.

446
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,280
Check what?

447
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,280
It's late. Let's sleep.

448
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,200
Hurry up!

449
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,080
What's there to see?

450
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,960
What's going on?

451
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,280
Sir.

452
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,440
Look at this.

453
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,760
Where's the building?

454
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,640
Where's Zhao Qiang?

455
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,920
A fox spirit...

456
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,640
It's a fox spirit.

457
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,300
The fox spirit is going to eat someone!

458
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,460
Zhao!

459
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
Zhao!

460
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,720
It's one thing
for the fox spirit to eat people,

461
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,720
but did it eat a building too?

462
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,880
This is the first time
in my life I've seen

463
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,760
a building mysteriously disappear.

464
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,520
This can't be.

465
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,600
How could this happen?

466
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,280
It's a fox spirit.

467
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,760
It must be a fox spirit.

468
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,640
Nonsense.

469
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,520
No ghost or fox spirit magic exists.

470
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,600
But my husband
disappeared into thin air,

471
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,400
and now this building...

472
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,880
If it wasn't the work of a fox spirit,

473
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,800
how could a mere mortal have such power?

474
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,800
I've heard that the house
in the wilderness

475
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,960
could possibly be transformed
by ghosts or monsters,

476
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,160
and mortals are not allowed to enter.

477
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,200
Otherwise...

478
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,280
We must leave quickly,

479
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,440
or else the fox spirit will eat us all!

480
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,720
Zhao Xiaolin!

481
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,800
The fox spirit ate people!

482
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,320
Wait a moment!

483
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,040
What should we do now?

484
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,200
You two, go take a look.

485
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,000
And you?

486
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,040
We'll check the scene.

487
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,680
Go on.

488
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,880
We'll head out.

489
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,720
Have you found anything?

490
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,960
How could a building just disappear?

491
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,160
Could it have been

492
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,200
demolished?

493
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,120
Even so,
there should still be a foundation.

494
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,240
I need to go back to the inn and check.

495
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,120
Xuanxuan, wait for me!

496
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,000
The fox spirit ate people!

497
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,360
The fox spirit ate people!

498
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:39,880
Xiaolin!

499
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,840
Xiaolin, where are you going?

500
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,400
It's a fox spirit.

501
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,800
It must be a fox spirit.

502
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,200
Fox Spirit Lord.

503
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,040
I'm sorry, Fox Spirit Lord.

504
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:56,960
Fox Spirit Lord,

505
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,360
please don't come after me again!

506
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,640
Xiaolin.

507
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,280
Fox Spirit Lord.

508
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
Fox Spirit Lord.

509
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,920
Xiaolin, what are you doing?

510
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,360
You...

511
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:04,680
Quickly.

512
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,920
Let's all apologize
to Fox Spirit Lord!

513
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,180
I'm sorry, Fox Spirit Lord.

514
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,320
I'm sorry, Fox Spirit Lord.

515
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,760
Wait.

516
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:41,960
All right,

517
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,840
the door's closed.

518
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,440
Let go.

519
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,240
Xuanxuan...

520
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,400
The door... The door opened.

521
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,920
I'll go close it.

522
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:19,920
Boring.

523
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,760
I'm not scared.

524
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,280
Why so timid?

525
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,040
Are you going to tremble all night?

526
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,440
I'm just worried you're scared.

527
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,720
Don't be afraid.

528
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,520
It's okay.

529
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,760
I'm here.

530
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,160
Don't be afraid.

531
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,200
It's okay.

532
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,080
There's definitely no such thing
as a fox spirit.

533
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,640
We're scholars.

534
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,840
No...

535
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,200
There's no fox spirit.

536
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,360
I just feel like

537
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,040
this place is really strange.

538
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
These people aren't quite normal.

539
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,100
The people of Zhao Village
really believe in the fox spirit.

540
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,160
Superstitions and nonsense.

541
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,600
So what do we do now?

542
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,360
We keep watching.

543
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,200
What are you doing?

544
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:14,840
You...

545
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,760
What are you doing?

546
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
What are you two doing?

547
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:20,960
I...

548
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,560
Nothing.

549
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,240
- Keep a watch.
- Keep a watch.

550
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
Keep a watch?

551
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,320
Watch what?

552
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,960
Where are they?

553
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,720
What time is it?

554
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,040
Maybe… They went back?

555
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
What about you two?

556
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,040
Weren't you at the inn last night?

557
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,440
That fox spirit

558
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,680
didn't come for you?

559
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,320
I don't believe in those things.

560
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,480
Yeah.

561
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,440
Me... Me neither.

562
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,360
But I wonder

563
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,520
who was cowering

564
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,040
in the inn yesterday.

565
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,840
Is this Zhao Xiaolin's house?

566
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,320
Yes.

567
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,960
So this is the crime scene.

568
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,640
Let's go.

569
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,620
We should take a look.

570
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,280
Yes, let's go.

571
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,840
On the day of the crime,

572
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,620
there were only
four people in the house.

573
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,280
After Zhao Qiang
and Fu Miao disappeared,

574
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,120
only Li Ye and Zhao Xiaolin were left.

575
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,000
So you're saying

576
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,160
the culprit is one of them?

577
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,140
It's just a speculation.

578
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,160
Xuanxuan,

579
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,520
what do you think?

580
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,040
I think we should first investigate

581
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,240
Fu Miao's social connections.

582
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,800
Social connections?

583
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,920
In other words,

584
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,440
bring in all the people
who frequently interacted with Fu Miao

585
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,740
and interrogate them one by one.

586
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,560
But there's no courtroom here.

587
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,940
How do we question them?

588
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,140
An interrogation room.

589
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,360
Interrogation room?

590
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,160
What room?

591
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,920
All right.

592
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,680
What is this contraption

593
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,160
good for?

594
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,040
Interrogations.

595
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,320
Studies show

596
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,760
that people tend to feel drowsy
in dim environments.

597
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,120
The purpose of bright lights

598
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,080
is to keep the suspect awake.

599
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,880
Prolonged exposure to strong light

600
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,560
can make people irritable,

601
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,020
which helps encourage suspects

602
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,840
to confess.

603
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,560
This is unheard of.

604
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,080
All right,
let's begin the interrogation.

605
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,040
Bring the first person in.

606
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,320
Let's go.

607
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,120
Greetings, Magistrate Guo.

608
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,280
No need to bow. Please sit.

609
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,200
I couldn't possibly.

610
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,000
Elder,

611
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
there's no need to be nervous.

612
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,860
We just have a few questions for you.

613
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,660
Answer truthfully,
and you'll be free to go.

614
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,740
Please, have a seat.

615
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,200
I heard that on the morning
after Fu Miao disappeared,

616
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,680
you set fire on the mountain.

617
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,120
Sir,

618
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,300
setting fire on the mountain

619
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,840
would bring divine punishment.

620
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,800
I...

621
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,160
I wouldn't dare start a fire.

622
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,680
The one who set the fire was...

623
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,960
It was the fox spirit!

624
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,520
What makes you say that?

625
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,720
Sir, you don't know.

626
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,800
When the villagers put out the fire,

627
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,840
they found in the ashes

628
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,920
a...

629
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,840
A headscarf.

630
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,940
What kind of headscarf?

631
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,800
The kind scholars wear.

632
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,280
I heard the scholars call it

633
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,440
a scholar's cap.

634
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,480
A scholar's cap?

635
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,200
What does this scholar's cap look like?

636
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,320
What else could it look like?

637
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,480
It's what scholars wear.

638
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,440
My husband...

639
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,600
In our village,

640
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,240
there are plenty of men to marry.

641
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,640
Why did you insist on taking in

642
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,800
a scholar from another place?

643
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,680
He...

644
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,120
He ate the offspring
of the Fox Spirit Empress.

645
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,420
The Fox Spirit Empress

646
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,220
dragged him
into the mountains and burned him

647
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,400
as a sacrifice for her cubs.

648
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,520
If this matter

649
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
ends here, so be it.

650
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,520
But if

651
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,880
it implicates our village,

652
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,040
it will be your fault!

653
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:32,680
Enough.

654
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,620
You're done here.

655
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,280
Leave.

656
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,640
It's all because of you!

657
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,720
This is your fault!

658
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,120
It's all because of you!

659
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,600
It's because of you!

660
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,920
It's your fault!

661
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,080
It's all your doing!

662
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,840
Silence!

663
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,560
The magistrate is here.

664
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,680
No disorderly conduct.

665
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,240
This thing of yours is too strange.

666
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,500
Look how agitated he is.

667
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,320
Everyone, listen to me.

668
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,560
I'm certain there's no
such thing as a fox spirit.

669
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,760
Everything that's happened
is the work of humans.

670
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,640
You can't say things
like that recklessly!

671
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,320
The gods are watching from above.

672
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,760
Don't let the fox spirit hear you.

673
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
What's she afraid of?

674
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,540
If Fox Spirit Empress gets angry,

675
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,920
it's us villagers who will suffer.

676
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,600
Right?

677
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,320
Grab her!

678
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,080
Yes!

679
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,420
We'll be the ones who pay for it!

680
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,520
Yes! Don't let her escape.

681
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,480
She can't leave!

682
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,040
Right!

683
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,440
Tie her up!

684
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,520
Don't let her leave!

685
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,640
Enough!

686
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,640
I'm here to get to the bottom of this.

687
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,840
I'll give you all a proper explanation.

688
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,760
Sir!

689
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,840
Sir!

690
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,280
We've found Fu Miao's body.

691
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,280
You've found it?

692
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,280
Let's go take a look.

693
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,420
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

694
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,560
Excuse me.

695
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,200
Dear!

696
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,040
Dear!

697
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,080
Dear!

698
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,120
He Chun!

699
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,360
Dear!

700
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,040
Xiaolin,

701
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,520
don't be too upset.

702
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,080
Let them examine what happened first.

703
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,240
The body is already bloated and decayed.

704
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,080
There's noticeable swelling

705
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,520
in the throat and wrists,

706
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,920
more than in the other areas.

707
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,320
The time of death

708
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,520
should have been about four days ago.

709
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,680
After the murder,

710
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,520
the killer should have
set the body on fire,

711
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,760
not drowned it in the pond.
