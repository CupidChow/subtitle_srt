It looks delicious.

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,080
Try it.

28
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,720
Oh, Mr. Zhao.

29
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,100
sorry for not greeting you.

30
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,640
Forgive me.

31
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,440
Have a seat.

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,360
What brings you here?

33
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,160
Magistrate Guo?

34
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,000
Do you know each other?

35
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,040
Greetings, sir.

36
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,240
Are you at Mr. Lyu's residence
for the banquet as well?

37
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,760
Yes.

38
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,480
Bufan is my close friend for many years.

39
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,400
I simply had to come.

40
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,400
Yes, indeed.

41
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,360
Come on.

42
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,640
Everyone, let's enjoy the meal.

43
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,180
Eat before the food gets cold.

44
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,160
It's delicious.

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,680
Master!

46
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:43,880
Master.

47
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,080
What's the matter?

48
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,520
What is it?

49
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,440
No one saw Luo Ji all night.

50
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,180
He didn't respond even
when the servant knocked at his door.

51
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,920
That's right.

52
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,560
I went to look for him this morning.

53
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,680
But no one responded.

54
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
That can't be.

55
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,760
This won't do.

56
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,300
I need to go and check on him.

57
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,200
Excuse me,

58
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,280
everyone.

59
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,280
Let's go.

60
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,160
Let's follow him.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,120
How many times did you knock?

62
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,800
Several times.

63
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,800
But no one answered.

64
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,640
Zijie,

65
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,580
do you think something happened

66
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,400
because of us again?

67
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,120
Then...

68
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,320
Should we go check it out?

69
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,280
Let's go.

70
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,280
Let's check it out.

71
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,280
Sir, please enjoy your meal.

72
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,320
Hey, wait for me.

73
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,160
What's the matter?

74
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,960
Luo,

75
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,680
you died in such a tragic manner.

76
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,840
He's...

77
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,960
Was

78
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,200
the door locked just now?

79
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,520
How did you enter the room?

80
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,440
The door's latched from the inside.

81
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,960
I had to break in by force.

82
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,640
Just as I thought.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,420
It's another locked-room murder.

84
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,040
Locked-room?

85
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,760
The audacity

86
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,680
to commit murder in broad daylight.

87
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,040
(Another locked-room murder?)

88
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,120
(Is it the same person?)

89
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,440
Miss,

90
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,600
what are you doing?

91
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,600
Luo had a special relationship
with Lord Su.

92
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
This is a serious matter.

93
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,300
Imperial Envoy has plenty
of experience handling cases.

94
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,080
It's fine to leave

95
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,180
this case to him.

96
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,600
Yes.

97
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,320
Based on a coroner's technique,

98
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,120
it is possible to determine

99
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,000
the exact time of death accurately

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,360
by observing the condition
of the middle finger and the palm

101
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,800
at different hours.

102
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,200
Based on this technique

103
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,520
and the stiffness of Luo's corpse,

104
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,960
he was killed last night

105
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,360
during the Chou hour.

106
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,120
Someone.

107
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,380
You all stay here and guard the scene.

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,920
Once we have everything figured out,

109
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,120
we'll handle Luo's body

110
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,560
properly.

111
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,800
Yes, sir.

112
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,280
No one is allowed

113
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,680
to leave until the investigation
is complete.

114
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,120
Mr. Zhao, do you suspect

115
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,360
that the person who killed Luo

116
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,880
is one of us?

117
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,880
What a joke.

118
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,040
I'm working for the emperor.

119
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,400
If I am delayed from getting back,

120
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,000
can you take responsibility for it?

121
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,840
No use talking about that now.

122
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,640
Let's start

123
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,720
by checking everyone's alibis.

124
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,640
At the hour of Chou last night,

125
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,880
who were you with,

126
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,880
where were you at,

127
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,900
and who can confirm your whereabouts?

128
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,680
I was already asleep by midnight.

129
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,600
De can vouch for me.

130
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,520
Last night,

131
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,080
I felt stuffy indoors

132
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,560
and went out for a walk.

133
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,880
The night watchman can confirm it.

134
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,000
But Zheng,

135
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,200
you weren't in the room

136
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,880
when I returned.

137
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,440
I was with Mr. Zheng last night.

138
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,160
You young ones sure
have a lot of energy.

139
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,000
So, where were the rest

140
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,000
of you last night?

141
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,240
We were all together,

142
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,940
and we can vouch for each other.

143
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,320
Magistrate Guo and the others

144
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,480
were under my care last night.

145
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,640
I can vouch for them.

146
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,080
Mr. Zhao,

147
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
may I ask

148
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,640
where you were

149
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,040
last night?

150
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,280
Last night,

151
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,720
I couldn't hold my drinks.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,400
So I went out for some fresh air

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,200
without informing anyone.

154
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,720
In that case,

155
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,760
no one has seen you, Mr. Zhao?

156
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,780
That's right.

157
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,200
Sir.

158
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,560
Mr. Zhao,

159
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,760
may I ask

160
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,600
what is that on the corner
of your clothes?

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,480
Mr. Zhao,

162
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,280
what...

163
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,600
Why is there blood

164
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,220
on your clothes?

165
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,320
I see.

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,680
No wonder no one can vouch for you.

167
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,000
Looks like the pot calling
the kettle black.

168
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,700
I just remembered something.

169
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,840
You and Luo Ji

170
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,200
had some issues, right?

171
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,120
Eunuch Wang,

172
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,600
don't make

173
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,240
wild accusations

174
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,200
in public like this.

175
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,840
We only have

176
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
a difference of opinion.

177
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
But his death

178
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,120
has nothing to do with me.

179
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,920
We can't judge a person
just by their appearance.

180
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
You're the prime suspect now.

181
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't trust you

182
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,640
to solve this case.

183
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:49,960
All right.

184
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
To prove my innocence,

185
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,960
I am willing

186
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,720
to lock myself in a room

187
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,920
and stay there

188
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,360
until the case

189
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,720
is solved.

190
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,720
Then

191
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,420
we'll have to trouble you, Mr. Zhao.

192
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:04,840
All right.

193
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,640
Bufan,

194
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,480
once the case is fully investigated,

195
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,600
you can release me.

196
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,320
Magistrate Guo,

197
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,100
my family has been crafting iron tools
for the court for generations.

198
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,380
This lock is our family heirloom,
an unbreakable lock.

199
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,680
Everyone can rest assured.

200
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,960
But

201
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,720
Mr. Zhao is confining himself
in his room

202
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,640
to avoid suspicion.

203
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,260
Magistrate Guo,

204
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,880
as the Country Magistrate of Yan City,

205
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,740
it's your duty to investigate this case.

206
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,000
What do you think?

207
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,640
Magistrate Guo?

208
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,280
Given what's happened,

209
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,140
I am obligated to take responsibility.

210
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,360
However, I'll need your help

211
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,240
with one thing.

212
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,280
No one is allowed to leave

213
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,520
until the case is solved.

214
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,720
Magistrate Guo, rest assured.

215
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Without your permission,

216
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,440
no one can leave Lyu Residence.

217
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,880
I appreciate your cooperation.

218
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,540
It's my duty.

219
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,440
(Lyu Residence)

220
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,280
Come and take a look.

221
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,880
What is it?

222
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,390
I thought you were familiar with this.

223
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,580
See if there are any clues.

224
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,520
Since you're asking me,

225
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,640
I'll take a look.

226
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,040
Xuanxuan,

227
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,640
this room is completely enclosed.

228
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,320
How did the killer enter

229
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,960
and how did he leave

230
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,160
after killing Luo Ji?

231
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,080
What if the killer

232
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,640
never entered this room at all?

233
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,040
How?

234
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,720
I once read a novel

235
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,000
where

236
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,680
the killer used

237
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,720
a crane

238
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,720
to lift the victim's bed

239
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,760
through a skylight

240
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,360
while

241
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,600
they were sleeping.

242
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,360
The killer decapitated the victim first.

243
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Then he placed the bed

244
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,360
in its original place.

245
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,800
The killer

246
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,760
never even

247
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,440
entered the room.

248
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,360
I understand

249
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,520
what she said.

250
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,000
But what is a crane?

251
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,280
It is the rolling equipment
you use in this time.

252
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,200
I see what you're saying.

253
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,400
Are you saying

254
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,840
the killer first used some kind of tool

255
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,480
to shoot the candlestick like an arrow

256
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,360
and then used rolling equipment

257
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,960
to flip the body tied with a rope?

258
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:27,760
Clever.

259
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,680
That's how it happened.

260
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,240
But as it stands,

261
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,600
this room

262
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,560
doesn't have a skylight.

263
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,040
That's right.

264
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,440
Miss He Chun,

265
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,920
you're a skilled martial artist

266
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,040
and know leaping skills.

267
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,240
Can you go up and check?

268
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,280
Sure.

269
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,960
Be careful.

270
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,600
We'll watch from down here.

271
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,160
Be careful.

272
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,740
There's none, right?

273
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,160
Could there

274
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,480
be a hidden one?

275
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,160
Come on down.

276
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,720
We've checked.

277
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
There's no skylight.

278
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,720
There's none.

279
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,780
Come on. Let's go.

280
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,880
You, thug.

281
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,800
So there's no skylight.

282
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,640
He's only a child.

283
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,680
Why not let him go home?

284
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,280
The Young Master has ordered

285
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,800
that no one leave

286
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,080
until the case is solved.

287
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,280
He's so young.

288
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,640
There's no way he's the killer.

289
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,520
Just let him go.

290
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,440
If anything happens,

291
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,500
I'll take responsibility.

292
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,400
I still can't do that.

293
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,060
He is the only one herding sheep today.

294
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,480
The other one went home and won't

295
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,540
be back until tomorrow.

296
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,120
You're...

297
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,620
He Chun.

298
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:42,960
He Chun,

299
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,460
don't make it difficult for him.

300
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,520
You can leave now.

301
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,160
Yes.

302
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:46,800
All right.

303
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,800
Here you go.

304
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,160
What happened just now?

305
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,880
Dou earned some money by herding

306
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,160
sheep for the Lyu Residence.

307
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,800
We had mutton soup this morning.

308
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,960
The child is upset

309
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,260
and only wants to go home.

310
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,040
You seem to know quite a lot about this.

311
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,440
Is it because you already knew

312
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
this boy?

313
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,200
Miss He Chun stayed at an inn

314
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,160
near my grandpa's usual begging spot

315
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,520
for some time recently.

316
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,360
Miss He Chun is a kind person.

317
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,440
She not only buys meals

318
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,920
for my grandpa,

319
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,560
but she also helps him collect herbs.

320
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,560
The herbs she collected are pretty.

321
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,720
But the herbs can only be collected

322
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,040
when they bloom in the evening.

323
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,360
It's called...

324
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,440
What is it again?

325
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,400
It's...

326
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,880
It's called evening primrose.

327
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,480
Ah, yes.

328
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,080
It's called evening primrose.

329
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:35,880
All right.

330
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,680
I get it now.

331
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,440
Come.

332
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,280
Sit here and eat.

333
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,720
I need to talk to Miss He Chun
about something.

334
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,380
Come on.

335
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,040
Is Dou's grandpa

336
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,320
the man we met last time

337
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
who is non-verbal
and may be hard of hearing?

338
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,320
Yes, that's the one.

339
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,240
My grandpa has a leg condition.

340
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,120
So when I see him,

341
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,840
I am reminded of my grandpa.

342
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,640
I lost my jade pendant

343
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,980
when I was collecting herbs
near the Guo Residence.

344
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,880
He picked it up and returned it to me.

345
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,800
You must be very close

346
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
to your grandpa.

347
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,240
My parents died when I was young.

348
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,960
Grandpa is the one who raised me.

349
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
Grandpa

350
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,600
doesn't like me learning coroner work.

351
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But I have no other siblings.

352
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,040
He has no successor.

353
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,960
He may not say it.

354
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,400
But I know he's sad about it.

355
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,080
So I study the work in secret.

356
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,240
He doesn't like me
practicing martial arts.

357
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,720
But it's dangerous to work as a coroner.

358
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,960
He is often misunderstood

359
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,680
and hurt

360
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,440
by the victims' families.

361
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,960
I want to protect him.

362
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,280
Dou?

363
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,800
Why are you going through

364
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,300
Magistrate Guo's things in his room?

365
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,200
What's this?

366
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:08,880
Let's go.

367
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:10,840
Sir,

368
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,440
Dou was playing with something

369
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,240
in your room.

370
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,920
Is it something valuable?

371
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,720
What is that?

372
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,600
It's hard to open.

373
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,480
It's nothing.

374
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,240
It's just a...

375
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,800
Oh, a bangle.

376
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,680
Yes, it's a bangle.

377
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,520
It's a cheap trinket.

378
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,620
Why not let the kid have it?

379
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,560
If he likes it,

380
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,700
just give it to him.

381
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,640
Be careful with that.

382
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,240
Do you like it?

383
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,160
Yes.

384
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
You can't touch...

385
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,160
You're a county magistrate.

386
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,780
What's the big deal
about letting him play with it?

387
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,240
My bangle!

388
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,840
It hurts!

389
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,680
You're hurting me.

390
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,560
It's just a cheap bangle.

391
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,220
I'll take it off and return it to you.

392
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,160
Never mind. You can just wear it.

393
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,520
It's yours sooner or later.

394
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,040
Magistrate Guo,

395
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,480
I'm glad to see you here.

396
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,680
We've been searching for you.

397
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,360
Yes.

398
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,120
Magistrate Guo,

399
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,520
please tell us what you would do

400
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,320
about this case.

401
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,960
Actually, we are making some progress

402
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,120
with the case.

403
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,700
Come.

404
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,840
Let's talk this over drinks.

405
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,840
- Right.
- Come with us.

406
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,440
That bangle!

407
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:23,820
Come on.

408
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,860
I'll take it off for you.

409
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Don't lose that bangle.

410
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,920
Why is he so stingy?

411
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,180
He's a county magistrate,
for heaven's sake.

412
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,380
Why is he being cheap

413
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,680
over this inexpensive bangle?

414
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,560
My wrist turned red.

415
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,040
What's so special about this bangle?

416
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,980
There's a character on it.

417
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:46,960
What character?

418
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,600
Ping?

419
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,560
Ping?

420
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,760
I heard Mrs. Guo's maiden name

421
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,660
might have the character "Ping" in it.

422
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,440
This belongs to his mother?

423
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,760
This kind of bangle

424
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,360
is usually called a blessing bangle.

425
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,980
It's a custom for wealthy families
that when a son is born,

426
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,420
the mother would prepare one,

427
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,880
and it's usually passed down
to the future daughter-in-law.

428
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,790
That's why it's called
a family heirloom bangle.

429
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,240
Magistrate Guo seems

430
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,120
to value you.

431
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,320
I couldn't take it off earlier.

432
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,560
It's not like he gave it to me.

433
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,520
Who'd want it?

434
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,600
(This kind of bangle)

435
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,100
(is usually called a blessing bangle.)

436
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,760
(It's a custom for wealthy families
that when a son is born,)

437
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,320
(the mother would prepare one,)

438
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,840
(and it's usually passed down
to the future daughter-in-law.)

439
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,820
(That's why it's called
a family heirloom bangle.)

440
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,920
(Magistrate Guo seems)

441
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,000
(to value you.)

442
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,840
Stop thinking about it.

443
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,240
I must stop thinking about this.

444
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,800
Go to bed.

445
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,080
What am I thinking?

446
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,560
Stop it.

447
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,880
Zhou Na,

448
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,440
you're leaving.

449
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,040
Stop overthinking.

450
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,640
What does this have to do with me?

451
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,280
None.

452
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,320
Give it back to him.

453
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,520
Miss Xuanxuan.

454
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,000
Hey, there.

455
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,880
Dou,

456
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,840
slow down!

457
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,200
Xiaolin?

458
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,440
What are you doing here?

459
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,920
Dou always says there's an older sister

460
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,360
who takes special care of him.

461
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,000
He insisted on saying goodbye
before leaving.

462
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,680
I didn't expect it to be you.

463
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,100
That's such a coincidence.

464
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,160
Are you working here?

465
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,040
Come.

466
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,440
Go outside and play for a while.

467
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,680
See you, Miss Xuanxuan.

468
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,160
See you.

469
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,520
After my husband died,

470
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,040
I needed to make a living for myself.

471
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,400
By the way,

472
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,960
Miss Xuanxuan.

473
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,720
Did you come by yourself

474
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,760
or

475
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,440
with Magistrate Guo?

476
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,080
I came with Zijie.

477
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,040
How far

478
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,080
have you two gone?

479
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,840
What do you mean by how far?

480
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,600
We're not in a relationship.

481
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,960
I want to tell you something.

482
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,720
Xuanxuan!

483
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,240
Lyu Residence's breakfast is ready.

484
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,480
Why are you still in your room?

485
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,200
Zhao Xiaolin?

486
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,740
Greetings, Magistrate Guo.

487
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,760
Why are you here?

488
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,440
I still have some urgent matters.

489
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,360
So I'll leave first.

490
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,000
Xiaolin, take care.

491
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:15,680
All right.

492
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,480
What's wrong with her?

493
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,680
How would I know?

494
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,760
Let's have breakfast.

495
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,660
I've prepared your favorite
donkey meat buns.

496
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,720
I'm not going.

497
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,100
By the way,

498
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,280
take this back.

499
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,760
I didn't know

500
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,080
it was your mother's bangle.

501
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,300
Just wear it.

502
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,460
It's fine for you to wear it.

503
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,560
Let's have breakfast.

504
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,760
I am not done

505
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,600
dressing up.

506
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,440
You can go first.

507
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,000
I'll meet up with you later.

508
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,480
You go now.

509
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,280
Why is she acting weird
at this early hour?

510
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,280
Stop overthinking.

511
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,240
I have to go home eventually.

512
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,980
Stop thinking about it.

513
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,520
(Why is the bangle with her?)

514
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,400
(I must tell Young Lady about this.)

515
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
Young Lady!

516
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,760
Bad news.

517
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,620
What's the matter?

518
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,980
I saw Young Master Zijie give

519
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,480
that bangle to Cao Xuanxuan.

520
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,680
What bangle?

521
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,000
The bangle that Master gave

522
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,440
to Madam.

523
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,680
(What?)

524
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,480
(Why would he give the bangle to her?)

525
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,640
That bangle

526
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,840
was Madam's favorite bangle

527
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,040
when she was alive.

528
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,320
Young Master Zijie gave it

529
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,240
to Cao Xuanxuan.

530
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,160
Does that mean...

531
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,880
You can leave now.

532
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,560
Young Lady,

533
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,640
we need to plan ahead.

534
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,800
We cannot

535
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,720
let Cao Xuanxuan

536
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,960
take over your place.

537
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,240
I said, leave!

538
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,600
How ugly.

539
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,200
What are you doing here?

540
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,760
I came to make peace with you.

541
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,560
Make peace?

542
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,040
I've come around.

543
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,560
You're quite pitiful.

544
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,920
After I marry Zijie,

545
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,140
I can let him take you
as his second wife.

546
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,200
What's wrong with you?

547
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,080
Do you expect us to be at the same rank?

548
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,720
Cao Xuanxuan,

549
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,000
don't go too far.

550
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,920
Stop yelling.

551
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,100
Go and play elsewhere.

552
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,460
Go.

553
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,640
I really did come to make peace.

554
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,880
We can learn to get along
with each other.

555
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,440
I made these pastries for you.

556
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,120
Try it.

557
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,960
Are you really that kind

558
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,960
to come all the way here to make peace?

559
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120
These pastries

560
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,120
are quite delicate.

561
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:45,840
Come.

562
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,420
How about you have a bite first?

563
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,800
I don't want to eat it.

564
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,040
Why not?

565
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,360
You eat it.

566
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,040
Come.

567
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,820
Let me feed you.

568
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,320
Take a bite.

569
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,000
No. I don't!

570
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,640
Tell me.

571
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,940
Who asked you to send
these pastries here?

572
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,480
I don't know.

573
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:05,840
No...

574
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:06,840
I...

575
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:08,560
I...

576
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,140
Come with me.

577
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,800
Pick it up.

578
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,760
Pick it up.

579
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:19,960
Follow me.

580
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,160
What's the matter?

581
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,040
Why don't you ask your cousin?

582
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,120
I don't know anything.

583
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,680
I mean...

584
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,160
Magistrate Guo.

585
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,440
Since it's your family matter,

586
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,880
I won't be in your way.

587
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,220
Excuse me, please.

588
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,600
What's going on?

589
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,680
See for yourself.

590
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,640
He Chun!

591
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,440
Yes, sir?

592
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,320
Check this for me.

593
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,240
Bloodfang Toxin.

594
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,760
In mild cases,

595
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,860
it causes stiff mouth and limbs,
similar to dementia.

596
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,380
In severe cases, it leads to coma.

597
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,840
What's going on here?

598
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,080
I don't know.

599
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,320
I really don't know.

600
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,640
Where did you get this?

601
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,880
It was him.

602
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,040
He...

603
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,680
Who told you to poison me?

604
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,640
I don't know.

605
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,440
He clearly said...

606
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,200
Who is he?

607
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,000
Ying.

608
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,920
Zilu?

609
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,180
Come here.

610
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,920
What's the matter?

611
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,040
You're in such a rush.

612
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,160
Are you going to see my younger brother?

613
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,840
Your devotion

614
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,240
is truly touching.

615
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,520
What's it to you?

616
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,560
Don't get angry.

617
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,560
Everyone knows you're devoted to Zijie.

618
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,080
But I'm worried

619
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,000
that your devotion

620
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,720
might be misplaced.

621
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,240
What do you mean?

622
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,520
Explain it clearly.

623
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,720
Why don't you still get it?

624
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,200
You're pure-hearted.

625
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,600
But Cao Xuanxuan

626
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,200
is malicious.

627
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,000
You're alone out there.

628
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,660
How could you possibly compete with her?

629
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,400
Don't you agree?

630
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
What should I do?

631
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,120
I can help you.

632
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,360
Dali.

633
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
What's this?

634
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,740
I don't want it.

635
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,040
Ying,

636
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,240
listen to me.

637
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,920
This is Golden Azalea Extract.

638
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,120
If used on a person,

639
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,160
it causes rashes.

640
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,840
You see.

641
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,720
If Cao Xuanxuan breaks out in rashes,

642
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,960
Zijie will naturally
be disgusted with her.

643
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,400
Then what chance does she have
against you after that?

644
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,640
If you marry Zijie,

645
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,000
the Guo and Liu families

646
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,920
will be even closer.

647
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,040
What is Cao Xuanxuan?

648
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,920
She's only an outsider.

649
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,880
As your cousin,

650
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,520
I will always stand by your side.

651
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,680
But

652
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,560
how you handle this

653
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,520
is still

654
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,440
up to you.

655
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,240
Ying is not evil by nature.

656
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,140
There must be some misunderstanding

657
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,600
for her to do something like this.

658
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,820
Misunderstanding?

659
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,140
How is this a misunderstanding

660
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,440
when the evidence is concrete?

661
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,720
Xuanxuan.

662
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,800
Once the Lyu Residence case is over,

663
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,080
I will look into this.

664
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,440
Is that alright?

665
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,480
Guo Zijie,

666
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,680
I'll remember this.

667
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,640
Xuanxuan.

668
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,240
Don't touch me!

669
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
Zijie,

670
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,800
I had no idea.

671
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,340
Why don't you go back first?

672
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,040
Something bad had happened!

673
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:54,840
What is it?

674
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,360
The Imperial Envoy is dead.

675
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,480
He's dead?

676
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,480
The deceased shows no signs
of being dragged after death.

677
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,160
This should be the first crime scene.

678
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,280
The time of death

679
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,840
was around the hour of Chou.

680
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,560
There are no signs of a struggle.

681
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,640
The fatal wound

682
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,440
is on the back.

683
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,320
The Chou hour again.

684
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,120
The door and windows were locked too.

685
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,080
Another locked-room murder.

686
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,440
Magistrate Guo,

687
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,920
who is committing

688
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,600
these crimes in my house?

689
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,200
Calm down.

690
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,440
The knife wound is on the back

691
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,480
and no signs of a struggle beforehand.

692
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,840
And from the angle of the stab,

693
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,360
the killer must have been very close
to Mr. Zhao at the time.

694
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,320
But Mr. Zhao was caught off guard.

695
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,920
It shows

696
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,320
Mr. Zhao should know

697
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,120
the killer.

698
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,840
The only ones
who are familiar with Mr. Zhao

699
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,760
are me and a few of my friends.

700
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,840
But we were all together last night.

701
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,480
Besides, the others in the house

702
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,480
don't know Mr. Zhao at all.

703
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,440
If they didn't know him,

704
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,000
it would be difficult
to kill him from behind

705
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,080
without him noticing.

706
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:42,960
Xuanxuan,

707
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,100
what do you think?

708
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,780
What else can I add

709
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,860
when you've said it all?

710
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,280
Luo Ji and Mr. Zhao have both died.

711
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,840
I suspect the killer
might be the same person.

712
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,160
But what is the connection
between these two?

713
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,240
Could there be

714
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,440
something we've missed?

715
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,160
What's wrong?

716
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,440
Zijie,

717
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,040
I think some things

718
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,520
should be said in person.

719
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,120
Xuanxuan is not an unreasonable person.

720
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,440
Just explain it to her.

721
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,260
I don't know what to say to her.

722
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,320
If you don't go,
it'll look like you're avoiding her.

723
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,520
Just go.

724
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,580
Come on. Go. Hurry up.

725
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,360
Go.

726
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,120
Just go.

727
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,880
Don't you know how to coax a woman?

728
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,360
Do you?

729
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,360
What are you writing?

730
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,760
I'm not telling you.

731
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,560
Xuanxuan,

732
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,320
do you want

733
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,880
to hear my story?

734
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,280
What?

735
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,120
When I was young,

736
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,400
I was close to Brother.

737
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,080
Later, my mother passed away.

738
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,000
My father, after all, was a man.

739
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,920
He only focused on our studies.

740
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,840
My elder brother, with his bold nature,

741
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
didn't like studying.

742
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,680
So he would often be scolded by Father.

743
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,520
Over time,

744
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,600
he began to feel
that our father was biased.

745
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,040
When the family secured
an official post,

746
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,980
Father sent me instead of him.

747
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,360
As the eldest son,

748
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,440
Brother feared

749
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,640
that one day

750
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,640
I might replace him

751
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,600
and take his inheritance.

752
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,560
So

753
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,400
you're avoiding confrontation

754
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,320
just to avoid competing with him?

755
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,320
So what if you are?

756
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,840
You brothers suspect each other.

757
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,960
He's afraid I might help you.

758
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,320
So he wants to poison me?

759
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,080
Why?

760
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,160
What have I done wrong?

761
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,200
Xuanxuan,

762
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,880
trust me.

763
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,440
After I return,

764
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,440
I will definitely clear things up
with him.

765
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,520
What about Liu Ying?

766
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,280
Why are you taking her side?

767
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,400
When did I take her side?

768
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,520
She

769
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,600
is open and honest.

770
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,480
She's probably been deceived by Brother.

771
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,560
But since she did this,

772
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,680
the Guo Residence
can no longer let her stay.

773
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,640
After all, she's a woman.

774
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,040
If word of this gets out,

775
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,680
her life is basically over.

776
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,640
I only want to give her a way out.

777
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,840
You've been together for so long.

778
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,480
Don't you have any feelings for her?

779
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,400
I...

780
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,200
I...

781
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:10,920
She and I...

782
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,040
I haven't even spoken
a few words to her.

783
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,080
If it weren't for you

784
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,080
who fell unconscious,

785
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,160
Father kept talking

786
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,680
about how the greatest sin
is being unfilial,

787
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,160
and having no heirs is the worst.

788
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,280
I really didn't want

789
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,640
to listen to him go on about it.

790
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,320
So I...

791
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,520
You understand, right?

792
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,680
You can leave.

793
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,360
I get it now.

794
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,040
Xuanxuan.

795
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,400
Xuanxuan?

796
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,040
Don't be mad.

797
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:58,960
All right?

798
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:12,960
Don't be mad,

799
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,680
all right?

800
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,000
Guo Zijie.

801
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,160
Why are you here?

802
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,240
You should go back.

803
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,440
I'm still not done cooking.

804
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,240
I didn't know you knew how to cook.

805
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,320
My cooking is great.

806
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,520
Second Madam.

807
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,640
Second Madam, be careful.

808
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,960
Who's that?

809
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,400
She's the Second Madam.

810
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,400
She fell into a trance.

811
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,640
So she's not clear-headed.

812
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,880
I'll leave you two to your work.

813
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,940
I'll go and check on her.

814
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,280
Second Madam

815
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,600
fell into a trance?

816
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,360
Could she

817
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,760
have been frightened by something?

818
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,640
It looks like the killer is still here.

819
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,240
Hurry up and head back now.

820
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:51,920
I'm almost done.

821
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,040
I'll send it over to you.

822
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,820
Let me help you.

823
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,120
I can crack an egg with one hand.

824
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,080
I can do that too.

825
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,040
Just go back.

826
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,000
Be good.

827
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:58,480
Go.

828
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,000
Miss Xuanxuan.

829
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,360
Oh, Xiaolin.

830
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,280
Why are you here?

831
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,480
Miss Xuanxuan,

832
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,600
why are you here?

833
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,560
Zijie went to prepare noodles

834
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,360
for me.

835
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,140
Please sit.

836
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,400
Uh...

837
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,360
What's the matter?

838
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,200
Is there anything you want to say?

839
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,920
You should stay away

840
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,280
from Guo Zijie.

841
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,440
Why do you say so?

842
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,560
Miss Xuanxuan,

843
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,640
you're my family's benefactor.

844
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,920
There are things

845
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,440
I didn't plan on telling.

846
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,400
But I saw you get along with him...

847
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,240
When you fell off the cliff,

848
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,520
it was Guo Zijie's order.

849
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,120
