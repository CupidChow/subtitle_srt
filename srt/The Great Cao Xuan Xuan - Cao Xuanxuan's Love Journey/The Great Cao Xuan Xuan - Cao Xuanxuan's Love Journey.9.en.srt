Xuanxuan.

23
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,200
You have no manners.

24
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,240
You came in without knocking.

25
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,840
Father's dead.

26
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,880
I'm worried that you'll be upset.

27
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,960
Did he agree

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,760
you can call him that?

29
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,000
He Chun.

30
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,680
The most urgent task now

31
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,440
is to find the murderer.

32
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,040
Who do you think the murderer is?

33
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,840
Aren't you an expert at solving cases?

34
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,160
Why are you asking me?

35
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,600
You really don't know?

36
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,520
What do you mean?

37
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,960
What are you nervous about?

38
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,240
I'm nervous?

39
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,800
Alright.

40
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,920
I'll tell you.

41
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,360
I've already caught

42
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,720
the person who used witchcraft

43
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,240
to curse my father to death that night.

44
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,680
The person is now locked up in the hall.

45
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,600
A curse that kills?

46
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,080
Do you believe it?

47
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,760
I checked the doors and windows.

48
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,320
They were all locked from the inside.

49
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,760
If there's a murderer,

50
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,560
how did they escape

51
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,880
after killing my father?

52
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,440
What else could it be

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,200
besides witchcraft?

54
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,480
So you arrested Ruohui?

55
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,040
There's no other explanation.

56
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,320
It must be witchcraft.

57
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,440
And she also said that night

58
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,200
that my father

59
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,680
would die that night.

60
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,800
I've

61
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,080
locked her up in the hall,

62
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,520
waiting for you to interrogate her.

63
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,000
Alright.

64
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,880
I hope every word you say

65
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,860
doesn't let your father down.

66
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,760
Farewell.

67
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,200
Is Ruohui locked up in here?

68
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,080
That's right.

69
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,320
Where is she?

70
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,120
She escaped.

71
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,480
It's all tricks.

72
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,680
Let's set her aside for now.

73
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,000
Let's look for other clues.

74
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:02,960
Alright.

75
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,760
She escaped.

76
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,880
She's not really the murderer, is she?

77
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,400
Has my father's body

78
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,360
been properly taken care of?

79
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,240
Don't worry.

80
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,320
I've taken care of it.

81
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,560
Have you examined it?

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,360
I've examined Master Guo's body.

83
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,700
The fatal wound
is on the right side of his lower back.

84
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,560
It's just one stab.

85
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
The wound is smooth.

86
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,000
It should have been made
by a sharp weapon.

87
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,840
The murder weapon

88
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,000
should be a dagger.

89
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,720
A dagger?

90
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,880
Why would it be a dagger?

91
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,800
Are you sure Madam Guo

92
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,960
was poisoned to death?

93
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,720
Yes.

94
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,800
And this poison is from Western regions.

95
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,460
There's no such thing in Central Plains.

96
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,440
If the murderer is really Guo Zilu,

97
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,840
why did he use a rare poison

98
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,040
to kill Madam Guo

99
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,280
but a dagger

100
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,960
to kill my father?

101
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,760
If he failed to kill with one stab,

102
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,520
wouldn't he expose himself?

103
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,120
Do you mean

104
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,520
that the murderer isn't Guo Zilu

105
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
but someone else?

106
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,760
Don't rule out any possibility.

107
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,000
However,

108
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,280
Madam Guo's death

109
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,600
is crucial.

110
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,360
How about this?

111
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,260
We'll check out my father's room.

112
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,640
Then, inform Mr. Sun

113
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,640
to investigate Ruohui.

114
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,520
No problem.

115
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,600
Xuanxuan.

116
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,320
Do you suspect that this room

117
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,320
is similar to the previous case
we encountered,

118
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,560
where the murderer faked a locked room
to commit murder

119
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,940
and played a trick to deceive us?

120
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,720
Generally speaking,
locked rooms are deceptions.

121
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,000
But if it's a real locked room,

122
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,520
the murderer can't escape freely.

123
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,240
Besides,

124
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,160
there's only one possibility

125
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,160
that the deceased
died in a real locked room.

126
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,520
And that's suicide.

127
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,280
But Master Guo
probably won't commit suicide.

128
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,400
I'm not sure about this either.

129
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,040
We can only check again.

130
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,120
I just want to know

131
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,320
how

132
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,720
the murderer escaped.

133
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,240
Could the murderer

134
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,960
kill him outside?

135
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:17,960
Yuan.

136
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,040
Dujuan.

137
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,360
You should leave.

138
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,920
Leave Guo Residence.

139
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,280
Why?

140
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,560
Cao Xuanxuan

141
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,720
has started to thoroughly
investigate the case.

142
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,720
I'm worried...

143
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,520
Don't worry.

144
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,040
I'm here.

145
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Promise me

146
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,820
you'll run away immediately

147
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,080
if there's any sign of trouble.

148
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,600
Alright.

149
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,240
I promise.

150
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll go first.

151
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,520
Be careful.

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,080
You should also be careful.

153
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,260
What do you think?

154
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,280
I think so too.

155
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,440
Miss Xuanxuan.

156
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,000
What is it?

157
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,560
I plead guilty.

158
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
I did...

159
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,160
I did all of this.

160
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,640
What did you say?

161
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,920
Is it true?

162
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,040
The poison...

163
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,440
I bought the poison at the pharmacy.

164
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,120
Master...

165
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,480
I killed Master too.

166
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,240
I did all of this.

167
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,920
Why?

168
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,960
I've been here for years,

169
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,360
but Master has never...

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,680
Master had never given me a raise.

171
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,120
And Madam Guo

172
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,080
would punish me severely

173
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,720
whenever I made a small mistake.

174
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,240
That's why I...

175
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,320
I...

176
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,800
You said you were the murderer.

177
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,240
What was the poison

178
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,600
Madam Guo got?

179
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,160
I...

180
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,880
Why did you only poison Madam Guo

181
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,960
but the others were fine?

182
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,840
Also,

183
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
how did Master end up dead
in a locked room?

184
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,480
I bought the poison at a pharmacy.

185
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,320
I didn't ask what poison was it.

186
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,920
And Master...

187
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,320
As for Master...

188
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,680
You don't know, do you?

189
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,140
Who are you taking the blame for?

190
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:28,980
No.

191
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,960
It's really me.

192
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,720
It's really me who did it.

193
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,640
Zhang Yuan knows nothing about the case.

194
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,600
He's clearly

195
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,320
taking the blame for someone else.

196
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,040
But Zhang Yuan

197
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,120
has been working in the kitchen
for several years.

198
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
He doesn't seem

199
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,480
to have any special relationships
with anyone.

200
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,720
Let's ask the butler.

201
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,680
Let's go.

202
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,120
(Guo Residence)

203
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,760
Butler.

204
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,160
Wait.

205
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,320
You're most familiar
with this residence.

206
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,680
Think about it carefully.

207
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,760
Who else did Madam Guo have conflicts
with when she was alive?

208
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,120
Yes.

209
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,360
Dujuan.

210
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,440
Dujuan?

211
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,080
Dujuan once had a private meeting
with Young Master Zilu

212
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,720
that Madam Guo saw.

213
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,080
It was because I interceded

214
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,560
that this matter

215
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,560
wasn't exposed.

216
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,600
But what does Dujuan

217
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,120
have to do with Zhang Yuan?

218
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,680
Dujuan is currently the only suspect.

219
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,480
If we find a connection
between her and Zhang Yuan,

220
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,080
we can prove

221
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,200
that Zhang Yuan

222
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,920
took the blame for Dujuan.

223
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,720
So it's her.

224
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,800
Don't be impulsive.

225
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,760
We can't confirm that the murderer

226
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,720
is Dujuan yet.

227
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,200
Go ahead with your work.

228
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,240
Yes.

229
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,100
(Guo Residence)

230
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,720
Zilu.

231
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,600
I...

232
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,960
What do you want from me?

233
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,120
That day...

234
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,160
That day...

235
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,280
Why are you stuttering?

236
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,740
Go straight to the point.

237
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,360
I...

238
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,760
Madam Guo saw...

239
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,600
So I...

240
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,920
What Madam Guo?

241
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,240
What are you talking about?

242
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,880
Zilu.

243
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,640
That day...

244
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,000
I...

245
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,720
She's trying to say

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,040
that she and Zhang Yuan

247
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,240
are childhood sweethearts,

248
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,360
but now

249
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,600
Zhang Yuan

250
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,520
wants to take the blame for you.

251
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,920
This poison

252
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,000
was found in your room.

253
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,560
Tell us

254
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,920
how you plotted and killed Madam Guo.

255
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,520
Take the blame?

256
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,120
Zhang Yuan?

257
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,000
Why is Yuan so foolish?

258
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,160
No.

259
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,520
That's not the case.

260
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,520
That's not the case.

261
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,760
Let me explain.

262
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,080
I didn't.

263
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,520
That's not the case.

264
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,040
Let me explain.

265
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,240
Zilu.

266
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,200
Why are you here?

267
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,800
I'm here to interrogate

268
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,280
this treacherous wench.

269
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,920
Now the truth is out.

270
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,080
Xuanxuan.

271
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
She's yours.

272
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,040
Don't forget

273
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,880
about Zhang Yuan.

274
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,960
Zilu.

275
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,880
Zilu.

276
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,320
Zilu!

277
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,040
No.

278
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,440
No.

279
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,640
That's not the case.

280
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,240
It has nothing to do with Zhang Yuan.

281
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,320
No.

282
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Let me explain.

283
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,160
This matter has nothing to do
with Zhang Yuan.

284
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,440
Take her away.

285
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,640
It has nothing to do with Zhang Yuan.

286
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,040
It's really not like that.

287
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,600
Let me explain!

288
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,880
No.

289
00:13:58,061 --> 00:13:59,860
(Bright Sky And Shining Sun)

290
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
At this point,

291
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,640
what else do you have to say now?

292
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,240
Yuan.

293
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,400
Why...

294
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,920
Why are you so foolish?

295
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,160
Dujuan.

296
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,560
How did you kill Madam Guo

297
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,560
and Master?

298
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,320
I didn't poison her.

299
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,960
I really didn't poison her!

300
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,840
I didn't kill

301
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,520
Madam Guo either.

302
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,400
I did it.

303
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,360
Shut up.

304
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,080
Go on.

305
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,920
Alright.

306
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,040
Zhang Yuan
really has nothing to do with this.

307
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,800
I...

308
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,600
I asked Yuan...

309
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,640
I asked him to buy the poison for me.

310
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,440
Yuan.

311
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,440
Could you

312
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,080
do me a favor?

313
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,400
Go ahead.

314
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,160
Help me buy some...

315
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,640
Hedinghong.
[*A deadly poison.]

316
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,220
You...

317
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,200
You're not really poisoning her,
are you?

318
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,880
Yuan.

319
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,240
I'm with Guo Zilu now.

320
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,520
I can only be with him.

321
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,560
But...

322
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,560
But as long as Madam Guo is around,

323
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,600
she'll kick me out sooner or later.

324
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,680
You're too careless.

325
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,240
How did she bump into you?

326
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,520
I've been really careful,

327
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,880
but somehow

328
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,560
she still bumped into us.

329
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
She also warned us

330
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,720
that she would expose me if she found me

331
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,120
with Young Master Zilu again.

332
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,400
I...

333
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,960
But if you killed her,

334
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,560
Master won't spare you.

335
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,600
Don't worry.

336
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,320
I'll be careful.

337
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,320
But I hesitated

338
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,880
and eventually didn't poison her.

339
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,240
So I don't know

340
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,040
why Madam Guo

341
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,280
suddenly died of poison.

342
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,640
I have no idea

343
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,320
about Master's death.

344
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,960
How dare you deny it?

345
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,720
Dujuan.

346
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,320
I wanted to take you as my concubine.

347
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,400
I didn't expect that you would do this

348
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,780
just because my father disagreed.

349
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,640
You vicious woman.

350
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,080
Zilu.

351
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,320
You don't believe me too?

352
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,160
I really didn't kill anyone.

353
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,080
I really didn't.

354
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,720
Xuanxuan.

355
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,080
Put them on death row.

356
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,200
I never want to see this woman again.

357
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,080
I really didn't.

358
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,840
Calm down.

359
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,160
If she really killed someone,

360
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,080
she would be punished by law.

361
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,240
Take them away

362
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,360
to await trial.

363
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,120
Miss.

364
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,040
Sir,

365
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:10,960
is this medicine

366
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,200
from you?

367
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,320
You're right.

368
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,000
This medicine was indeed bought here.

369
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,120
Can you tell
how many times it has been used?

370
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,720
Give me a minute.

371
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,560
This medicine is complete.

372
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,520
It hasn't been used at all.

373
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,560
Are you sure?

374
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,960
Yes.

375
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,120
Miss.

376
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,960
Give me a minute.

377
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,480
(If the measurement is correct,)

378
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,400
(Dujuan didn't lie.)

379
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,440
These medicines are pre-packed.

380
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,080
If you don't believe me,

381
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,520
you can weigh it yourself.

382
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,280
Alright.

383
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,080
Thank you.

384
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,780
You're welcome.

385
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,320
Take care, Sir.

386
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,720
Waiter, a bowl of noodles.

387
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,600
Sure.

388
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,680
A bowl of noodles!

389
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,240
Mr. Guo's death

390
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,480
is strange.

391
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,880
Yeah.

392
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,830
This is the first time

393
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,880
Magistrate Guo has encountered
such a bizarre case

394
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,740
after being a detective for so long.

395
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,920
In my opinion,

396
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,040
it's difficult.

397
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,040
- It's his father who died.
- Dead?

398
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,720
Concern can cloud one's judgment.

399
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,000
What were you talking about?

400
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:37,920
Is that old man

401
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,600
really dead?

402
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,720
No.

403
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,920
Why did you say that?

404
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,760
Turns out Master Zhang

405
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,200
is amazing.

406
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,080
What nonsense
is this girl talking about?

407
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,000
Don't talk nonsense.

408
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,920
Enjoy your meal.

409
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,040
Master Zhang is great.

410
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,840
Ruohui.

411
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,240
Uncle.

412
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,600
Why are you here?

413
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,800
Come home with me.

414
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,520
Wait.

415
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,200
Let me go.

416
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,360
I can walk on my own.

417
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,160
Miss.

418
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,400
Your noodle is ready!

419
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,480
What would you two like to eat?

420
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,440
We'll have two bowls of noodles first.

421
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,440
Two bowls of noodles?

422
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,080
Noodles?

423
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,360
- Sit.
- Two bowls of noodles.

424
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,040
I'm not hungry.

425
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,160
Yes.

426
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,600
I'm hungry.

427
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,720
Here.

428
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,980
Drink some water first.

429
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,200
Excuse me.

430
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,080
Do you

431
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,680
know a girl named Ruohui?

432
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,800
Yes.

433
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,160
This girl

434
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,360
was just there.

435
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,160
Her uncle wanted to take her home,

436
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,160
but she ran away.

437
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,320
Leave.

438
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,840
Master.

439
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,960
You're amazing.

440
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
How accurate.

441
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,520
Master Guo really died.

442
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,320
Your trick is effective.

443
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,880
Since it's effective,

444
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,720
pay up the remaining

445
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,960
balance.

446
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,520
But...

447
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,560
But what?

448
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,000
But except for Master Guo,

449
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,280
everyone else

450
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,200
is cursed wrongly.

451
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,680
Master.

452
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,520
Did you remember it wrong

453
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,960
and killed the wrong person?

454
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,680
I wanted to kill Master Guo,

455
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,560
but why is Madam Guo also dead?

456
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,360
Well...

457
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,800
How dare you?

458
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,400
How could I have cursed wrongly?

459
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,000
I cursed Master Guo.

460
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,480
It's just that this spell

461
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,000
is powerful

462
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,080
and dangerous.

463
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,480
In addition,
Madam Guo was already in poor health

464
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,480
and weak.

465
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,800
That's why she was accidentally

466
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,960
injured by the spell.

467
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,280
I see.

468
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,040
Well...

469
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,440
Every time you pay,

470
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,120
a person dies.

471
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,920
But now that two people are dead,

472
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,600
shouldn't you

473
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,640
pay me

474
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,600
the remaining balance?

475
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,880
The cursing
must be compensated with money.

476
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,000
As the saying goes,

477
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,240
losing money can ward off disaster.

478
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,600
Besides,

479
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,120
this money isn't for me.

480
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,760
It's

481
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,080
for the gods.

482
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,680
You must know

483
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,440
that if you don't compensate,

484
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,480
the gods

485
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,000
will punish you.

486
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,200
Alright.

487
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:48,960
Got it.

488
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,400
I'll go raise the money now.

489
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,200
Someone died in Guo Residence.

490
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Why arrest me?

491
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,080
I've never been to Guo Residence.

492
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,520
You

493
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,200
should save this for the court.

494
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,760
Miss He.

495
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:32,760
Miss He.

496
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,080
I asked a lot of people.

497
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,920
I finally found you.

498
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,640
This is what you asked
Coroners Association to find.

499
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,880
What's this?

500
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,480
Don't touch it.

501
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,200
It's poisonous.

502
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,200
Xuanxuan.

503
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,800
We caught Ruohui.

504
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,000
We'll talk about her later.

505
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,920
Did you find what I asked you to find?

506
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,600
Yes.

507
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,240
This is the poison from Western regions,

508
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,960
but there's only a small amount.

509
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,640
There were seven people
drinking together that night,

510
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,120
but only Madam Guo was poisoned.

511
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,240
I think the problem

512
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,760
lies with the glass.

513
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,320
Someone also mentioned this that day.

514
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,280
Mr. Song checked the food and glasses

515
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,920
and found nothing wrong with them.

516
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,480
It's not the glass,

517
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,960
nor the drinks and food...

518
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,120
Did Madam Guo

519
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,720
sit in the main seat that night?

520
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,000
Do you suspect that Madam Guo's death

521
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,720
is related to the order of the seats?

522
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,320
Fu.

523
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,080
Bring some wine.

524
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,120
Sure.

525
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,280
He Chun, silver needle.

526
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,280
How did this happen?

527
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,360
They were all poured out
from the same pot of wine.

528
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,960
Why is only the last glass poisonous?

529
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,200
I got it.

530
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,220
It's about that night's
seating arrangement.

531
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,200
Madam Guo is the host.

532
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,120
Out of courtesy,

533
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,160
she would pour herself
the last glass of wine.

534
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,400
This poison has a high density and can

535
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,840
sink to the bottom of the wine.

536
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,800
If the murderer

537
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,520
poured the wine in order,

538
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,900
the last person
to drink the poisoned wine

539
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,640
would definitely be Madam Guo.

540
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,720
Who on earth

541
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,160
could be so cruel?

542
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,280
But this person

543
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,320
isn't simple.

544
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,800
Leave.

545
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,600
Let me go!

546
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,040
Get out.

547
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,480
Yuan.

548
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,800
Yuan.

549
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,240
Yuan, how are you?

550
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,760
Yuan.

551
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,640
Yuan.

552
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,360
Yuan, how are you?

553
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:45,880
Yuan.

554
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,160
Ruohui's uncle.

555
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,920
You're still humming?

556
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,960
Ruohui was taken away.

557
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,460
What?

558
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,360
She's at Guo Residence.

559
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,160
Hurry and save her.

560
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,160
Why

561
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,480
is this girl

562
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,160
so troublesome?

563
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,000
Miss Xuanxuan.

564
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,580
You should at least eat something.

565
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,600
Leave it here.

566
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,720
Yes.

567
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,160
Let me go.

568
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,600
Xuanxuan.

569
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,240
Ruohui is here.

570
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,640
Let go.

571
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,240
What proof do you have
that I committed murder?

572
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,220
Where's the proof?

573
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,720
Let her go.

574
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,640
Sit.

575
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,880
In the entire Yan City,

576
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,080
you're probably
the one who hates Master Guo the most.

577
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,080
You know I hate him?

578
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,680
Are you guilty?

579
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,840
What

580
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,240
happened back then?

581
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,200
On the way home

582
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
that night...

583
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,440
Go.

584
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:03,960
Go.

585
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,560
Buddies.

586
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,240
You've worked hard.

587
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,960
Here.

588
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,040
Here, continue.

589
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,760
The rope is a bit loose.

590
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,960
We still have a chance to leave

591
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,720
when they're drunk.

592
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,680
Look.

593
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,240
My leg is injured.

594
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,440
If there's a chance,

595
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,040
you must run

596
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,040
without hesitation.

597
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,200
Don't mind me.

598
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,360
Nonsense.

599
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,760
We have been doing business

600
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,320
and traveled together for so many years.

601
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,560
No one can be left behind.

602
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,160
Master.

603
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,480
He's right.

604
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,800
His leg is injured

605
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,040
and can't run fast.

606
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,320
No.

607
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,720
We must leave together.

608
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,360
They escaped!

609
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:28,920
Hurry!

610
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,960
Let's leave together.

611
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,680
Let's go, Master.

612
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,200
Go!

613
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,720
Hurry.

614
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,640
Run!

615
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,400
That night,

616
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,240
only Master Guo

617
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,480
and the butler managed to escape.

618
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,360
But Ruohui's father

619
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,160
failed.

620
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,920
You really have the nerve to say that.

621
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,520
It's that old man

622
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,120
and his cowardly lackey's

623
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,280
fault.

624
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,440
They're both bad people.

625
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,840
Ruohui.

626
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,040
I understand that you hate Master Guo,

627
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
but you must know

628
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,720
that anyone who was in that situation

629
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,360
would do the same thing.

630
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,440
The morals and laws here
aren't perfect yet.

631
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,200
At where I'm from,

632
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,080
we have a saying about risk aversion.

633
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,520
You're right.

634
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,000
When facing life and death,

635
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,280
you should save yourself first.

636
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,200
My father

637
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,800
was a living human.

638
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,280
How could you say that so easily?

639
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,880
Tell me.

640
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,280
How did you kill them?

641
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,600
I refuse to tell you.

642
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,260
Do you think we can't convict you

643
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,760
if you don't tell us?

644
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,080
I wasn't there

645
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,080
when they both died.

646
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,800
What makes you call me the murderer?

647
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,400
Xuanxuan.

648
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,640
Come with me.

649
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,760
That's what happened at the time.

650
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,240
That's why

651
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,000
Ruohui said

652
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,960
she wasn't the murderer,

653
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,480
but she firmly believed
that it was the power of a curse.

654
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,960
There's such a thing?

655
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,040
In my opinion,

656
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,800
Ruohui

657
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,280
firmly believes

658
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,800
in the charlatan's power.

659
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,160
She does have the intent to kill,

660
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,480
but she was manipulated by a charlatan.

661
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,760
What does the charlatan

662
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,160
have to do with my father?

663
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,640
So...

664
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,480
Have you eaten enough?

665
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,920
You can go now.

666
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,560
What?

667
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,320
Really?

668
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,800
Not only can you leave,

669
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,600
but this is also for you.

670
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,560
What's going on?

671
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,000
You're letting me leave

672
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,080
and giving me money.

673
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,280
What's the matter?

674
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,440
Are you reluctant to leave?

675
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,240
I'll leave.

676
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
I'll leave right away.

677
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,360
With this money,

678
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,320
I won't have to suffer backlash.

679
00:34:04,163 --> 00:34:05,152
He's really amazing.

680
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:07,610
He's a master.

681
00:34:07,938 --> 00:34:09,225
