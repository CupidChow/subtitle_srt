Whoa!

Hyah!

28
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,320
Why do you want to see me?

29
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,120
Tell me.

30
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,540
Were you behind the incidents

31
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,040
at Lyu Residence and Zhao Village?

32
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,600
You told me

33
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,240
I only need to deliver messages for you.

34
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,840
But now people have died!

35
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,640
You suspect I'm the killer?

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,760
I asked you to deliver a letter.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,520
Who you gave it to and its contents,

38
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,320
you should never have known.

39
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,160
So...

40
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,080
As a scholar,

41
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,040
I couldn't have peeked.

42
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,640
Anyway,

43
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,440
I won't help you anymore.

44
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,920
Ten years of hard study wasted.

45
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,880
Don't you want
to be an official anymore?

46
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,360
I do.

47
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,280
But I want to succeed
with my own efforts.

48
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,920
Of course, you can try

49
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,800
because you still have time.

50
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,760
But I don't know

51
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,040
if your foster father

52
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,160
can wait.

53
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,960
What did you do to my father?

54
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,060
Believe it when I say
I'll fight you head-on.

55
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,440
Calm down.

56
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,960
I only want to help him.

57
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,600
You know he has a lung disease.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,080
Besides me,

59
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,480
no one can save him.

60
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,520
Can you really heal my father?

61
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,280
Whether I can or not

62
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,720
depends on your choice.

63
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,360
Guo Zijie

64
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,120
taught you a few words.

65
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,720
But without your foster father,

66
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,280
you would have died that winter.

67
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,200
A few words of kindness

68
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,840
can't be more important

69
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,240
than your foster father's life.

70
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,880
But don't worry.

71
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,560
I won't force you.

72
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,440
But right now,

73
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,040
his life is

74
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,120
in your hands.

75
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,560
Sir.

76
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,200
Sir,

77
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,000
how's my father?

78
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,280
You should prepare for his funeral.

79
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,560
Sir,

80
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,160
please find another way.

81
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,000
Sir...

82
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,480
Father.

83
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,200
(Guo Residence)

84
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:36,620
Welcome.

85
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:38,200
Let's go.

86
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,200
Welcome.

87
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,653
All right.

88
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,880
Young Master Zijie.

89
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,880
Where's Guo Zilu?

90
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,380
Young Master Zilu is over there.

91
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,280
What's he planning to do?

92
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,280
I don't know

93
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,160
and who cares?

94
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,180
Where's Mr. Sun?

95
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,000
He left a note saying

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,640
Mr. Sun's lung condition
had worsened.

97
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,000
He had to rush back home overnight.

98
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,520
I wonder

99
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,440
how is he doing now.

100
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,880
Young Master Zilu,

101
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:13,120
it has been a long time.

102
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,000
Young Master Zijie.

103
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,640
Young Master Zijie.

104
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,680
Thank you.

105
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,040
In that case,

106
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,360
you should drink more

107
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,700
at my father's birthday feast.

108
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,480
Of course.

109
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,240
Young Master Zilu.

110
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,080
Young Master Zilu.

111
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,120
We'll excuse ourselves.

112
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,680
Zijie, you're home.

113
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,280
You did it, right?

114
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,600
Did what?

115
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,040
Did you do it?

116
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,026
What did I do now?

117
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,053
What's going on?

118
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,400
Guo Zilu,

119
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
just answer me.

120
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,120
Oh,

121
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,160
Guo Zijie.

122
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,480
Have you lost it
from conducting investigations?

123
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,680
Do you even know what you're saying?

124
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,000
Coward.

125
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,640
Guo Zilu,

126
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,280
Liu Ying had confessed everything.

127
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,460
Why are you still denying it?

128
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,230
You're his brother.

129
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,460
Do you have to be so vicious?

130
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,040
You should stop spouting nonsense!

131
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Guo Zilu!

132
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,180
Young Master Zilu!

133
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,480
Young Master Zilu!

134
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,160
Move aside!

135
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,440
I...

136
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,600
Fine.

137
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,480
Just you wait!

138
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,840
Just you wait!

139
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,600
Everyone, get back to work.

140
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,800
Go on.

141
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,600
Are you all right?

142
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,560
I'm fine.

143
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,840
In the future,

144
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,640
avoid direct confrontation
with such people.

145
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,760
He'll take revenge on you.

146
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,200
Aren't you scared?

147
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,320
I am scared.

148
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,560
I've been scared since I was young.

149
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,960
That's why I've endured it
for so many years.

150
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,760
At the start,

151
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,080
people are born good.

152
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,920
Their natures are similar,

153
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,600
but their habits differ.

154
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,760
If you don't teach them,

155
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,720
their natures will change.

156
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,560
The way to teach

157
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,480
is with dedication.

158
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,560
When Mencius' mother...

159
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,240
Master.

160
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,680
Saw her son not learning...

161
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,600
Young Master

162
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,920
is smart

163
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,240
and diligent.

164
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,680
You will have a worthy successor.

165
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,960
With a righteous way,

166
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,680
teaching five sons

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,680
to be famous.

168
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,640
At the start,

169
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,720
people are born good.

170
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,560
Their natures are similar,

171
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,000
but their habits differ.

172
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,400
Then why did you...

173
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,280
Xuanxuan,

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
I will never

175
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,360
let anyone bully you again.

176
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,560
What happened?

177
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,120
You've been getting

178
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,040
more and more out of line.

179
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,200
Why didn't you come to see me

180
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
as soon as you got back?

181
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,640
I heard

182
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,600
you hit Zilu.

183
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,160
You're brothers.

184
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,360
If there's a problem,

185
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,900
do you have to let it come to this?

186
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,800
Father,

187
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,800
today is your birthday.

188
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,200
My brother and I

189
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,400
will take care of this matter.

190
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,640
You both better be.

191
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,760
Better be.

192
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,400
You've done a great job

193
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,200
with the Lyu Residence case.

194
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
You annoying son.

195
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,200
You're making more and more progress.

196
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,200
Father, you're flattering me.

197
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,240
Actually,

198
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,120
it's all thanks to Xuanxuan.

199
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,880
Father,

200
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,720
don't push yourself too hard today.

201
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,560
If there's anything,

202
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,760
let the servants do it for you.

203
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,160
The guests here today

204
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,480
are my old friends.

205
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,880
Speaking of old friends,

206
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,360
do you still remember

207
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,520
Mr. Ning?

208
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:12,880
Yes.

209
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,160
I've sent him an invitation.

210
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,680
It has been a while

211
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,040
but he didn't give a response.

212
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,200
Back then,

213
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,840
this would never happen.

214
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
Speaking of which,

215
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,800
his residence isn't

216
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,840
that far from here.

217
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,560
I need

218
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,960
to trouble you

219
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,480
to go

220
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,400
and invite him over

221
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,560
on my behalf.

222
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,720
All right. I'll go now.

223
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,180
Father,

224
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:32,780
rest assured.

225
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,080
I'll invite Mr. Ning over.

226
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,360
All right, then.

227
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,860
Then I'll make my way now, Father.

228
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,280
Go ahead.

229
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,320
Young Master Zilu,

230
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,320
apply some medicine.

231
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,600
Apply medicine?

232
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,960
Darn it!

233
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,160
Darn you, Guo Zijie.

234
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,480
That kid is becoming
more and more audacious now.

235
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,360
Young Master Zilu,

236
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,400
I'll send some men

237
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
to seek revenge for you.

238
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,160
Guo Zijie,

239
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,440
you've been pretending
to be foolish all this time, huh?

240
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,640
That Guo Zijie

241
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,760
has been hiding his true abilities.

242
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,080
By the way,

243
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,160
about the inheritance...

244
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,640
Father plans to announce it

245
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,040
at the birthday feast.

246
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,800
It looks like

247
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,880
he deliberately rushed back

248
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,600
to compete with me.

249
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,400
(Moral Values)

250
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,320
Did you hear

251
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,200
what Father talked
to Guo Zijie about just now?

252
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,680
They were talking

253
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,080
about letting Guo Zijie

254
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,280
invite Mr. Ning over.

255
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,440
We'll do it this way.

256
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,880
Dali, help me do one last thing.

257
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,960
If you fail again,

258
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,400
don't ever come back.

259
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,880
Yes.

260
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,040
What is it?

261
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,000
I will take care of it for you.

262
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,800
Xuanxuan.

263
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,840
Xuanxuan.

264
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,440
Why do you keep tugging me?

265
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,320
Can't you forgive me?

266
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,240
What did you do wrong?

267
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,480
Zijie.

268
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,160
Zijie,

269
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,080
I have something to say.

270
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,640
Can you come out for a moment?

271
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,360
You can tell me where.

272
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,840
Xuanxuan is not an outsider.

273
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,720
You...

274
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,320
Zijie,

275
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,490
about that previous incident,

276
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,600
I really had no idea.

277
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,520
Can you forgive me?

278
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,800
I'm your future wife.

279
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,520
Fine.

280
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,080
Since you are here,

281
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,080
I'll make things clear.

282
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,680
I don't care

283
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,640
whether you did it

284
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,600
on purpose.

285
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,360
But it is already in the past.

286
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,680
In my heart,

287
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,240
there has always been only one person.

288
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,520
When Xuanxuan was unconscious,

289
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,060
everyone said she would remain
that way forever.

290
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,080
Father and Madam Guo insist
that I marry you.

291
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,160
But I don't have
any romantic feelings toward you.

292
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,240
I think

293
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,400
no matter what happens in the future,

294
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,960
I'll at least ensure

295
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,780
you'll never have to worry
about your life.

296
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,560
Zijie,

297
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,840
don't you want me anymore?

298
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,920
When you get married,

299
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,260
I'll prepare
a generous gift for you.

300
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,000
You must be hungry.

301
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,000
Why did you use me as an excuse

302
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,880
to reject her?

303
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,480
Xuanxuan,

304
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,640
those were from the bottom of my heart.

305
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,080
Are you still going

306
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,160
to Mr. Ning's place?

307
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,400
Yes.

308
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,120
Let's go.

309
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,000
Should we ask He Chun to come with us?

310
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,360
Welcome! Welcome!

311
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,160
By the way,

312
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,320
how come I don't see

313
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,400
your second son around?

314
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,680
I have an old friend

315
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,800
who hasn't arrived yet.

316
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,280
So I asked Zijie

317
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,200
to go and invite him over.

318
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,480
I heard about Fox Spirit case

319
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,040
some time ago.

320
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,520
Your second son

321
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,280
is truly a genius.

322
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,840
Oh, you're flattering him.

323
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,080
Actually, he also solved
the case at Lyu Residence.

324
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,440
Mr. Guo Zilu is also a great talent.

325
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,160
Master Guo, I'm truly envious of you

326
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,800
for having such sons.

327
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,960
It seems

328
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,280
you are not interested

329
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,000
in your birthday celebration today,

330
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,200
but rather want

331
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,600
to step down

332
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
and announce the heir?

333
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,200
Since

334
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,760
you've brought it up,

335
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,680
I'll be honest with you.

336
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,360
Today

337
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,560
is not only

338
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,880
my 60th birthday,

339
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,720
but I also want you

340
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,200
to be witnesses.

341
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,840
From now on, our family's business

342
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,580
will be passed down to the children.

343
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,560
I hope

344
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,400
you'll help and support them
in the future.

345
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,000
- Of course.
- Of course.

346
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,720
Of course.

347
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,840
Let's enjoy

348
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,800
ourselves today.

349
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,820
Please enjoy the feast.

350
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,760
- All right.
- We will.

351
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,560
This way, please.

352
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,160
He Chun,

353
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,760
can you do me a favor?

354
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:08,920
What is it?

355
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,360
It's my father's birthday today.

356
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,740
But I didn't prepare any gifts.

357
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,320
Don't worry.

358
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,600
I'll go and prepare it for you.

359
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,440
Thank you.

360
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,640
Let's go.

361
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,000
What are you doing?

362
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,600
Are you doing something sneaky again?

363
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,520
I never said I would forgive you.

364
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,320
It's been so long

365
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,560
since we've spent time alone.

366
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,240
Now that He Chun is not with us,

367
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,760
no one can bother us anymore.

368
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,920
We should go now.

369
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
We're going to be late

370
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,740
for Master Guo's birthday celebration.

371
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,780
(Ning Residence)

372
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,960
There are many people around.

373
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,880
Stop grabbing at me.

374
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,960
Your sleeve is dirty.

375
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,720
Look.

376
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,740
You're not the one
who's going to wash it anyway.

377
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,520
Weiyan?

378
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,040
Zijie. Xuanxuan.

379
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,240
What are you doing here?

380
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,320
I was originally going
to Master Guo's birthday celebration.

381
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,660
When I heard you were coming here,

382
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,320
I rushed over

383
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,400
to offer some assistance.

384
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,080
Where's He Chun?

385
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,280
Why isn't she with you?

386
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,100
She went to help me buy a birthday gift.

387
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,160
It's getting late now.

388
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,320
We should head inside first.

389
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,560
You are...

390
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,640
My name is Guo Zijie.

391
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,040
Today I am here to invite Mr. Ning

392
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,640
to celebrate my father's birthday feast.

393
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,290
The Master did inform us of this.

394
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,160
Please, follow me.

395
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,520
Thank you

396
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,560
for coming here.

397
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,560
It's not a problem.

398
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,360
Father missed you very much.

399
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,360
So he sent me here
to invite you to the feast.

400
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,800
Yes, of course.

401
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,040
Let's talk inside.

402
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,400
All right.

403
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,560
As I get older,

404
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,960
my health

405
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,000
is prone

406
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,400
to various problems.

407
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,000
I see.

408
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
How about this?

409
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,040
You've come all the way here in person.

410
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,840
So I can't refuse

411
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,340
out of respect to Master Guo.

412
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,040
Wait another four hours.

413
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,280
After four hours,

414
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,940
the physician will administer
another acupuncture treatment.

415
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,720
After that,

416
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,080
we'll ride

417
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,640
fast horses

418
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,120
and make it there
for Master Guo's birthday feast.

419
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,120
Mr. Ning,

420
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,000
it's...

421
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,680
All right, then.

422
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,000
You can get some rest

423
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,280
in the backyard.

424
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,360
Linyuan!

425
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,060
- Yes, Master.
- Hurry now.

426
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,440
Please attend to them

427
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,880
and bring them to the backyard.

428
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,520
Yes, Master.

429
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,360
All right.

430
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,180
Please come this way,

431
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,360
everyone.

432
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,360
Zijie, stop pacing around.

433
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,640
You're making me dizzy.

434
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,920
What is taking him so long?

435
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,240
Don't worry about that for now.

436
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,200
Sit down for a while.

437
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,480
Do you notice

438
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,840
that Mr. Ning

439
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,760
is hiding something?

440
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,600
Why?

441
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,380
Is there anything suspicious?

442
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,760
Can't you tell?

443
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,040
It's a huge house.

444
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,340
But he only has one servant.

445
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,440
Don't you find it weird?

446
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,720
Besides,

447
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,680
Mr. Ning

448
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,560
was lying.

449
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,520
Lying?

450
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,120
He is old

451
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,120
and his headache requires acupuncture.

452
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,120
It doesn't seem like he's lying, right?

453
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,880
He's old

454
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,720
with a headache.

455
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,960
Do you think someone like this

456
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,180
can ride a fast horse?

457
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
So you're saying

458
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
Mr. Ning is stalling us

459
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,800
on purpose.

460
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
It's hard to tell.

461
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,880
But

462
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,240
I always feel like wherever we go,

463
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,280
trouble follows.

464
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,440
It's just like what I used to read,

465
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,480
Conan.

466
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,520
What's a Conan?

467
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,860
The kid who always runs
into trouble wherever he goes.

468
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,000
This won't do.

469
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,940
I need to check it out.

470
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,900
Magistrate Guo,

471
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,780
please have some rest.

472
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,560
Where's your master?

473
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,940
Master is packing his things.

474
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,000
Please wait for a moment.

475
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,000
Magistrate Guo!

476
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,280
Have you counted them all?

477
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:04,960
Magistrate Guo!

478
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,080
Magistrate Guo, you can't...

479
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,840
Magistrate Guo.

480
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,560
Master.

481
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,320
What's this?

482
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:10,920
Mr. Ning,

483
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
what are you doing?

484
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,920
It's a gift I prepared
for your father's birthday.

485
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,960
Mr. Ning, that's too much.

486
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,120
No need to spend so much.

487
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,960
It is already a huge gift
to my father if you

488
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,220
could attend his birthday feast.

489
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,560
It's getting dark now.

490
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,580
We should head out now.

491
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,760
Let's wait a little longer.

492
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,060
There's no need to rush.

493
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,080
They don't look

494
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,480
too happy.

495
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,760
Master,

496
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,200
we're still short.

497
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,560
How much?

498
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,360
About 100 taels.

499
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,240
What...

500
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,240
What...

501
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,080
What do we do now?

502
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,280
Did you bring money?

503
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,120
Do you have money?

504
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,600
Yes.

505
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,080
Lend some to me.

506
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,360
Mr. Ning,

507
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,280
use this first.

508
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,440
This...

509
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,760
If you're late,

510
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,800
you'll miss the time to pay the ransom.

511
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,640
Kidnapper?

512
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,760
You knew?

513
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,960
Saving lives is more important.

514
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,080
(Three days ago)

515
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,720
No.

516
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,360
Don't hurt Xian!

517
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,760
Prepare the ransom

518
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,960
or else I'll kill him!

519
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,560
Stop right there!

520
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,040
Or else I'll kill him!

521
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,720
No, don't.

522
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,320
Stay still.

523
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,720
Young Master.

524
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,140
What...

525
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,400
Master.

526
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,400
This...

527
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,680
Let's go inside and check.

528
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,553
I don't know.

529
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,266
Young Master.

530
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,820
Master. Did anything
happen to Young Master?

531
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,960
- Young Master!
- Young Master!

532
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,120
Young Master!

533
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,800
Xian!

534
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,440
Young Master!

535
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,860
- Young Master!
- Find him quickly.

536
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,000
Don't just stand there!

537
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,960
Where's Young Master?

538
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,680
Search there!

539
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,640
He's not here.

540
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,120
Master.

541
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,920
Why Young Master...

542
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,460
- Why is he missing?
- Where did he go?

543
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,300
How can he disappear into thin air?

544
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,180
He's not here.

545
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:25,740
Young Master!

546
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,640
Xian!

547
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,520
Hurry!

548
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,760
Prepare the ransom now!

549
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,160
All right.

550
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,360
Hurry up!

551
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,720
That's what happened.

552
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,000
After the kidnapper kidnapped Xian,

553
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,280
he disappeared into thin air.

554
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,000
Disappeared into thin air...

555
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,160
Is this another locked-room case?

556
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,000
So that's why you turned
down my father's invitation.

557
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,680
I'm sorry for doing this.

558
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,120
The kidnapper already

559
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,560
gave a final deadline.

560
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,520
If we don't raise the ransom by tonight,

561
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,000
he will kill Xian.

562
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,020
Why didn't you report this
to the authorities?

563
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,460
I supposed the kidnapper said

564
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,440
he would kill Xian
if Mr. Ning reported it.

565
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,080
Ning Xian is Mr. Ning's youngest son.

566
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,800
He's naturally kind and intelligent.

567
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,160
Master Ning has always been
very fond of him.

568
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,300
He didn't dare to report this
to the authorities.

569
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,800
I cannot

570
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,480
stay and chat.

571
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,320
I need to prepare the ransom.

572
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,360
Everyone,

573
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,400
please go home.

574
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,720
I sincerely apologize.

575
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,440
Mr. Ning,

576
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,960
I am, after all, the country magistrate.

577
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,760
How could I not do anything

578
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,460
when this happened
at the Ning Residence?

579
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,600
But...

580
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,000
Master! Master!

581
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,680
The kidnapper...

582
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,880
The kidnapper is here again.

583
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,320
The kidnapper.

584
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,240
Master, don't run.

585
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,340
Let's go check it out.

586
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,080
Where's the money?

587
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,960
Have you prepared it?

588
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,860
Yes, it's all prepared.

589
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,640
I have it prepared.

590
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,080
Now...

591
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,860
Stand right there.

592
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,840
Send the money

593
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,760
to the agreed location.

594
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,440
All right.

595
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,560
I'll do anything you say.

596
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,320
Where's Xian?

597
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,160
Where's my son?

598
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,240
Stop wasting time with him.

599
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,680
Arrest him!

600
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,360
Xian.

601
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,400
Xian!

602
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,520
Xian!

603
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,880
Where did he go?

604
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,240
Hurry.

605
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,480
Load the silvers to the cart

606
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,720
and send it to the outskirt.

607
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,200
Let's go.

608
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,800
Hurry!

609
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,520
How does someone

610
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,000
just disappear?

611
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,200
Where did he go?

612
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,880
The door was locked.

613
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,720
There's no sign of any broken windows.

614
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,480
I was right earlier.

615
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,220
It's another locked-room case.

616
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,000
Zijie,

617
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,630
we won't be able
to make it back in time.

618
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,600
What do we do now?

619
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,280
We have no choice.

620
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,140
We should go and take a look first.

621
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,600
(Ning Residence)

622
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,240
Go!

623
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,880
Let's go.

624
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,080
Hyah.

625
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,640
Hyah.

626
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,400
What is the hour now?

627
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,940
You should head back first.

628
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,640
I'll be here.

629
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,600
So don't worry.

630
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,600
Zijie,

631
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,320
I'll follow them and check things out.

632
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,840
No.

633
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,040
I told you

634
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,720
that I won't let you get hurt again.

635
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,120
It's just a kidnapper.

636
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,280
There's no need to worry.

637
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,920
Besides, there are so many people here.

638
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,160
Didn't you say

639
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,480
it's another locked-room case?

640
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,840
I'm worried

641
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,360
this matter is related to that person.

642
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,720
Then your father...

643
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,160
My father only wants me
to be a good official.

644
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,760
Mr. Ning

645
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,840
is my father's old friend.

646
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,720
If I go home like this,

647
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,500
what would he think of me?

648
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,320
Are you still the Guo Zijie
I know from back then?

649
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,880
You're different now.

650
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,540
Good thing we're not far
from the outskirts.

651
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,820
Let's see if we can make it back

652
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,080
before the feast starts.

653
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,200
Xuanxuan.

654
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,720
When we return home,

655
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,920
I'll talk to my father

656
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,000
about completing our marriage.

657
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,840
I don't know what you're saying.

658
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,240
Master,

659
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,120
please have some.

660
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,960
I'll have to trouble you

661
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,120
to attend

662
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,920
to the guests

663
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,160
on my behalf tonight.

664
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,960
No matter.

665
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,760
I'll do as you say.

666
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,960
Go

667
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,960
and get that box

668
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,760
from the cabinet.

669
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,240
Master.

670
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,240
(The Zhangs gave birth to a son, named Lu.)

671
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,520
(Hope the child can be adopted.)
Master,

672
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,960
do you really want
Young Master Zilu to take charge?

673
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,560
But

674
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,320
he is not

675
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,000
your...

676
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,240
Say no more.

677
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,120
Zilu may not be my birth son.

678
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,720
But I already

679
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,960
see him as my own.

680
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,320
I am aware of the things

681
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,560
he did to Zijie.

682
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,800
If

683
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,200
I hand it over to Zijie,

684
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
will Zilu

685
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,600
let Zijie be?

686
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
Master,

687
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,480
you still need
to consider this carefully.

688
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,880
Young Master Zijie
is smart and capable.

689
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,640
He also solved two mystery cases
in a row.

690
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,040
He is the only suitable choice
for Guo Residence.

691
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,800
Master.

692
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,360
If the guests found out

693
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,520
Young Master Zilu's true background,

694
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,960
who

695
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,640
wouldn't have objections?

696
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,760
Say no more.

697
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,120
I've already made up my mind.

698
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,040
Take this

699
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,800
and burn it.

700
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,160
From now on,

701
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,720
there is no difference

702
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,360
between biological and adopted children.

703
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,440
But Master...

704
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,160
All right, Master.

705
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,720
Mr. Ning,

706
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,560
is this the place the kidnappers chose

707
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,440
for the exchange?

708
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,560
Yes.

709
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,520
That's weird.

710
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,880
He didn't take the ransom

711
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,920
when it was right there.

712
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,920
But he did the exchange
at a specific place.

713
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,500
He might have a trick up his sleeve.

714
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,200
Don't worry.

715
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,880
I'm not that foolish.

716
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,360
What if he doesn't release Xian

717
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,280
after I give him the money?

718
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,960
What will happen to Xian?

719
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,940
I don't think this is just
ordinary ransom money.

720
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,360
Mr. Ning,

721
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,640
do you have any enemies?

722
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,960
Not that I know of.

723
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,280
I

724
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,720
never do

725
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,960
anything inhumane.

726
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,560
If others show me respect,

727
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,500
I will show them even more in return.

728
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,560
