Let's

55
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,420
go

56
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,540
one by one.

57
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,180
Who shall I kill first?

58
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,220
He Chun.

59
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:50,940
Yes.

60
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,860
You're the most skilled in martial arts.

61
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,820
If I kill you,

62
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,260
everyone will feel at ease.

63
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,140
Kill!

64
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,380
Kill me!

65
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,740
Come on!

66
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,660
Someone,

67
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,340
kill He Chun.

68
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,100
Zhou Qin.

69
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,340
Zhou Qin!

70
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,580
You know

71
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,060
I did all this.

72
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,920
If you want to kill someone,
kill me first!

73
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,540
Zijie!

74
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,220
The loser

75
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,540
wants to be a hero.

76
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,460
Alright.

77
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,900
I'll give you this opportunity today.

78
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,380
- Let him go!
- Let him go!

79
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,860
No!

80
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,180
Zijie.

81
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,220
Are you scared?

82
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,527
You can't behead Magistrate Guo.

83
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:44,090
- Magistrate Guo!
- Magistrate Guo!

84
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,660
Yan City's magistrate, Guo Zijie...

85
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,360
- You can't kill Magistrate Guo.
- You can't kill Magistrate Guo.

86
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,700
Shall now be beheaded.

87
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,740
No!

88
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,220
Let him go!

89
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,060
Zijie!

90
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,860
Young Master!

91
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,660
Zijie!

92
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,420
Young Master!

93
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,740
You can't kill him!

94
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,540
Magistrate Guo!

95
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,260
You can't kill him!

96
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,140
Let me go.

97
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,900
Let me go!

98
00:05:10,898 --> 00:05:11,923
Magistrate Guo!

99
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,900
Grand Mentor Zhou.

100
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,900
Magistrate Guo can't die.

101
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,060
My family

102
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,820
is all indebted to Magistrate Guo.

103
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,140
He's a good man.

104
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,060
Grand Mentor Zhou.

105
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,860
Magistrate Guo can't die.

106
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,900
You're useless.

107
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,740
We can't kill him!

108
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,740
I'll do it myself!

109
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,860
Grand Mentor Zhou.

110
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,500
No!

111
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,460
Zijie!

112
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,780
Sir!

113
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,780
Zijie!

114
00:05:32,134 --> 00:05:38,360
- Don't kill him!
- Don't kill him!

115
00:05:39,436 --> 00:05:42,192
- Don't kill him!
- Don't kill him!

116
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:49,283
- Don't kill him!
- Don't kill him!

117
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:52,345
We can't kill Magistrate Guo!

118
00:05:55,225 --> 00:05:56,319
Magistrate Guo!

119
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,192
Zijie!

120
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Magistrate Guo!

121
00:06:00,803 --> 00:06:07,440
- Don't kill him!
- Don't kill him!

122
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,741
- Let him go!
- Let him go!

123
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,380
Keep an eye on them.

124
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,020
Zijie.

125
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,220
Ignorant people

126
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,460
deserve death.

127
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,580
Kill.

128
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,660
Kill them!

129
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,860
Zhou Qin.

130
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,940
Come at me!

131
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,260
Let them go!

132
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,980
You want to die?

133
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,180
Don't worry.

134
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,740
None of you

135
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,980
can leave here alive today.

136
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
I want you

137
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,460
to watch them die.

138
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,380
Kill!

139
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,980
Lord Su.

140
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,300
Did you see this?

141
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,940
You're really stupid.

142
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,300
What's the point

143
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,860
of letting your people

144
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,660
put up a useless fight?

145
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,980
Do you think
a disorganized group like you

146
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,780
can defeat me?

147
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,660
Dream on!

148
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,700
Lord Su.

149
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,660
We came late.

150
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,540
Go!

151
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,380
Take Lord Su away!

152
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,420
Hurry!

153
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,740
Evacuate quickly.

154
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,420
Zhou Qin!

155
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,380
Don't run.

156
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,220
Zhou Qin.

157
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,060
Magistrate Guo.

158
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,060
Are you alright?

159
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,180
Are you alright?

160
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:07,740
I'm fine.

161
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,220
Good.

162
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:08,780
Are you okay?

163
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,200
I'm fine.

164
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,660
Lord Su is in danger.

165
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,940
This is not the place to talk.

166
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,720
Let's go after them.

167
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:25,940
Sir.

168
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:26,940
Sir.

169
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,620
Look.

170
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,300
Sir.

171
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,500
I have it too.

172
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,180
Looks like Zhou Qin's lair

173
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,420
is nearby.

174
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,140
No.

175
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,380
The number of these iron tools is wrong.

176
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,780
And these gunpowder.

177
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,140
Their musketeers alone

178
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,260
can't use these.

179
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,180
I think something must be wrong.

180
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,380
What do you mean?

181
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,500
Young Master.

182
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,140
It's too dangerous.

183
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,000
Should we wait for reinforcements first?

184
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,980
There's no time.

185
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,620
No matter what,

186
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,340
we must end this with him today.

187
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,580
And we must

188
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,660
save Lord Su.

189
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,180
Zhou Qin

190
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,140
is too abominable.

191
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,020
We're not scared of him.

192
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,100
That scum.

193
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,980
Let's fight him today.

194
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,020
- Yes.
- Yes.

195
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,420
Everyone.

196
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,060
Calm down.

197
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,260
This is dangerous.

198
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,300
You can't go.

199
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,940
And Zhou Qin still has followers.

200
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,460
You can't defeat him.

201
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,980
Go back to Yan City first.

202
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,260
How can we do that?

203
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,180
Miss Xuanxuan.

204
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,300
Everyone.

205
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,100
Go back and help me appease the people.

206
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:19,820
I'll leave it

207
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,780
to you two.

208
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,980
Take good care of them.

209
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,400
Yes.

210
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,530
Be careful on your way back.

211
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:24,980
Don't worry.

212
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,060
Let's go.

213
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,220
Young Master.

214
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,060
Miss Xuanxuan.

215
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,500
Trust Magistrate Guo.

216
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,140
Miss Xuanxuan.

217
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,940
Young Master.

218
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,260
Be careful!

219
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,780
Zijie, look.

220
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,460
This should be it.

221
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,220
Alright.

222
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,220
No need to see me off.

223
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,180
Go back.

224
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,220
Xuanxuan.

225
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,020
You asked them to go back just now

226
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,260
because you were worried
about their safety, weren't you?

227
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,300
No need to worry about me.

228
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,460
I've recovered.

229
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,580
Capturing Zhou Qin

230
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,460
is a piece of cake.

231
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,340
Zhou Qin is targeting me.

232
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,220
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

233
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,820
He Chun.

234
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,060
Zijie.

235
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:08,980
Mr. Sun.

236
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,180
Thank you for taking care of me
during this time.

237
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,820
I'm happy.

238
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,420
At this point,

239
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,380
are you still trying to be

240
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,060
the hero?

241
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,260
Ouch.

242
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,100
Yes.

243
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,700
No matter what lies ahead,

244
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,100
so what if it's a dead end

245
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,260
as long as the four of us are together?

246
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,340
We've spent

247
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,340
so much time together.

248
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,340
Don't you

249
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
abandon us now.

250
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,340
But...

251
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,980
I'm here.

252
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,660
Are you scared?

253
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,580
With you here,

254
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,040
what's there to be afraid of?

255
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,100
Let's go then.

256
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,740
Let's go.

257
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,140
Be careful.

258
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,820
Your Lordship.

259
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,980
Lord Su.

260
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,380
That's dynamite.

261
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,660
Dynamite?

262
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,860
Zhou Qin!

263
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,300
You can't escape.

264
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,100
Get the hell out!

265
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,860
Cao Xuanxuan.

266
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,660
You're indeed good.

267
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,740
You figured it out.

268
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,060
But you're

269
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,700
a little late this time.

270
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,580
Since everyone's here,

271
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,940
let's play a small game.

272
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,820
If you want to save Lord Su,

273
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,220
you must find

274
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,340
the three keys I hid in this cave.

275
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,140
Otherwise,

276
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,980
there will be

277
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,020
one boom.

278
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,340
And none of you can leave.

279
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,660
Speaking of,

280
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,660
you only have

281
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,740
15 minutes.

282
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,220
He Chun.

283
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,820
Don't bother with that psycho.

284
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,940
Save Lord Su first.

285
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,620
Find the keys.

286
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,220
Your Lordship.

287
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,780
Your Lordship.

288
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,500
I found one.

289
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,580
Hurry. Bring it over.

290
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,380
It's here.

291
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:53,940
It's unlocked.

292
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,220
Key.

293
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,420
Here.

294
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:05,940
Be careful.

295
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,740
Take it slow.

296
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,620
It's unlocked.

297
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,820
We still need one more.

298
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,380
We only found two.

299
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,100
It's probably on him.

300
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,060
On him?

301
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,620
There's none.

302
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,740
Be careful.

303
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,780
Be careful.

304
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,420
Zijie.

305
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:07,580
I'm fine.

306
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,800
Hurry and help His Lordship over.

307
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,500
Sure.

308
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,660
Be careful.

309
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,020
Give me.

310
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,700
Be careful.

311
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:25,940
Go.

312
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,460
You've been fooled.

313
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,100
If you step out of this circle,

314
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,300
you'll die.

315
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,860
Look for clues first.

316
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,500
Alright, let's go.

317
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,780
Did you find anything?

318
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,860
Not yet.

319
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,740
Look again.

320
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,140
Xuanxuan.

321
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,180
Is this

322
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,060
the same as that lock?

323
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,100
Watch out!

324
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,140
Are you alright?

325
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,420
I'm fine.

326
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,540
- I'm fine.
- I'm fine.

327
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,540
The explosives on the scarecrow

328
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,540
should be connected.

329
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,660
Once removed in the wrong order,

330
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,660
it will explode.

331
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,300
Cao Xuanxuan.

332
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,540
You're indeed smart,

333
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,300
but you missed out on something.

334
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,660
Not only the imperial mausoleum,

335
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,980
but the entire Yan City

336
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,540
will be destroyed.

337
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,540
What did you say?

338
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,580
A year ago,

339
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,140
I laid explosives

340
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,460
all over Yan City.

341
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,500
When you came here,

342
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,500
Yan City was destined
to become a sea of ​​fire.

343
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,660
Today,

344
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,220
I want all of you

345
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,500
to die with me.

346
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,140
Thank you.

347
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,260
Thank you.

348
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,300
Please enjoy.

349
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,540
Congratulations.

350
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,640
It's you who should be congratulated.

351
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,020
We have a deal.

352
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,740
Although you're my ghostwriter,

353
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,540
all the profits from the new book,

354
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,260
including the one million yuan bonus,

355
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,300
are yours.

356
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,300
I believe your grandma will be saved

357
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,620
if you take this money.

358
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,820
Thank you.

359
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,260
I don't know what to say.

360
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,820
Really.

361
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,260
I really don't know what to say.

362
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,380
Thank you so much.

363
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,380
You wrote so well.

364
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,780
You deserve it.

365
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,460
What?

366
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,020
Zhou Na?

367
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,020
How is this possible?

368
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,860
What happened?

369
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:46,660
Alright.

370
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,300
I got it.

371
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,140
Friends.

372
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,620
The new book sales

373
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,820
of the two beautiful writers,
Wang Jing and Zhou Na,

374
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,840
are neck and neck.

375
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,140
Who will be
the Most Popular Mystery Novel Writer

376
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,660
this year?

377
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,420
Let's wait and see.

378
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,940
Come on, friends.

379
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,540
Count down with me.

380
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,420
Five.

381
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,420
Four.

382
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,740
Three.

383
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:20,940
Two.

384
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,340
One.

385
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,380
Here.

386
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,580
The result is out.

387
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,020
Congratulations to Zhou Na

388
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,180
for winning the Most Popular Writer.

389
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,380
0625.

390
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,540
1437.

391
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,100
What did you say?

392
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,860
There are seven scarecrows left.

393
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,100
Including the one that was blown up,

394
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,340
there are eight.

395
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,300
So I think

396
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,060
the number should be eight.

397
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,980
Cao Xuanxuan.

398
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,780
Zhou Qin.

399
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:32,980
Let me.

400
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,020
How did you know?

401
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,860
June 25th,

402
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,340
14:37

403
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,060
was the time

404
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,060
for Wang Jing's first book signing

405
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,580
and also the day you hated me the most.

406
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,980
How could you remember it so clearly?

407
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,820
It doesn't make sense.

408
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,100
There's no way
you can guess a number like that.

409
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,700
Zhou Qin.

410
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,380
Actually, you don't know

411
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,980
that I have read
every one of your books.

412
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,740
Every trick you devise

413
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,780
amazes me.

414
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,900
I admit

415
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,580
you're better than me in many ways.

416
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,780
Haven't you always
wanted to compete with me?

417
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,540
Haven't you always wanted to defeat me?

418
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,380
Alright.

419
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,620
I'm willing to compete with you.

420
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,900
What do you want to compete?

421
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,960
How shall we compete?

422
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,100
I'll go through with it.

423
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,740
But they

424
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,660
and the people

425
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,060
are innocent.

426
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,300
I beg you

427
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,620
to spare them.

428
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,700
Zhou Qin.

429
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,580
Let's stop here.

430
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,340
Stop here?

431
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,180
No.

432
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,980
Our story isn't over yet.

433
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,580
Do you know

434
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,420
I was so happy that I didn't sleep

435
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,700
when I got over a million readers?

436
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,260
Because

437
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,660
the most popular writer

438
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,780
will receive a million yuan.

439
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,940
But you!

440
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,460
You took everything from me

441
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,060
when your book hit the shelves.

442
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,140
Without that bonus,

443
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,820
I have no money

444
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,660
for Grandma's treatment.

445
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,540
All I could do was watch her

446
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,780
slowly die

447
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,220
in that hospital bed.

448
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,860
I had nothing when I was little.

449
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,980
Only Grandma...

450
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,060
Only Grandma

451
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,140
accompanied me the whole time.

452
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,100
Cao Xuanxuan.

453
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,140
I hate you.

454
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,420
Because you...

455
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,420
You

456
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,780
killed her.

457
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,900
Sorry.

458
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,820
I didn't know.

459
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,820
If...

460
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,180
No ifs!

461
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,860
I don't need your apology.

462
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,700
I will never forgive you!

463
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,540
Zhou Qin.

464
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,980
What do these

465
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,260
have to do with Xuanxuan?

466
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,620
Is that why you did what you did?

467
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,780
There's no need to tell him these.

468
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,460
He won't listen right now.

469
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,100
Come on!

470
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,420
Cao Xuanxuan.

471
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,820
I'll let everyone

472
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,300
die in front of you today.

473
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,580
I want you

474
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,420
to feel powerless.

475
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,300
I'll let you experience

476
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,540
what it's like

477
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,460
to lose everything.

478
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,540

479
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,420

480
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,620
No!

481
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,860
Zijie.

482
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,620

483
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700

Zijie.

486
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,100
It's alright.

487
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,380
It's alright.

488
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,140
Let's find a physician.

489
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,620
You'll be fine.

490
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,220

No.

496

Wait for me.

497
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,620
I'll find He Chun.

498
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,580
I'll wake them up

499
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,860

00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,140
Zhou Na.

578
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,820
I've been worried that I wouldn't

579
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,000
have time to say something

580
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,460
to you since you were hurt.

581
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,540
Although we're rivals,

582
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,460
I've always considered you
my best friend.

583
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,060
Zhou Na,
you mustn't let anything happen to you.

584
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:36,940
We

585
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,180
and your fans are waiting for you.

586
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,980
Book...

587
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,860
Book?

588
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,300
- Book.
- Book.

589
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,380
Yan City Diaries?

590
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,380
The book's here.

591
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,420
The book's here.

592
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,060
I know it's important to you,

593
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,480
so I carry it with me wherever I go.

594
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,120
We're just waiting for you to wake up.

Nana.

598
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,923
- Nana.
- Zhou Na!

599
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:08,585
Zhou Na!

600
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,829
Zhou Na!

601
00:34:09,901 --> 00:34:10,898
- Nana!
- Zhou Na!

602
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,940
Go get the doctor!

603
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,220
Go get the doctor!

604
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,220

Xuanxuan.

608
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,380
You're awake.

609
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,900
Why are you crying?

610
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,260
Do you feel unwell?

611
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,140
Zijie.

612
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,900
I thought I would never see you again.

613
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,580
Don't

614
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,420
leave me anymore.

615
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,060
Alright?

616
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,460
What nonsense are you talking about?

617
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,300
Haven't I always been here?

618
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,860
It's great that you woke up.

619
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,100
