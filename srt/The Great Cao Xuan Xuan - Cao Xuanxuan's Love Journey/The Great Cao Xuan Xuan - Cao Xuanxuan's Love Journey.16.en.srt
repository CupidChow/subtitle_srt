No need for an autopsy.

22
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,280
The deceased bit his tongue
to commit suicide.

23
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,800
There are no other wounds on his body.

24
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,440
It appears to be

25
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,640
a suicide out of guilt.

26
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,840
It would appear so.

27
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,560
This looks familiar.

28
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,440
I've seen this somewhere before.

29
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,880
I know the truth now.

30
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,480
The real culprit

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,960
is Keqin.

32
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,400
I found this out from their village.

33
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,600
Years ago,

34
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,080
Master Zhai adopted a child
whose parents had both passed away.

35
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,480
That child's father

36
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,040
was a Taoist priest.

37
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,960
By the looks of things,

38
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,920
Keqin is that child.

39
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,440
And the Taoist priest

40
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,480
is the Longhu Priest.

41
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,880
He did not actually die back then.

42
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
The Longhu Priest

43
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,280
once said

44
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,900
he had a grudge against Master Zhai

45
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,060
for stealing his wife.

46
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,320
Keqin killed

47
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,200
her adoptive father for revenge.

48
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,600
When the Longhu Priest realized

49
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,960
his daughter had committed
a serious crime,

50
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,480
he forged evidence

51
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,160
to implicate himself
and redirect all the clues toward him.

52
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Now,

53
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,600
to protect his daughter,

54
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,540
he has committed suicide out of guilt.

55
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,920
How about that?

56
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,400
You've lost

57
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,640
this round.

58
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,080
You've said all this,

59
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,720
but can you deduce
how Keqin committed the murder?

60
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,560
Once we apprehend Keqin,

61
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,280
everything will become clear.

62
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,400
Long He.

63
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,280
Let's go.

64
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,560
Zhou Shaoliang got ahead.

65
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,320
Don't jump to conclusions

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,320
before the case is fully resolved.

67
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,920
Any updates?

68
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,360
New information.

69
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,320
Multiple witnesses

70
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,720
saw Miss Keqin
at several of the locations

71
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,280
where Master Zhai's body parts
were dumped.

72
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,400
It looks like Zhou Shaoliang was right.

73
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,920
We've lost this round.

74
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,200
Let's inform Xuanxuan.

75
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,080
Come on.

76
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,760
Keqin.

77
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,840
Mingyue.

78
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,800
What's going on?

79
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,640
What's the rush?

80
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,440
There's no time to explain.

81
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,200
Leave now.

82
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,700
What are you talking about?

83
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,540
I don't understand.

84
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
I have no choice

85
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,520
but to tell you now.

86
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,840
The Longhu Priest
is actually your father.

87
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,720
He thought you killed Uncle Zhai

88
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,700
to avenge your mother,

89
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,040
so he took the blame for you.

90
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,320
The Longhu Priest is my father?

91
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,520
But

92
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,700
wasn't Master Zhai the one

93
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,000
who killed my parents?

94
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,960
They found a jade pendant

95
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,000
identical to yours on the Longhu Priest.

96
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,720
Mingyue.

97
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,840
Take care of yourself.

98
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,840
Try this.

99
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,040
This meat isn't fatty.

100
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,360
I can't eat anymore.

101
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,880
I've gained weight.

102
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,900
Afraid of gaining weight?

103
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,240
Then this is perfect for you.

104
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,700
It doesn't matter if you gain weight.

105
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,040
You'd be cute if you're chubby.

106
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,980
- Here.
- You have some too.

107
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,520
Magistrate Guo! Xuanxuan!

108
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
We were one step behind.

109
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,200
They've won this time.

110
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,600
Sit down and tell us everything.

111
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,320
Zhou Shaoliang has already deduced

112
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,440
that Keqin is the killer.

113
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,690
She's been taken
to the office.

114
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,490
My sources confirmed
that Zhai Keqin was seen

115
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,540
at the locations
where the body parts were dumped.

116
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,880
So Zhou Shaoliang might
really have won this time.

117
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,640
Zhai Keqin?

118
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,640
Zhai Keqin

119
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,280
is the daughter of the Longhu Priest.

120
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,480
He likely took the blame

121
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,560
to protect her.

122
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:18,880
Also,

123
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,760
the Longhu Priest has already
committed suicide

124
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,580
by biting his tongue.

125
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,560
I've examined the body.

126
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,840
It's nothing unusual about it.

127
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,720
Has she confessed?

128
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,700
Zhou Shaoliang is interrogating her now.

129
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,520
If that's the case,

130
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,680
she's probably guilty.

131
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Zhou Shaoliang detained Keqin.

132
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,260
He likely doesn't want us
to hear the interrogation.

133
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,400
Here's what we'll do.

134
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Eat something first,

135
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,800
then keep an eye on things for us.

136
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,400
We'll head over now.

137
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,840
We can't let Zhou Shaoliang win
this one.

138
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,240
I've lost my appetite.

139
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,480
Zhai Keqin.

140
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,600
Did you murder Master Zhai?

141
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,320
No, it wasn't me.

142
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,880
Not you?

143
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,220
When you learned that Master Zhai
wasn't your biological father

144
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,160
but the one who killed your mother,

145
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,080
you used cruel methods to murder him,

146
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,600
didn't you?

147
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,560
Yes,

148
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,400
but I only planned it.

149
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,120
I didn't actually carry it out.

150
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,400
I...

151
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,320
I don't even know what happened.

152
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,360
Stop pretending to be clueless.

153
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,320
Speak!

154
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,760
Where were you

155
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,960
on the night of the murder?

156
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,120
I...

157
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,440
Official Zhou, please continue.

158
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,240
I'm here under Magistrate Guo's orders
to observe the interrogation.

159
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,040
Go on.

160
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,620
That night,
I was at the residence the entire time

161
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,560
and never left.

162
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,760
The maids

163
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,720
and Mingyue

164
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,760
can vouch for me.

165
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,840
And

166
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,280
Mr. Shangshan, too.

167
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,200
Don't think you can get away with this

168
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,760
just because you won't confess.

169
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,760
It really wasn't me.

170
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,160
Actually,

171
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,660
I was planning to hang myself
after taking revenge.

172
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,560
It would've been my way of repaying him
for raising me all these years.

173
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,600
Long He.

174
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,680
Take her away.

175
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,900
Interrogate her thoroughly.

176
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,240
Let's see how long

177
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,440
you can keep this up.

178
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,680
Sir! Sir...

179
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,280
Wait!

180
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,240
Wait!

181
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,720
Wait...

182
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,440
Sir.

183
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,480
Is it true

184
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,400
that the Longhu Priest is my father?

185
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,040
I beg you,

186
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,280
let me see him one last time.

187
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,680
Please!

188
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,040
Sir.

189
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,560
- Just one last time!
- Take her away.

190
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,680
Sir, please!

191
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,520
Let me see him one last time!

192
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,280
Sir...

193
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Sir...

194
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,140
(Yan Administrative Office)

195
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,840
He Chun!

196
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,960
He Chun.

197
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,640
I need your help with something.

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,640
What is it?

199
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,960
Can you take another look

200
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,880
at Master Zhai's body?

201
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,920
Sure.

202
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,480
But the body has been stored
for a while now.

203
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,200
I'm not sure if we can find
any more clues.

204
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:57,720
Well,

205
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,680
we'll need to trouble you.

206
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,280
All right. You two carry on.

207
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,440
Strange.

208
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,160
Why is the head less decomposed

209
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,040
than the rest of the body?

210
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
Xuanxuan! Zijie!

211
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,680
I've been looking for you all day.

212
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,720
What's the matter?

213
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,920
How's your investigation going?

214
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,200
We've checked.

215
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,080
Master Zhai's head is decomposing

216
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,560
at a different rate than his limbs.

217
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,040
Different decomposition rates?

218
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,800
Yes.

219
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,720
I've got it.

220
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,640
The killer is trying to create an alibi.

221
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,400
That's right!

222
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,820
But something still doesn't add up.

223
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,880
Shangshan told me

224
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,360
Zhai Keqin faints

225
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,680
at the sight of blood.

226
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,920
If that's true,
she couldn't be the killer.

227
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,480
Hold on.

228
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,220
Zhou Shaoliang is taking the case file
back to the capital tomorrow.

229
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,320
If she gets convicted,

230
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,100
Zhai Keqin will surely be executed.

231
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,320
We can't let that happen!

232
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,020
We can't let him
execute the wrong person.

233
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,690
I'll go to the administrative office

234
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:48,740
to find Zhou Shaoliang.

235
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
I'll go with you.

236
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,640
That won't be necessary.

237
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,560
You three head to the Zhai Residence.

238
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
I'll meet up with you

239
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,680
once I've handled this.

240
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,200
All right.

241
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,360
Fine.

242
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,320
I'll go with you, Zijie.

243
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,280
Xuanxuan.

244
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,000
Look at this.

245
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,000
I found it in Master Zhai's mouth.

246
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,840
I don't know what it is yet,

247
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,200
but I'll let you know

248
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,320
once I've figured it out.

249
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,560
All right.

250
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,640
Keqin.

251
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,800
I'll ask you one last time.

252
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,340
What was your method
for committing the crime?

253
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,720
I don't know.

254
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,840
Even if you refuse to tell me,

255
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,800
I can still convict you

256
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,360
based on the evidence.

257
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,420
Do you understand that?

258
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,920
Long He.

259
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,960
Take Keqin to the dungeon

260
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,740
and prepare for her execution.

261
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,360
Yes, sir.

262
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,440
Wait!

263
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,520
She isn't the killer.

264
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,200
The evidence is clear.

265
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,420
What doubts could there be?

266
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,120
Are you refusing to accept defeat,

267
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,360
Magistrate Guo?

268
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,080
You claim she isn't the killer.

269
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,880
Then, tell us who is.

270
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,920
I don't know

271
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,000
who the killer is yet.

272
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,520
But a life is at stake here.

273
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,020
This isn't about winning or losing.

274
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,520
The killer's method

275
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,640
hasn't even been clarified.

276
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,340
How can you claim
the evidence is conclusive?

277
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,720
Are you suggesting

278
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,120
that you know
how the killer committed the crime?

279
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,440
Yes.

280
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,440
Fine.

281
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,960
Long He.

282
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,320
Take Keqin to the side hall

283
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,800
and await further instructions.

284
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,720
But...

285
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,480
Sir...

286
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,280
Just do it.

287
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,480
Understood.

288
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,720
Get up.

289
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,680
Magistrate Guo.

290
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,460
I'll give you 15 minutes.

291
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,120
I'm eager to hear about

292
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,400
how the killer committed the crime.

293
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,240
Magistrate Guo.

294
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,080
The body parts were dumped far apart,

295
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
and the timeline is tight.

296
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,040
How could the killer have managed it?

297
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,080
Let's hear your brilliant deduction.

298
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,240
A few nights ago,

299
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,160
Master Zhai, who had been away for days,

300
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,240
suddenly returned home

301
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,440
in a sedan chair.

302
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,120
Not long after arriving,

303
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,960
he left again in the same chair.

304
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,960
Shortly after that,

305
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
he disappeared near the Zhai Residence.

306
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,200
Early the next morning,

307
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,320
someone found his severed arm

308
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,080
7.5 kilometers away.

309
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,900
The journey from the Zhai Residence

310
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,200
to the dumping site

311
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,080
would take at least half an hour.

312
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,320
So it takes an hour
to go there and back.

313
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,040
This means the killer

314
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,960
couldn't have been

315
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,780
inside the Zhai Residence at the time.

316
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,680
But I'm saying

317
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
the killer was inside
the Zhai Residence.

318
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,840
Magistrate Guo.

319
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,520
Do you hear yourself?

320
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,240
Are you not contradicting yourself?

321
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,960
How could the killer have managed that?

322
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,080
What, did they fly there?

323
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,760
That's the brilliance of this killer.

324
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,320
Most people assume

325
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,160
the killer would first murder the victim

326
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,720
and then dismember the body.

327
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,880
But this killer used reverse logic

328
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,240
and fooled us completely.

329
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,000
The victim

330
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,600
was dismembered first

331
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,800
and then killed.

332
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,080
That is absurd.

333
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,240
How is that even possible?

334
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,920
Do you mean...

335
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,600
You've guessed it, Official Zhou.

336
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,680
Master Zhai was dismembered first.

337
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,520
The killer preemptively
severed his limbs

338
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,160
and sent them to the dumping sites.

339
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,760
Leaving only the torso and head intact.

340
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,720
If the bleeding was stopped in time,

341
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,360
he wouldn't have died from it.

342
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
This means

343
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,920
that the Master Zhai seen
at Zhai Residence that night

344
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,240
wasn't a complete person.

345
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,720
That's why the killer used a sedan chair

346
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,400
to transport Master Zhai in and out.

347
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,960
After leaving the Zhai Residence,

348
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,540
the killer ordered the sedan bearers

349
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,760
to hide Master Zhai.

350
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,000
When everyone else came out to check,

351
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,120
the killer mingled
with the crowd and slipped

352
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,980
back into the Zhai Residence unnoticed.

353
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,440
Master!

354
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,980
The next day,
when the dismembered body parts

355
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,320
were discovered,

356
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,140
and everyone believed

357
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,000
Master Zhai had been killed
and dismembered,

358
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,860
the killer then killed Master Zhai
for real.

359
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,440
Then, calmly and methodically

360
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,560
dealt

361
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,360
with the head

362
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,800
and torso.

363
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,720
How despicable!

364
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,040
Magistrate Guo.

365
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,480
Are you saying

366
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,600
that the killer was actually

367
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,840
with the Master Zhai
the butler saw that night?

368
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,160
Correct.

369
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,600
Someone claimed

370
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,460
they saw Master Zhai lift
the curtain of the sedan chair.

371
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,240
But

372
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,920
how could a man without arms

373
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,520
possibly lift a curtain?

374
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,360
I deduce

375
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,320
that Master Zhai was coerced

376
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,920
and forced to cooperate with the killer

377
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,800
to stage

378
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,440
this twisted scene.

379
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,240
Wait.

380
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,680
If the arms were cut off

381
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,640
and only the torso and head remained,

382
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,080
but Master Zhai was still alive,

383
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,600
the decomposition rates
would still differ.

384
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,760
That's where
the killer's brilliance lies.

385
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,720
They used a method

386
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,760
resembling a forbidden ritual
from ancient legends

387
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,840
to dismember the body,

388
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,080
and then scattered the parts
to various locations.

389
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,600
They misled us

390
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,120
into believing the ritual
was their goal,

391
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,000
but in reality,

392
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,520
it was to hide

393
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,600
the differing decomposition rates.

394
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,160
We found traces of blood
in an abandoned temple

395
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,360
two intersections away

396
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,400
from the Zhai Residence.

397
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,600
This proves that the killer
hid Master Zhai there

398
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,680
after drugging the sedan bearers.

399
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,960
Clever indeed.

400
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,000
Magistrate Guo.

401
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,000
You've impressed me.

402
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,520
Still,

403
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,400
even if this method

404
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,680
is correct,

405
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,120
how can we prove

406
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,920
that Keqin isn't the killer?

407
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,840
We need to bring everyone
from the Zhai Residence

408
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,320
together

409
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,280
and interrogate them again.

410
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,600
All right.

411
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,960
We'll do it your way.

412
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,480
Long He.

413
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,200
Present.

414
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,860
Summon everyone from the Zhai Residence
for a private interrogation.

415
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,000
Yes.

416
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,440
Magistrate Guo.

417
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,080
Zijie.

418
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,440
We've got it.

419
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,040
Xuanxuan was right.

420
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,640
After the second interrogation,

421
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,080
Ouyang Mingyue confessed.

422
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,920
So, Ouyang Mingyue was the killer.

423
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,880
How did she confess?

424
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,800
We were all misled
from the very beginning.

425
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,720
Zhou Shaoliang discovered

426
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,640
that Master Zhai had caused the deaths

427
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,800
of a couple in his youth.

428
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,400
Out of guilt,

429
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,240
he adopted their child.

430
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,880
We believed

431
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
that Zhai Keqin

432
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,640
was that child.

433
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,660
But it was actually Ouyang Mingyue.

434
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,200
It wasn't just Master Zhai

435
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,620
who kept this secret deeply buried.

436
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,400
The two children were of similar age,

437
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,800
making their identities easily confused.

438
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,920
Ouyang Mingyue exploited this.

439
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,520
She even brought Zhai Keqin

440
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,820
to every dumping site

441
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,520
to shift suspicion

442
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,880
onto her.

443
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,920
I see.

444
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,120
If Ouyang Mingyue was the child,

445
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,360
then why did the Longhu Priest
take the blame?

446
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,200
What's his connection to Ouyang Mingyue?

447
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,000
Ouyang Mingyue used Keqin's identity
to approach the Longhu Priest

448
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
and claim him as her father.

449
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,760
He believed her

450
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,680
and took the blame to protect her.

451
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,160
These are just our speculations.

452
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,900
What about the evidence?

453
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,720
The evidence

454
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,560
is Zhai Keqin's jade pendant.

455
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,880
After it was lost and then recovered,

456
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,480
there were traces of blue dye on it.

457
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,920
I had it examined.

458
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,480
It matches the poison
on the hidden weapon

459
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,200
that injured Ouyang Mingyue that day.

460
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,400
This proves

461
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,520
Ouyang Mingyue

462
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,560
took the jade pendant.

463
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,200
Also, Keqin has

464
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,240
a birthmark.

465
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,080
I secretly investigated

466
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,720
and found that Ouyang Mingyue

467
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,960
had a fake birthmark
identical to Keqin's.

468
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,640
This confirms that Ouyang Mingyue

469
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,920
used the pendant

470
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,040
and Keqin's identity

471
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,880
to approach the Longhu Priest

472
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,440
and orchestrate everything.

473
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,040
But I still have one question.

474
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,280
If the Longhu Priest was the one

475
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,520
who injured Ouyang Mingyue,

476
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,520
then

477
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,400
that master diviner foresaw this.

478
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,800
Master diviner?

479
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,220
He's nothing more than a fraud.

480
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,400
But one thing bothers me.

481
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,600
Ouyang Mingyue claimed
to have witnessed Master Zhai

482
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,960
killing her parents.

483
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,560
How is that possible?

484
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,440
Xuanxuan,

485
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,400
don't overthink it.

486
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,200
Ouyang Mingyue has already confessed.

487
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,480
That's right.

488
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,320
The case is solved.

489
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,600
Let's find a place to relax.

490
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:29,880
Come on.

491
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,960
Cheer up.

492
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,120
She confessed.

493
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:39,800
Waiter.

494
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,000
Bring us a braised fish

495
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,760
and a plate of peanuts.

496
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,640
Go on.

497
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,960
Coming right up!

498
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,240
Would you like anything to drink?

499
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:49,760
Just

500
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,240
bring us four cups.

501
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,640
All right.

502
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,220
You didn't order any wine.

503
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,160
What are we drinking?

504
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
Who said there's no wine?

505
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,960
Isn't this the grape wine
that Xuanxuan brewed?

506
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,040
It's been a while
since I've had my wife's grape wine.

507
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,440
Here.

508
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,080
Your cups.

509
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,460
Didn't expect this, did you?

510
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,320
I even made

511
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
a trip back to get it.

512
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,200
Here.

513
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,240
- Cheers!
- Here!

514
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,680
Xuanxuan?

515
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,140
What's gotten into you?

516
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,280
Xuanxuan found out

517
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,040
that Sun Yi

518
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,760
and Master Zhang

519
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,880
are nowhere to be found.

520
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,120
And the painter is dead.

521
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,160
What?

522
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,920
Why didn't you tell me

523
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,120
about this?

524
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,480
I suspected those three before,

525
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,520
but now the leads point to Zhou Qin.

526
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,400
The three of them
are no longer relevant.

527
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,480
The thing is,

528
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,520
I don't quite understand something.

529
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,320
Don't you think something's odd

530
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,360
about Ouyang Mingyue?

531
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,360
Ouyang Mingyue?

532
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,880
But the evidence is solid.

533
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,880
There shouldn't be any issues.

534
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,720
That's right, Xuanxuan.

535
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,320
I think you've been overworking

536
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
yourself lately.

537
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,480
Don't overthink it.

538
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,200
Your food is here.

539
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,200
Here.

540
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,400
To another case solved!

541
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,080
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

542
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,720
This way, please.

543
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,600
This way.

544
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,440
Xuanxuan.

545
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,320
Why won't you drink with me?

546
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,640
Hurry up!

547
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,760
Let's fill that up.

548
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,400
Xuanxuan.

549
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,160
Fill it up.

550
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,280
I want to tell you something.

551
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,280
Did you know?

552
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,800
I've been an orphan

553
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,200
since I was a child.

554
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,400
I can't even imagine

555
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,240
what it would be like

556
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,120
for a four or five-year-old

557
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,560
to witness their parents die

558
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,720
in front of them with their own eyes.

559
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,280
Witnessed it with their own eyes?

560
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,000
That's impossible.

561
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
Didn't Ouyang claim to have

562
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
witnessed her parents' death?

563
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,480
Something doesn't add up.

564
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,800
She couldn't have seen it herself.

565
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,240
I know what's wrong!

566
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,480
Zijie.

567
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,680
Let's go home.

568
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,680
I've figured it out.

569
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,480
Sun Weiyan.

570
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,320
Get back to work.

571
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,480
Have a drink with me

572
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,420
and then we'll leave.

573
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,120
No more drinks.

574
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,800
Let's go.

575
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,160
Just one more...

576
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,920
Get up!

577
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,100
- Get up.
- Let's drink...

578
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,540
Come on!

579
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,920
I haven't had enough yet...

580
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,400
Let's go.

581
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,200
Where are we going?

582
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,360
- Home to drink.
- Home to drink.

583
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:02,900
(Zhai Residence)

584
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,520
The case is already solved.

585
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,160
What do you want with me now?

586
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
Calm down, Official Zhou.

587
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,760
Have a seat.

588
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,720
So much has happened in our residence.

589
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,800
We can't take

590
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,040
much more.

591
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,320
Be patient, everyone.

592
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,680
We've all overlooked

593
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,240
something important.

594
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,120
Bring her in.

595
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,360
Young Lady Mingyue.

596
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,640
I've told you everything.

597
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,000
What more do you want?

598
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,600
But what you've said

599
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,880
isn't the truth.

600
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,480
I saw him kill my father
with my own eyes.

601
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,240
What other truth do you want?

602
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,000
Are you sure you saw it
with your own eyes?

603
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,460
Yes.

604
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,590
But you were only four or five years old
at the time.

605
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,560
So what?

606
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,240
I'll never forget the hatred

607
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,240
of watching my parents killed.

608
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:04,840
Is it good?

609
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,800
I'll go make you some food.

610
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,120
Yue'er.

611
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,280
Father!

612
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,200
Yue'er.

613
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,360
I've missed you so much.

614
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,160
Did you miss me?

615
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,480
My little girl smells lovely.

616
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,340
Where did you get the money
to buy so much rice?

617
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,380
Your brother gave it to me.

618
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,940
He hired me to refine elixirs for him

619
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,020
and paid me for the work.

620
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,360
Don't get too close to him.

621
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,680
My brother...

622
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,040
We're family.

623
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,800
It's just keeping things
within the family.

624
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,760
Besides,

625
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,120
with this job,

626
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,120
my family

627
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,600
won't have to go hungry anymore.

628
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,120
All right.

629
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,640
Just make sure to take care of yourself

630
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,560
and come back early every day.

631
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,440
Sure.

632
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,440
Go on,

633
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,260
get some rest inside.

634
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,360
Okay. Let's go home!

635
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,320
Let's head inside!

636
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,500
My daughter smells so nice!

637
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,680
The elixir is ready, right?

638
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,120
Hand it over!

639
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,640
How do you feel?

640
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,840
I don't feel anything at all.

641
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,520
Could there be a problem

642
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,040
with the inducer?

643
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,800
That can't be right.

644
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:32,880
Look here.

645
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,480
It says

646
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,240
to achieve the best longevity effects,

647
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,240
the inducer must be

648
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,840
someone born

649
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,440
in a year, month,

650
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,920
and day of Yang.

651
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,200
Where am I

652
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,440
supposed to find such a person?

653
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,680
Someone born
in a year, month, and day of Yang.

654
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,640
I just remembered.

655
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
My brother-in-law fits the criteria.

656
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,080
But he's your brother-in-law.

657
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,160
And using a person

658
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,120
as a medicine inducer

659
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,520
would kill them.

660
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,080
Can your sister

661
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,600
accept that?

662
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,160
I don't care,

663
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,440
not if it's for the elixir.

664
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,880
This is what we'll do.

665
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,960
Today's batch turned out great.

666
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,400
You should

667
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,160
try it later.

668
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,360
All right.

669
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,360
Here's double your pay

670
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,520
for today.

671
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,360
We're family.

672
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,780
You don't need to be so generous.

673
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,440
You've already treated my sister

674
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,360
well enough.

675
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,360
She's never had to suffer.

676
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,560
Not at all.

677
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,900
What are you waiting for?

678
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,980
Hurry and help!

679
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,000
Quickly!

680
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,680
That's how it all happened back then.

681
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,520
All right.

682
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,160
As you said,

683
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,200
there were only three people

684
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
in the alchemy room.

685
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,760
Master Zhai, the Longhu Priest,

686
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,960
and your father.

687
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,320
Where were you?

688
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,560
I was hiding outside the window.

689
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,880
Those two scoundrels didn't see me.

690
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,840
That's how I managed

691
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,960
to escape.

692
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,280
If you remember everything so clearly,

693
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,920
do you recall

694
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,160
the alchemy furnace?

695
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,240
Of course.

696
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,400
The furnace had my father's blood on it.

697
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,880
I'll never forget that.

698
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,400
Can you draw it?

699
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,480
Of course.

700
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,880
Bring the ink and paper.

701
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,220
(Zhai Residence)

702
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,080
Is this the furnace?

703
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,360
The exact one?

704
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,920
The exact one.

705
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,280
Everyone, take a look.

706
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,360
This furnace

707
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,360
looks familiar.

708
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,320
I think so too.

709
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,240
I feel like I've seen it
somewhere before.

710
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,680
I recognize this furnace.

711
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,500
It's the royal alchemy furnace.

712
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,640
Three years ago,

713
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,640
before His Majesty
ascended to the throne,

714
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,860
the late emperor,
obsessed with Taoism and alchemy,

715
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,040
gifted this furnace

716
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,560
to Master Ge.

717
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,640
Master Ge's temple

718
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,320
is located over 50 kilometers
from Yan City in Liang City.

719
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,880
The late emperor

720
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,400
sent a heavily armed escort

721
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,080
to transport it from the capital.

722
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,660
That's right.

723
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,640
Now I remember.

724
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,760
When the furnace
passed through Yan City,

725
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,360
Mingyue and I went to see it.

726
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,480
That's right.

727
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,640
Master took the two young ladies there

728
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,520
to gain experience.

729
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,680
I also went along.

730
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,800
Make way!

731
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,760
Mingyue, look!

732
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,360
That furnace is magnificent.

733
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,100
Of course, it is.

734
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,320
That's the furnace
His Majesty gifted to Master Ge.

735
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,640
How could it be ordinary?

736
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,880
It's just a furnace.

737
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,680
What's so special about it?

738
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,800
You just said

739
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,120
you saw this furnace
with your own eyes.

740
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,640
But this furnace

741
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,720
only arrived in Yanzhou

742
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,760
three years ago.

743
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,160
How could you have seen it?

744
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,520
Right...

745
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,440
I heard that when alchemy

746
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,960
was prevalent over ten years ago,

747
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,640
saltpeter was used in the processes.

748
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,240
However,
the smell of saltpeter is pungent

749
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,200
and can cause dizziness and vomiting

750
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,280
when inhaled too much.

751
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,880
Even alchemists themselves

752
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,840
had to cover their faces
with wet cloths.

753
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,100
You were only four or five years old
at the time.

754
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,400
Why would your father take you

755
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,480
to such a place?

756
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,400
And in your memory,

757
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,720
you said you could clearly see
all their faces.

758
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,000
None of their faces

759
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,080
were covered.

760
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,160
Master was obsessed with alchemy,

761
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,480
and I know

762
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,680
a little about it.

763
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,680
Alchemy requires saltpeter

764
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,040
and demands extreme caution.

765
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,740
Not only must the nose and mouth
be protected,

766
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,820
but even the eyes

767
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,340
must be covered with gauze.

768
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,600
There have been many cases

769
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,460
of people being poisoned
by saltpeter fumes.

770
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,460
Master was always

771
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,520
very careful.

772
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,840
It's impossible for him

773
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,200
not to have taken
any protective measures.

774
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,120
But I saw them!

775
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,800
Human memory is fragmented.

776
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,520
If it's not coherent,

777
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,240
your mind fills in the gaps

778
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,940
based on your thoughts and concepts.

779
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,360
And if someone constantly

780
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,520
suggests ideas to you
during this process,

781
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,640
your brain

782
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,560
can create a false

783
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,040
yet seemingly real memory.

784
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,640
This technique

785
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,680
is called

786
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,200
memory implantation.
