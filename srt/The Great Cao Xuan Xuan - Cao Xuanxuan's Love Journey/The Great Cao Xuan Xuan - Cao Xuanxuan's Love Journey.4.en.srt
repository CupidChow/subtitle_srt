Father,

22
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,360
I heard you wanted to see me.

23
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,480
Zilu,

24
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,080
I heard Imperial Envoy likes
calligraphy and paintings.

25
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,680
Go to the study and pick a few nice ones

26
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,640
to send to the Imperial Envoy.

27
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,640
Father,

28
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,000
you were

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,600
never fond of dealing with officials.

30
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,960
Why would you want me

31
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,120
to send something now?

32
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,220
Master is worried
about Young Master Zijie.

33
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,960
Father,

34
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,600
in my opinion,

35
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,240
Zijie has his own fate.

36
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,720
If he's really foolish,

37
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,460
nothing you give
to the official will help.

38
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,800
Stop wasting time

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,040
and do what I say.

40
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,240
All right.

41
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,240
Calm down.

42
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,160
I will go

43
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,760
and get it done now.

44
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,880
Young Master Zilu,

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,760
this case

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,920
has not been solved yet.

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,600
Keep an eye on it.

48
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,640
Make sure he doesn't solve this case.

49
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,320
Rest assured.

50
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,920
He won't.

51
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,040
Everyone, please look at this.

52
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,560
Isn't this

53
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,640
an ordinary house?

54
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,060
What's so special about it?

55
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,720
It's...

56
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,720
It's...

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,980
Why does it look like this?

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,080
Sir,

59
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,680
people say

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,280
seeing is believing.

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,320
But sometimes, what we see

62
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,280
isn't the truth.

63
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,880
In certain situations,

64
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,760
we can experience optical illusions.

65
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,960
Optical illusions?

66
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,960
What does that mean?

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,420
I've never heard of it before.

68
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,160
Zhao Qiang,

69
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,400
you killed Fu Miao

70
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,360
and staged this entire scene.

71
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,960
I've never heard

72
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,320
of optical illusions.

73
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,880
You still won't budge, huh?

74
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,560
Fine.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,640
I'll make you admit it.

76
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,920
Sorry

77
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,180
for stealing your spotlight.

78
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,640
Well,

79
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,480
sir.

80
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,200
My child bride here

81
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,480
loves solving cases.

82
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,800
She overheard me

83
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,040
when I was deducing the case.

84
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,560
Zhao Qiang,

85
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,480
these pieces of board were found

86
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,600
by my men near the inn in the woods.

87
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,400
You stayed in that storage room
that night.

88
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,280
Are you going to say

89
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,160
you didn't notice

90
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,280
the house

91
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
was just some wooden board?

92
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,760
I...

93
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,160
Summon

94
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,760
the witness, Zhang Qin.

95
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,400
Greetings, sir.

96
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,040
You, animal.

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,800
Don't do it.

98
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,020
Xiaohua, don't be scared.

99
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,600
What's the matter?

100
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,080
Are you scared now?

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But that's not the only crime
you've committed.

102
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,240
You violated Zhang Qin,

103
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,780
and her daughter, Xiaohua, saw you.

104
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,880
You then planned to kill her
to cover up your crime.

105
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,960
You used the Fox Spirit as a scapegoat

106
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,200
to kill Xiaohua.

107
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,560
When that didn't work,

108
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,760
you framed your classmate, Li Ye.

109
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,640
You've taken two lives,

110
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,520
and you deserve to be executed!

111
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,120
Sir,

112
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,200
I'm innocent.

113
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,120
I didn't do it.

114
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,680
It was her.

115
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,800
It was this widow

116
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,040
who failed to seduce me.

117
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,280
So she's trying to frame me.

118
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,040
Nonsense!

119
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:24,960
Sir,

120
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,640
please seek justice for me.

121
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,120
Didn't you send

122
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,280
He Chun to follow me?

123
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,360
How could I possibly

124
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,520
harm Xiaohua

125
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,740
under her surveillance?

126
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,840
It's precisely you knew

127
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,960
He Chun was following you

128
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,120
so you exposed
your whereabouts to her

129
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,160
to clear yourself of suspicion.

130
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,760
That day,

131
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,440
He Chun saw you bought
four skewers of candied hawthorn

132
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,800
and gave them to four children.

133
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,920
But Xiaohua wasn't among them.

134
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,200
You

135
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,520
only had to take one candied hawthorn

136
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,600
off from every skewer

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,520
and stick them to a new skewer,

138
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,720
to make five skewers.

139
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,600
Then you used the candied hawthorn

140
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,800
to lure Xiaohua

141
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,080
into the trap

142
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,640
you had set on the mountain.

143
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,540
As for the evidence,

144
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,360
the old man selling
the candied hawthorn noticed

145
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,240
that he was one skewer short

146
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,880
after you left.

147
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,240
Sir,

148
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,240
it was only a skewer.

149
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,560
It cannot prove

150
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,960
that I took it.

151
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,200
Zhao Qiang,

152
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,160
I thought you had potential.

153
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,020
But you're nothing but a disappointment.

154
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,520
Open your eyes
and look who is behind you!

155
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,960
Xiaohua.

156
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,200
Xiaohua, don't be scared.

157
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,360
Tell me

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,720
if the one

159
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,560
who hurt you is here.

160
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,560
Don't be scared.

161
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,680
Don't be scared.

162
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,120
It's him.

163
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,080
Xiaohua.

164
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,720
Look

165
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,000
what I have.

166
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
It's candied hawthorn.

167
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,380
Do you want it?

168
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,860
You can have it.

169
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,440
Is it tasty?

170
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,700
Do you want to eat something else?

171
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,020
There are still plenty over there.

172
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,380
How about I take you to have some?

173
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,440
Let's go.

174
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,160
What a ruthless scholar.

175
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,360
Speak the truth now

176
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,160
or else

177
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,200
don't blame me

178
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,760
for using harsh punishment!

179
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,520
The truth is clear now.

180
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
I hereby sentence

181
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,360
the criminal, Zhao Qiang,

182
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,020
to be executed immediately!

183
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,540
(Order)

184
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,680
Why?

185
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,520
Why?

186
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,440
Aren't you and my husband close friends?

187
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,200
Why did you kill him?

188
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,680
That's right.

189
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,560
I killed Fu Miao.

190
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,800
He was just a poor scholar.

191
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,200
I promised I'd help him pass
the Provincial Examination.

192
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,000
But he reported me for cheating!

193
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,440
He deserved to die.

194
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,440
And you!

195
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,920
I never wanted to kill you.

196
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,480
But she saw

197
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,600
what I did to her mother.

198
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,240
I had no choice but to kill her.

199
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,200
You, animal.

200
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,240
You two.

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,960
I planned everything

202
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,360
so perfectly.

203
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,880
But you two saw through it

204
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,720
so easily.

205
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
Why?

206
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,680
I can't accept this!

207
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,960
Take him away!

208
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes, sir.

209
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,480
Move!

210
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,080
Get up!

211
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,240
Magistrate Guo,

212
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,760
you've changed my view of you.

213
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,240
Thank you, sir.

214
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,640
Master!

215
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,640
Master,

216
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,640
the case is solved.

217
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,480
The killer

218
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,480
is Zhao Qiang.

219
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,280
Really?

220
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,360
There's no mistake.

221
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,360
That Zhao Qiang

222
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,840
is going to the execution ground.

223
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,520
That's great.

224
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,520
That's great.

225
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,160
Young Master Zijie has made something.

226
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,840
Master.

227
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,120
This time,

228
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,800
you can rest assured now, right?

229
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,040
He did well.

230
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,720
This case was solved

231
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,680
thanks to everyone.

232
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,240
Here.

233
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,640
A toast to all of you.

234
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,880
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

235
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,760
Everyone, have a seat.

236
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,400
Eat up.

237
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,280
He Chun,

238
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,080
I always thought

239
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,880
you were only good at martial arts.

240
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,200
But

241
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,380
you really live up
to Mr. He's reputation.

242
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,800
You have

243
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,440
my respect.

244
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,520
Thank you, sir.

245
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,680
As for you, Xuanxuan.

246
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,080
I admit

247
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,000
that I never noticed this before.

248
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,600
But now I noticed

249
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,760
you seemed

250
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,880
to be pretty clever.

251
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm very capable.

252
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,480
Here.

253
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,640
A toast to you too.

254
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,160
Please, enjoy your meal.

255
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,320
You should enjoy it too.

256
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,600
Magistrate Guo,

257
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,560
what about me?

258
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,920
Well...

259
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,760
You...

260
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,200
You look in good spirits today.

261
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,600
Good spirits?

262
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,000
Well,

263
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,560
you are smart.

264
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,520
But you're a little sharp-tongued.

265
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,600
She's right.

266
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,920
Tell me.

267
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,960
Have you ever worked

268
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,940
on similar cases

269
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
like optical illusions

270
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,340
or a secret chamber murder?

271
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,440
We have never

272
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,520
had such cases before

273
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,440
Listen. The case

274
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
is already solved.

275
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,800
We're here to drink today.

276
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,800
So stop talking

277
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,520
about those weird

278
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,840
and incomprehensible things.

279
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
All right. Let's drink.

280
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,480
Waiter!

281
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,560
Serve the wine.

282
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,160
Coming right up!

283
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,120
Sir,

284
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,880
here's your wine.

285
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,480
All right.

286
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,440
Today,

287
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,480
we will drink

288
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,160
until we drop!

289
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:26,880
All right.

290
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,240
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

291
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,180
Drink until we drop!

292
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,860
(Guo Residence)

293
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,020
Young Master Zilu,

294
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,640
it doesn't hurt at all.

295
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,300
Young Master Zilu,

296
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,000
I don't know

297
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,640
how they solved the Fox Spirit case.

298
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,840
What is the use of keeping
you people around?

299
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,800
Go and prepare some gifts.

300
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,520
Why prepare gifts

301
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,520
at a time like this?

302
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,560
That fool has solved the case.

303
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,600
Don't I need to show some gesture

304
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,000
as his older brother?

305
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,240
What would that old man think of me?

306
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,160
I understand now.

307
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,480
Understand, huh?

308
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,000
Then why are you still here?

309
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,320
Yes, Young Master Zilu.

310
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,600
Get lost!

311
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,000
A bunch of good-for-nothings.

312
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,840
Xuanxuan,

313
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,080
perfect timing.

314
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,480
Come

315
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,980
and let's have breakfast together.

316
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,400
I feel something's off
about Zhao Qiang's case.

317
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
I want to find out more.

318
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,800
The case is already closed.

319
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,680
Stop overthinking.

320
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,680
Come on.

321
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,480
Go for breakfast.

322
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,840
Miss Xuanxuan.

323
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,680
I don't want to go.

324
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,960
Just listen to Young Master

325
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,160
and have breakfast with him.

326
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,720
Today is definitely worth celebrating.

327
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,580
And as for Zhao Qiang,
he's already dead.

328
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,440
Dead?

329
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,500
He committed suicide in prison.

330
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,120
Well, someone like him

331
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
should die like this.

332
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,840
Zhao Qiang has committed many crimes
and tried to deceive us.

333
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,730
We can see
how strong his mental resilience was.

334
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,560
So he wouldn't easily take his own life.

335
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,840
So,

336
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
we should have breakfast
and celebrate his death.

337
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,080
His death is that simple.

338
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Are you not interested

339
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,520
in having breakfast?

340
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,680
If you don't want to have breakfast,

341
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,000
I've got a friend

342
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,120
who brought back some

343
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,380
interesting stuff from the West.

344
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,580
Would you like to go see it?

345
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,560
(The case is already closed.)

346
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,280
(Should I make Guo Zijie write it down)

347
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,640
(in Yan City Diaries first?)

348
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,200
(Maybe I get to go home.)

349
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,440
Come with me.

350
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,080
What are you up to again?

351
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,600
Come and sit.

352
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,600
Where's that book?

353
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,880
What book?

354
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,960
Yan City Diaries.

355
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,540
(Yan City Diaries)

356
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,280
Did you write

357
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,560
all these?

358
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,280
I mean with such an impressive record

359
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,920
of solving the case,

360
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,360
it should be documented, right?

361
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,960
(It looks like)

362
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,920
(he is the only one who can write it.)

363
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,040
All right.

364
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,480
Keep writing.

365
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,480
About what?

366
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,120
(This fool looks like)

367
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
(he can only write)

368
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,440
(if he personally experiences it.)

369
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,080
(Good thing)

370
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,600
(I've memorized that book by heart.)

371
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:19,920
Write down

372
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,160
what I tell you.

373
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,240
Cao Xuanxuan,

374
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,840
what do you think this is?

375
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,160
Do you think
this is some street-side cheap novel

376
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,380
where you can throw
a bunch of nonsense together?

377
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,080
I'm not writing.

378
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,360
(Something is not right.)

379
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,280
(But the Fox Spirit case
was not written in that book.)

380
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
(It's a new content.)

381
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,500
(Does that mean only cases
that Guo Zijie went through)

382
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,980
(can be written in the book?)

383
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,480
(The classmate, Zhao Qiang.)
(Do I cause a butterfly effect,)

384
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,360
(changing Guo Zijie's experience?)

385
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,220
Do I have to wait for him
to finish writing everything

386
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,840
before going home?

387
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,600
I have a question.

388
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,640
How did you know Zhao Qiang's

389
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,600
timing for buying the brush
didn't match up?

390
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,720
I guessed.

391
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,440
Explain it.

392
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,400
All right.

393
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,720
Well, you see.

394
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,920
All the evidence pointed to him.

395
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,040
But he had such

396
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,080
a perfect alibi.

397
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,640
So that made me suspicious.

398
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,440
And since he dared to say

399
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,360
he bought the brush
from the Qian Family Shop,

400
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,040
it's possible he really did go there.

401
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,760
But it wasn't the time

402
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,920
he claimed.

403
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,980
Wasn't he worried
the authorities would check

404
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,840
and expose him?

405
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,040
With so many people coming
and going into the shop every day,

406
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,920
how could the shopkeeper remember

407
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,480
exactly which day someone came,

408
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,100
whether it was the seventh
or the eighth?

409
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,680
So he was taking a gamble.

410
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,400
He never expected

411
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,160
the brush he bought that day

412
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,800
was the last one in stock.

413
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,020
It's like justice
will eventually prevail.

414
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,000
How did you know

415
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,360
you could prove he was lying?

416
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,580
I didn't know for sure.

417
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,160
That was why I sent He Chun

418
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,120
to check both places.

419
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,360
I just didn't expect

420
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,120
to get evidence from both.

421
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,840
I knew you were pretending to be a fool.

422
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,160
Once you had He Chun investigate,

423
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,560
I already figured it out.

424
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,200
Congratulations
on cracking the case, Zijie.

425
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,720
Brother, you're here.

426
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,520
Zijie,

427
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,440
this is some fine silk

428
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,640
I had brought back
from Suzhou and Hangzhou

429
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,200
to celebrate your solving the case.

430
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,320
If you get promoted,

431
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,400
I'll arrange a proper feast for you.

432
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,680
Thank you, Brother.

433
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,080
You didn't have to trouble yourself.

434
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,640
I must say,

435
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,720
the case was so strange.

436
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,040
I never expected you

437
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,240
to solve it in only five days.

438
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,680
It seems my younger brother
is a genius at solving cases.

439
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,360
Brother, don't tease me.

440
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,160
Actually, it's all thanks to Xuanxuan.

441
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,560
I overheard

442
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,680
and repeated what she said.

443
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,320
Is that so?

444
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,840
There's a shop in the west of the city.

445
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,400
They're very good at telling stories.

446
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,680
I often listen to
the "Celebrated Cases of Judge Di".

447
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,960
I listen to every story there is.

448
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,620
The book has techniques
for solving cases.

449
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,810
So I picked up some knowledge.

450
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,780
It's an honor to be able

451
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,000
to help Young Master Zijie.

452
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,440
I see.

453
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,600
Zijie,

454
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,280
it looks like you have a fine wife.

455
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,500
By the way,

456
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,360
I suddenly remembered

457
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,080
that both of you have yet

458
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,520
to complete your wedding ceremony.

459
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,400
Why not take this opportunity

460
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,480
to pick an auspicious date

461
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,960
to complete the wedding.

462
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,480
Father is in charge of this.

463
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,560
Besides, we just returned home.

464
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,000
Look at me.

465
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,160
I got so carried away

466
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,640
I forgot about Father.

467
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,720
You're right

468
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,240
about letting Father decide.

469
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,240
Yes.

470
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,160
Since you just returned home,

471
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,160
you should get

472
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,240
some proper rest.

473
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,280
Then

474
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,560
I won't interrupt

475
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,040
your sweet moment.

476
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,020
I'll take my leave then.

477
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,960
Brother, take care.

478
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,640
Put down Young Master Zijie's gifts.

479
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,560
So?

480
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,480
I didn't give you away, right?

481
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,040
What do you mean?

482
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,320
You were pretending to be dense

483
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,600
to guard against him, right?

484
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,640
That's ridiculous.

485
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,960
He treats me very well.

486
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,000
See this brocade?

487
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,560
It's clearly high quality.

488
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,100
I bet you've never seen it before.

489
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,720
I don't care about things

490
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,880
between you two brothers.

491
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,080
Are you blind?

492
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,240
I'm talking to you.

493
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,320
Are you deaf?

494
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,600
We were moving
toward each other directly.

495
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,000
If I'm blind, are you blind too?

496
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,840
Cao Xuanxuan,

497
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,880
do you think you can win Zijie's heart

498
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,340
by hanging around him all the time?

499
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,500
You should take a look

500
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,780
at yourself in the mirror.

501
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,320
People who cling to men

502
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,840
aren't exactly well-liked.

503
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,640
Who are you talking about?

504
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,280
Don't go!

505
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,320
Zijie!

506
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,800
Zijie!

507
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,960
Zijie,

508
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,760
just now

509
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,280
Cao Xuanxuan bullied me again.

510
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,240
Can you speak up for me?

511
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,200
Sure.

512
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,600
Zijie,

513
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,520
we're about to get married.

514
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Don't tell me

515
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,760
you're changing your mind.

516
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,720
Young Master.

517
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,280
Young...

518
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,320
What's the matter?

519
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,440
Young Master,

520
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,160
Master wants to see you.

521
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,520
Father wants to see me.

522
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,240
I need to go now.

523
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,040
You can wait here.

524
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,800
But Zijie...

525
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,700
Young Master, this way.

526
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,160
Let's go.

527
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:35,640
Zijie.

528
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,680
Fu

529
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,760
keeps ruining my plan.

530
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,680
Son,

531
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,300
come and sit down.

532
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,000
Father, this is such a brilliant move.

533
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,440
How

534
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,120
about I play with you?

535
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,440
Forget it.

536
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,680
You're becoming

537
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,600
more impressive by the day.

538
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,400
This time,

539
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,880
seeing how you solved
the case brilliantly

540
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,320
was very satisfying

541
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,920
to me.

542
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,440
Father, you're flattering me.

543
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,240
This time,

544
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,800
it's all thanks to Xuanxuan.

545
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:12,960
All right.

546
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,320
But

547
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,800
now that things your case is settled,

548
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,520
we should also take care

549
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,760
of your personal matter.

550
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,640
You and Ying

551
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,080
should pick a good date.

552
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,720
Why?

553
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,520
You haven't picked a date yet?

554
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,880
Well,

555
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,320
parents' wishes
and the matchmaker's arrangements,

556
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
are just to marry someone
to be good to you.

557
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,900
You can just make the decision.

558
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,120
Ridiculous.

559
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,600
Father,

560
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,360
calm down.

561
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't even know what to say to you.

562
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,160
Never mind.

563
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,520
We will discuss this

564
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,640
next time.

565
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,080
There's something

566
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,800
I want to ask.

567
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,120
When you went to Zhao Village,

568
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,800
did you notice

569
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,960
anything unusual about Cao Xuanxuan?

570
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,200
What do you mean?

571
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,920
I only want to remind you

572
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,440
that I found out by accident

573
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,840
that Cao Xuanxuan

574
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,120
has an older sister,

575
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,680
Cao Yiyi.

576
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,560
They are twins.

577
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,520
They look

578
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,920
exactly alike.

579
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,160
Do you mean

580
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,160
Cao Xuanxuan changed after waking up

581
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,440
because she was swapped with her sister?

582
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,680
So it's Cao Yiyi, not her?

583
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,640
She's been around you the whole time.

584
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,920
Why are you asking me?

585
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,400
How would I know?

586
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,240
Just a reminder,

587
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,240
Cao Yiyi

588
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,000
has a crescent-shaped birthmark
on her back.

589
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,000
You figure it out.

590
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:33,880
Zijie,

591
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,640
come here.

592
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,760
Your mother repeatedly

593
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,800
told me

594
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,840
to pass it on

595
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,360
to your future wife.

596
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,320
You should keep

597
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,760
it safe now.

598
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,640
That's not right.

599
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,120
Father,

600
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,640
Brother is the eldest son.

601
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,760
This should be kept
for the eldest daughter-in-law.

602
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,840
Just take it when I tell you so.

603
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,140
Thank you, Father.

604
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,840
You can get back to your business.

605
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,880
That bracelet

606
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,760
was left by your mother.

607
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,600
It was promised to the future head
of the household's wife.

608
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,200
Do you really think

609
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,040
your father might want Guo Zijie

610
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,960
to inherit the family business?

611
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,120
Young Master Zilu,

612
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,160
you're not worse than that fool.

613
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:02,440
He...

614
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:02,920
Shut up!

615
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,200
He Chun,

616
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,480
where are you going?

617
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,820
This is the wooden board
we found earlier.

618
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,000
I'll go and take care of it.

619
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,080
Let me see.

620
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,680
To be able to paint

621
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,500
such a realistic house on a wooden board

622
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,880
creates an optic illusion.

623
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,600
Do you have

624
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,920
any realist artists here?

625
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Realist artist?

626
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
If you put it that way,

627
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
there's a famous

628
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,120
Western artist

629
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,500
on the outskirts of the city.

630
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,040
The paper,

631
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,320
ink, and brushes he uses

632
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,800
are special.

633
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,400
Wealthy young ladies

634
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,040
often go to him

635
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,040
for portraits.

636
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,840
He can really make them come to life.

637
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,520
I know that artist.

638
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,520
Do you suspect

639
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,200
Zhao Qiang had an accomplice?

640
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,080
I'm sure he couldn't

641
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,100
come up
with such a tricky plan by himself.

642
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,080
I'll go and meet that artist.

643
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:12,960
Maybe

644
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,160
I can find some answers.

645
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,380
Then I leave this matter to both of you.

646
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,180
No problem at all.

647
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,180
Just go.

648
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,360
Can I

649
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,360
have a sip of water?

650
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,200
It's wine.

651
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,920
Move aside!

652
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,900
Are you all right, mister?

653
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,480
What's wrong?

654
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm so sorry.

655
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,920
I'm sorry, mister.

656
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,000
Are you hurt?

657
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,640
I'm fine.

658
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,280
Let me help you.

659
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,240
Are you all right?

660
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,200
Don't go too fast later.

661
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,640
All right.

662
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,560
Be more careful later!

663
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,680
I will.

664
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,600
This way.

665
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:01,880
You're fine.

666
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,700
Your vital points aren't injured.

667
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,800
You're not the one injured.

668
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,000
Of course, you don't feel pain.

669
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,520
You...

670
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,280
I'm in a lot of pain now.

671
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:11,880
Get up.

672
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,280
We need to keep going.

673
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,520
I'm injured.

674
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,360
Wait for me.

675
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,160
Hurry up.

676
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,560
How can I walk fast

677
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,000
when I'm injured?

678
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,160
Get on.

679
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,920
I don't think that's proper.

680
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,840
Stop wasting time.

681
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,860
You're too slow.

682
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,400
I'm a man.

683
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,720
How can I let a woman carry me?

684
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,680
I said, get on.

685
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,640
The other hand.

686
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,500
This isn't something we see every day.

687
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,680
Why is she carrying him or her back?

688
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,280
Are you tired?

689
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,000
Actually,

690
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,000
you can be quite gentle sometimes.

691
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,520
Why is she carrying
that man on her back?

692
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:53,960
Keep quiet.

693
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,360
Look at that.

694
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,200
That's something new.

695
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,720
Why don't you put me down?

696
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,460
I think I can walk.

697
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,100
Stay still.

698
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,000
Put me down.

699
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I think I can walk.

700
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,080
You hurt your muscles.

701
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,480
So it will be hard for you to walk.

702
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,640
Come on. Put me down.

703
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,640
I just said you were gentle
a moment ago.

704
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,780
It's difficult to get along
with women and petty people.

705
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,640
Get up.

706
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,940
Up ahead is the stall
of a Western artist.

707
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:24,920
Hurry.

708
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,240
Jeez.

709
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,640
Wait for me!

710
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,800
I almost couldn't catch up with you.

711
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,360
Excuse me,

712
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,480
would you like a painting?

713
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,600
Mister,

714
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,200
did you draw these?

715
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:49,720
No.

716
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,640
A Western artist did.

717
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,560
He's ill.

718
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,840
So

719
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,660
I'm helping him to sell his paintings.

720
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,080
How about buying one?

721
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,000
Mister,

722
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,120
do you know when this

723
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,300
Western artist will return?

724
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,440
He told me

725
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,600
to watch his stall for a couple of days.

726
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,120
I think he'll come back

727
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,440
the day after tomorrow.

728
00:29:15,261 --> 00:29:17,220
(He's Apothecary)

729
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,080
Miss.

730
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,080
What's this?

731
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,520
This is...

732
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,080
Healing powder

733
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,900
to improve blood flow
and clear blood clots.

734
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,080
Thank you.

735
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:34,840
Then

736
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,160
what do you have there?

737
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,840
Are you ill?

738
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,360
I suffer from insomnia.

739
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,240
I can't sleep.

740
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840
I didn't know you would suffer
from insomnia.

741
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,400
Miss,

742
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,720
Guo Residence is that way.

743
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,600
We're too far.

744
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,520
How do we go back?

745
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,560
Then where do we go?

746
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,600
Miss He,

747
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,000
where are we?

748
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,960
Is this your house?

749
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,240
It's different from what I imagined.

750
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,320
Is

751
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,280
your grandpa not home?

752
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,800
He is in the countryside.

753
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,160
Let's make do

754
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,600
with staying here for the night.

755
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,320
But

756
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,640
there's only one bed.

757
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,080
How can we sleep?

758
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,360
You'll sleep in the bed.

759
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,200
How is that proper?

760
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,320
You should sleep in the bed.

761
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,440
I can make do.

762
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,160
Martial artists like us
don't care about this.

763
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,680
All right, then.

764
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,800
I'll see you tomorrow.

765
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,800
What's the matter?

766
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,320
What is it?

767
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,240
Who told you to blow out the candle?

768
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:23,960
I'm going to bed.

769
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,320
How can I not blow out the candle?

770
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,180
Don't blow it out!

771
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:26,900
Light it!

772
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,240
But I don't have a fire starter.

773
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,640
There's one in the cabinet.

774
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,280
What is this situation...

775
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,200
I can't get the fire starter

776
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,280
if you don't let me go.

777
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,720
Don't be scared.

778
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,920
Here, sit here.

779
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,520
I'll go and get the fire starter.

780
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,280
I'll be right back.

781
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,360
Is it at the bottom?

782
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,160
Yes.

783
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,560
Hurry up!

784
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,000
I found it.

785
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,800
Hurry up.

786
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,360
This fire starter won't light.

787
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,000
Why are you so stupid?

788
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,740
You can't even start a fire with it.

789
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,320
Say that again.

790
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,600
I'm doing you a favor here.

791
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,120
I didn't expect

792
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,160
a heroine to be afraid of the dark.

793
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,520
That's pretty adorable.

794
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,760
If you dare tell anyone about this,

795
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,280
I will kill you.

796
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,360
Fine. I won't tell a soul.

797
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,560
This thing...

798
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,480
It's not lighting up
after blowing on it.

799
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,480
What now?

800
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,640
Then...

801
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,000
Then

802
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,240
I'll just keep you company.

803
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,480
You won't be scared that way.

804
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,540
(Guo Residence)

805
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,360
What do you want?

806
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,400
Hurry up.

807
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,000
There you go.

808
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,680
You want me to write again?

809
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,020
I don't want to write.

810
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,760
I can't write
when there's no inspiration.

811
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,820
You have no choice.

812
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,600
Write it now.

813
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,960
I get it.

814
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,320
Are you trying

815
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,480
to help me sort out

816
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,360
the thoughts

817
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,400
for this brilliant work of creation?

818
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,520
I knew

819
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,640
you cared

820
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
about me.

821
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,160
Who says I care about you.

822
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,160
I've written

823
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,400
this one down.

824
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,080
You can copy word by word
into your book.

825
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,140
Then your book is complete.

826
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,200
(The principle of this case:
Optical Illusion.)

827
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,000
If you ask me,

828
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,680
you really need

829
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,860
to practice your writing.

830
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,320
Do you want to learn
how to write?

831
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,120
If you beg me,

832
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,160
I can teach you.

833
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,080
These are simplified characters,

834
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,200
not incorrect characters.

835
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,800
Simplified?

836
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,300
See for yourself.

837
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,600
It's either missing a side part

838
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,560
or a radical.

839
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,720
Simplified, huh?

840
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,920
I've never heard of that...

841
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,480
What would an illiterate like you know?

842
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,220
Just write it now.

843
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:15,720
No.

844
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,160
You...

845
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:16,960
I can't.

846
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,600
I can teach you.

847
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,680
Do you know how to write?

848
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,820
Write your name for me.

849
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,880
Mr. Sun, you're back.

850
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,320
Yes.

851
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,480
Tell us what you found.

852
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,040
Tell us.

853
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,360
I...

854
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,080
You can ask from here.

855
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,420
Why are you standing so close?

856
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,680
Please be seated.

857
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,320
Mr. Sun,

858
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,200
have you found that Western artist?

859
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,000
We found his stall.

860
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,840
But he wasn't there.

861
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,320
They said he'll come back tomorrow.

862
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,960
Tomorrow, huh?

863
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:48,840
Fine.

864
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,220
We'll check it out again tomorrow.

865
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,720
He is attending a banquet?

866
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,520
Yes.

867
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,880
He went

868
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,800
to attend Mr. Lyu's banquet.

869
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,800
Mr. Lyu had him painted
his portrait before.

870
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,520
He highly respects his painting skills.

871
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,880
You mean Lyu Bufan
from outside the city?

872
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,120
Yes,

873
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,600
that Mr. Lyu.

874
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,600
Do you know him?

875
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,640
I received his wedding invitation
yesterday.

876
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:13,960
But

877
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,160
we aren't close.

878
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,020
Since you've received the invitation,

879
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,600
people can get close over drinks.

880
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,360
We're not on the same page.

881
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,880
Forget about a wedding reception,

882
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,000
even drinking nuptial wine

883
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,360
can't change our direction.

884
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,640
If you help me this time,

885
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,000
I'll help you

886
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,000
with future cases.

887
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,200
All right, then.

888
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,760
(Lyu Residence)
Welcome.

889
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,880
This way, please.

890
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,560
Congratulations.

891
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,480
You're late.

892
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,160
Congratulations.

893
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,840
Feng, Li.

894
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,000
It's truly an honor

895
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,520
to have you here.

896
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,980
Please head inside.

897
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:57,920
Welcome, Wang.

898
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,200
So this is Lyu Residence.

899
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,120
Please come inside.

900
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,440
I'll catch up with you later.

901
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,800
Together, all right?

902
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:09,880
Hello, Lyu.

903
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,300
Oh, my! It's Magistrate Guo.

904
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,120
Congratulations.

905
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,090
Mr. Lyu, congratulations.

906
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:14,640
Thank you!

907
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,920
Hold these.

908
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,220
Gentlemen,

909
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,680
let me make the introduction.

910
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,680
This person

911
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,600
is the county magistrate of Yan City,

912
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,120
Magistrate Guo Zijie.

913
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,260
Magistrate Guo, how do you do.

914
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,320
Magistrate Guo,

915
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,000
this is Zhou Shui

916
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,920
and Zheng Si.

917
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,240
This one

918
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,320
is Mr. Luo Ji.

919
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,960
They're all my good friends.

920
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,800
This man is no ordinary person.

921
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,840
He's the palace favorite, Eunuch Wang.

922
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,820
Let's meet each other.

923
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,820
Greetings, Eunuch Wang.

924
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,580
Hua, show Magistrate Guo
and the others the way inside.

925
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,500
Magistrate Guo, please.

926
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,160
Serve him well.

927
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:49,440
Yes.

928
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,160
Magistrate Guo, this way.

929
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:51,960
Please come inside.

930
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,400
Magistrate Guo is finally here.

931
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,640
Hurry.

932
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,600
Magistrate Guo,

933
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,580
forgive me.

934
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,960
We don't have many guest rooms left

935
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,480
and there are so many of you.

936
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,920
Miss He Chun and I can share a room.

937
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,540
But...

938
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,400
That would work too.

939
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,040
Aren't you used to living alone?

940
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,200
Why are you...

941
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,440
I'm afraid

942
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,280
someone might have bad intentions.

943
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,560
I feel safer with you around.

944
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,680
By the way,

945
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,120
we've just imported
Dragon Spring Water here.

946
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,090
I'll have it delivered

947
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:22,960
to your room shortly.

948
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,280
Sure.

949
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,400
We can enjoy the hot spring?

950
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:24,860
Yes.

951
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,400
This way.

952
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,140
Let's go.

953
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,200
♪Like the setting sun,
which repeatedly sets in the west♪

954
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,900
♪My heart goes over mountains
