Guo Zilu.

23
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,680
(Take him in.)
Does this ring a bell?

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,400
What is this?

25
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,840
Father ordered

26
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,120
the butler to burn this.

27
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,560
He wants you to take over
the family business.

28
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,160
I never wanted
to take anything from you.

29
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,720
Impossible.

30
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,480
This can't be real!

31
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,840
You're all lying to me!

32
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,160
Only Father and the butler knew.

33
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
When you saw Father took it out,

34
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,000
you concluded
that he had given up on you,

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,200
and was going to let me
inherit the family wealth.

36
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,640
You'd even go after my life for that.

37
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,440
Guo Zilu.

38
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,560
Do years of family bonds as your brother

39
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
and your father

40
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,160
mean nothing

41
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,800
compared to the family wealth?

42
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,760
How did you find out?

43
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,200
All those years ago...

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,560
Father.

45
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,680
Zilu was...

46
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,280
What's wrong?

47
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,480
Mistreated?

48
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,200
Your brother

49
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,920
was brought to our family as an infant.

50
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,520
I've always seen him as my own son.

51
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,640
However, he doesn't share our blood.

52
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,160
Sometimes,

53
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,160
you should be more forgiving
toward him.

54
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,680
Father, are you saying

55
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,200
Zilu isn't

56
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,040
your son by birth?

57
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,280
Years ago,

58
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,480
our estate was flooded.

59
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,120
A farmhand couple

60
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,920
was washed away by the current

61
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,440
trying to save the crop.

62
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,520
I took pity on their only son.

63
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,520
So, I brought him home.

64
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,320
From now on,

65
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,520
you must treat him like a real brother.

66
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,960
Chin up.

67
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,120
Father...

68
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,600
I've been so wrong...

69
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,440
I've always known

70
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,120
I was adopted.

71
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,480
I've always feared that Zijie
would take over the family business.

72
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,000
Father, why didn't you tell me soon?

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,520
I could've avoided committing
such an unforgivable sin!

74
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,720
Father.

75
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,800
You asked for me.

76
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,000
It's...

77
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,080
It's late at night.

78
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,080
Why are you out here by yourself?

79
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,440
I'll walk you inside.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,840
Zilu.

81
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,240
You were rash and impatient.

82
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
You disappointed me.

83
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,040
Father.

84
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,320
What is this about?

85
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,560
Madam Guo's death

86
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,480
was your doing, right?

87
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,800
I brought a bottle of poison
from Western regions.

88
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
You knew where I kept it.

89
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,240
The poison was a deterrent

90
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,120
against the enemies

91
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,840
who would do us harm.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,720
But you?

93
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,320
You used it against your own family!

94
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,760
Father!

95
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,080
Madam Guo was meant to be

96
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,960
at the butler's location.

97
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,040
If my guess is right,

98
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,800
your target was the butler!

99
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,360
Is that it?

100
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,960
You wanted to commit murder!

101
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,040
Zilu.

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,160
The Guo family

103
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
has never committed crimes.

104
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,400
We are righteous.

105
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,440
But any who commits murder

106
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,360
must face punishment!

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,520
I won't show any mercy.

108
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,480
Tomorrow...

109
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,400
No,

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,920
it must be today!

111
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,960
I'm taking you to the authority!

112
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,120
Come with me!

113
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,920
No, Father!

114
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,760
No!

115
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,680
Come with me!

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
No, Father!

117
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,920
Father!

118
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,720
I'm sorry!

119
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,240
Father!

120
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,940
Please give me a second chance!

121
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,680
I won't make the same mistake again!
Father!

122
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,720
I won't fight Zijie
for the family business! Please!

123
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,280
Let go of me!

124
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,600
Father, give me another chance!

125
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,400
Father!

126
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,000
Butler!

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,480
Father!

128
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,120
Butler!

129
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:45,960
Guards!

130
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,320
Guards!

131
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,120
Father!

132
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,080
Father!

133
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,760
Father, don't go!

134
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,480
Father!

135
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,960
Let go of me!

136
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,600
You fiend!

137
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,880
You fiend!

138
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,000
You're a disgrace!

139
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,920
Butler!

140
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,240
Butler!

141
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,880
Help!

142
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,760
Father!

143
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,000
You forced my hand.

144
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,040
It's not my fault.

145
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,640
Father!

146
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,040
Father!

147
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,800
Father!

148
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,360
Guo Zilu.

149
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,160
Open your eyes!

150
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,360
See where you are now!

151
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,640
Stand up!

152
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Get up!

153
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,120
Guo Zilu.

154
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,760
Before dying,

155
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,800
Father crawled all the way here

156
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,480
to finish it all.

157
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,560
Father was lying there.

158
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,320
Yes.

159
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,440
You're sitting on where he died!

160
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,840
He used the last bit of
strength he had to crawl here

161
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,000
in order to protect your reputation.

162
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,680
How could you kill him?

163
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,680
You're a disgrace to yourself!

164
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,640
Brother.

165
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,360
Reflect on everything you've done.

166
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
From now on, you're no longer
my brother.

167
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,280
I was wrong.

168
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,560
Father.

169
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,840
I was so wrong.

170
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,080
Father...

171
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,120
I was wrong.

172
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,480
Father!

173
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,120
I was so wrong.

174
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,120
Father...

175
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,880
Sir.

176
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,120
Zijie.

177
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,960
It's all right.

178
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,520
I'm right here.

179
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:09,140
(Clear Blue Sky)

180
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,720
Zijie.

181
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,640
After Father's funeral is over,

182
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,000
light some joss sticks for him
on my behalf.

183
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,000
Xuanxuan.

184
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,680
The Guo family

185
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,800
is in your care now.

186
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,840
Enough.

187
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,920
Come with us.

188
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,420
Young Master Zijie.

189
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,840
Here you are.

190
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,960
This is the ledger.

191
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,000
Have a look.

192
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,740
(Ledger)

193
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,520
I went through it.

194
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,480
You're done?

195
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,800
That was quick.

196
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,600
Insolence.

197
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,280
The Guo family's ledger

198
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,240
can't be read by a mere child bride.

199
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,560
Can you even read it?

200
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,040
Hand it here.

201
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,800
Come out!

202
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,200
Show yourself.

203
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,160
Come out if you dare!

204
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,040
Come out.

205
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,000
Show yourself.

206
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,480
Come out!

207
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,880
Come out!

208
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,720
Who are you?

209
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,920
Where is he?

210
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,720
Where did he go?

211
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,320
What do you want of him?

212
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,520
After all the things I've done for him,

213
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,520
Guo Zijie wants me gone.

214
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,080
Why else would I be here?

215
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,600
What?

216
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,160
Finally coming around?

217
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,520
Are you willing to serve
the right master?

218
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,200
As long as I can get promoted and rich,

219
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,080
I can do anything.

220
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,800
Come with me.

221
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,520
Zijie.

222
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,080
Zijie.

223
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,440
You're here.

224
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,320
How are you feeling?

225
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,680
I'm all right.

226
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,760
These are the family ledger

227
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,960
and today's documents.

228
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,320
Have a look.

229
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,000
Xuanxuan.

230
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,480
I'm not in the mood for this.

231
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,080
I understand.

232
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,920
When other families

233
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,400
go through ordeals like this,

234
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,120
they couldn't have resolved it
the way you did.

235
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,200
When we get the chance,

236
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,040
we should go on a vacation.

237
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,480
There's a saying in my hometown.

238
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,360
A new mood

239
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,760
in a new environment.

240
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,160
Now that Father is gone,

241
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,480
the whole family

242
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,880
must rely on you.

243
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,880
You promised to take care of me.

244
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,320
You're not going to let me

245
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,880
handle the aftermath, right?

246
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,400
Xuanxuan.

247
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,960
This is my fault.

248
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,360
I'm sorry.

249
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,240
This is

250
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
only temporary.

251
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,160
The amazing detective Guo Zijie

252
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,120
would never sulk.

253
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,200
In any case,

254
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,000
life goes on.

255
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,880
I'll be there for you

256
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
along the journey.

257
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,680
Very well.

258
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,760
I'm all yours.

259
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:48,100
(Here lies the beloved father
Guo Shouyi)

260
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:14,500
(Here lies the beloved father
Guo Shouyi, by Guo Zijie)

261
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,160
Father.

262
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,080
Don't you worry.

263
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,680
From now on,

264
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,040
I'll take good care of Zijie.

265
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,780
(Guo Residence)

266
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,600
Young Master.

267
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,400
Bad news.

268
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,520
What is it?

269
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,560
Why are you panicking?

270
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,600
Sir,

271
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,120
Mr. Sun was caught.

272
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,960
How is that my problem?

273
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,280
Sir,

274
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,280
read this.

275
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,080
Look.

276
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,920
It was found on Mr. Sun's desk.

277
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,560
Sir, look.

278
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:32,920
I knew

279
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,440
something was off about this spot.

280
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,280
Check this.

281
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,960
Mr. Sun...

282
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,080
Bring me Xuanxuan and He Chun.

283
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,080
Yes, Young Master.

284
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,520
Look.

285
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,040
What's going on?

286
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,880
Sun Weiyan is in trouble.

287
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,080
We heard.

288
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,440
Sir,

289
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,640
will you rescue him?

290
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,920
Are you mad at him?

291
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,120
Whatever he's done,

292
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,720
I can't just let him die.

293
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,600
We'll rescue him.

294
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,520
Look at this.

295
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,640
- Sun Weiyan!
- Sun Weiyan!

296
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,200
Up ahead.

297
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,840
Sun Weiyan!

298
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,920
Is that Sun Weiyan?

299
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,360
Sun Weiyan!

300
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,880
Sun Weiyan!

301
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,240
Sun Weiyan!

302
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,000
Sun Weiyan!

303
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,200
Sun Weiyan!

304
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,640
Sun Weiyan! Open your eyes!

305
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,320
He Chun?

306
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,000
Xuanxuan?

307
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,120
Zijie?

308
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,840
Zijie,

309
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,200
what are you doing here?

310
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,940
Are you going after the mastermind
on your own?

311
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,880
How could you be so reckless?

312
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,400
He is unpredictable.

313
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,680
He would never let you catch him.

314
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,400
Sorry.

315
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
Let's help him up.

316
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,160
Sorry.

317
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,080
(A cursed doll.)

318
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,800
(This belonged to Wang Jing.)

319
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,600
Sorry.

320
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,560
Let's get out of here.

321
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,080
Zijie.

322
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,160
We are headed to He Chun's place.

323
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,440
She has the medicine

324
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,640
to treat Sun Weiyan's wound.

325
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,180
You and Sun Weiyan should head back.

326
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,640
He Chun.

327
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,200
Let's go.

328
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,040
Xuanxuan?

329
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,760
Xuanxuan?

330
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,040
Zijie.

331
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,080
I've failed you.

332
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,900
I shouldn't have done it.

333
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,880
I shouldn't have...

334
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,640
Enough.

335
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,920
Save it for later.

336
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,680
Zijie.

337
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
I must tell you now.

338
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,480
I did terrible things

339
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,320
for my father.

340
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,880
You should never have come to my rescue.

341
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,200
You should let me die!

342
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,840
Sun Weiyan!

343
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,480
I knew you needed help.

344
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,400
But when you needed help,

345
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,720
you went to the villain

346
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,600
instead of trusting me.

347
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,720
Look what you've done.

348
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,640
Did you even see me

349
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,440
as your friend?

350
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,320
Zijie.

351
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,280
I'm sorry.

352
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,960
I failed you.

353
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,720
Just go.

354
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,200
Zijie?

355
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,800
Zijie?

356
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:46,920
Zi...

357
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,360
Sun Weiyan!

358
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,360
Xuanxuan? Xuanxuan!

359
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,000
What's going on?

360
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,160
I don't have the medicine.

361
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,960
Sun Weiyan is hurt. I can't...

362
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,360
Calm down.

363
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Zijie can take care of Sun Weiyan.

364
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,200
Let's give them some time

365
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,240
to talk things out.

366
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
But why did you

367
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,720
bring me all the way here?

368
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,080
Look at this.

369
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,720
What is this thing?

370
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,720
Given the circumstances,

371
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,480
the assailant

372
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,760
could've killed Sun Weiyan
in a heartbeat.

373
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,200
But they spared him.

374
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,960
I think

375
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,240
the person was showing off
the marvel of their crime

376
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,600
to me.

377
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,640
I see.

378
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,800
Why didn't you

379
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,880
tell Magistrate Guo?

380
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,120
Zijie just lost his father.

381
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,800
I don't want to stress him out.

382
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,440
I'll tell him when he feels better.

383
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,080
You know him well.

384
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,040
Being in a relationship

385
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,600
means caring about each other

386
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,560
and being tolerant.

387
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,960
You'll understand when you fall in love.

388
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:07,960
What?

389
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,640
Is our Miss He Chun

390
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,640
actually in love?

391
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,480
No!

392
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,440
Nonsense!

393
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,520
Let me guess.

394
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,200
Mr. Sun?

395
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,800
No...

396
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
No way!

397
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,720
Not a chance.

398
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,360
I wouldn't fall for him.

399
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,400
Get out of my hair.

400
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,160
I knew it.

401
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,400
You can stop denying it now.

402
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:30,720
By the way,

403
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,000
the culprit left this

404
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,680
as a calling card

405
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,960
for you.

406
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,320
Now that

407
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,640
a challenge has been sent to me,

408
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,080
we must stay cautious now.

409
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,160
We'll face it.

410
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:46,960
Fear not.

411
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,680
I'll always keep you safe.

412
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,600
Let's go.

413
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,640
(Guo Residence)
Why did Young Master bring him back?

414
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,160
I heard he's done horrible things.

415
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,960
We're in no place

416
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,240
to argue who the villains are.

417
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,960
Let's leave.

418
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,880
Zijie...

419
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
I don't deserve your kindness.

420
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,120
I'm too ashamed to even be here.

421
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,800
Cao Xuanxuan.

422
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,360
Why are you

423
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,960
always sitting by the rocks?

424
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,880
What is it?

425
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,360
Where were you?

426
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,800
Look at the time.

427
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,560
I...

428
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,480
I spent the night at He Chun's place.

429
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,760
I fell asleep there.

430
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,320
If you don't want to come home,

431
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,240
I won't stop you.

432
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,280
Don't be upset.

433
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,520
I'm telling the truth.

434
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,680
I lost track of the time.

435
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,760
From the moment

436
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,200
you asked for He Chun's help

437
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,680
I knew you'd been investigating.

438
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,960
Why didn't you tell me?

439
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,000
You found out...

440
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,240
Is it because

441
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,840
the person came from your home?

442
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,120
Maybe they have

443
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,440
a way to bring you home.

444
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,200
Is that the reason?

445
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,640
You'll leave eventually.

446
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,080
Right?

447
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,960
I knew from the get-go

448
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,440
you weren't the real Cao Xuanxuan.

449
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,520
But whoever you are,

450
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,760
you're the one I like.

451
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,080
So...

452
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,200
whatever decision you make,

453
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,840
I'll support you.

454
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,480
I admit it.

455
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,960
I used to

456
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,280
yearn to go back.

457
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,560
However,

458
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,440
I've changed my mind.

459
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,920
After all, there's someone

460
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
I care about here.

461
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,160
