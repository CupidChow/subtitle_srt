He's a master.

23
00:02:18,643 --> 00:02:20,185
He has magical powers.

He's really magical.

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:27,840
See.

26
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,080
I picked the right guy.

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,120
Master is amazing.

28
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,440
Let's watch longer.

This stone lion weighs 500 kilograms.

I have the protection of divine energy.

31
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,800
That's why I'm safe.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,058
Master.

33
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,225
Amazing.

34
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,509
If you have any problems,
find Master Zhang.

35
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:54,320
He'll solve it.

36
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,680
It's a small trick.

37
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,920
A small trick?

38
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,040
How did he do it?

39
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,520
Take a good look.

40
00:03:04,207 --> 00:03:04,905
What is she doing?

41
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,640
Who's this?

42
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,160
What is she doing?

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,920
Master Zhang.

44
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,360
Are you not tired of pretending?

45
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,360
I'm

46
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,480
performing a spell.

47
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,240
Go away.

48
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,458
What is she doing?

49
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,320
You...

50
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,520
What... What are you doing?

51
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,530
What are you doing?

52
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,160
Stop her.

53
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,120
If you don't want to go to jail,

54
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,960
let go.

55
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,690
What is she doing?

56
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,080
Watch carefully.

57
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,327
Amazing.

58
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,000
You're a weak woman,

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,840
but you have such divine power.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,920
You must be

61
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,040
an immortal practitioner too.

62
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,760
Pardon my lack of respect.

63
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,840
Master Zhang.

64
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,240
Stop acting.

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,120
Make way.

66
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,330
- Look.
- You swindler.

67
00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:11,720
What's this?

68
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,970
Look.

69
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,180
- Yes.
- Why is it like this?

70
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,800
No.

71
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Let me explain.

72
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Hear me... Hear me out.

73
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
- You swindler.
- This... It's not... It's...

74
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,000
- You swindler.
- Compensate us.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,280
I...

76
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,020
You swindler, pay up.

77
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,720
- Pay up.
- You swindler, pay up.

78
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,160
- Don't run.
- Pay up.

79
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,927
- Catch him.
- Catch him.

80
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,800
Ruohui.

81
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,880
Take a good look.

82
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,920
This is Master Zhang's trick.

83
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,000
(Turns out I didn't kill Master Guo.)

84
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,520
(Father.)

85
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,840
(I failed to avenge you.)

86
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,400
(Forgive me.)

87
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,800
Ruohui.

88
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,280
Why do you

89
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,480
keep running around?

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,960
Who are you?

91
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,320
I'm Zijie's wife.

92
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:00,920
Then

93
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
why is he not here?

94
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,400
Uncle.

95
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,880
Do you know Guo Zijie?

96
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,300
What foolish thing did you do again?

97
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
She wants revenge.

98
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,680
She wanted to kill my father-in-law.

99
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,720
You...

100
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,600
Come home with me.

101
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,080
What's the matter?

102
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,680
His son became an official,

103
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,320
so are we supposed

104
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,280
to swallow our grudges?

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,040
You cower

106
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,360
in front of our enemies.

107
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,880
I don't have an uncle like you.

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,600
Enough!

109
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,600
If it weren't for Magistrate Guo,

110
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,080
you and I would have starved to death!

111
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
After that incident,

112
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,240
Master Guo brought his butler

113
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,320
to our house to apologize.

114
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,480
He also said

115
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,040
he wanted to adopt you.

116
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,120
After I understood what happened,

117
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,520
I forgave them.

118
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,760
Because I think

119
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
even I

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,160
would have run away alone

121
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,720
to survive.

122
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,720
Besides,
he was your father's best friend.

123
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,760
Your father
instructed him to do that either.

124
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,600
That's why

125
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,680
I refused to let them adopt you.

126
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,240
But

127
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,480
the money

128
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,560
I used to raise you

129
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,320
was given by Master Guo.

130
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,920
Otherwise, how do you think

131
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,640
I can raise you

132
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,000
with my condition?

133
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:05,960
No.

134
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,280
It's not true.

135
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,320
It's true.

136
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,680
You just didn't remember it.

137
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,520
Although it was your father
who raised you,

138
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,280
it was Master Guo who raised you

139
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,160
from childhood to now.

140
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
Do you remember

141
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,120
when you had a fever as a child?

142
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,840
You had smallpox,

143
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,880
a terminal disease.

144
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,440
No physician in the city
was willing to treat you.

145
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,280
It was Master Guo

146
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,760
who went to the suburbs at night

147
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,560
to beg Miracle Doctor Xue to save you.

148
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
I promised

149
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,040
not to tell you

150
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
these things,

151
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,120
but

152
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,680
look at what you've done!

153
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,940
(Guo Residence)

154
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
I didn't expect

155
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,000
Master Guo to die in this way.

156
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,360
When Master Guo's funeral is held,

157
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,640
please let me know.

158
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
I'll come over

159
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,480
to pay my respects.

160
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,360
Sure.

161
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,920
Master's funeral arrangements

162
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,240
will be decided

163
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,480
after Zijie wakes up.

164
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,740
If there's nothing else,

165
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,040
we'll leave first.

166

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,760
and get away with it.

190
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,640
Do you mean...

191
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,800
I already know who the murderer is

192
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,880
and how he committed the murder.

193
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,880
Xuanxuan.

194
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,320
There's someone here.

195
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,320
The poison

196
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,720
should still be here.

197
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,520
I will now order people

198
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,080
to thoroughly search
every corner of the residence.

199
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,080
(I wasn't involved)

200
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,320
(in this,)

201
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,520
(but if Xuanxuan really searches...)

202
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,840
(No.)

203
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,380
(I must get rid of it immediately.)

204
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,040
Turns out it's really you.

205
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,120
Didn't you already
doubt me a long time ago?

206
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,980
(To: Ning Xian,
Zhao Village, Lyu Residence)

207
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,920
So you're really
with the one behind this.

208
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,080
Anything you'd like to explain?

209
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,280
I know

210
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,240
it doesn't matter what I say,

211
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,560
but please believe

212
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,680
that my feelings

213
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,560
for Zijie and you

214
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,280
are real.

215
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,880
That's why

216
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,720
I know

217
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,400
you must have your own reasons.

218
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
What are you

219
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,760
doing all this for?

220
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,840
It's all because of my father

221
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
and fame.

222
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,360
Before I returned to Yanzhou,

223
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,600
someone found me

224
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,400
and told me that he could cure
my father's lung disease.

225
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,160
But the condition

226
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
is to privately
help him deliver letters.

227
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,080
I didn't want to agree,

228
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,840
but he told me

229
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,520
that he was from the future.

230
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,280
He said it was possible

231
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,640
to cure my father in his era.

232
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,520
I later learned
that all the letters I delivered

233
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,000
were modi operandi.

234
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,240
You said

235
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,800
it's someone from the future.

236
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,120
Did you see them?

237
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,280
Who is it?

238
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,160
I've never seen his face.

239
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
I can only confirm

240
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,320
that he's a man.

241
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,880
Was he also the one

242
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,120
who killed my father?

243
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,520
No.

244
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,000
They didn't intervene this time.

245
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,440
Is

246
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,360
what you said true?

247
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,800
At this point,

248
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,920
what else do I have to hide?

249
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,840
I know I disappointed you,

250
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,200
but it's all because of my father.

251
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,000
I have no choice.

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,560
I just want to help him.

253
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
You know he has lung disease.

254
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,160
No one in this world

255
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,640
can save him

256
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,880
except me.

257
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,240
Can you

258
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,000
really cure my father?

259
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,400
Whether I can

260
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
depends on your choice.

261
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,800
Guo Zijie

262
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,480
only taught you a few words.

263
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,120
Without your foster father,

264
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,440
you wouldn't have survived that winter.

265
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,520
Can the kindness

266
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,840
of teaching a few words
outweigh your foster father's life?

267
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,040
Don't hit me.

268
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,400
I have no money.

269
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,640
What are you doing?

270
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,500
Who do you think you are?

271
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,960
How dare you meddle in our business?

272
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,680
It's wrong
to take other people's homework.

273
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,720
Give him his homework back.

274
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,840
If you want your stuff,
come get it yourself.

275
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,840
I'll fight you!

276
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,640
Why were you so foolish?

277
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,080
I was brave,

278
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,040
not foolish.

279
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,880
Thank you.

280
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,040
It's not a big deal.

281
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,520
But if you keep being so weak,

282
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,240
they'll keep bullying you.

283
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,760
But I can't beat them.

284
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,400
You can study.

285
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,200
The more you know,

286
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,520
the less you will be bullied.

287
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,280
Study?

288
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,600
Can someone like me study?

289
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,560
Don't resent having no company
when you're out.

290
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,380
There are many carriages and horses
in books.

291
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,460
Why not?

292
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,380
I happened
to finish reading these books.

293
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,800
You can have them.

294
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,080
Books are expensive.

295
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,600
Can I really have them?

296
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,840
If you have any words you don't know,
you can come to me.

297
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,800
Here.

298
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,360
Sun Weiyan.

299
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,720
Sober up.

300
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,920
How could those ruthless murderers

301
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,160
save your father?

302
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,760
Besides,

303
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,000
lung disease

304
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,760
is difficult to treat even in our era.

305
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,280
He lied to you.

306
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,360
No, you're lying!

307
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,440
My father... My father can be cured.

308
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,840
My father can definitely be cured!

309
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,560
I don't believe you!

310
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,540
(Draw on a wood set upright
to attract attention.)

311
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,020
(Mount on a pole to move it.)

312
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,420
(Use the hidden compartment
within the jar to hide it.)

313
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,160
This is really Wang Jing's method.

314
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,520
It's obviously how the novel
is written in the later stages.

315
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,000
Could it

316
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,080
really be her ghostwriter?

317
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,760
It's all my fault.

318
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
If it weren't for me,

319
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,440
many innocent people wouldn't have died.

320
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,880
Although I don't understand
the future you're talking about,

321
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,520
I don't think it's your fault.

322
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,160
If you want to blame someone,

323
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,720
blame that person for being vicious.

324
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,440
He took advantage of
and hurt innocent people.

325
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,360
Xuanxuan.

326
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,720
You're so good

327
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,720
that he's jealous of you.

328
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,720
Can you confirm

329
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,320
who that person is?

330
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,840
I think I can confirm soon.

331
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,120
But our priority now

332
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,160
is to wait for Zijie to wake up

333
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,520
and find the real murderer.

334
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,500
(Guo Residence)

335
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,040
Let's go.

336
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,640
Are you looking for me?

337
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,640
What's this?

338
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,040
Miss Xuanxuan.

339
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,400
When did you go outside?

340
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,000
Is this also a way?

341
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,840
It can be

342
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,240
a way to create a fake locked room.

343
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,720
I've seen this

344
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,880
countless times in novels.

345
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,960
I'm tired of it.

346
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
I think

347
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,080
this is how the murderer escaped.

348
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,160
It's my fault.

349
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,240
When I saw Master lying there,

350
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,240
I panicked

351
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,880
and didn't check carefully.

352
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,960
It's not your fault.

353
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,460
Don't blame yourself too much.

354
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:26,960
Speaking of,

355
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,160
Miss Xuanxuan,

356
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,320
what did you mean

357
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,400
by locked room?

358
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,960
Carr

359
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,680
has detailed notes on locked rooms

360
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,080
in The Three Coffins.

361
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,880
The first type

362
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
is that the locked room
is completely enclosed.

363
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,320
There's no murderer.

364
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,920
Death was just an accident.

365
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,800
The second

366
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,120
is that the murderer

367
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,360
forces or induces the victim
to commit suicide.

368
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,600
The third type

369
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,220
is that the locked room has a trap.

370
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,080
The fourth type

371
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,160
is a locked room

372
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,380
caused by mystery or illusion,

373
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,160
which is also what we just demonstrated.

374
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,800
I still don't understand.

375
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,440
I've said so much

376
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,600
just to say

377
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,960
that I've ruled out

378
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,200
all of these.

379
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,520
I conclude

380
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,800
that the locked room

381
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,040
was created by m father himself.

382
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,080
Master Guo?

383
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,440
When he found out

384
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,080
that it was Guo Zilu

385
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,800
who hurt him,

386
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,800
he certainly couldn't bear

387
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,760
to let his son become a criminal.

388
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,040
So he used up his last bit of strength

389
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,120
to return to this room

390
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,320
and locked the door.

391
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,600
Then...

392
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,360
Is it

393
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,680
really Guo Zilu?

394
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
These are just my speculations.

395
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,800
There's one last thing
we need to confirm.

396
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,560
Miss Xuanxuan.

397
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
I believe you

398
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,000
can find the murderer

399
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,440
of Master and Madam Guo.

400
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,360
I want to confirm one thing.

401
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,160
When did Master's leg problem occur?

402
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,520
It was in the evening.

403
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:08,920
Yes.

404
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,240
All the guests had arrived by then.

405
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,160
Master knows
that he has difficulty walking,

406
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,280
so he asked me
to find you to replace him.

407
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
But as soon as I left,

408
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,840
Madam Guo stopped me.

409
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,200
Later, she found out

410
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,280
and went ahead herself.

411
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,720
If Madam Guo didn't die,

412
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,600
I would be the one who died?

413
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,080
You're the murderer's real target.

414
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,680
Have you offended anyone?

415
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,480
I...

416
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,200
Who could I offend?

417
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,520
There's only one possibility then.

418
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,480
There's another person

419
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,120
who knew the order of guests

420
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
that night.

421
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,520
You're leaving?

422
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,560
You can't leave yet.

423
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,680
You have to wait for Zijie to wake up

424
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,040
and give him an explanation.

425
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,040
At this point,

426
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,920
how can I face Zijie?

427
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,080
I can't help you

428
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,040
with future cases anymore.

429
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,320
Goodbye.

430
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,520
Farewell.

431
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,400
Xuanxuan.

432
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,560
Will you forgive Sun Weiyan?

433
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,840
He's at fault,

434
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,780
but his mistake isn't too severe.

435
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,800
I think

436
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,800
Zijie will forgive him

437
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,920
when he wakes up.

438
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,600
Go check on him.

439
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,360
Wait!

440
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,920
I don't think

441
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,080
you're a bad guy.

442
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,480
But I helped pass on messages.

443
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,080
Although I didn't do it myself,

444
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,640
many people died

445
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,320
because of me.

446
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,560
All because of me!

447
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,200
If it were for Grandpa,

448
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,840
I would too!

449
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,240
What if
you're Guo Zijie and Cao Xuanxuan?

450
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,720
Young Master.

451
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,240
Young Master, you're awake.

452
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,280
I'll go tell Young Madam you're awake.

453
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,440
Young Master.

454
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,400
Young Master.

455
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,440
What time is it?

456
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,600
Young Master.

457
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,240
You've been unconscious for days.

458
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
Where's Xuanxuan?

459
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,760
Young Master.

460
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,640
A lot of things happened

461
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,240
while you were unconscious.

462
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,640
Young Master.

463
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,880
It's alright.

464
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,680
Take your time.

465
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
On the day
of Master's birthday banquet...

466
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,000
Young Lady.

467
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,480
Young Master Zijie is awake.

468
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,600
Really?

469
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,760
What do you think of my look?

470
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,720
You look good.

471
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,840
Let's go find him.

472
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,400
Sure.

473
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,800
You finally woke up.

474
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,800
A lot of things happened

475
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,560
while you were unconscious.

476
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,120
No need to tell me.

477
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,880
I already knew it.

478
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,960
You've suffered.

479
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,280
I'm here.

480
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,800
Young Lady.

481
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,840
Let's go.

482
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,520
Yes.

483
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,640
I'll go back and make your bed.

484
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,720
Let's go back and rest early

485
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,880
so that we don't have to look at them.

486
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,920
Did you guys

487
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,080
already know

488
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,840
that Zijie

489
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,080
never liked me?

490
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,800
Let's go home.

491
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,880
Let's go back to our home.

492
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,880
Who is it?

493
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,280
Young Master Zilu.

494
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,740
Young Master Zijie is awake

495
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,340
and says he has something to discuss.

496
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,360
Is he awake?

497
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,880
How are you doing now?

498
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,600
Are you

499
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,800
uncomfortable anywhere else?

500
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,400
I'm fine.

501
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,480
This bracelet looks great on you.

502
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,360
I'll keep wearing it then.

503
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,480
Sure.

504
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,220
Brother, you're here.

505
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,720
Zijie.

506
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,480
You just recovered.

507
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,200
Why are you already drinking?

508
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,240
Don't drink too much.

509
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,720
Your health is important.

510
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,240
Someone, come.

511
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,240
Send Young Master Zijie
and Young Madam

512
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,480
to their room to rest.

513
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,520
I'll go now.

514
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,520
Brother, sit.

515
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,440
It's been a long time

516
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,480
since we had a good drink
with each other.

517
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,840
Brother.

518
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,340
Here's a toast to you.

519
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,800
What's wrong?

520
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,080
Are you afraid to drink?

521
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,280
Why would I be afraid?

522
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,480
I just recently

523
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,560
found a doctor to treat my health.

524
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
He prescribed a medicine.

525
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,480
I have to avoid alcohol.

526
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,040
Are you not drinking

527
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,320
because you have to avoid alcohol

528
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,800
or because you know

529
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,160
this wine is poisonous?

530
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,480
Zijie.

531
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,920
You didn't ask me here to drink,
did you?

532
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,320
Tell me.

533
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,120
What are you up to?

534
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,280
Regarding Father and Madam Guo,

535
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,120
I already guessed that it was you.

536
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,200
I just didn't want to believe it

537
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,320
until just now.

538
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,800
Your actions have betrayed you.

539
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,800
Zijie.

540
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,920
I'll tell you again.

541
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,200
Don't blame everything on me

542
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,480
if you can't solve the case.

543
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,680
Do you understand?

544
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,280
Guo Zilu.

545
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,360
You don't want to admit it yet?

546
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,200
Master had an old illness.

547
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,600
He sent the butler

548
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
to entertain guests.

549
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,440
The same went for his birthday banquet.

550
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
When you learned

551
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,160
that the butler knew your identity,

552
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,020
you were afraid
that he would tell others

553
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,100
and wanted to kill him.

554
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,240
But you killed Madam Guo

555
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,880
by mistake.

556
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,000
What makes you say so?

557
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,560
Do you have any proof?

558
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,400
Proof?

559
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,720
When I learned the medicinal properties
of this poisonous wine,

560
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,960
I knew the murderer

561
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,080
only needed to meet three conditions.

562
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,080
First,

563
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,400
the murderer

564
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,160
knew the medicinal properties
of the poison.

565
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,080
Second,

566
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,120
the murderer
knew Master Guo's habits

567
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,480
and knew

568
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,520
he would drink the last wine.

569
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,520
And third,

570
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,480
the murderer knew
that the Guo family

571
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,940
had this poison in their storeroom.

572
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,800
Brother.

573
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,680
You didn't know
that Father once mentioned

574
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,040
this poison to me, did you?

575
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,840
I want to believe

576
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,240
that you didn't mean to hurt Father.

577
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,800
You probably hurt him

578
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,960
out of desperation

579
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,960
after he knew the truth.

580
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,880
And it was you

581
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,880
who helped him back to his room.

582
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,200
It was just that you didn't know

583
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,520
that Father would never wake up again.

584
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,080
Nonsense!

585
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,000
I didn't even help Father into the room!

586
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,240
Guo Zilu.

587
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,400
You finally admitted it.

588
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:25,960
We said

589
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,200
something you didn't do.

590
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,520
You were too eager to make excuses

591
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,780
and reveal yourself,

592
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,800
but you should know

593
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,060
that you'll regret it
if you know the final truth

594
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,880
of the locked-room murder.

595
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:38,880
Alright.

596
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,680
Tell me

597
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,400
the truth!

598
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,800
You want proof?

599
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:53,880
Sure.

600
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,880
