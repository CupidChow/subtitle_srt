00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,500
Stop!

43
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,820
Is she possessed by evil spirits?

44
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,980

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,460
Hurry.

54
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,740
Inform Master and Madam Guo.

55
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,540
Why are you running?

56
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,580
You're running so fast.

57
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,680
Where are you running to?

58
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,460
Step aside!

59
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,300
Back off!

60
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,100
Put the sword down. Put...

61
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,220
Did you kidnap me?

62
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,600
What nonsense are you talking about?

63
00:03:56,505 --> 00:04:03,340
(Guo Residence)

64
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,740
Keep an eye on Xuanxuan

65
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,140
and ask Yanhong
to change her into clean clothes.

66
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,140
Yes.

67
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,660
Young Master.

68
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,140
Young Master.

69
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,820
She didn't hurt you, did she?

70
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,780
I'm fine.

71
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,060
Look at what they've done.

72
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,660
What if she gets hurt?

73
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,860
Young Master.

74
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,020
Don't you find it strange?

75
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,860
Didn't the physician say
she couldn't wake up?

76
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,980
Why did she suddenly wake up?

77
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,860
What nonsense are you talking about?

78
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,460
Isn't it a good thing that she woke up?

79
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:35,980
Master.

80
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,980
Ms. Xuanxuan was in a coma.

81
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,220
That's why you decided
to let Young Master Zijie

82
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,900
marry Ying.

83
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,140
But

84
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,380
she woke up

85
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,820
as the wedding approaches.

86
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,220
What should we do?

87
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,940
(Who hit me this hard?)

88
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,740
(Who changed my clothes?)

89
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,980
(I'm so exhausted.)

90
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,500
(Is it necessary to make the house
so complicated?)

91
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,540
(Is this a house or a maze?)

92
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,740
(This smell)

93
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,900
(is lacquer,)

94
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,580
(but no one uses this lacquer)

95
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,980
(nowadays.)

96
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,500
(Have I really
traveled to ancient times?)

97
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,140
Search!

98
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,580
Even if you have to turn Guo Residence
upside down,

99
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,260
you must find him.

100
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,860
Yes.

101
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,100
No matter what,

102
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,180
the Guo family

103
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,820
owes so much to the Cao family.

104
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,300
Now,

105
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,460
we owe another life to Cao Xuanxuan.

106
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,740
Do you mean

107
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,620
that Young Master Zijie

108
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,900
and Ms. Xuanxuan's engagement

109
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,980
should proceed?

110
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,180
But

111
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,220
Ying is Madam Guo's niece.

112
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,780
Madam Guo might disagree.

113
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,020
Never mind.

114
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,100
Let me think again

115
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,620
about the wedding.

116
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,140
I'm starving.

117
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,300
What are you eating?

118
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,060
Zijie.

119
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:34,860
Are you alright?

120
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,040
Is something wrong with you?

121
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,660
You just woke up
and you're already causing chaos.

122
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,940
Don't get so close to my cousin.

123
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,540
Cao Xuanxuan.

124
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,860
Don't think that you can escape
being a child bride

125
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,780
just by saving Young Master Zijie.

126
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,980
You haven't gotten married yet.

127
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,360
There's no place for you

128
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,300
at the main table.

129
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,180
Cao Xuanxuan?

130
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,220
Child bride?

131
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,220
Go to hell.

132
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,460
Ms. Xuanxuan.

133
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,780
Don't be rude to Madam Guo and Ying.

134
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,020
Madam Guo?

135
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,380
This man's

136
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,020
concubine?

137
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:06,900
You...

138
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,180
Master.

139
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,460
You little wench.

140
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,820
How dare you touch me?

141
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,060
Leave me alone!

142
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,160
I have something to do,

143
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,030
so I won't fight you.

144
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,340
Guo Zijie!

145
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:15,860
Look at her.

146
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,220
Look at her rebelling.

147
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,760
Are you going to do something about it?

148
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,860
Guo Zijie?

149
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:32,780
Are you

150
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,620
Guo Zijie?

151
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,340
(The protagonist of Yan City Diaries)

152
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,740
(is county magistrate, Guo Zijie.)

153
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,100
(Detective Guo Zijie)
(Most of)

154
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,140
(the documented cases used)

155
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,660
(honkaku mystery's modus operandi.)

156
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,040
Have you lost your mind
because of your illness?

157
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,140
You don't even
recognize your husband anymore.

158
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,420
Is this

159
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,420
Yan City?

160
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,220
She doesn't even know she's in Yan City.

161
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:57,780
Father.

162
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,300
Master.

163
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,820
I already told you not to...

164
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,180
Yes.

165
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,500
Look at what's going on now.

166
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
Yes, Master.

167
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,700
Look at what's going on.

168
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,220
Enough.

169
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,140
Stop arguing!

170
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,540
Xuanxuan.

171
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,580
You have no manners!

172
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,620
She's rebelling.

173
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,780
(How did I get here?)

174
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,820
(Cao Xuanxuan
is in such a bad situation.)

175
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,220
(Guo Zijie is also completely different)

176
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,920
(from what is described in the diaries.)

177
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,220
(How strange.)

178
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,460
(Why did I wake up in Yan City?)

179
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,420
(Could it be related
to that ancient book?)

180
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,060
(No.)

181
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,460
(I have to hurry up and find)

182
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,820
(Yan City Diaries.)

183
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,700
(Looks like the key to getting back)

184
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,020
(is related to the book.)

185
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,900
(Let me find Yan City Diaries first.)

186
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,860
Xuanxuan is a different person
after waking up.

187
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,580
Don't you think

188
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,340
there's something fishy

189
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,500
about this?

00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,820
(Yan City Diaries)

191
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,300
(doesn't seem to be in Guo Residence.)

192
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,860
(I should put it aside.)

193
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,900
(Since I'm here,)

194
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,100
(I should have no regrets.)

195
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,540
(I should have fun first.)

196
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,560
(Teahouse)

197
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,080
Take a look. It's cheap.

198
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,420
Mr. Zhang.

199
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,900
Come back for a drink next time.

200
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,340
Take care.

201
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,020
I didn't expect you

202
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,980
to be interested in this.

203
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,620
Come in, please.

204
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,060
Do you

205
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,780
know me?

206
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,660
Everyone in Yan City

207
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,260
knows Magistrate Guo's child bride.

208
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,340
Yes.

209
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:23,980
Come on.

210
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,640
Have a drink.

211
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,060
Come on.

212
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,380
Hurry.

213
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,300
No.

214
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:26,620
Come on.

215
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,380
Don't grab me.

216
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,420
I don't want to go in.

217
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,420
(Qunfang)

218
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,540
I'm really not...

219
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:31,940
I...

220
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,080
(Spring Tavern)

221
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,860
(Guo Residence)

222
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,860
I'm the flower of Sanlitun.

223
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,820
Drinking with me?

224
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,140
I'm not afraid of you.

225
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,860
Drink.

226
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,100
You lost again.

227
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,620
Six sixes.

228
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,020
Open!

229
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,660
Why are you here again?

230
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,780
Why am I here again?

231
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,980
You unfaithful woman.

232
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,540
You drank so much last night

233
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,340
that you had to be carried back.

234
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,180
You embarrassed me.

235
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:21,900
Unfaithful?

236
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,380
I'm still a young lady.

237
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,540
How dare you argue?

238
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,620
I'm telling you.

239
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,700
Don't you dare

240
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,900
leave my sight today.

241
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,980
Who are you to tell me what to do?

242
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,060
I'm not your wife.

243
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,220
I'm telling you.

244
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,060
Follow me
to the administrative office today.

245
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,180
You can't go anywhere else.

246
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,260
Look at your outfit.

247
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,480
Hurry up and get changed.

248
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,380
I'll wait for you at the door.

249
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,100
Hurry.

250
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,820
What's wrong with you?

251
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,780
What does my outfit have to do with you?

252
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,300
I'm not doing what you say.

253
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,580
I look good.

254
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,220
Where are you going?

255
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,300
Are you trying to run?

256
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:18,980
Let go!

257
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,180
Why don't you get changed?

258
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,540
Where are you going?

259
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,620
Get down.

260
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,340
Get down.

261
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,340
(Yan Administrative Office)

262
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,980
Get off.

263
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,620
Stop urging me.

264
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,460
Is this the administrative office?

265
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:54,980
Come on.

266
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,700
Go to work.

267
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,780
Why did you bring me?

268
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,620
Alright.

269
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,740
You

270
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,380
keep an eye on her.

271
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,160
Just stay here.

272
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,740
She's not allowed to go anywhere.

273
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,020
(Yan Administrative Office)

274
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,260
I'm Yan City's county magistrate,
Guo Zijie.

275
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,020
Welcome, Imperial Envoy.

276
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,820
Magistrate Guo.

277
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,400
No need for formalities.

278
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,660
Thank you.

279
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,140
Sir.

280
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:19,980
This way, please.

281
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,420
Please take a seat.

282
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,180
How is that appropriate?

283
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,100
I came to Yan City for inspection

284
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,260
on the orders of Lord Su.

285
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,540
Magistrate Guo.

286
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,420
It's

287
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,820
up to you this time.

288
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:39,780
Sure.

289
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,780
Why do you keep following me?

290
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,440
I heard Magistrate Guo
is about to hold court.

291
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:48,900
Yes.

292
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,100
Come on. Let's check it out.

293
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,860
Why are there so many people?

294
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,340
I'll check it out.

295
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,260
Stop following me.

296
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,820
Magistrate Guo.

297
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,420
Get started.

298
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,260
Hurry.

299
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,820
See if there are any cases.

300
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,540
Bring them up.

301
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,380
Sir.

302
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,740
A kidnapping hideout
was busted in the north of the city.

303
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,140
Several children were rescued.

304
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,220
Excuse me.

305
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,530
There's another case where a woman

306
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,140
named Zhang from the south of the city

307
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,340
sued a scholar for abducting

308
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,780
her daughter and eloping with her.

309
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,020
Imperial Envoy is here.

310
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,660
How can such trivial matters

311
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,900
show my wisdom and abilities?

312
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,220
Are there any difficult cases?

313
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,820
We do have that.

314
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,260
It's just

315
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,940
too ridiculous.

316
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,580
Tell me.

317
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,400
Summon them.

318
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,340
Summon

319
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,540
peasant woman, Zhao Xiaolin, to court.

320
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,420
Sir.

321
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:45,940
Sir.

322
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:46,660
Sir.

323
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,100
Get justice for me.

324
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,540
Sir.

325
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,700
You must get justice for me.

326
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,300
My husband...

327
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,660
My husband

328
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,940
disappeared into thin air.

329
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,100
Your husband disappeared into thin air?

330
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,140
Sir,

331
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,580
my husband, Fu Miao,

332
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,780
didn't disappear.

333
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,540
He...

334
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,380
He was caught by a fox spirit.

335
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,060
Fox spirit?

336
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,460
Interesting.

337
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,100
What happened?

338
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,140
Tell me in detail.

339
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,420
That day,

340
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,460
I went back to my parents' home.

341
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,660
I came home at night.

342
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,860
I distinctly remember

343
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,940
my husband sitting at his desk

344
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,940
and turning around to look at me.

345
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,100
But who would have expected

346
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,340
him to suddenly disappear

347
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,300
while I lit the lamp?

348
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,180
Maybe

349
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,620
your husband went out

350
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,920
when you were lighting the lamp.

351
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,940
No way.

352
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,780
It's my husband's fault

353
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,580
for refusing to listen

354
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,860
and eating the baby foxes

355
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,180
from the mountains.

356
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,260
A few days ago,

357
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,860
two of my husband's classmates
came to visit.

358
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,580
Seeing the beautiful scenery
in the mountains,

359
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,620
they took some liquor
and went up to recite poems.

360
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,620
But

361
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,120
they found a nest of baby foxes

362
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,740
on their way back after drinking.

363
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:11,980
In the end,

364
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,580
they roasted the foxes and ate them.

365
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,980
I tried to dissuade them

366
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,140
after I found out,

367
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,660
but they didn't believe me.

368
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,340
Who knew

369
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,940
my husband was captured
by a fox spirit that night.

370
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,220
Fox spirit?

371
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,300
It's really a fox spirit.

372
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,620
What should we do?

373
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,380
(Is there really a fox spirit?)

374
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,300
It's absurd.

375
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,820
It's absurd!

376
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,660
How could there be a fox spirit?

377
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,820
You and your husband

378
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,140
disappeared in the same room.

379
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,380
Maybe you murdered your husband

380
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,580
and then

381
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,860
blamed it

382
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,220
on something nonexistent

383
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,300
like a fox spirit.

384
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,340
Sir.

385
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,580
Every word I say is true.

386
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,100
Sir.

387
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,780
It's indeed true.

388
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:03,940
Sir.

389
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,380
The two of us

390
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,140
can prove it.

391
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,720
How dare you continue making excuses?

392
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,260
All of you

393
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,380
are suspects.

394
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,420
Sir.

395
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,220
I'm telling the truth.

396
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:13,620
Sir.

397
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,620
It's really not me.

398
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,940
It's not me.

399
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,180
Let me investigate further
in the afternoon.

400
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:19,960
Take them away.

401
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,540
Sir!

402
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:21,980
Sir.

403
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,020
Sir, I'm innocent!

404
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,420
Sir, I'm innocent!

405
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,460
Does he know how to solve cases?

406
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:27,740
Hurry.

407
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,700
Sir!

408
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,540
Hurry up.

409
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,360
Why did Magistrate Guo run away?

410
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:36,860
Yes.

411
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,580
Well...

412
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,540
Well...

413
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,780
(Fairness and Integrity)

414
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,620
Are you capable of solving cases?

415
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,820
You jumped to conclusions

416
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,740
without solid evidence.

417
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,000
What are you looking for?

418
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,860
Could you please be quiet?

419
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,220
I'm already frustrated enough.

420
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,600
I don't want to bother with you.

421
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,340
You're throwing things randomly.

422
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,900
What are these?

423
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,780
Don't touch them.

424
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,660
This book

425
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,300
is made of the finest paper
from West regions.

426
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,940
I especially used them to record

427
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,060
some major cases.

428
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,260
I can't show it to others.

429
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,900
Really?

430
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,980
You act all mysterious.

431
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,260
You can write books?

432
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,960
Do you know how to name it?

433
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,060
This book

434
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,420
has no title yet,

435
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,500
but

436
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,060
I've thought of several

437
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,940
impressive names as alternatives.

438
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,700
Tell me.

439
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,140
For example,

440
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,380
something like Detective Guo's

441
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,380
Record,

442
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,620
Mr. Guo's Case,

443
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,900
and something like

444
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,260
Tales of Mr. Guo Slaying Demons.

445
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,880
Aren't they particularly awesome?

446
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,340
Slaying Demons?

447
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,020
Outrageous.

448
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,220
Isn't punishing evil and promoting good

449
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,420
for the people

450
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,420
fighting demons?

451
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,860
I thought of a better name.

452
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,420
(Yan)

453
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,380
(Yan City Diaries)

454
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
(Yan City)

455
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,230
(Yan City Diaries)

456
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,340
(Yan City Diaries)

457
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,140
This artifact, newly unearthed

458
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,830
(Archaeological Institute)
at an ancient city site,

459
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,300
(Hechuan City)
hasn't been disclosed yet.

460
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,720
(Guo Residence)
Master.

461
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,620
We have a problem.

462
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,900
Imperial Envoy is here.

463
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,980
Young Master Zijie
lost his composure in court.

464
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,820
His official position

465
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,260
is probably in jeopardy this time.

466
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,580
Imperial Envoy

467
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,020
is sent by Lord Su.

468
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,380
Lord Su has always

469
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,740
advocated fairness and integrity.

470
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,820
He's also strict

471
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,920
with all civil and military officials.

472
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,220
It's a good thing

473
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,740
for the people,

474
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,820
but it's a disaster

475
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,420
for Zijie.

476
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,380
(Yan Administrative Office)

477
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,620
Magistrate Guo.

478
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:31,500
This...

479
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,260
Please make a decision soon,
Magistrate Guo.

480
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:36,980
Sir.

481
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,140
Let me think about it again.

482
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,180
I need some time.

483
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,940
We've waited for so long.

484
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,500
Why hasn't the verdict been made yet?

485
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,820
What's going on?

486
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,500
What about Chen?

487
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,200
Have you heard?

488
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,680
If you get entangled by a fox spirit,

489
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,900
the whole family will be bad.

490
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,300
It continues for three generations.

491
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,220
Really?

492
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,260
That bad?

493
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,460
(What is Guo Zijie up to?)

494
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,420
(Is he really a fool?)

495
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,620
Magistrate Guo, hurry up.

496
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,180
(If this goes on,)

497
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,860
(that woman will probably be in danger.)

498
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,740
It's not a fox spirit.

499
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,900
Zhao Xiaolin reported the case.

500
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,300
I don't think she's the murderer.

501
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,060
If she wants to kill her husband,

502
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,180
she can set up an accident.

503
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,340
Why go to all the trouble

504
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,900
to make up a story about a demon fox?

505
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,460
Yes.

506
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,580
She has a point.

507
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,700
Magistrate Guo.

508
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,700
Who is this woman?

509
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,500
How dare she disrupt
the court like this?

510
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,500
This is

511
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,860
my child bride.

512
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,260
But she knows a lot

513
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,300
about these strange things.

514
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,860
Maybe she can help.

515
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,260
If what Zhao Xiaolin said is true,

516
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,140
it should be a locked-room murder.

517
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,540
Locked room?

518
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,940
Scientifically speaking,

519
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,100
there's no way

520
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,740
someone can just disappear
for no reason.

521
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,020
Young Madam Guo.

522
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,660
In your opinion,

523
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,420
how should this case be resolved?

524
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,220
Now,

525
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,420
we have a few clues.

526
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,740
Further investigation is needed.

527
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,420
That means you have no clue.

528
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,140
Guo Zijie.

529
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,460
How dare you?

530
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,740
It's fine that you're incompetent.

531
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,500
You allowed your child bride

532
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,060
to disrupt the court,

533
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,260
speak freely,

534
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,060
and talk nonsense.

535
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,260
Sir.

536
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,180
Calm down.

537
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,420
Give me a few days.

538
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,780
I'll solve the case for you.

539
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,980
Give you some time?

540
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,460
We don't have much time.

541
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,900
Lord Su will be visiting Yan City soon.

542
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,340
You guys are going
to lose your heads by then.

543
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,180
Calm down.

544
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,580
Sir.

545
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:46,740
Sir.

546
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,140
I only need five days.

547
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,700
How dare you?

548
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,440
If you don't solve this case

549
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,140
in five days,

550
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,620
don't blame me

551
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,020
for reporting to Lord Su

552
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,520
about Yan City's county magistrate,
Guo Zijie,

553
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,620
who seeks fame,

554
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,900
attempts to bribe,

555
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,620
allows a woman to disrupt the court,

556
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,940
and incites people.

557
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,660
Take care

558
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,220
of yourselves.

559
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,740
Imp... Imperial Envoy.

560
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,420
Sir.

561
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,180
Take care.

562
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,260
Five days?

563
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,380
Even if you were Judge Di,

564
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,220
you couldn't boast about five days.

565
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,100
I said that casually.

566
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,820
It was you who promised him five days.

567
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,300
You'll kill me.

568
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,660
How about this?

569
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,920
I'll help you solve the case.

570
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,120
And you'll give me that book.

571
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:42,920
Will that work?

572
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,500
Is it just for the book?

573
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,660
If you can solve the case,

574
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,420
you can have whatever you want.

575
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,340
Sir.

576
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,340
What do we do?

577
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,600
Take them away first.

578
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,140
We'll hold a retrial at a later date.

579
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:05,840
Take them away!

580
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,900
- Sir!
- Sir!

581
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,540
Sir, investigate this carefully.

582
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,900
Investigate carefully, Sir.

583
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,180
No.

584
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,300
No!

585
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:57,940
Fu.

586
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,140
Young Master.

587
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,820
Did you

588
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,260
have a nightmare again?

589
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,460
Where's Xuanxuan?

590
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,540
Ms. Xuanxuan

591
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,700
hasn't woken up yet.

592
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,300
She

593
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,420
wasn't like this before.

594
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,700
Yes.

595
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,780
She used to get up before dawn.

596
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,580
You may go.

597
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,300
I'm fine.

598
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,340
Yes, Young Master.

599
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:36,820
Fu.

600
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,300
Where's your young master?

601
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,860
Our young master went to court
early in the morning.

602
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,540
Is Guo Zijie going to try the case?

603
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,620
Our young master
is a renowned detective of Yan City.

604
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,540
This time,

605
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,460
look carefully.

606
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,660
The suspects are already in court.

607
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,380
Nonsense.

608
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,740
Dali.

609
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,980
You brought me good news.

610
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,060
Well, you know.

611
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,140
My foolish brother.

612
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,380
I'm talking about him, not you.

613
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,800
What are you standing there for?

614
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,580
Sit.

615
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,540
No.

616
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,900
I wouldn't dare.

617
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,820
Sit down when I tell you to.

618
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,820
Sit.

619
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,200
Thank you, Young Master Zilu.

620
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,900
How dare he take on such a big case

621
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,340
and say

622
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,340
it would be solved within five days?

623
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,260
If he fails to solve the case,

624
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,300
let's watch Imperial Envoy

625
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,140
punish him.

626
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,340
Cao Xuanxuan.

627
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,220
I'm working on a case,

628
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,140
but you dragged me out.

629
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,980
You'll humiliate me.

630
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,360
Look at how you worked on the case.

631
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,280
Do you have shame?

632
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,500
I was just speculating.

633
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,800
Speculating. Do you understand?

634
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,580
Why do you insist it's Zhao Xiaolin?

635
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,860
Fu Miao was originally
from somewhere else.

636
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,380
No one cared that he disappeared.

637
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,700
Why would Zhao Xiaolin go

638
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,520
to the administrative office
to get attention?

639
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,100
Also,

640
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,100
Zhao Village

641
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,340
shuns the fox spirit.

642
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,100
Why would Zhao Xiaolin make up

643
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,540
a story about a demon fox's revenge

644
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,360
to get attention?

645
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,300
It doesn't make sense.

646
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,760
Have you ever thought about it?

647
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,140
(I thought he was playing dumb,)

648
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,540
(but he's actually dumb.)

649
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,300
(The author of that ancient book)

650
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,540
(is too unreliable.)

651
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,300
(How could he call himself a detective?)

652
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,720
Why did you stop talking?

653
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,700
Go on.

654
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,860
How do you think

655
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,940
we should investigate?

656
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,300
Fu Miao's body hasn't been found.

657
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,700
I think his chances of survival

658
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,820
are slim.

659
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,980
If we want to investigate this case,

660
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,500
we must go

661
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,060
to the crime scene in Zhao Village.

662
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,220
Let's go then.

663
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,580
Do you think
the on-site investigation is easy?

664
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,540
There's a whole process of verification.

665
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,620
We also need

666
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,940
a forensic doctor.

667
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,380
A forensic doctor for verification.

668
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,180
What's

669
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,700
a forensic doctor?

670
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,460
That's

671
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,620
the coroner.

672
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,020
We need a coroner.

673
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,500
A coroner.

674
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,840
We have a coroner.

675
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,560
Come here.

676
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,840
We have a coroner, of course.

677
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,240
Sir.

678
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,140
Go tell them.

679
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,140
Keep an eye on them.

680
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,560
I have something important to do.

681
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,040
Well...

682
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,660
Go.

683
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,100
Yes.

684
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,740
Why are you gone?

685
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,860
You left me just like that.

686
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,260
Open your eyes and look at me.

687
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,820
You had such a hard life.

688
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,620
When you were alive,

689
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,860
you didn't even enjoy one good day.

690
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,980
Why are you gone?

691
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,740
How can you bear to part with me?

692
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:37,940
What happened?

693
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,700
- Let's take a look.
- Let's take a look.

694
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,420
Here, excuse us.

695
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,420
Excuse us.

696
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,460
What happened?

697
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,140
Why are you gone?

698
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,660
Who is that woman?

699
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,060
Isn't that a man?

700
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,620
You fool.

701
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,860
No one knows who will die first, right?

702
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,280
It's not due to charcoal burning.

703
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,340
He's

704
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,660
the murderer.

705
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,820
Nonsense!

706
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,860
My wife died of charcoal poisoning.

707
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,220
Yes.

708
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,380
How is that possible?

709
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,900
The whole house smells like charcoal.

710
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,780
How could it not be charcoal poisoning?

711
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,020
- Yes.
- Yes.

712
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,740
Mr. Coroner.

713
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,920
Mr. Li and Mrs. Li
have a good relationship.

714
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,180
You must investigate thoroughly

715
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,600
and not wrong an innocent person.

716
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,540
Yes.

717
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,460
Mr. Coroner.

718
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,820
You must investigate thoroughly.

719
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,940
Don't end up
wrongly accusing good people.

720
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,740
- Yes.
- Yes.

721
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,340
Yes.

722
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,620
No need to investigate.

723
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,820
My wife died of charcoal poisoning.

724
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:55,740
Leave.

725
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,040
You're not welcome in my home.

726
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:57,780
Leave.

727
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,780
The coroner is a woman.

728
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,340
How did you know she's a woman?

729
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,300
The coroner is a woman!

730
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,660
Could ancient people

731
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,580
really not tell
if someone was male or female?

732
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,260
It's obvious.

733
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,540
Really?

734
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,020
Mr. He is here.

735
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,500
Mr. He.

736
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,380
Mr. He.

737
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,300
Did you see?

738
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,980
This is the old coroner I mentioned.

739
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,220
You're the head coroner of Yan City.

740
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,620
You must get justice for me.

741
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,700
Grandpa.

742
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,500
Chun.

743
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,900
Strange.

744
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,540
Inhaling charcoal poison

745
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,100
will make the lips glisten

746
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,460
like cherries.

747
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,140
But Mrs. Li...

748
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,620
Look, Grandpa.

749
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,100
Shall we

750
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,380
do something exciting today?

751
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,780
What are you trying to do?

752
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,780
I see.

753
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,300
He's the murderer.

754
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,060
Catch him!

755
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,820
How dare you run?

756
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,900
Jeez.

757
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,140
Grandpa.

758
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:01,980
Let's go back.

759
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,100
Let's go.

760
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,100
Master.

761
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,060
I asked the physician yesterday.

762
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,820
The physician said,

763
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,460
with Xuanxuan's condition at the time,

764
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,140
there was no way she could wake up.

765
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,420
It's really strange.

766
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,260
Mr. He, please stay.

767
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,380
Magistrate Guo.

768
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,300
Did you just arrive?

769
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,460
I watched you from there for a while.

770
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,340
I was in a hurry

771
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,460
and didn't see you.

772
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,700
It's alright.

773
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,660
Who is this lady?

774
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,300
She's my granddaughter.

775
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,620
Don't we need a coroner?

776
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,540
I want her.

777
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,340
That's right.

778
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,260
Are you Guo Zijie?

779
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,260
Yes.

780
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,940
Corrupt official.

781
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:56,820
Magistrate Guo.

782
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,340
Apologies.

783
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,420
Have you ever seen anyone so rude?

784
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,420
Look at how badly you've done your job.

785
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,100
She doesn't even
want to talk with you.

786
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,340
Think about it.

787
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,340
Do you have anyone else that's good?

788
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,300
For example,

789
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,200
a private secretary?

790
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,540
Private secretary?

791
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,380
I've been trying to hire one.

792
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,580
It's just that...

793
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:18,660
You know

794
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,120
that scholars are over-scrupulous.

795
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,380
I can't find a suitable

796
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,260
and better one.

797
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,020
Miss.

798
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,900
This is my new stock.

799
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:42,860
Hey,

800
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,740
why do you have a Rubik's cube?

801
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,480
It's called a Rubik's cube?

802
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,340
I bought this

803
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,580
in bulk.

804
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,940
It's for kids.

805
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,320
I don't know much about it either.

806
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:51,980
Really?

807
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,220
Why would I lie to you?

808
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:53,980
If you like it,

809
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,180
just take it.

810
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,980
Thank you.

811
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,580
What's this?

812
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,930
How come I've never seen it before?

813
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,000
(Could there be other
modern people here already?)

814
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,620
You can even turn it.

815
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:09,980
How do you play this?

816
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,220
You don't know how, right?

817
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,020
I'll teach you.

818
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,340
Did you get it?

819
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,540
We're hiring a private secretary
and offering rice as a benefit.

820
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,380
Take a look.

821
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,900
We're hiring a private secretary
and offering rice as a benefit.

822
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,580
Next.

823
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,580
We're giving away rice.

824
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,260
We're hiring a private secretary.

825
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,380
We're hiring a private secretary
and giving away rice.

826
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,620
What's this?

827
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,060
Hiring a private secretary.

828
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,700
(Recruiting Private Secretary)

829
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,020
(Free Rice)
Is this

830
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,780
how you recruit a private secretary?

831
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,300
How else
should we recruit a private secretary?

832
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,220
Let's use this.

833
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,660
Are you hiring me a private secretary

834
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,380
with this toy?

835
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,900
Pay attention.

836
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,220
This rice isn't for free.

837
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,100
Whoever can solve this

838
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,820
will become
Yan City's top private secretary

839
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,540
with a salary tripled.

840
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,420
Come on.

841
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,780
Ms. Xuanxuan became extremely smart

842
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,580
after waking up.

843
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:30,700
It

844
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,580
doesn't make sense.

845
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,060
Do you think

846
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,100
it's possible

847
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,700
that there are two...

848
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,680
