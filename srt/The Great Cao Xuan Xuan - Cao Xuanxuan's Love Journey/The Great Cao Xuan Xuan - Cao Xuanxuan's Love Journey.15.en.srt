21
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,320
Sir, this is it.

22
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,840
The severed leg was found here.

23
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,520
Azure Dragon of the East.
Vermillion Bird of the South.

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,680
Xianchi of the West.

25
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,800
Black Tortoise of the North.

26
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,520
What does that mean?

27
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,960
Based on the divination,

28
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,960
this is the Black Tortoise's position.

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,080
The left arm was found

30
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,120
at the Vermillion Bird's position.

31
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,160
Master,

32
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,400
what can you tell us
from this information?

33
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,440
When a person's limbs

34
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,280
head, and torso

35
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,000
are scattered in six directions

36
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,160
for a Taoist spell,

37
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,760
the soul of the deceased can never
find peace in death.

38
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,480
This is cruel.

39
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,600
The legs and the two arms

40
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,840
were found over 4 kilometers apart.

41
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,360
Could the remaining parts

42
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,540
be 4 kilometers apart too?

43
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,400
Indeed.

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,640
Sir,

45
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,120
based on the location
and position you know,

46
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,080
could we locate the other body parts?

47
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,800
It wouldn't be a challenge.

48
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,160
It's in the southwest.

49
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:33,960
Sir!

50
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:34,760
Sir!

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,760
We found a head.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,880
It's in an abandoned kiln
in the southwest.

53
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,400
It's Master Zhai.

54
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,160
Just as I calculated.

55
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,360
Zijie.

56
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,160
He Chun.

57
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,120
It's done?

58
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,160
You're a grown-up man.

59
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,200
Why are you so scared?

60
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,760
I'm...

61
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,480
I'm not scared.

62
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,760
I...

63
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,720
I...

64
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,520
I was just messing with you two.

65
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,200
Is that so?

66
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,240
He Chun.

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,480
You called me a grown-up man.

68
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,360
Correct.

69
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,080
Would you prove it to me?

70
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,120
Fine, so be it.

71
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,240
All right,

72
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,120
let's begin.

73
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,120
Wait.

74
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,320
You certainly act fast, Magistrate Guo.

75
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
You've already

76
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,160
put the parts together.

77
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,200
How is your investigation,
Official Zhou?

78
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,440
It's confidential.

79
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,880
However, I must go through

80
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,520
the corpse examination report.

81
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,400
Master Zhai!

82
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,680
Master Zhai!

83
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,040
Master Diviner is incredible.

84
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,760
He even predicted this.

85
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,720
It's a shame poor Master Zhai

86
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,080
was mutilated.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,440
Fate and outcomes

88
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,240
were decided long ago.

89
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,720
It's written

90
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,120
in Master Zhai's fate.

91
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,560
This was inevitable.

92
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,840
It's best

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,760
you move on.

94
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
Master Diviner,

95
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,160
could we speak in private?

96
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,600
I have some questions.

97
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,600
Split up

98
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,800
and search for leads.

99
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,320
I want all the details.

100
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,720
Yes.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,040
Guo Zijie is known

102
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,440
to be Yan City's great detective.

103
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,360
However, he failed to find the leads.

104
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,840
We mustn't

105
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,520
underestimate him.

106
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,640
Understood.

107
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,760
Master Diviner.

108
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,400
My uncle was murdered.

109
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,560
I feel anxious.

110
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,240
Could you divine my fortune?

111
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,120
I think divination, fate,

112
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,040
and destiny differ.

113
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,920
I need to know

114
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,200
what you'd like to know.

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,200
From what I heard,

116
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,600
luck in gambling

117
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,520
reflects a person's fortune.

118
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,360
Winning means

119
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,040
the person's fortune is good.

120
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,480
I'd like to know

121
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,200
how my fortune will be

122
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,480
in the gambling parlor today.

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,640
I know of that theory.

124
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,600
Allow me to divine it.

125
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,400
Based on the divination,

126
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,800
you are bound

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,600
to win.

128
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,800
Moreover,

129
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,360
you will win exactly

130
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,640
ten taels of silver.

131
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,880
However,

132
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,560
this divination also shows

133
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,440
a certain

134
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,120
malicious outcome.

135
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,440
How to solve?

136
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,240
This divination

137
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,680
also shows me

138
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,200
that your residence

139
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,280
will see

140
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,560
bloodshed.

141
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,200
In other words,

142
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,600
Master Zhai isn't

143
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,200
the only one who dies in the residence.

144
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,920
(Gambling Parlor)

145
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,240
Zijie, this is it.

146
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:48,440
I'm going to win this time!

147
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,200
Place your bets!

148
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,200
- Big!
- Big!

149
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,520
- It's small!
- Small!

150
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,520
- Big!
- Small!

151
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,600
- Big!
- Big!

152
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,840
She actually won.

153
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,840
Zijie,

154
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,720
Master Diviner could be the real deal.

155
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,920
His prediction came true.

156
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,080
Is this really happening?

157
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,680
How can he predict a big win?

158
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,840
He mentioned

159
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,880
that aside from

160
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,440
Ouyang Mingyue winning big tonight,

161
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,960
the Zhai Residence will be in trouble.

162
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:15,574
- Small!
- Go small!

163
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,138
- Come on!
- Small!

164
00:09:17,138 --> 00:09:19,130
- Open it!
- Open it!

165
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,240
- Where are Xuanxuan and He Chun?
- Small!

166
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,360
- Keeping watch at the Zhai Residence.
- Open it!

167
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,840
Let's regroup.

168
00:09:25,472 --> 00:09:26,483
Big!

169
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:31,240
- Go big!
- Big!

170
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:35,960
Sir,

171
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,640
we work for Official Zhou.

172
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,320
Greetings.

173
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
We need some information.

174
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,280
Sure.

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,480
I remember the girl.

176
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,720
The poor girl

177
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,400
was orphaned at a young age.

178
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,160
To make it worse,

179
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,160
her parents' bodies were never found.

180
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,240
That is miserable.

181
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,040
So,

182
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,640
was the case ever solved?

183
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,200
Nope.

184
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,040
The parents and their remains
were never found.

185
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,360
It was a dead end.

186
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,720
Thanks for your time.

187
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,840
Yes. Have a nice day.

188
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:11,960
You!

189
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,280
Give it back now!

190
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,240
How can you prove

191
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,440
that she stole from you?

192
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,920
I don't care. It has to be her!

193
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,800
I lost it right after she arrived.

194
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,880
Sir.

195
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,480
What is it?

196
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,560
Is something wrong?

197
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,560
She accuses me of theft.

198
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,520
I always carried it with me.

199
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,160
But it went missing when she came.

200
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,420
So, who else could it be?

201
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Do you have proof

202
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,560
that I stole from you?

203
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,480
I don't care.

204
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,240
Give it back.

205
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,360
It was gone after you came.

206
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,880
My Young Lady,

207
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,520
calm down.

208
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,320
Young Madam Guo

209
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,160
would never steal from you.

210
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
I know it's her!

211
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,560
Who else could it be?

212
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,280
Come,

213
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,420
walk her back to her room

214
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,000
and search it.

215
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,440
Go on.

216
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,160
But...

217
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,720
Just do a thorough search.

218
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,240
Young Madam Guo,

219
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,080
my deepest apology.

220
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,480
My Young Lady

221
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,560
has a bad temper.

222
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,240
I hope

223
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,560
you don't take it to heart.

224
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,640
It's all right.

225
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,240
You may go now.

226
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,240
Are you sure?

227
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,760
Yes.

228
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,280
What brings you here?

229
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,200
Master Diviner was incredible.

230
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,040
He predicted

231
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,520
Ouyang Mingyue would win big tonight.

232
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,680
By the way,

233
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:19,920
he also said

234
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,100
the Zhai Residence

235
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,320
would see bloodshed.

236
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,000
Yes.

237
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,600
We came back to see

238
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,480
if everyone was safe.

239
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,440
Six-line divination
to discard body parts.

240
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,360
Six-line divination
to locate the body parts.

241
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,340
It's nothing unusual.

242
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,840
But precise fortunetelling?

243
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,720
I don't buy it.

244
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,160
What is it?

245
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,880
Is there more trouble?

246
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,880
It's happening!

247
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,520
Let's have a look.

248
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,600
Young Lady Mingyue!

249
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,440
Young Lady Mingyue!

250
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,040
Mingyue.

251
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,000
Young Lady Mingyue!

252
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,000
What's the matter?

253
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,280
Mingyue?

254
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,760
What's wrong?

255
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,440
A poisoned dart.

256
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,680
Oh heaven!

257
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,040
How is this happening?

258
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,080
Someone is trying to murder

259
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,720
the entire Zhai family!

260
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,640
Ouyang Mingyue,

261
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,640
did you see the assailant?

262
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,960
I didn't get a good look.

263
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,200
A shadow dashed by the window.

264
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,800
However,

265
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
I think I saw

266
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,320
a Taiji Eight Trigrams Chart
on his back.

267
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,800
A Taiji Eight Trigrams Chart?

268
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,440
A Taoist robe?

269
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,480
It has to be the Taoist priest.

270
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,360
Him?

271
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,640
Could it...

272
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,360
really be the priest?

273
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,200
Who is that?

274
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
A good friend of Master Zhai.

275
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,920
He was very close

276
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,200
with Master Zhai.

277
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,840
He was a Longhu Priest.

278
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
I need you

279
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,640
to bring the priest in tomorrow.

280
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,080
Let her get some rest.

281
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,320
Get a healer.

282
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,620
Watch your steps.

283
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,080
Do you think

284
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,680
the Longhu Priest did this?

285
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,840
He is the only one we haven't

286
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,240
investigated.

287
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,600
But he took a great risk attacking her

288
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,360
while we were all here.

289
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
Things don't add up.

290
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,480
We'll ask when he's here.

291
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,520
Drink up.

292
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,320
Sure.

293
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,320
Zijie.

294
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,400
Don't worry.

295
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,060
We'll bring the Taoist priest back.

296
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,360
See you later.

297
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,800
You're in a good mood today.

298
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,800
The lost jade pendant was found.

299
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,840
Of course I feel happy.

300
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,960
What jade pendant?

301
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,680
It's nothing.

302
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:36,840
Eat up.

303
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:53,900
(Zhengqing Temple)

304
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,600
The Longhu Priest should be here.

305
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,720
Let's check inside.

306
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,200
Let's go.

307
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,480
Split up.

308
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,360
All right.

309
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,800
Did you find anything?

310
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,600
Nope.

311
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,640
There's a house.

312
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,080
Come.

313
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
We should search there.

314
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,800
A dismemberment diagram.

315
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,560
The Six-Line Eight Trigram.

316
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,600
No doubt about it.

317
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,240
The murderer was here.

318
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,880
You fell for it!

319
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,680
Open the door!

320
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,120
Open the door!

321
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
It's not opening.

322
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,800
What now?

323
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
Look for another exit.

324
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,560
The windows!

325
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,560
The windows are sealed shut!

326
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,280
The only way out

327
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,600
is to break them.

328
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,360
You'll both die here!

329
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,040
Poison gas!

330
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,240
Stay still.

331
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,280
He Chun!

332
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,800
He Chun!

333
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,360
He Chun!

334
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,400
He Chun! Wake up!

335
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,320
He Chun!

336
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,040
He Chun!

337
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,960
Longhu Priest!

338
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,720
He Chun! He Chun!

339
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,680
Wake up!

340
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,780
Magistrate Guo.

341
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,200
I think you are

342
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,360
completely mistaken.

343
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,440
Enlighten me.

344
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,160
Nothing adds up.

345
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,120
Your train of logic doesn't make sense.

346
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,320
They should be back by now.

347
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,120
But I think your reasoning
doesn't make sense.

348
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,080
Impossible.

349
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,080
Sir,

350
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:55,920
bad news.

351
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,760
This is Weiyan's fan!

352
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,160
Where was it found?

353
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,840
In the woods.

354
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,800
Hold up.

355
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,080
It's the middle of the night.

356
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,880
What?

357
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,280
Do you hope to search aimlessly?

358
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,200
Besides,

359
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,280
the place is crawling with bandits.

360
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,300
It's not safe to bring
Young Madam Guo along.

361
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm better at rescue missions.

362
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,240
I should go.

363
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,440
Can we even trust you?

364
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,400
Don't worry.

365
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,400
We may be rivals,

366
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
but lives are at stake.

367
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,240
I will

368
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,800
rescue your friends.

369
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,800
A sound plan.

370
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,520
We're counting on you.

371
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,040
Long He.

372
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,200
Let's go.

373
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,840
Make sure you bring them back!

374
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,280
Don't worry.

375
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,920
He Chun!

376
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,080
Sun Weiyan!

377
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,560
He Chun!

378
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,080
Sun Weiyan!

379
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,960
Sun Weiyan!

380
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,760
Sun Weiyan!

381
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,440
Sun Weiyan! Wake up!

382
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,200
Open your eyes, Sun Weiyan!

383
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,400
He Chun?

384
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,080
Are you all right?

385
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,640
You're burning up.

386
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,560
He Chun.

387
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,040
Do you think

388
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,440
we'll die here?

389
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,320
Don't be silly.

390
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,040
The poison gas didn't kill us.

391
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,400
The poison isn't very strong.

392
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,360
We'll be all right.

393
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,200
Actually,

394
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,640
I wouldn't mind dying here

395
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,360
with you by my side.

396
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,720
Silly.

397
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,200
Let me get you to the bed.

398
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,640
Come on.

399
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,880
Still feeling cold?

400
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,000
Feeling better?

401
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,760
Why are you so nice to me?

402
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,160
I...

403
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,320
Embarrassed?

404
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:33,920
Not at all.

405
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,160
You are.

406
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,400
No!

407
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,680
Yes, you are.

408
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,760
Aren't you

409
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,240
feeling sick?

410
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,440
So...

411
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,520
You...

412
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,600
Why are you here?

413
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,040
To rescue you.

414
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,760
Are you hurt?

415
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,120
I...

416
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,160
We're all right.

417
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,480
Thank you, Official Zhou.

418
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:37,960
Oh no!

419
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,680
Go after the Longhu Priest now!

420
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,280
Long He, let's go.

421
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,360
Go!

422
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:45,880
Come on.

423
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:28,420
(Zhai Residence)

424
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,400
Zijie! Xuanxuan!

425
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,200
Are you all right?

426
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,960
Welcome back.

427
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,280
I brought your friends back.

428
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,760
Thank you.

429
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,640
The Longhu Priest was cunning.

430
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,960
We fell for his trap.

431
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,740
We owe

432
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,040
Zhou Shaoliang our lives.

433
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,080
Get some rest.

434
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,160
We'll talk later.

435
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,000
This way.

436
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,240
Are you hurt?

437
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,320
No.

438
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,920
(Peace and harmony for the people)

439
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,120
Did you kill them?

440
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,720
I've killed many.

441
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,520
Which do you mean?

442
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,000
Stop playing dumb.

443
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,800
I meant Master Zhai!

444
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,800
The old fool?

445
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,440
I killed him. So what?

446
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,520
Did he cross you?

447
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,320
He robbed me of my wife.

448
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,160
So why were you two so close

449
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,440
not long ago?

450
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,920
The old man knew his days were numbered.

451
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,160
He asked me for a way
to have immortality.

452
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,880
I befriended him to have my revenge.

453
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,360
So,

454
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,640
I pretended to have let go
of the old grudge.

455
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,400
Why did you use the six-line divination

456
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,600
to scatter Master Zhai's body parts?

457
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,800
Only because

458
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,840
I want him

459
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,400
to suffer eternally in the afterlife.

460
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,240
Where were you

461
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,520
last night?

462
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
Zhai Residence.

463
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,920
After years of grudges,

464
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,280
killing him wouldn't have been enough

465
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,760
to bring me peace.

466
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,920
Very well.

467
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,960
Since you've confessed,

468
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,200
a death sentence awaits.

469
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,180
(Yan Administrative Office)

470
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,920
Sir,

471
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:37,920
you've caught

472
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,080
the real murderer.

473
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,520
You'll certainly be promoted

474
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,000
to the new Secretary.

475
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,600
Fool!

476
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,520
I don't understand.

477
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,960
The Longhu Priest confessed

478
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,920
to killing Master Zhai.

479
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,480
Do you really think

480
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,240
he's the real murderer?

481
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,720
If he didn't do it,

482
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,920
why did he confess?

483
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:06,920
Well?

484
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,060
Does your head hurt?

485
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,120
Yeah.

486
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,760
I feel awful.

487
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,080
He Chun,

488
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,400
do you think

489
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
I'm dying soon?

490
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,560
Dying?

491
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,400
Great.

492
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,840
How about a proper send-off?

493
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,560
That...

494
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,640
That won't be necessary.

495
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,440
Strange.

496
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,560
I feel like I'm all healed.

497
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,640
What is this?

498
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,920
Wind-repellent powder.

499
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,000
For fever and headache.

500
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,360
Why didn't you

501
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,360
give me this sooner?

502
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,400
I get it now.

503
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,000
You just went out to get it for me.

504
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,840
I knew you cared about me.

505
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,640
Xuanxuan?

506
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,160
Xuanxuan.

507
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,960
What about the priest's trial?

508
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,720
What?

509
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,960
Did he not confess?

510
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,000
He confessed,

511
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,320
but something felt off.

512
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,520
How so?

513
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,880
Things are going

514
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,240
too smoothly.

515
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,720
Understood.

516
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,960
I'll investigate.

517
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,080
I'm counting on you two.

518
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,520
I must figure this out.

519
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,840
How are you supposed to investigate?

520
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,800
The protocol is always the same.

521
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
How else can it be?

522
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,280
Leave it to me.

523
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,520
You?

524
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,040
What's your plan?

525
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,960
I have a brilliant idea.

526
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,600
Start a head count.

527
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,200
One.

528
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:58,880
Two.

529
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,680
Three.

530
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,480
Four.

531
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,600
Five.

532
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,400
Six.

533
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:02,960
Seven.

534
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,560
Eight.

535
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,680
All right.

536
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,200
This is what I've trained you for.

537
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,280
Next, I'll need you

538
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,200
to do me a favor.

539
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,440
Keep an eye on everyone
in the Zhai Residence.

540
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,040
Do a good job,

541
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,040
and you be rewarded

542
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,800
with this delicious dish every day.

543
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,327
- I want one!
- Me too!

544
00:29:21,407 --> 00:29:22,338
I want one!

545
00:29:22,578 --> 00:29:24,889
- I want one too!
- Same here!

546
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,810
- I want that!
- Give me one!

547
00:29:27,007 --> 00:29:27,800
I want one!

548
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,520
- Impressive.
- I want one!

549
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,040
Why would they listen to you?

550
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,320
Because

551
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,160
I used to be one of them.

552
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,440
Spare me some food.

553
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,560
Cursed beggar!

554
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,320
You bumped into me!

555
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,200
Cursed beggar!

556
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,600
Eat this!

557
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,240
Eat this!

558
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,920
Spare him a few coins.

559
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,760
Let's go.

560
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,040
This is all you got?

561
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,560
No dinner for you!

562
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,320
Boss,

563
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,640
this is the money we got today.

564
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,960
You two did a great job today.

565
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,680
A bun for each of you.

566
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,400
- Thank you, boss.
- Thank you, boss.

567
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,880
Eat up.

568
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,160
What now?

569
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
Do you want some?

570
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,800
Do you want a bun?

571
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,600
Keep this in mind.

572
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,400
Next time,

573
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,280
go out,

574
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,240
cry,

575
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,880
and beg.

576
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,460
Is that clear?

577
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,560
Act like a pitiful thing.

578
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,760
Show me how you do it.

579
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,840
If you don't get any coins,

580
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,760
you won't even

581
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,520
get a bun!

582
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:46,960
You...

583
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,440
Curse you!

584
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,720
Master Zhai was...

585
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,080
He was generous

586
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,440
and so kind.

587
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,360
You...

588
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,400
How could you kill him?

589
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:00,960
Thankfully,

590
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,440
you reap what you sow.

591
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,080
Heaven is punishing you!

592
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,880
You'll lose your head soon!

593
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,760
Not even ten thousand cuts
on your cursed body

594
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,960
can bring Master Zhai

595
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,200
back to life.

596
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,320
Your visiting time is up.

597
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,400
Sir,

598
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,280
we don't want trouble.

599
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:18,880
Please leave.

600
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,120
Cursed priest!

601
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,600
You deserve the worst death!

602
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,040
Do you notice it?

603
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,020
The investigation is slowly deviating

604
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,720
from Master Zhai's murder.

605
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,080
It feels like

606
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,360
someone is directing us.

607
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,960
Correct.

608
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,120
Zijie, Xuanxuan.

609
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,040
We have a new lead.

610
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,720
The Longhu Priest had no time
to commit the crime.

611
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,600
That night,

612
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,720
he was performing a ritual

613
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
at the Zhou Village.

614
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,120
I knew it.

615
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,200
What if

616
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,000
he is only acting as a scapegoat?

617
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,480
That connects all the dots.

618
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,880
He never wanted to harm

619
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,520
He Chun and Mr. Sun.

620
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,840
He left the evidence that could

621
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,880
be used against him.

622
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,000
Magistrate Guo!

623
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,520
Bad news.

624
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,960
The Longhu Priest killed himself.

625
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,200
What?

626
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,040
A suicide?

627
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,000
He Chun,

628
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,720
check the cell.

629
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,720
