Later,

35
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,960
when she comes over,

36
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
push her down from there.

37
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,720
Am I clear?

38
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,520
Listen.

39
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,520
If you do this well,

40
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
everything is negotiable.

41
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,360
All right.

42
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,720
But

43
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,520
you must not tell

44
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,560
anyone about this.

45
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,560
Here.

46
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,200
Take this.

47
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,280
Guo Zijie!

48
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,120
Go now.

00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,280

50
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,480

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,880
Sun Weiyan!

52
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,640
Xuanxuan.

53
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,560
What's the matter?

54
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,680
Where's Zijie?

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,240
We were separated when we
were searching for Li Ye.

56
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,520
But don't worry.

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,040
Li Ye is a weak scholar.

58
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,440
He Chun is a skilled martial artist.

59
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,600
It's easy to catch him.

60
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,500
I don't think this matter
is that simple.

61
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,560
You're right.

62
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,720
Li Ye has been to this mountain.

63
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
If he wants to hide,

64
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,780
He Chun will need to put in some effort.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,880
Think about it.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,960
Li Ye was always present

67
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,480
when we were investigating the case.

68
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,960
But we never suspected him.

69
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,200
Why did he run?

70
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,240
I think

71
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,120
this might be

72
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,640
because Li Ye...

73
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,640
You...

74
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,120
It was she
who disrespected Fox Spirit.

75
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,440
She's trying to get us all killed!

76
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,120
There's no such thing as Fox Spirit.

77
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Fox Spirit doesn't exist.

78
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,200
Yes, there's no Fox Spirit.

79
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:13,880
It's you!

80
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,260
You're trying to get us all killed!

81
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:15,700
It's you!

82
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,300
She's the one.

83
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,420
We must not let her go!

84
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,000
What?

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,920
Listen to me!

86
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Don't let her go!

87
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,320
- Let me explain.
- We can talk.

88
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,760
It was her.

89
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,700
- She wants us killed! Catch her!
- Listen to me!

90
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,600
Don't let her go!

91
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,360
Catch her!

92
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,160
Everyone! Calm down!

93
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,680
Catch her!

94
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,640
She's trying to kill us!

95
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,200
Listen to me!

96
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,940
We won't spare you.

97
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,220
We can't let her leave!

98
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,120
Get her!

99
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,920
Don't let her go!

100
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,040
Don't run!

101
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,800
Don't let her escape!

102
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,000
Get her!

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,920
It's you!

104
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,040
She's the one
who tried to get us killed.

105
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,600
It was her!

106
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,040
Get her!

107
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,080
Help!

108
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,280
Get her!

109
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,680
Let me go!

110
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
Don't let her get away!

111
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,600
Keep this a secret.

112
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,940
Let's get out of here.

113
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,500
Come on.

114
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,380
Let's go.

115
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,240
It's done.

116
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,800
Don't let this matter get out.

117
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,480
Understood.

118
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,340
You can go now.

119
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,880
Sun Weiyan!

120
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,760
Zijie!

121
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Have you found them?

122
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,520
He Chun went to find Li Ye.

123
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,840
What about Xuanxuan?

124
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,080
Xuanxuan?

125
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,640
I thought you suspected her.

126
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,160
So I took the chance

127
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,400
to help you

128
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,300
get rid of her.

129
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,320
What did you do?

130
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,080
I found several villagers

131
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,160
to push her off the cliff.

132
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,560
Zijie!

133
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,020
Better to wrong a thousand

134
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,000
than let one escape!

135
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,860
You're ridiculous!

136
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,720
How stubborn.

137
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,840
Help!

138
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,000

139
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,760

It's something I should do.

169

175
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,520
Let me explain.

176
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,520
Explain?

177
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,180
Are you going to say
it's related to your brother?

178
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,760
I admit your behaviors were different

179
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,440
after you woke up.

180
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,600
I did suspect you were sent by Brother.

181
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,600
So...

182
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:41,920
So...

183
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,080
So

184
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,880
you put all these baseless charges

185
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,720
on an innocent person

186
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,240

00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,360
and everything about you is an act!

191
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,280
You've never trusted me, have you?

192
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,640
Fine.

193
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,200
I don't ever want to see you again.

194
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,840
Let me go!

195
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,720
Xuanxuan,

196
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,600
listen to me.

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,880
Yes, I admit.

198
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,320
I hesitated.

199
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,560
It was my fault.

200
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,560
I didn't trust you enough back then.

201
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,480
But I came around after a while.

202
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,520
I don't care if Brother sent you

203
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,120
or if you were Cao Xuanxuan from before.

204
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,000
I could never do something like that

205
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,320
because you were the one

206
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,000
who showed up and stayed by my side

207
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,320
when I was at my lowest.

208
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,320
Xuanxuan!

209
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,900
Magistrate Guo!

210
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,360
Xuanxuan.

211
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,200
Magistrate Guo.

212
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,900
Something bad has happened!

213
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,480
Master Luo Ji's body is missing.

214
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,080
Sir,

215
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,660
you need to go and check right away!

216
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,840
Sir.

217
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,880
What happened?

218
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,240
Check on Xuanxuan for me.

219
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,640
All right.

220
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,160
Sir.

221
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,480
Sir.

222
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,880
Let's go.

223
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,840
Young Master Zilu.

224
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,840
Where do you think you can run to?

225
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,960
What is it?

226
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,960
Liu Ying failed.

227
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,760
Useless thing.

228
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,840
I thought she might still be
of some use.

229
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,780
The people involved
in the Lyu Residence case

230
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,040
are all important figures.

231
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,180
One of the victims
is the Imperial Envoy.

232
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,440
If Guo Zijie solves this case,

233
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,580
he will be praised
by His Majesty.

234
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,940
Young Master Zilu,

235
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,320
stop hesitating.

236
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,320
Guo Zijie, that fool.

237
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,240
I thought I would just get rid
of Cao Xuanxuan

238
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,960
to spare him since we are brothers.

239
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,360
But who would have thought...

240
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,160
Things have already come to this point,

241
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,720
and there's no turning back.

242
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,620
Young Master Zilu,

243
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,100
everything is ready.

244
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,720
We only need your command.

245
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,560
Go.

246
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,920
Rest assured.

247
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:19,880
This time,

248
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,760
it'll be done fast without a trace.

249
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
Guo Zijie,

250
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,040
you jerk.

251
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,880
Who's there?

252
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,640
Xuanxuan!

253
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,560
Xuanxuan!

254
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Xuanxuan!

255
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,600
Sir!

256
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:46,840
Bad news.

257
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,200
Xuanxuan is in danger.

258
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:00,840
This way.

259
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,600
Right here.

260
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,900
Let's split up and search.

261
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,100
- All right.
- All right.

262
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,440
Xuanxuan!

263
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,640
Xuanxuan!

264
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,800
(Xuanxuan,)

265
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,840
(wait for me.)

266
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,440
(I'll save you.)

267
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,240
Xuanxuan!

268
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,600
Xuanxuan!

269
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,520
Xuanxuan!

270
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,880
You're finally here.

271
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,000
Xuanxuan!

272
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,840
I'm the one you want.

273
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,800
Let her go.

274
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,760
You're pretty clever.

275
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,580
No wonder someone wants to kill you.

276
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,480
Since you're aware of the situation,

277
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,400
we don't want to escalate things either.

278
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,240
If you drink this,

279
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,360
we'll let her go right away.

280
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,480
It's Bloodfang Toxin again.

281
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,640
Stop wasting time

282
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,920
before we kill her.

283
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,560
Fine.

284
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,920
I'll drink it.

285
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,800
Tell the one who ordered you

286
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,760
to take care of my father.

287
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,440
Get her!

288
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,320
Xuanxuan.

289
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,400
Xuanxuan!

290
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,640
Xuanxuan!

291
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,640
Xuanxuan!

292
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,040
Run!

293
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,440
After them!

294
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,400
He Chun!

295
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:31,920
Zijie!

296
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,320
This way!

297
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,520
Over here.

298
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,800
Come in.

299
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,640
Young Master Zilu.

300
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,640
My darling baby.

301
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,440
Come quickly.

302
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,080
Come here.

303
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,400
Come and sit down.

304
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,920
What's the matter?

305
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,040
Someone's here.

306
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:29,960
Get out.

307
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,880
Yes, Young Master.

308
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,960
Don't disturb me.

309
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,800
Yes, Young Master.

310
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,040
Come on.

311
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,720
All you have

312
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,240
is your eloquent mouth.

313
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,840
You can say all the sweet things.

314
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,560
If you really missed me,

315
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,040
why didn't you come find me sooner?

316
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,160
That shrew

317
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,600
is always at home.

318
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,720
You know that.

319
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,400
Good thing

320
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,920
my old man is celebrating his birthday.

321
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,960
So she went back
to invite her father over.

322
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,080
Otherwise,

323
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,480
we wouldn't be able to meet.

324
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,280
So

325
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,040
about what you said before,

326
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,560
does it still count?

327
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,040
Before?

328
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,120
Yes, it still counts.

329
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,840
But do you think
your father will listen to you?

330
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,200
Dujuan,

331
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,000
don't worry.

332
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,520
Guo Zijie

333
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,360
will never come back.

334
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,280
After this, I'll be the head

335
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,800
of the Guo family.

336
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,120
When that time comes,

337
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,240
I'll divorce that shrew

338
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,200
and marry you.

339
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,920
No!

340
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,800
Xuanxuan.

341
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,460
You're safe now.

342
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,680
I'm here.

343
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,640
Did you save me?

344
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,100
Magistrate Guo was there too.

345
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,360
Don't mention him.

346
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,920
I don't want to hear his name.

347
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,480
Xuanxuan,

348
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,760
are you feeling better?

349
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,660
Are you disappointed

350
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,920
that I'm still alive?

351
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:28,960
Xuanxuan,

352
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,280
don't say that.

353
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,200
I...

354
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,840
Didn't you want to kill me?

355
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,880
Why did you save me?

356
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,960
Let me explain.

357
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,200
Enough with your explanation.

358
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,400
I don't want to hear it.

359
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,400
Once the mastermind is found,

360
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,000
I'll settle everything

361
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,600
and go back to where I belong.

362
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,040
Just leave.

363
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,260
I don't want to see you.

364
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,280
Sir,

365
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,680
why don't you head back first?

366
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,480
Leave her to me.

367
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,120
Don't worry.

368
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,560
I'll head back then.

369
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,080
If there's anything,

370
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,880
let me know.

371
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,360
I'm leaving now.

372
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,920
After I left,

373
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,320
did anything happen?

374
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:36,920
Yes.

375
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,760
Luo Ji's body went missing.

376
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,160
Missing?

377
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,560
How could it suddenly disappear?

378
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,720
(With Wang Jing's usual method,)

379
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,600
(she is skilled at using magic tricks)

380
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,840
(to create deceptions.)

381
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,600
(Magic tricks?)

382
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,160
(If we piece everything together...)

383
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,840
Luo Ji died

384
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,480
in a locked room.

385
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,440
Mr. Zhao

386
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,680
was locked up

387
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,320
because of the prints on his shoes.

388
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,040
Later,

389
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,040
he was killed in a locked room too.

390
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,800
And the Second Madam
who seems to be in a confused state.

391
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,520
If all this is part of a magic trick...

392
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,600
I've figured it out.

393
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,320
I need to investigate this.

394
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,920
Xuanxuan,

395
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,840
you just woke up.

396
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,830
Your health is important.

397
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,640
You should leave

398
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
the investigation to me.

399
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,960
But...

400
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,720
It's all right.

401
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,440
I'll ask Sun Weiyan to go with me.

402
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,960
Be safe.

403
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,560
Lie down.

404
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,760
Who's there?

405
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,440
It's me, Young Master.

406
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,160
Didn't I say not to disturb me
if it's nothing urgent?

407
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,820
But...

408
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,840
Wait for me, darling.

409
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,660
Speak up if you have something to say.

410
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,360
Didn't you say you will handle

411
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,400
this fast without a trace?

412
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,360
Why are you focusing on him?

413
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,200
Think about it.

414
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,240
Over the years,

415
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,360
the Guo family's managers

416
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,800
have always followed your lead.

417
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,720
What do you even know?

418
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,400
My father's birthday is coming up,

419
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,360
and he plans to announce

420
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,800
his successor.

421
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,880
Do you understand?

422
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,720
Even if Master Guo wants Guo Zijie

423
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,920
to take charge,

424
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,160
those managers

425
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,880
won't listen to him.

426
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,520
You...

427
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,560
Useless.

428
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,320
I'm sorry.

429
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,200
Young Master Zilu,

430
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,120
it's inevitable.

431
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,840
Get lost.

432
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,120
You can get back to your business.

433
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,400
(Seems like)

434
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,520
(none of them can be left alive.)

435
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,760
May I ask

436
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,320
how Mr. Zhao's martial arts skills are?

437
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,480
My master comes

438
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,520
from a martial arts background.

439
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,320
He could kill five or six people

440
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,680
without breaking a sweat.

441
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,560
So he has remarkable skills.

442
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,680
So tell me.

443
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,600
If someone pressed a bloody handprint

444
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,360
onto your master's clothes,

445
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,200
would he not be aware of it?

446
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,720
Well,

447
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,460
that's impossible.

448
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,520
Absolutely impossible.

449
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,600
Second Madam,

450
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,800
go back and rest.

451
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,400
Don't kill me.

452
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,300
Let's check it out.

453
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,200
Let's go get some rest.

454
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,240
Second Madam.

455
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,440
Second Madam.

456
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,600
How about getting some rest?

457
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,120
Come.

458
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,360
Help her sit down.

459
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,280
Here.

460
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,560
Sit.

461
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
Don't kill me.

462
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,640
Second Madam,

463
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,720
I heard

464
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,600
you ran into a ghost.

465
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,440
Ghost...

466
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,000
Don't kill me.

467
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Second Madam.

468
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,600
I don't want to die with you.

469
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,160
Second Madam, don't be scared.

470
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,400
I don't want to die with you.

471
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,760
Did the ghost you see

472
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,520
look like this?

473
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,040
Yes, that's the one!

474
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,840
It's all right.

475
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,560
Let me go.

476
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,200
Please spare me.

477
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,960
Spare me!

478
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,120
I don't want to die with you!

479
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,780
Second Madam!

480
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,560
Don't run!

481
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,940
Something is fishy here.

482
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,600
Don't you think there are
too many suspicious points

483
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,780
in what the two maids said

484
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,160
and Second Madam's reaction?

485
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,400
Let's go and check the kitchen.

486
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,520
All right.

487
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,920
Mr. Wang,

488
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,860
you're still working?

489
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,200
You are...

490
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,400
What are you making?

491
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,400
The leftover lamb meat

492
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,920
from that day.

493
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,680
The lamb from that day, right?

494
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,840
We only had lamb soup that day

495
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,960
and didn't see any lamb blood.

496
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,400
Our young master doesn't like it.

497
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,840
So after slaughtering the sheep,

498
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,800
we usually give the blood
to the neighbors.

499
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,240
Then how did you handle the blood

500
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,240
from that day?

501
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,240
It's here.

502
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,760
We've had so many guests

503
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,640
these past few days

504
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,360
that we didn't have time
to give it to the neighbors.

505
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,760
Where did the lamb blood go?

506
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,960
I think Da threw it away.

507
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,000
Why are you here?

508
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,360
Both of us

509
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
are hungry.

510
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,040
We want to find something to eat.

511
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
Thank you.

512
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,160
Xuanxuan?

513
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,200
Why are you standing out here so late?

514
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,880
Didn't I tell you to get proper rest?

515
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,680
It's too stuffy inside.

516
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,100
So I came out for some fresh air.

517
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,340
By the way, we've checked.

518
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,800
We asked Mr. Zhao's attendants.

519
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,280
Mr. Zhao is skilled
in martial arts.

520
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,380
So he was lying.

521
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,000
We also met Second Madam.

522
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,640
I showed her Luo Ji's portrait.

523
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,280
Her reaction was extremely unusual.

524
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,480
We even went to the kitchen.

525
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,740
The sheep's blood from the slaughter
that day has mysteriously vanished.

526
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,800
I think

527
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,720
I know who the killer is.

528
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,480
Come closer.

529
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,560
All right.

530
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,840
We'll do this tomorrow.

531
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,720
What about Magistrate Guo?

532
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,720
Go to bed.

533
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:12,900
(Lyu Residence)

534
00:27:17,695 --> 00:27:18,470
You're in the way.

535
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,440
Hello, Magistrate Guo.

536
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,120
Magistrate Guo.

537
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,280
Magistrate Guo.

538
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,480
Magistrate Guo.

539
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,780
Good morning, everyone.

540
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,800
What is

541
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,640
going on here?

542
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,960
Have a seat first.

543
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,320
I know who is the killer.

544
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,880
Mrs. Guo,

545
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
who is the killer?

546
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,780
That's right.

547
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,520
Who is it?

548
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,480
Luo Ji.

549
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,680
Isn't Luo Ji dead?

550
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,640
How is that possible?

551
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,600
We clearly saw a lot of blood on him.

552
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,480
That's right.

553
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,600
Mr. Lyu, you are quite fond
of mutton, right?

554
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,000
We've asked the cook from the kitchen.

555
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,860
The blood
from the sheep slaughtered that day

556
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,340
had mysteriously disappeared.

557
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,280
Are you saying

558
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,960
the blood we saw was sheep's blood?

559
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,320
But Mr. Zhao clearly checked the body.

560
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,000
Yes, he did.

561
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,400
What if Mr. Zhao

562
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,760
and Luo Ji were colluding?

563
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:16,720
What?

564
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,800
Are you saying

565
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,800
Mr. Zhao

566
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,080
was lying?

567
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,800
We've questioned

568
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,000
Mr. Zhao's attendants.

569
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,800
We've discovered

570
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,640
that Mr. Zhao is skilled
in martial arts.

571
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,760
So no one could have printed

572
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
blood on his clothes

573
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,380
without him being aware of it.

574
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,040
So there's only one possibility.

575
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,880
He did it himself.

576
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,920
The person Luo Ji intended to kill

577
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,840
was Mr. Zhao.

578
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,560
He deceived Mr. Zhao into believing

579
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,880
they were going
to kill their mutual enemy together.

580
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,880
So the two of them formed an alliance.

581
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,240
Luo Ji faked his death.

582
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Mr. Zhao locked himself in his room.

583
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,880
No one would believe

584
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,240
a dead person can kill.

585
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,360
But Mr. Zhao didn't expect

586
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,920
Luo Ji intended to kill him.

587
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,740
You can get back to work.

588
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,080
I don't get it.

589
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Even if

590
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,280
Luo managed to gain Mr. Zhao's trust,

591
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,120
the door lock was not damaged.

592
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,760
How did he get in?

593
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,880
He has a point.

594
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,780
That's right.

595
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,760
How did he enter?

596
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:27,280
Can't make sense of this.

597
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,320
Could it be...

598
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,520
Lyu,

599
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,240
is it you?

600
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,480
Ridiculous!

601
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,160
Don't speak nonsense

602
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,400
at a time like this.

603
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,840
How could it be me?

604
00:29:38,729 --> 00:29:39,240
He's right.

605
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,760
Lyu, look at this letter.

606
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,380
(Dear Xiuniang)

607
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,000
I got this letter

608
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,560
from Second Madam.

609
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,560
Second Madam has lived alone
for many years

610
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,120
and had long been involved with Luo Ji.

611
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,800
Luo Ji used Second Madam

612
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,400
to change the unbreakable lock
in secret.

613
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,120
(Everything is going well.)
When Second Madam

614
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,600
(I'm achieving everything.)
heard Luo Ji died,

615
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,660
she wanted to seek revenge.

616
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,840
She just happened
to witness Luo Ji killing Mr. Zhao

617
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,840
and thought she had seen a ghost.

618
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:00,960
That's why

619
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,680
she ended up in such a state.

620
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,960
So that was what happened.

621
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,840
I see.

622
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,160
That was unexpected.

623
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,520
So that was how it went.

624
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,960
We were friends.

625
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,800
Why would Luo want

626
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,440
to kill Mr. Zhao?

627
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,080
I understand now.

628
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,520
It must be because of that incident.

629
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,560
Mr. Zhao was assigned a case back then,

630
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,960
which led to Luo Ji losing his parents.

631
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,280
But later, the case was overturned
and corrected.

632
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,320
Mr. Zhao never wanted

633
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,520
Luo Ji to know

634
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,080
he handled that case.

635
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,000
But now it seems

636
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,840
Luo Ji found out.

637
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,040
But how did Luo fake his death?

638
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,480
We clearly saw his dead body

639
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,840
in front of us that day.

640
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,200
Guo Zijie,

641
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,440
carry the candle stand here.

642
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,680
Now.

643
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
The one at the entrance.

644
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,600
Make way.

645
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,360
This is the candle stand.

646
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,880
So it's...

647
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
It turns out...

648
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,120
It turns out to be a flat surface.

649
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,720
Incredible!

650
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,660
I didn't expect this.

651
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,480
Mrs. Guo is really something.

652
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,680
Good thing Mrs. Guo discovered this.

653
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,680
Magistrate Guo,

654
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,280
you've found yourself a great wife!

655
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:46,800
That's right.

656
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,200
She's really intelligent.

657
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,040
Ah, yes.

658
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,480
That explains everything, then.

659
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,200
Luo Ji.

660
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,320
This darn Luo Ji.

661
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,320
Where is he now?

662
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,960
Since the truth of this case
is now clear,

663
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,160
I'll issue an arrest warrant
throughout the city

664
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,220
to have him captured.

665
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,420
He won't be able to escape.

666
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,480
That's great.

667
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,180
- He won't escape.
- That's right.

668
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,280
When did you figure it out?

669
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:07,960
I'm hungry.

670
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,040
Let's eat something.

671
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:12,790
She's...

672
00:32:12,913 --> 00:32:13,240
Why...

673
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,440
What's wrong with her?

674
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,720
Zijie,

675
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,520
we really shouldn't offend women.

676
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,740
(The task is complete.
Please provide the next move.)

677
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,600
You've been working hard

678
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,800
over the past few days.

679
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,280
You're welcome.

680
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,680
Actually,

681
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,120
we have a request.

682
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,320
Mrs. Guo,

683
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,380
please tell me what it is.

684
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,960
Well...

685
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,840
Well,

686
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,840
we heard that a Western artist
visited your residence.

687
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,000
We would like to meet him.

688
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,280
That Western artist?

689
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,240
He prefers peace and quiet.

690
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,780
So I let him stay at a different place.

691
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,440
How about this?

692
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,200
I'll send someone to invite him over.

693
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:03,880
Everyone,

694
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,760
please take a seat

695
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,560
and have some rest.

696
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,760
I'll be right back.

697
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,680
Thank you.

698
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,640
Thank you.

699
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,000
Come.

700
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,720
Take a seat.

701
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,440
Magistrate Guo!

702
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:31,960
He's here.

703
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,080
I'm back.

704
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,560
Hello.

705
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,200
Here he is.

706
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,800
So you're the Western artist?

707
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,440
Yes, I am.

708
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,720
May I know

709
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
why you want to see me?

710
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,120
Yes, we wanted to see you.

711
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,960
Please wait for a moment.

712
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,280
I'll leave if it's nothing.

713
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,200
Wait.

714
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,440
We want you to verify something.

715
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,440
Please wait for a while.

716
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,280
That's right.

717
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,360
This one.

718
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,440
It's here.

719
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:58,880
Well,

720
00:33:59,200 --> 00:33:59,920
may I know

721
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,400
if you've seen such a thing?

722
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,520
I made it.

723
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,140
What is it that you'd like to say?

724
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,160
Did you really make this?

725
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,520
Who else could do this besides me?

726
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,160
Then can you tell me

727
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,800
what inspired you to build this?

728
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,880
Young lass,

729
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,800
how many artists have you actually met?

730
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,200
How dare you doubt me?

731
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,240
I'm not going to entertain
any of your questions.

732
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,000
Mr. Lyu,

733
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,700
is this why you asked me to come over?

734
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,720
I'm leaving.

735
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,440
Mister!

736
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,320
Mister!

737
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,400
Master,

738
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:43,880
are you worried

739
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,800
about Young Master Zijie?

740
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,880
When I was young,

741
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,080
I looked forward to my birthday.

742
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,280
But as I get older,

743
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,160
I'm afraid of celebrating it.

744
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,960
I'm worried
if Zijie can't make it this time,

745
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,320
he won't have another chance

746
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,240
to attend my birthday.

747
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,400
Master,

748
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,200
please don't say such things.

749
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,200
There's still next year.

750
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,040
Next year?

751
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,360
Next year, huh?

752
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,840
Next year...

753
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,640
(Zijie,)

754
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,800
