21

Magistrate Guo's wife.

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,100
My memories
and the methods used in the crime

23
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,340
were all taught by her.

24
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,285
- Young Madam Guo?
- Young Madam Guo?

25
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,658
How could it possibly be her?

26
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,140
How dare you!

27
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,700
In the court of law,

28
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,000
how can you spout such nonsense?

29
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,960
When did Xuanxuan
ever teach you these things?

30
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,500
Before this incident,

31
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,820
I didn't know her at all.

32
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,620
Magistrate Guo,

33
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,060
this matter involves your wife.

34
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,820
You should recuse yourself.

35
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,900
Ouyang Mingyue,

36
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,740
you claim Young Madam Guo
instructed you.

37
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,860
Do you have any evidence?

38
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,140
Of course I do.

39
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,860
Present it.

40
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,460
Such crucial evidence,

41
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,740
I wouldn't carry it with me.

42
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,820
I've hidden it in a safe place.

43
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,020
Where is it?

44
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,980
I'll send someone to retrieve it.

45
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,460
I don't trust them.

46
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,540
This matter

47
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,460
can only be disclosed to you personally.

48
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,620
Long He.

49
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,740
Take the two suspects

50
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,420
to the back hall
for further questioning.

51
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,060
Court dismissed.

52
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,620
Official Zhou.

53
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,540
Wait a moment.

54
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,700
Xuanxuan,

55
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,260
are you all right?

56
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,340
I'm fine.

57
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,540
It's just strange.

58
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,180
I have no dealings with her.

59
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,980
Why is she insisting

60
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,060
that I was behind it?

61
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,300
She's facing imminent death.

62
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,920
She's trying
to drag someone down with her.

63
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:57,900
Exactly.

64
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,460
We are upright and above suspicion.

65
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,860
I'd like to see

66
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,300
what evidence she can produce.

67
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,220
It's fine.

68
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:11,820
Let's go.

69
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,460
Xuanxuan.

70
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,380
Magistrate Guo.

71
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:16,380
This...

72
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,876
Young Madam Guo...

73
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,749
How could this be?

74
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,381
How could it possibly
be Young Madam Guo?

75
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,020
(Yan Administrative Office)

76
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,180
(Justice and Integrity)

77
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,500
(Remove the limbs, stop the bleeding,
then remove the head and kill.)

78
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
This is indeed
the method used in the crime.

79
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,460
But on this letter,

80
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,820
there is no official seal or stamp.

81
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,780
How can you prove it's Young Madam Guo?

82
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,660
Please examine the characters
in the letter carefully.

83
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,300
Are they all incorrect characters?

84
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,380
Simplified characters...

85
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,140
Exactly.

86
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,460
It seems the person
who wrote this letter

87
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,700
is not literate.

88
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,700
Many of the characters here

89
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,140
are missing strokes.

90
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,260
Sir, as you've lived in the capital
for a long time, you may not know.

91
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,880
These are not incorrect characters.

92
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,260
They are simplified characters.

93
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,380
Though I've never met
Young Madam Guo before,

94
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:05,860
(Letter)

95
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,060
these simplified characters

96
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,500
are her unique creations.

97
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,240
She is the only one who can write them.

98
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,500
Everyone in Yan City can vouch for me.

99
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:14,898
What does this mean?

100
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,220
The person who harmed me is her.

101
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,500
I do know
how to write simplified characters.

102
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,020
But I'm not the only one

103
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,980
who can write them.

104
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,300
Then, Young Madam Guo, tell us.

105
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,620
Who else can write them?

106
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,100
Could it be Magistrate Guo?

107
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,780
After all, you are husband and wife.

108
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,740
It wouldn't be surprising
if you taught him.

109
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,180
With that logic,

110
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,180
it'd be possible
for Magistrate Guo to frame me.

111
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,220
I plead with you
to seek justice for me.

112
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,020
Young Madam Guo,

113
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
what else can you say?

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,140
The handwriting
on the letter is not mine.

115
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,940
Sir,

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,200
please verify it in court

117
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,360
and prove my innocence.

118
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,780
I recognize Xuanxuan's handwriting.

119
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,260
This is not hers.

120
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,520
Official Zhou,

121
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,860
she has solved many unusual cases

122
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,100
and created her own characters.

123
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,220
Is forging handwriting

124
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,380
that hard for her?

125
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,300
If I were forging,

126
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,200
why would I use simplified characters?

127
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,980
To make it obvious to you?

128
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,180
How would I know?

129
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,740
It's been said that Young Madam Guo
was once a child bride.

130
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,940
Perhaps she never learned

131
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,420
to write properly in the first place.

132
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,580
Maybe that's why
she invented these characters.

133
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,280
Sir,

134
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,180
I've already said,

135
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,140
the letter wasn't written by me.

136
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,020
I ask for some time

137
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,580
to uncover the truth.

138
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,460
I will stake my official hat on it.

139
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,980
I will get to the bottom of this.

140
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,620
They're trying to stall for time

141
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,580
to destroy evidence.

142
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,700
Please, sir, seek justice for me.

143
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,100
Please, sir, investigate thoroughly.

144
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,780
This...

145
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,620
Grand Mentor has arrived.

146
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,740
Make way!

147
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,020
Sir.

148
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,580
Yan City

149
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,420
is truly a marvelous place.

150
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,860
It has allowed me,

151
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,380
an old man, to see such wonders.

152
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,740
Mentor,

153
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,860
why are you here?

154
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,780
If I hadn't come,

155
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,100
how could I have encountered

156
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,020
such an injustice?

157
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,340
I am ashamed, mentor.

158
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,260
Mentor, please.

159
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,060
With me here,

160
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,220
no one can harm you.

161
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,940
Thank you, sir,
for seeking justice for me.

162
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,940
(It turns out
you've always been by my side.)

163
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,380
Guards!

164
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,420
Take Cao Xuanxuan

165
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,500
and place her in the prison.

166
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,580
Sir, where are you going?

167
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,140
Move aside!

168
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,740
Sir, you can't go.

169
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,600
Get out of the way!

170
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,580
Young Master!

171
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,200
I know you're eager
to save Young Madam,

172
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,820
but we need to make a careful plan.

173
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,980
Young Master.

174
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,240
I can't wait another moment.

175
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,490
- Young Master!
- Young Master!

176
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,260
- Calm down!
- Sir!

177
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,580
Zijie, you can't go.

178
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,900
Are you stopping me as well?

179
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,560
Zhou Qin is hiding in the shadows.

180
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,640
If you go,
you'll fall right into his trap.

181
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,220
Do you want all of us to be captured?

182
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,260
Move aside.

183
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,820
I said, move aside!

184
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,580
Sun Weiyan!

185
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,940
You go ahead and try if you dare!

186
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,060
What if I insist on going today?

187
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,540
Mr. Sun.

188
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,500
Guo Zijie,

189
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,060
I'm not as clever
as you or Cao Xuanxuan.

190
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,860
I don't have He Chun's skills either.

191
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,340
But I know,

192
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,980
at times like this,

193
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,580
we must remain calm.

194
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,540
Zhou Qin is hiding in the shadows.

195
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,640
We just discovered
that Master Zhai's death

196
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,600
is connected to him.

197
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,800
And he couldn't wait to strike.

198
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,920
What does that tell us?

199
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,820
It means
we're getting closer to the truth.

200
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,380
If you get caught too,

201
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,860
what will happen to Cao Xuanxuan?

202
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,620
Young Master.

203
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,300
That's right.

204
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,260
Young Master,

205
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,020
stay calm.

206
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,660
Yes.

207
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,580
Zhou Qin personally killed Master Zhai.

208
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,620
This proves

209
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,820
that Master Zhai had

210
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,700
important evidence in his possession.

211
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,260
What about that piece of tree bark?

212
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,900
We haven't found anything yet.

213
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,380
It seems Zhou Qin's evidence

214
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,420
is hidden in that piece of tree bark.

215
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,180
I have a suspicion.

216
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,660
If Master Zhai's death

217
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,420
was because he had

218
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,740
evidence against Zhou Qin,

219
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,180
then what about the other victims?

220
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,980
Were those really random crimes?

221
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,100
Xuanxuan once said

222
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,780
Zhou Qin's true motive

223
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,360
might be more than just challenging her.

224
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,780
Are you suspecting

225
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,180
that those who died

226
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,620
were intentionally targeted by Zhou Qin?

227
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,060
But those rural villagers...

228
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,780
Not really.

229
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,340
Mr. Zhao was a third-rank official.

230
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,660
And I heard

231
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,020
that he disagreed
with Zhou Qin politically.

232
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,940
He once criticized

233
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,620
Zhou Qin's arguments as sheer nonsense.

234
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,140
But now that you mention it,

235
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,230
it reminds me of something.

236
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,580
When I was in the capital before,

237
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,900
I heard

238
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,380
Mr. Zhao once got drunk

239
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,680
and angrily cursed Zhou Qin,

240
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,740
causing quite a scene.

241
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,020
It happened at a banquet.

242
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,340
There were many witnesses.

243
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,460
It was two years ago,

244
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,200
at Zhou Qin's birthday celebration...

245
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,820
But that doesn't make sense.

246
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,300
Mr. Zhao isn't the only one who died.

247
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,300
Butler.

248
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,700
Young Master.

249
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,140
I have a question.

250
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,540
Did my father
go to the capital two years ago?

251
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,380
Young Master,

252
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,820
you know as well as anyone

253
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,020
that Master's health

254
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,020
hasn't allowed him to travel that far.

255
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,140
Zijie,

256
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,260
we all know

257
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,060
Uncle Guo

258
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,580
passed away because...

259
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,780
This matter shouldn't have

260
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,300
anything to do with Zhou Qin.

261
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,780
I understand.

262
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,340
You may leave.

263
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,540
Yes.

264
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,420
Zijie...

265
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,020
I'm fine.

266
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,020
You should get some rest too.

267
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,380
Xuanxuan,

268
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,260
what should we do now?

269
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,260
Everyone, leave us.

270
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,500
Yes, sir.

271
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
Should I call you Cao Xuanxuan

272
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,340
or Zhou Na?

Here,

305
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,380
have some water.

306
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,260
Thank you, Professor.

307
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,340
I must say, Zhou, the great writer,

308
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,060
you've been here since early morning.

309
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,900
By the way, Professor,

310
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,580
this book you gave me

311
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,900
is absolutely brilliant.

312
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,660
Of course.

313
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,020
Today, my inspiration

314
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,180
has been endless.

315
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,360
I haven't written
ten thousand words in a day for ages.

316
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,000
Look.

317
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,780
This is something

318
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,280
excavated from an ancient city site.

319
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,960
It hasn't been publicly announced yet.

320
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,420
I know you love these things,

321
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,540
so I secretly

322
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,180
brought it over for you to see first.

323
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,980
But I think

324
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,740
this doesn't seem like an ancient book.

325
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,220
What do you mean?

326
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,220
I mean, it contains

327
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,780
a lot of modern elements.

328
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,980
For example,

329
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,420
principles of physics

330
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,260
and

331
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
magical sleight of hand.

332
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,860
It doesn't feel like an ancient book.

333
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,760
It feels more like

334
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,640
a modern replica.

335
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,500
Ancient wisdom

336
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,860
is something that we modern people

337
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,660
still find hard to match.

338
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,580
Take, for example,

339
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,460
the pyramids,

340
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,260
Atlantis,

341
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,140
and the Nazca Lines.

342
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,980
There are countless mysteries

343
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,980
that remain unsolved.

344
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,260
It's not surprising

345
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,620
to find advanced crime-solving methods

346
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,580
in ancient times.

347
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,780
Besides,

348
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,140
who am I?

349
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,620
Have you ever
seen me misjudge something?

350
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,140
That's not what I meant,

351
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,860
Professor.

352
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,020
While reading this book,

353
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,260
I thought Guo Zijie

354
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,260
was especially brilliant.

355
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,980
If he were in modern times,

356
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,020
I'd love to spar with him.

357
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,260
Professor,

358
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,680
I haven't finished reading yet.

359
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,660
You...

360
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,420
Professor Zhang.

361
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,380
Professor Zhang.

362
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,580
Is Zhou Na here?

363
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,860
Oh, my goodness,

364
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,260
I've been looking for you all day.

365
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,140
What's wrong?

366
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,500
Do you know what day it is today?

367
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,420
What day is it?

368
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,980
Miss Zhou,

369
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,900
tonight is your book signing event.

370
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,620
Look, I'm busy.

371
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,460
I don't have time.

372
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,380
You can handle it for me, all right?

373
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,560
How can you
just brush off something like this?

374
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,700
Your fans have been queuing
since early this morning.

375
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,900
If they don't see you,

376
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,300
it'll all be for nothing.

377
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,520
Can you really bear that?

378
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,220
Fine.

379
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,180
I'll go.

380
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,180
That's the spirit.

381
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,020
Let's go.

382
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,380
How can you casually take artifacts?

383
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,140
Come on,

384
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,780
return it to me.

385
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,340
Professor,

386
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,200
I haven't finished it.

387
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,860
Once I'm done,

388
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,760
I'll return it to you.

389
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,200
Okay?

390
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:25,740
Very soon.

391
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,700
Professor,

392
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,500
don't worry.

393
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,140
I'll keep an eye on this artifact

394
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,480
and make sure it's safe.

395
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,300
We're really going to be late.

396
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,860
You're impossible to deal with.

397
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,940
I'll take good care of it.

398
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:35,740
Goodbye!

399
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,380
Make sure to take good care of it.

400
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,340
Finish reading it,

401
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,740
then return it to me immediately.

402
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,540
No problem.

(Hechuan City Archaeological Institute)

404
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,080
My goodness,

405
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,620
hurry up.

406
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,620
We're going to be late!

407
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,620
Stop reading.

408
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,420
All right.

409
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,020
I get it.

410
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,100
No...

411
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,620
Wait...

412
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,960
You're going dressed like that?

413
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,660
What's wrong with it?

414
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,540
It looks fine.

415
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,660
Fine,

416
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,300
but Wang Jing is definitely

417
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,880
going to be dressed extravagantly today.

418
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,500
You'll just end up being overshadowed.

419
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,180
I rely on my talent,

420
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,220
not on those

421
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,340
flashy things.

422
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:06,900
Come,

423
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,860
let's set off.

424
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,700
All right.

425
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,580
Dear fans,

426
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,580
please settle down.

427
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,660
The signing event is about to begin.

428
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,220
Please queue up in an orderly manner

429
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,060
and wait a moment.

430
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,540
Thank you.

431
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,780
Miss Wang Jing,

432
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,060
your new book has now

433
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,300
reached a million sales.

434
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,500
When can we expect

435
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,820
your next work to be released?

436
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,300
You can look forward to it soon.

437
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,220
It'll be ready soon.

438
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,060
That's wonderful!

439
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,460
Wait.

440
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,640
What are you doing with that?

441
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,640
Leave it in the car.

442
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,580
Handle it carefully.

443
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,380
Hey,

444
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,940
please keep an eye on this for me.

445
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,580
Don't let anyone touch it.

446
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,020
All right?

447
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,260
Thank you.

448
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:57,840
Let's move.

Dear fans,

452
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,820
the popular author Zhou Na

453
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,220
has now arrived at our venue.

454

Hello, everyone.

Let's give her a warm welcome.

In addition, our Miss Zhou Na

457
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,460
has not disappointed our wait.

458
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,940
We kindly ask all fans

459
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,300
to maintain order at the venue.

460
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,380
Thank you all.

Hello, everyone.

462
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,820
Thank you for waiting.

I'm Zhou Na.

464
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,220
Zhou Na!

465
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,220
I really like you!

466
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,220
You're so pretty!

467
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,340
Thank you.

468
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,500
Nana,

469
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,540
I really like you!

470
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,100
Nana!

471
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,860
Can we begin?

472
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,420
Yes.

473

Dear fans,

474
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,460
good evening, everyone.

Good evening!

476
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,380
Welcome, everyone,

477
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,620
to our exploration of suspense.

from renowned authors Zhou Na

481

and Wang Jing.

482
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,020
Bravo!

in an orderly manner

488
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,820
to get your books signed.

489
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,740
Can you sign for me?

490
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,100
Nana, can you sign for me?

491
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,380
I really love your work!

Thank you.

493

Thank you for your support.

494

Thanks.

495
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,900
Nana, can you sign for me?

496
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,620
Of course!

497
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,780
I'll always support you.

498
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:21,980
Thank you.

499
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,380
Miss Zhou,

500
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,820
when is your next book coming out?

501
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,780
Very soon.

502
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,920
I'm already working on it.

503
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,540
That's great!

504
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,020
Thank you, Miss Zhou.

505
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:30,890
Miss Zhou Na,

506
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,100
you've been the King of Mystery

507
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,400
for three consecutive quarters.

508
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,440
How do you feel about it?

509
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,580
I'm, of course,
grateful for everyone's support.

510
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,580
I'll continue to work even harder.

511
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,740
Miss Zhou,

512
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,800
can you add a personalized note
to your signature?

513
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,540
Sure.

514
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,420
Thank you.

515
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,620
So envious.

516
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,660
The world has truly changed.

517
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,100
Someone who only writes
beginner-level mystery novels

518
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,780
can still be crowned
the King of Mystery.

519
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,100
Adding romance subplots

520
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,220
to mystery novels?

521
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,180
It's a disgrace to the mystery genre.

522
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,020
Not like Miss Wang, the great writer,

523
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,380
who deliberately shows off

524
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,120
and forces logic into her stories.

525
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,020
Her works are filled
with exaggerated fake haunting.

526
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:06,940
Exactly.

527
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,020
Thank you, Miss Zhou.

528
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,140
You...

529
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,340
I can't be bothered
to stoop to your level.

530
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,740
Some readers

531
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,540
just enjoy consuming trash.

532
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,780
Who are you calling trash?

533
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,660
What's going on?

534
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,130
Apologize to us now! I'm telling you!

535
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,860
Who are you calling trash?

536
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,460
Everyone, calm down.

537
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,140
Please stay calm.

538
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,620
(Book Sharing Event)
How can you say like that?

539
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,080
Exactly!

540
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,420
Wang Jing, watch out!

541
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,420
- Nana!
- Nana, Nana!

542
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,820
- Nana!
- Nana, Nana!

543
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,860
Call 110!

544
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,260
Call an ambulance!

545
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,940
Hurry, call now!

546
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,220
Wake up!

547
00:23:06,476 --> 00:23:07,938
Quick, quick!

548
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,500
Help her!

549
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Hurry up!

550
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,860
Wake up!

551
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,980
Zhou Na, Zhou Na!

552
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,780
Wake up!

553
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,980
Wake up!

554
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,420
So it's you.

555
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,340
Who else would it be?

556
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,380
It could only be me.

557
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,420
Weren't you always so clever?

558
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,780
I've been right by your side all along,

559
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,100
yet you've only
just figured it out today.

560
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,220
I have no grudge against you.

561
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,460
Why are you targeting me?

562
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,900
No grudge, you say?

563
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,860
All these years, you've overshadowed me.

564
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,460
And you have the audacity
to claim no grudge?

565
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,740
I've worked so hard to get here.

566
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,100
This is my world.

567
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,740
But then you showed up,

568
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,940
destroying everything

569
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,300
I worked so hard to build.

570
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,140
Don't you think

571
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,340
you deserve to die?

572
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,620
You've killed so many innocent people.

573
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,900
The one who deserves to die is you.

574
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,300
Innocent?

575
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,340
Who's innocent?

576
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,580
Anyone who stands
in my way deserves to die.

577
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,620
Look at you now.

578
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,980
Do you still think
you can see me brought to justice?

579
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,060
What justice?

580
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,900
Whose justice?

581
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,660
Here, I am the justice.

582
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,260
Zhou Na,

583
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,660
this round

584
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,820
belongs to me.

585
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,060
What are you planning to do?

586
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,980
Can you smell it?

587
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,220
The scent of revenge.

588
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,020
Come back!

589
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,660
If you have something to say,

590
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,220
say it to my face.

591
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,460
Come back!

592
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,580
We are so fortunate
to have Grand Mentor today.

593
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,260
Who would have thought

594
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,660
all of this was orchestrated
by Cao Xuanxuan herself?

595
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,220
No wonder she could solve cases.

596
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,820
No wonder Grand Mentor said,

597
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,900
"Extraordinary people

598
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,900
solve extraordinary cases

599
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,220
and create extraordinary cases."

600
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,620
So that's what it meant.

601
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:29,740
Sir,

602
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,180
do you think

603
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,700
those past cases

604
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,420
were also her doing?

605
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:45,860
Mentor.

606
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,380
Why are you here?

607
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,020
Mentor.

608
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,060
(Returning to Origin)

609
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:54,740
Mentor,

610
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,100
what's this?

611
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,300
(Returning to Origin)

612
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,180
I wrote the wrong character.

613
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,620
What's the matter?

614
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,500
Mentor,

615
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,700
I have something to ask you.

616
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,260
Sir.

617
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,140
Sir.

618
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,620
Grand Mentor is here.

619
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,900
Shaoliang.

620
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,500
Mentor.

621
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,900
Why are you daydreaming?

622
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,300
It's nothing.

623
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,340
(Escort Criminal Cao Xuanxuan
to the capital on the third of July)

624
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,640
Cao Xuanxuan will be escorted
to the capital in two days.

625
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,380
Execution will follow after autumn.
This...

626
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,940
What's the problem?

627
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,860
There are still many unclear aspects

628
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,260
in this case.

629
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,020
The evidence is conclusive.

630
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,580
How is it not clear enough?

631
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,060
Lord Su's honor guard
has already arrived in Yanzhou.

632
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:56,860
Do you intend

633
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,060
to let such a trivial matter
disturb Lord Su?

634
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,060
If His Majesty were to lay blame,

635
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,740
you and I, as master and student,

636
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,860
would not be able to bear it.

637
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,220
Or

638
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,580
do you

639
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,100
not trust me?

640
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:12,980
I wouldn't dare.

641
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,660
Lord Su has only brought

642
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,020
five hundred soldiers
to Yanzhou for the ancestral rites.

643
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,380
I have already

644
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,260
submitted a petition

645
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,540
to allow you

646
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,220
to take charge of Yanzhou's affairs.

647
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,300
With fewer attendants by his side,

648
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,540
you must dedicate yourself entirely

649
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,780
to ensuring no errors occur.

650
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,920
Lord Su is conducting ancestral rites
on behalf of the Emperor.

651
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,040
There is no fixed number
of accompanying troops.

652
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,660
Mentor.

653
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,300
How do you know

654
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,300
he only brought five hundred men?

655
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,580
As someone in a high position,

656
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,100
how could I remain ignorant?

657
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,260
If I weren't constantly vigilant,

658
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,540
those with ulterior motives would have

659
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,660
exploited my oversight long ago.

660
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,580
Enough.

661
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,300
Let's not discuss this further.

662
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,820
In any case,

663
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,260
you must prepare yourself well

664
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,780
to receive Lord Su.

665
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,580
Whatever happens,

666
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,740
do not let Cao Xuanxuan's case

667
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,940
reach his ears.

668
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,260
If this matter is handled well,

669
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,900
it will certainly earn you merit
in His Majesty's eyes.

670
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,540
The Secretary

671
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,320
of Ministry of Justice position

672
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,500
will soon be yours.

673
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,100
Thank you for your guidance, Mentor.

674
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:07,020
(Criminal Cao Xuanxuan.
Guilty of heinous crimes)

675
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,400
(To be escorted to the capital...)

676
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,060
What excellent tea.

677
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,380
All right.

678
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,580
It's getting late.

679
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,420
You should rest early.

680
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,860
(Document)

681
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,060
(Temporary Imperial Abode)

682
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,520
Your Highness, please calm down.

683
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,880
(Temporary Imperial Abode)

684
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,500
By order,
I have taken charge of Yanzhou.

685
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,620
I am here to greet Lord Su.

686
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,380
Official Zhou, please return.

687
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,880
His Highness is not seeing visitors.

688
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,020
If that's the case,

689
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,260
I won't disturb His Highness's rest.

690
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,020
Farewell.

691
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,140
Wait.

692
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,300
Official Zhou,

693
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,620
heed my advice.

694
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,260
You are young and accomplished.

695
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,020
Do not let riches blind you,

696
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,260
believing the wrong people.

697
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,500
What do you mean?

698
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,100
Long He.

699
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,380
Thank you for the warning.

700
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,420
Sir,

701
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,000
that person is interesting.

702
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,040
Who do you think
he meant by "wrong people"?

703
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,300
Could he mean Grand Mentor?

704
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,300
How absurd.

705
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,260
Long He.

706
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,340
Do something for me.

707
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,100
Write a letter to Guo Zijie in secret.

708
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,320
Inform him of everything happening here.

709
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,840
Make sure no one knows.

710
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:12,940
This

711
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:13,980
isn't right.

712
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,620
If Grand Mentor finds out...

713
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,300
Understood.

714
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,860
I will handle it right away.

715
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,100
(Guo Residence)

716
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,100
Attention, everyone.

717
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,700
Listen.

718
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,540
Xiao Xingguo,

719
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,140
you take this bark

720
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,700
and ask around over there.

721
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,260
You three, go to the end of the alley.

722
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:57,820
Li,

723
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,460
you take people to Hanzheng Street.

724
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,260
Everyone,

725
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,540
gather here

726
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,580
at noon.

727
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:04,980
Go on.

728
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,860
Miss,

729
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,500
have you seen a tree like this?

730
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,780
Never.

731
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,380
Sir, have you seen a tree like this?

732
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,080
No, I haven't.

733
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,420
Have you seen this?

734
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,100
No.

735
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,180
Have you seen this?

736
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,100
No, I haven't.

737
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,940
Sir, have you seen this tree before?

738
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,900
No, I haven't.

739
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,940
Have you seen this?

740
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,940
No, I haven't.

741
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,980
I really don't understand.

742
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,660
In such a big city like Yan City,

743
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,060
no one knows this tree bark.

744
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,540
Corrupt official.

745
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,300
When the tree falls,
the monkeys scatter.

746
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,460
Those who used to
call themselves friends with Zijie

747
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,220
now refuse to lend a hand.

748
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,100
It's all superficial connections.

749
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,300
You all may leave.

750
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,060
I want to be alone for a while.

751
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,740
Why are you here?

752
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,220
Lord Su has arrived in Yanzhou.

753
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,940
The day after tomorrow, Cao Xuanxuan
will be escorted to the capital.

754
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,900
How is Xuanxuan now?

755
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,760
I've delivered the message.

756
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,740
Do as you see fit.

757
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,740
I advise you
not to try appealing to Lord Su.

758
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,400
With the ancestral worship approaching,

759
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,100
the imperial abode
is heavily guarded.

760
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,400
No one is allowed in or out.

761
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,380
Along the route,

762
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,820
there are hidden sentries.

763
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,260
Thank you.

764
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,940
Magistrate Guo!

765
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:18,700
He Chun.

766
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,340
I heard

767
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,420
Long He was just here.

768
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,300
Are you all right?

769
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,500
I'm fine.

770
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,140
Once Xuanxuan
is escorted to the capital,

771
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,800
it will be even harder to save her.

772
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,960
I need you to help me with something.

773
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:35,980
All right.

774
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,260
Understood.

775
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:49,780
What's wrong?

776
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,040
Why do you look so flustered?

777
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,160
I'll tell you when I return.

778
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,460
Zijie,

779
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,140
where is she going?

780
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,020
Young Master Zijie,

781
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,300
why are you here?

782
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,180
I've been looking for you everywhere.

783
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,820
With Xuanxuan's fate uncertain,

784
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,100
any family matters

785
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,580
can be handled by yourself.

786
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,700
No.

787
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,440
Young Master Zijie,

788
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,380
yesterday you asked me
whether Master

789
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,420
had gone to the capital
in the past two years.

790
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,900
I remembered something.

791
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:24,740
What is it?

792
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,980
Tell us quickly.

793
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,780
Before he left, Master

794
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,060
wrote a letter to the capital.

795
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,220
To the capital?

796
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,300
When was this?

797
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,180
Who did he write to?

798
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,500
It was about three months ago.

799
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,060
At that time,
Miss Xuanxuan hadn't woken up yet.

800
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,980
Who was the letter addressed to?

801
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,580
I don't know.

802
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,740
But,

803
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,020
the capital is far away,

804
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,220
so Master

805
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,260
used a courier.

806
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,180
You should

807
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,540
go to the local courier station.

808
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,980
They might know

809
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,100
which agency it was sent to.
