21

That person is

22
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,740
likely to be Master Zhai.

23
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,060
He took the letter

24
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,580
to the Yan family for verification.

25
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,420
Coincidentally,

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,720
Yan's son, Fu Miao,
overheard the conversation.

27
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,500
He fled

28
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,540
after hearing that.

29
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,100
Have there been similar cases

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,900
in other prefectures in recent years?

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,620
You mean Yanzhou isn't the only place

32
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,780
involved in Zhou Qin's schemes?

33
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,980
Yes.

34
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,900
While I serve in
the Ministry of Justice,

35
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,340
every prefecture

36
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,500
delivers murder cases for review
every year.

37
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,900
Many people who attended

38
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,120
Mentor's birthday banquet
died of strange reasons.

39
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,140
Most of the cases

40
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,100
remain unresolved,

41
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,300
and only a few

42
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,900
were concluded as revenge killings.

43
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,620
I noticed something was off

44
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,780
but convinced myself

45
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,660
it was all just a coincidence.

46
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,500
By the way,

47
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,980
what about Chengxin paper?

48
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,340
Around seven or eight years ago,

49
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,140
before the late Emperor passed,

50
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,220
Mentor served in the imperial study.

51
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,780
Once,

52
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,100
while the late Emperor
was reviewing memorandums,

53
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,620
he accidentally tore a piece
of Chengxin paper.

54
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,580
Then, he gave it to Mentor.

55
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,220
Receiving the Chengxin paper
is a huge grace.

56
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,340
Mentor treasured it very much

57
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,180
and enshrined it in his study.

58
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,900
But one day,

59
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,540
the paper disappeared.

60
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,580
Mentor claimed he had put it away.

61
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,180
Come to think of it now,

62
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,860
the paper disappeared

63
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,860
around the period
of his birthday banquet.

64
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,820
Actually, Mentor

65
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,980
showed me the paper many times.

66
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,580
Even without the Yan family's
secret mark,

67
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,580
I could recognize the flaw in it.

68
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,740
I became his disciple
at the age of ten.

69
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,660
He is my mentor

70
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,420
and my father.

71
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,260
I have

72
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,740
never expected

73
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,140
he would do that.

74
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,060
I've been

75
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,100
lying to myself

76
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,500
that it was all just a coincidence.

77
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,220
But now...

78
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,020
Don't be too upset.

79
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,540
Actually,

80
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,220
this man

81
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,980
isn't your mentor anymore.

82
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,460
Your real mentor

83
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,460
is still the revered Grand Mentor Zhou

84
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,260
you once knew.

85
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,180
What does that mean?

86
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,380
That man is no longer
the mentor you knew.

87
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,700
Now that we've sorted out
all the doubts,

88
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,980
what should we do next?

89
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,560
Entering the capital
and filing a complaint with His Majesty?

90
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,620
Kill him.

91
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,660
Oh, my.

92
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,420
I know you're a skilled fighter,

93
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,620
but he's well-protected.

94
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,030
Are you sure you can eliminate them?

95
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,230
Can you even get close to him?

96
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,860
This matter isn't hopeless yet.

97
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,180
Lord Su has arrived in Yanzhou.

98
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,700
Zhou Qin is devious.

99
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,260
I'm afraid he's already cast
a huge trap.

100
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,300
If we go,

101
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,980
we'll walk right into it.

102
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,700
We can only take the risk.

103
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,460
Don't worry.

104
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,180
I'll help you.

105
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,880
I appreciate it, Official Zhou.

106
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,500
Who are you?

107
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,460
Long He.

108
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,020
They're with us.

109
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,880
Lord Su came to Yanzhou
for the ancestor veneration rites.

110
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,860
You're assigned to assist
with the ceremony.

111
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,460
This is as far as I can get you.

112
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,300
You're on your own for the rest.

113
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,000
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

114
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,320
Thank you so much.

115
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,940
(Yan Administrative Office)

116
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,500
Stand right there.

117
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,860
- Mentor.
- Sir.

118
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,220
Where were you?

119
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,830
Wang's Tailor Shop on the northern side
of the city was robbed.

120
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,740
Official Zhou and I went there
to investigate.

121
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,500
Is that so?

122
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,420
Yes,

123
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,260
Mentor.

124
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,180
Shaoliang,

125
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,300
you

126
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,460
lied to me.

127
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,180
Bring her here.

128
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,020
You replaced the woman with her.

129
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,020
Did you think you could fool me

130
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,860
with such a petty trick?

131
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,660
Mentor,

132
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,620
please stop making these mistakes.

133
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,780
How dare you!

134
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,340
How could I be in the wrong?

135
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,140
Have you forgotten
how I've treated you?

136
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,380
If I hadn't supported you,

137
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,100
would you be where you are today?

138
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,900
And yet,

139
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,660
you and Cao Xuanxuan

140
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,500
gang up on me.

141
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,060
Shaoliang,

142
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,300
you're indeed my dear disciple.

143
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,700
Very well.

144
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,100
In that case,

145
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,500
I will not

146
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,500
show you mercy.

147
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,060
You

148
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,220
and Cao Xuanxuan

149
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,180
will

150
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,060
go to hell together!

151
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,060
Guards.

152
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,860
Traitor,

153
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,180
you will die a terrible death!

154
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,940
Take them away.

155
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,060
Yes.

156
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,420
Mentor.

157
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,260
Mentor!

158
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,780
Move.

159
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,100
Please don't make another mistake.

160
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,800
Mentor, please stop while you can.

161
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,460
Mentor.

162
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,900
(Temporary Imperial Abode)

163
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,420
Be careful.

164
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:26,900
Mr. Sun.

165
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,660
Please do me a favor.

166
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,540
What's it about?

167
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,500
Me?

168
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,740
He Chun is a better choice
for this task.

169
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,900
I might mess it up.

170
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,180
He Chun is obviously strong

171
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,660
and might draw attention.

172
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,180
It's better if you handle it.

173
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:48,900
Understood.

174
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,260
Be careful.

175
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,800
(First, theft of Chengxin paper
is an act of disrespect.)

176
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,390
(Second, abetting murder
is unforgivable.)

177
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,640
(Judgment)

178
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,100
That's what happened.

179
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,420
Please decide, Your Highness.

180
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,060
Very well done, Zhou Qin.

181
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,980
I will not spare him.

182
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,060
Guards.

183
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:14,780
Yes.

184
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,220
Where is Zhou Qin right now?

185
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,700
Arrest him immediately.

186
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,780
After the ceremony ends,

187
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
I'll personally escort him
to the capital

188
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,740
to face the imperial verdict.

189
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,140
Yes.

190
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,180
Zhou Shaoliang,

191
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,900
who are you to say I'm wrong?

192
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,780
What wrong have I done?

193
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,740
It's them.

194
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,540
They all should die.

195
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,460
Only I

196
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,220
can make the world

197
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,620
a better place.

198
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,500
Speak up.

199
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,140
Sir,

200
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,580
it's planned on next month's
ancestor veneration rites

201
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,620
to assassinate Lord Su

202
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,540
and usurp the throne.

203
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,340
But now, something unexpected came up.

204
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,980
Yan City doesn't have
sufficient weapons.

205
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,800
Many of your supporters
from every prefecture

206
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,040
have yet to show their attitude.

207
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,060
We can't wait anymore.

208
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,660
Cao Xuanxuan probably

209
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,660
has already met with Lord Su.

210
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,140
If we don't take any action,

211
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,460
we'll be sitting ducks.

212
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,860
Proceed with my plan.

213
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,100
Yes.

214
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,620
Soldiers,

215
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,740
depart!

216
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,900
Yes!

217
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,620
We pledge loyalty to Grand Mentor!

218
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,460
We pledge loyalty to Grand Mentor!

219
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,180
I've long suspected

220
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,540
Zhou Qin

221
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,740
harbors ulterior intentions,

222
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,540
but I didn't have proof.

223
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,340
Knowing that His Majesty is young,

224
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,300
he constantly tricks him

225
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,460
with wicked schemes,

226
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,660
making His Majesty trust him completely.

227
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,260
If I hadn't stood in his way,

228
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,220
the imperial court

229
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,700
would've fallen under his control.

230
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,300
This time,

231
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,740
I'd like to see

232
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,540
how he gets away.

233
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,900
Guo Zijie,

234
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,140
well done.

235
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,720
You remind me of your late father.

236
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,620
Did you know my father?

237
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,780
Of course.

238
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,460
Yanzhou is where the dynasty begins.

239
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,760
If it weren't for your father's
recommendation,

240
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,780
do you really think

241
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,660
you could've earned this position
with money?

242
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,100
I'm ashamed of myself.

243
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,380
Never mind.

244
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,860
Both you and your father

245
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,140
have done well.

246
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,460
If it weren't for your father's guide,

247
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,220
I wouldn't have come to Yanzhou.

248
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,060
And you

249
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,900
brought me the proof.

250
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,260
You came here because of my father?

251
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,380
Why?

252
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,220
You didn't know?

253
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,860
I didn't.

254
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,340
Give it to me.

255
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:13,460
(Unknown individuals illegally forged
weapons. By Guo Shouyi)

256
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,300
Did my father write this?

257
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,060
Yes.

258
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,660
Was the letter my father sent

259
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,780
to the capital

260
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,580
for you?

261
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,420
That's correct.

262
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,500
The letter mentioned

263
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,620
someone in Yanzhou

264
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,740
illegally forging weapons.

265
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,260
Yanzhou is
where the imperial mausoleum stands.

266
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,940
If someone staged a coup here

267
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,780
and destroyed the imperial mausoleum,

268
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,880
I'm afraid the nation would collapse.

269
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:37,860
Your Highness,

270
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,500
do you believe in the legend
of the imperial mausoleum?

271
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,140
This is simply nonsense.

272
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,780
Even though you and I
don't believe that,

273
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,500
many others do.

274
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,060
As long as they believe,

275
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,980
the imperial mausoleum
mustn't be destroyed.

276
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:51,940
Unfortunately,

277
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,820
by the time I arrived,

278
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,700
Zhou Qin had already been alerted.

279
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,020
Thankfully,

280
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,660
you've brought me this evidence.

281
00:13:59,340 --> 00:13:59,940
Come.

282
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,580
Thank you so much.

283
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,740
Sir,

284
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,300
why did you involve yourself

285
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,540
in such a trivial matter

286
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,220
and land yourself in this state?

287
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,820
Long He,

288
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,980
seeking truth

289
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,900
is never a trivial matter.

290
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,660
Oh, my dear sir.

291
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,980
- Victory!
- Victory!

292
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,820
- Victory!
- Victory!

293
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,020
Long He,

294
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,700
what's the noise outside?

295
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,220
Sir,

296
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,260
it sounds like soldiers chanting
on the drill ground.

297
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,380
Could it be that Mentor...

298
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,780
Mentor, he...

299
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,780
What should we do now?

300
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:08,780
Sir.

301
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,020
Why is it taking so long
to capture him back?

302
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,980
I'll go check now.

303
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,100
What's wrong?

304
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,020
Your Highness!

305
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,180
I heard you're looking for me,
Your Highness.

306
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,020
There's no need for the hassle.

307
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,420
See?

308
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,820
Here I am.

309
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,300
How brazen of you!

310
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:50,900
Zhou Qin,

311
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,620
do you intend to rebel?

312
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,780
As for what I intend to do,

313
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,300
I suppose

314
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,140
you knew it long ago.

315
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,300
Guards,

316
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,820
arrest this traitor.

317
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,100
No one responding?

318
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,180
Allow me

319
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,660
to call out for you.

320
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,060
Guards!

321
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,700
Quick.

322
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,580
What are you doing?

323
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,140
Where is the key?

324
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,140
Let's go.

325
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,620
Shaoliang.

326
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,900
Shaoliang.

327
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,020
Official Zhou.

328
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,700
Sun Weiyan?

329
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,500
Long He,

330
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,780
wake up.

331
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:11,980
Hurry.

332
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,620
How did you get in here?

333
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,260
How? Grand Mentor's men guard here.

334
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,260
How did you get in here?

335
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,220
Most of Zhou Qin's men

336
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,260
have gone.

337
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,540
Also, we're here.

338
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,460
Yan City's yamen
is Magistrate Guo's turf.

339
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,460
Let's not stay here for too long.

340
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,260
Let's go out first.

341
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,020
Go.

342
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:25,980
Don't hesitate.

343
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,860
Let's go.

344
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,500
Move.

345
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:40,860
Follow us.

346
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,020
Hurry.

347
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:43,980
Quick.

348
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:48,700
Come.

349
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,380
Quick.

350
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:55,700
Quick.

351
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,300
Hurry up.

352
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,740
Here it is.

353
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,420
Here?

354
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,660
Is this the turf you mentioned?

355
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,780
Don't worry.

356
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,620
Please hear me out.

357
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,180
This is a safe exit.

358
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,540
If word gets out,
it's bad for Official Zhou's reputation.

359
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,900
Enough. Are you going or not?

360
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,320
Hurry.

361
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,020
Be careful.

362
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,860
Quick, Official Zhou.

363
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,220
Be careful.

364
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,060
Can this thing really fool
Grand Mentor?

365
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,620
Certainly.

366
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,300
Xuanxuan has never made wrong decisions.

367
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,140
I have faith in her.

368
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,352
What is this?

369
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,020
Can this really work?

370
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,620
Of course, it can.

371
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,940
Xuanxuan taught me this.

372
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,100
Show us, then.

373
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,900
Sure.

374
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,890
What's he doing?

375
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,540
Watch me.

376
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,243
No sound at all.

377
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,780
Can this really work, Mr. Sun?

378
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,900
Let me try again.

379
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:51,770
Will it really make a sound?

380
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:52,590
It doesn't work.

381
00:18:52,803 --> 00:18:54,120
This isn't working at all.

382
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Can it be useful?

383
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,300
Did you forget?

384
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,140
I

385
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,260
don't think so.

386
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,460
Then why is it not working?

387
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,540
Long He.

388
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:05,065
He's wasting time.

389
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:10,399
What's this?

390
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,880
Tell me about it.

391
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:13,770
It's huge.

392
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,820
Mentor

393
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,860
created one before.

394
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,300
But this seems

395
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,780
a bit different.

396
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,340
What's the difference about it?

397
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,600
I made this according to
the draft Xuanxuan gave me.

398
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,100
Long He,

399
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,180
get me a thicker copper wire.

400
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:10,820
It's done.

401
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,900
You can try it now.

402
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,140
All right.

403
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,900
My ears are almost deafened.

404
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,083
It's loud.

405
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,940
You're really something, Zhou Shaoliang.

406
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,140
Oh, no.

407
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,620
It's Official Zhou.

408
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,100
We'll definitely take Zhou Qin down.

409
00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:30,310
This is huge.

410
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,058
Well done.

411
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,940
Nice throne, Your Highness.

412
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,700
This chair

413
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,780
is finally mine.

414
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,260
Traitor,

415
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,980
His Majesty trusts you wholeheartedly.

416
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,340
How dare you commit treason!

417
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,780
His Majesty?

418
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,500
He's only a kid
who's wet behind the ears.

419
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,020
Does he deserve that title?

420
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,060
Oh, Lord Su.

421
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,020
I know

422
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,980
you intend to emulate the Duke of Zhou.

423
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,220
It's a shame that the kid
doesn't deserve your effort.

424
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,940
If I were you,

425
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,860
I'd seize the power

426
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,300
and make a great achievement.

427
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,740
You despicable traitor.

428
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,700
How dare you associate yourself with me?

429
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,260
Look at yourself.

430
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,420
You're now a prisoner.

431
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,080
When I lead the army
to destroy the imperial mausoleum,

432
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,220
I'll use you as a sacrifice
for my banner.

433
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,020
Cao Xuanxuan,

434
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,260
even though you hold evidence
against me,

435
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,620
what can you really do?

436
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,980
Can you solve

437
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,700
this game?

438
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,380
Not answering?

439
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,980
Oh, you're angry.

440
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,740
Cao Xuanxuan,

441
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,700
just compromise.

442
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,500
Admit

443
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,300
that you are

444
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,620
no better than me,

445
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,260
and I might just spare your life.

446
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,620
You know,

447
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,900
if I were the only one left

448
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,180
in this world,

449
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,820
just the thought of it

450
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,220
makes me feel lonely.

451
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,900
So I want to keep you alive.

452
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,380
I'll let you live

453
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,580
to witness

454
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,820
my success.

455
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,820
In your dreams!

456
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,100
Someone like you

457
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,140
will never succeed.

458
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,540
You!

459
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,060
You've lost.

460
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,700
You're utterly defeated.

461
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,300
Here and now,

462
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,540
I say what goes.

463
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,420
How about this?

464
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,180
You kneel and kowtow to me

465
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,660
until I'm satisfied.

466
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,380
Guards.

467
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,580
Don't you dare!

468
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,060
That's impressive.

469
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,100
A hero is saving a damsel in distress.

470
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,740
Cao Xuanxuan,

471
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,220
look at what kind of man

472
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,580
you've chosen.

473
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,740
Such a wimp!

474
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,580
And you.

475
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,460
Aren't you supposed to
be a skilled fighter?

476
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,220
With just a little
Bone-Softening Powder,

477
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,580
you can barely

478
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,220
stand on your feet.

479
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,260
Where's Sun Weiyan?

480
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,460
Did he flee?

481
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,820
He's a faithless fool.

482
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,580
Cao Xuanxuan,

483
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,300
look.

484
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,700
People around you

485
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,580
are nothing but ignorant fools.

486
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,380
To defeat you,

487
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,700
even fools like us

488
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,820
are more than enough.

489
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,620
What do you mean?

490
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,220
What's that noise?

491
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,780
Lord Su,

492
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,100
didn't you only bring 500 soldiers?

493
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,380
Someone like you

494
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,820
deserves to be eliminated by all.

495
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,700
Move.

496
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,140
Now.

497
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:04,900
How can this be?

498
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:05,980
Hurry.

499
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,660
Mentor,

500
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,100
please stop everything.

501
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,500
This is impossible.

502
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,100
It can't be.

503
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,420
Mentor,

504
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,860
I've already informed every prefecture.

505
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,380
More reinforcements are
on their way here.

506
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,380
Impossible.

507
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,220
Even if they do receive your word,

508
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,020
they couldn't have reacted so quickly.

509
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,420
Lord Su planned everything
ahead of time.

510
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,260
Long He,

511
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,140
take him away.

512
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,140
Yes.

513
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,340
Xuanxuan.

514
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:44,740
Watch out.

515
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:46,980
Come here.

516
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,860
Long He, stop him.

517
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,500
Let go.

518
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,420
Stay back.

519
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,660
Zhou Qin, let go of him.

520
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,340
Come any closer, I'll kill him.

521
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:53,820
Move.

522
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:54,860
Come with me.

523
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,340
Move aside.

524
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,060
Zhou Qin,

525
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,500
release him.

526
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,900
Stay back.

527
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,260
Don't come any closer.

528
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,820
Don't hurt him.

529
00:25:52,992 --> 00:25:53,660
Everyone,

530
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,540
the louder we shout,

531
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,700
the scarier our enemy will be.

532
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,540
Did you hear me?

533
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,300
Yes.

534
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,260
Carry on.

535
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,340
Come on.

536
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,180
Louder.

537
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,020
Shout.

538
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,940
(Temporary Imperial Palace)

539
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,620
You must be tired, Mr. Sun.

540
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,220
Take a rest.

541
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,020
No, I'm not.

542
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,300
Why did you stop?

543
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,660
Zijie?

544
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,540
You...

545
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,420
Zijie.

546
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,340
Mr. Sun,

547
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,580
is your foster father

548
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,260
doing well?

549
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,700
What are you talking about?

550
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,300
Of course, you can work harder

551
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,260
as you still have time.

552
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,020
But I wonder

553
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,380
if your foster father

554
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,340
can wait that long.

555
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,700
It was you!

556
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,740
Stand right there.

557
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,780
Zhou Qin.

558
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,940
Zhou Qin.

559
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,820
The man who asked me
to deliver the letter

560
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,620
was Zhou Qin.

561
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,180
Cao Xuanxuan,

562
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,780
I've told you before,

563
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,140
you always disregard logic.

564
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,900
When it comes to strategies,

565
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,340
you're never my match.

566
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,260
Match?

567
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,980
People like you

568
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,260
don't deserve to be my match.

569
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,540
The hand-crank generator
of the amplifier

570
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,300
is your idea, right?

571
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,860
Such an elementary trick.

572
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,380
Zhou Qin,

573
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,780
stop it.

574
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,660
Shaoliang,

575
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,020
are you addressing me

576
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,260
directly?

577
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,780
The greatest flaw about you is

578
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,940
that you can't lie.

579
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,380
From the moment you came in,

580
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,900
I knew

581
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,100
you were up to something.

582
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,140
Zhou Qin,

583
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,500
the moment you chose to do this,

584
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,300
you're no longer my mentor.

585
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,380
Very well.

586
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,100
Take all of them away.

587
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,520
(Temporary Imperial Palace)
Yes.

588
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,460
Quick.

589
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,660
Move.

590
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,180
Don't overthink.

591
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,900
Xuanxuan,

592
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,820
I'm to blame.

593
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,740
I messed it up.

594
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,820
All of you trusted me so much,

595
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,660
but I failed you.

596
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,340
It's not your fault.

597
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,020
You did your best.

598
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,900
I underestimated Zhou Qin.

599
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,940
Xuanxuan,

600
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,780
it's not your fault.

601
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,820
Zhou Qin is

602
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,780
just unconscionable.

603
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,180
He may be smart,

604
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,020
but he's been hurting others.

605
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,500
And you,

606
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,480
you're trying to protect more people.

607
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,780
Both of you are different
in the first place.

608
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,100
What if Zhou Qin succeeds

609
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,460
and usurps the throne?

610
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,180
He won't.

611
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,380
The chickens will come home to roost.

612
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,860
People like Zhou Qin

613
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,220
will be brought to justice one day.

614
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,380
I've noticed Zhou Qin

615
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,820
was up to something,

616
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,340
but he's also watching

617
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,700
my movements.

618
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,740
If I were to

619
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,100
bring a large troop from the capital,

620
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,740
someone

621
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,180
would surely

622
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,740
speak ill of me in front of His Majesty.

623
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,740
Not to mention,

624
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,740
I don't have proof.

625
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,540
The letter

626
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,660
from Guo Shouyi alone

627
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,300
isn't enough

628
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,740
to convict him.

629
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,820
That's why I came to Yanzhou

630
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,500
to see

631
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,420
if he would

632
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,180
take any action.

633
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,580
Once it's verified...

634
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,380
Your Highness,
you put yourself in danger

635
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,220
and used yourself as bait.

636
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,580
What's your plan?

637
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,420
Could it be that you've
made preparations?

638
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,500
I've stationed scouts in the city.

639
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,260
If they don't hear from me,

640
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,260
they will

641
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,100
return to the capital

642
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,300
to report to His Majesty

643
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,820
what happened in Yanzhou.

644
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,500
But the journey

645
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,580
to the capital and back is long.

646
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,860
I doubt Zhou Qin will keep us alive
until they arrive.

647
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,460
In the end,

648
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,980
hurrah if they find the truth.

649
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,020
If not,

650
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,460
we'll die for nothing.

651
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,340
Long He.

652
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,700
I

653
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,100
have an ambition

654
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,000
to bring peace and prosperity
to this nation.

655
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,300
As long as we hold evidence
against Zhou Qin,

656
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,020
it doesn't matter

657
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,580
whether I live or die.

658
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,220
We admire your resolve, Your Highness.

659
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,080
We admire your resolve, Your Highness.

660
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:52,860
Sir,

661
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,500
that's what happened.

662
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,580
Sir,

663
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,700
please be cautious.

664
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,700
Let them be.

665
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,420
They're only struggling for nothing.

666
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,180
When the day of my uprising comes,

667
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,940
they will be

668
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,260
the sacrifice of my banner.

669
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,189
- Give it here.
- Officer.

670
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:22,047
- I beg of you. I need it to cook.
- Hand it over.

671
00:32:22,265 --> 00:32:23,000
Officer.

672
00:32:26,003 --> 00:32:26,680
Go away.

673
00:32:27,094 --> 00:32:27,603
Officer.

674
00:32:29,305 --> 00:32:30,229
Please spare me.

675
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,500
What can we do? We need the big wok.

676
00:32:36,192 --> 00:32:38,040
I need it to cook.

677
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:40,018
Stop hitting.

678
00:32:40,352 --> 00:32:41,140
Officer.

679
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,220
From this day on,

680
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,620
whoever is found hiding metal items

681
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,700
must be executed.

682
00:32:47,203 --> 00:32:48,640
We're going to starve to death.

683
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,060
(Yan Administrative Office)
Officer.

684
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,060
Magistrate Guo!

685
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,236
Where's Magistrate Guo?

686
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:53,814
We must see Magistrate Guo.

687
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,494
Magistrate Guo.

688
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,369
Stand up for us, Magistrate Guo.

689
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,290
Come out, Magistrate Guo.

690
00:32:59,538 --> 00:33:01,339
We want to see Magistrate Guo.

691
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,927
Magistrate Guo.

692
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,100
You wish to see Magistrate Guo?

693
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,540
Magistrate Guo is in trouble himself.

694
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,140
Get lost,

695
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,660
or you'll get killed.

696
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,660
See?

697
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,300
Get lost now,

698
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,340
or this will be your fate.

699
00:33:28,018 --> 00:33:28,809
You'll be doomed.

700
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,380
You'll be doomed, corrupt official.

701
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,300
Stay sharp.

702
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,660
If anything goes wrong
during the ancestor veneration rites,

703
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,920
I'll hold you accountable.

704
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,340
Yes.

705
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,420
Sir,

706
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,460
as per your order,

707
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,620
all iron items in Yan City
have been confiscated.

708
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,080
Not a single household was left out.

709
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,620
How's the altar?

710
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,260
It'll be completed in no time.

711
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,100
It won't delay our plan.

712
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,580
Yes.

713
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,060
The seventh day of the ninth month

714
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,900
is the end of this dynasty.

715
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,980
I'd like them to see how I offer
Lord Su as a sacrifice for the banner

716
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,700
on the ancestor veneration rites.

717
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,540
As for Guo Zijie,

718
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,140
the people are expecting him
to deliver justice, right?

719
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,540
I want him to die a pathetic death

720
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,940
in front of everyone.

721
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,960
During the imperial ancestor
veneration rites

722
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,640
when the imperial mausoleum
is destroyed,

723
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,060
I'd like to see

724
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,620
who dares to defy me.

725
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,260
With your visionary foresight,

726
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,340
everything is within your control.

727
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,420
You may go.

728
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,340
Yes.

729
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,660
The weather

730
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,820
is nice.

731
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,420
Silence.

732
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,425
- Corrupt official!
- Corrupt official!

733
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,220
- Corrupt official!
- Corrupt official!

734
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,380
Corrupt official!

735
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,860
Corrupt official!

736
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:30,970
Corrupt official!

737
00:36:32,563 --> 00:36:33,509
Corrupt official!

738
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,940
You people!

739
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,018
You hypocrite.

740
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,980
How dare you oppose me!

741
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,020
Very well.

742
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,260
- I'll show you
- Corrupt official!

743
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,140
how you meet your demise
when you oppose me.

744
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,100
Bring them up here.

745
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,490
Isn't that Magistrate Guo?

746
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,596
Right.

747
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,890
Magistrate Guo is a good official.

748
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,260
- Right.
- Magistrate Guo.

749
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,260
Young Master.

750
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,210
It must be the doing
of the corrupt official.

751
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:09,232
Magistrate Guo.

752
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,380
It has nothing to do
with Magistrate Guo.

753
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,620
Your Highness,

754
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,700
you didn't expect

755
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,020
the day would come

756
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,780
when you'd kneel in front of me,
did you?

757
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,140
These riffraffs

758
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,380
are your people.

759
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,220
Today,

760
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,300
I'll send all of them to their death.

761
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,460
Then,

762
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,580
it'll be your turn.

763
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,900
Mentor,

764
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,860

Please mend your ways.

Shaoliang,

as matters stand,

769
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,780
yet you're still being stubborn.

770
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,300
I'm very

771
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,420
disappointed.

772
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,140
I have no choice but to take your life.

773
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,660
Come.

Don't hurt him.

775
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,500
Don't hurt him.

776
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:20,860
Let go of me.

777
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:21,940
Sir.

778
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,100
Sir.

779

780

Sir.

781

- Don't execute him.
- Don't execute him.

782
