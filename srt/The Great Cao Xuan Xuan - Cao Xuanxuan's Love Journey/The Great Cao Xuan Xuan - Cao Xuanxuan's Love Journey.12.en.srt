Xuanxuan.

22
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,480
Why isn't this place

23
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,080
decorated for a wedding?

24
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,760
I've discussed it with Zijie.

25
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,520
We won't be holding a wedding ceremony.

26
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,420
When we have the time,
we'll go for a destination wedding.

27
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,920
A destination wedding?

28
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,440
Xuanxuan,

29
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,400
I should've given you

30
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,720
a grand wedding.

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,040
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,440
It's all right.

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,640
I don't like those grand ceremonies

34
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,800
where you have to invite

35
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,400
a bunch of acquaintances
you barely know anyway.

36
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,520
The two of us

37
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,920
can just go somewhere fun

38
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,400
and full of delicious food.

39
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,000
That's nice.

40
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,440
What are you doing here so early?

41
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,640
I...

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,720
I came to check on Sun Weiyan.

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,680
Mr. Sun?

44
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,080
I haven't seen him at all today.

45
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,000
He left.

46
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,640
He left?

47
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,120
Why?

48
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,280
Was I supposed

49
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,680
to tie him down
to keep him from leaving?

50
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,940
(One Month Later)

51
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,080
Help! Anyone!

52
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,160
It's a body!

53
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,760
Help!

54
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,300
(Tongfu Tavern)

55
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,560
Get it together,

56
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,760
and be on your best behavior.

57
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,160
- Yes.
- Yes.

58
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,640
There he comes.

59
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:18,767
He's here.

60
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,380
Greetings, Your Lordship.

61
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,000
You're traveling
on behalf of His Majesty

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,340
and have endured a tiring journey.

63
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,680
I've prepared a modest feast

64
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,660
and hope you'll grace us
with your presence.

65
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,280
Here.

66
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,480
A toast

67
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,360
to Your Lordship.

68
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,000
I wouldn't dare.

69
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,080
You are favored
by His Majesty, Grand Mentor.

70
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,720
Who in the world

71
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,600
would dare have you toast to them?

72
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,440
You jest, Lord Su.

73
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,920
His Majesty is still young.

74
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,160
This journey on His Majesty's behalf
to Yanzhou for the ancestral rites

75
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,600
is a great service to the state.

76
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,680
I must

77
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,240
toast to you in respect.

78
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,320
Is that so?

79
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,840
You've been away from the capital

80
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,360
for a year

81
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,120
helping His Majesty write

82
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,960
The Great Chronicles of The Continent.

83
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,220
You've kept close tabs
on my movements, I see.

84
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,000
You know everything about my travels.

85
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,280
You make me uneasy

86
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,840
with those claims.

87
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,240
I was just passing through here.

88
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,240
The local officials,

89
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,080
hearing that Your Lordship

90
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,040
would stop by,

91
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
asked me

92
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,960
to accompany you

93
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,000
to ensure

94
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,960
you were well received.

95
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,240
Report!

96
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,240
Your Lordship.

97
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,880
There's been another incident
in Yanzhou.

98
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,640
Yanzhou?

99
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,400
Yes.

100
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,360
How far is this place from Yanzhou?

101
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,400
Your Lordship.

102
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,190
We've just entered
the Liangzhou territory.

103
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,400
If we travel day and night,

104
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,500
it will take three days.

105
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,260
If the entire entourage moves together,

106
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,420
it will take seven days.

107
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,080
This is absurd.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yanzhou is the ancestral land

109
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,480
and home of the Dragon Vein.

110
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,080
How can there be any disturbances

111
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,040
during the ancestral rites?

112
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,360
I remember the magistrate

113
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,440
of Yanzhou, Yan City,
is named Guo Zijie.

114
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Where is he?

115
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,960
Your Lordship.

116
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,760
Magistrate Guo left with his wife
to report

117
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,100
to the provincial capital days ago

118
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,220
and has not yet returned.

119
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,480
Reporting for so long?

120
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,600
Ridiculous.

121
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,980
Order him to return
to Yanzhou immediately

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,180
and investigate this.

123
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,840
Yes.

124
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,120
Your Lordship,
there's no need to be upset.

125
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,640
Yanzhou is

126
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,360
the ancestral land,

127
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,240
and Yan City is a small county.

128
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,080
However,

129
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,240
the magistrate's role

130
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,400
has always been

131
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,520
of utmost importance.

132
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,640
Since Magistrate Guo

133
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,320
shows no interest in governing,

134
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,080
why force him?

135
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,520
I happen

136
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,160
to have someone in mind

137
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,760
who could assist Your Lordship.

138
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,600
Shaoliang.

139
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,860
Pay your respects to His Lordship.

140
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,920
Greetings, Your Lordship.

141
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,320
This student of mine

142
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,400
is well-versed in the law

143
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,120
and a rising talent
in the Ministry of Justice.

144
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,480
Perhaps

145
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,720
he could

146
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,680
leave at once

147
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,480
and take on the task?

148
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,880
Let's do away with the formalities.

149
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,360
I've heard that Guo Zijie

150
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,200
has solved many strange cases.

151
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,240
What cases have you solved?

152
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,000
The veneration ritual is nigh.

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,980
If anything goes wrong
with the ancestral rites,

154
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,560
can you bear the responsibility?

155
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,840
It seems Your Lordship

156
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
still doubts my recommendation.

157
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,400
Whether

158
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,520
he's capable or not,

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,280
we'll know once he tries.

160
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,040
Very well.

161
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,800
I'll see

162
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,320
who can solve the Yanzhou case first.

163
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,760
I believe the position of Secretary
in the Ministry of Justice

164
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,320
is currently vacant.

165
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,440
Whoever solves the Yanzhou case first

166
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,880
will be granted

167
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,720
the position.

168
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,560
Shaoliang,

169
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,320
shouldn't you thank His Lordship?

170
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,000
Thank you, Your Lordship.

171
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,040
Come.

172
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,960
Let us raise a toast to His Lordship.

173
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:10,920
Here.

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,440
Cheers!

175
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:23,700
(Guo Residence)

176
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,540
(Guo Residence)

177
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,360
Over here.

178
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,960
That's it.

179
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,880
Don't go any higher.

180
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,620
Lower it a little.

181
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,680
- All right.
- All right.

182
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,880
Lower. Lower. All right.

183
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:00,010
Steady now.

184
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,840
Young Master and Young Madam are back!

185
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,880
Young Master!

186
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,840
Young Master.

187
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,400
Young Madam.

188
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,360
Young Master!

189
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,560
Young Madam!

190
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,640
You're finally back.

191
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,520
It's so good to see you.

192
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,920
We're so glad you're back.

193
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,640
Young Master,

194
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,160
I missed you so much!

195
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,600
It's such a relief to have you back.

196
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,520
All right, all right.

197
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,160
We were just in the provincial capital.

198
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,180
We're not gone forever.

199
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,600
Why are you all so emotional?

200
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,520
Young Master.

201
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,000
You have no idea.

202
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,200
After Master Guo's passing,

203
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,920
we've been worrying about you every day,

204
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,880
afraid you wouldn't return.

205
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,800
Now that you and Young Madam are back,

206
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,680
we can finally be at ease.

207
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,280
- Yes, much more at ease now.
- That's right.

208
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,800
Knowing you were coming back,

209
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,960
we've already

210
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,360
prepared the food.

211
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,040
All right.

212
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,600
Get back to work, everyone.

213
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,356
All right.

214
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,043
- Let's go.
- Go on.

215
00:10:51,043 --> 00:10:52,350
- I'm glad they're back.
- Yes.

216
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,240
All will be well now.

217
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,240
Well?

218
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,540
Everyone has been concerned
about your return.

219
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,320
You must get back on your feet quickly.

220
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,680
Let's go eat.

221
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,600
Sir!

222
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,680
Sir, why are you here?

223
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,060
A pile of work waits for you
at the administrative office!

224
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,920
Sir!

225
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,560
What?

226
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,320
Widow Zhang from the west of the city
says her chicken was stolen.

227
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,160
She claims
the tofu seller next door did it.

228
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,200
The tofu seller denied it.

229
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,820
Mr. Zhang is accusing
his younger brother

230
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,920
of stealing his artillery.

231
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,600
Can't you handle
these trivial matters yourselves?

232
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,640
But...

233
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,120
But what?

234
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,840
Are you going to take responsibility

235
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,680
if you delay something important for me?

236
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,000
Wait.

237
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,000
Sir.

238
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,040
What will you say

239
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,120
if my wife asks about this?

240
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,000
I understand.

241
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,440
You may leave.

242
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,240
Young Master,

243
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,800
you haven't been to
the administrative office for a month.

244
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,680
The officers

245
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,680
have come
requesting your presence several times.

246
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Dragging it on like this
is not a solution.

247
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,600
Got it.

248
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,640
I'll go take a look another day.

249
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,280
Sir! Sir!

250
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,320
Sir! Something terrible has happened!

251
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,480
It's another major case!

252
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,600
Why did you let him in again?

253
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,920
Speak.

254
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,080
What's the case?

255
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,040
Sir, it's hard to explain
in just a few words.

256
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,840
You'd better come and see for yourself!

257
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,960
Another time.

258
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,200
Young Madam Guo.

259
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,840
Young Madam.

260
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,200
Xuanxuan!

261
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,840
Sit down.

262
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,800
Are they here to see you

263
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,840
about something important?

264
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,280
I don't know what issue they have.

265
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,480
Where did you go this morning?

266
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,680
I didn't see you at all.

267
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,840
What happened?

268
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,620
It's just the usual stuff
from the administrative office.

269
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,800
Then let's head there now.

270
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,360
Let's go.

271
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,600
I refuse.

272
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,120
Come on!

273
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,900
I don't want to go.

274
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,760
One, two, three, up!

275
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,160
Xuanxuan,

276
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,560
my head hurts...

277
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,260
Three days ago,

278
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,280
Wang Er, a liquor seller,

279
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,740
found a severed arm on the outskirts.

280
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,240
We suspect it's a dismemberment case.

281
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,860
Lord Su will be arriving
in Yanzhou soon.

282
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,480
Having such a big case right now

283
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,460
could spell trouble

284
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,010
for Magistrate Guo if it's not resolved.

285
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,280
Got it.

286
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,460
What other clues do we have?

287
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,520
Wang Er is inside, right?

288
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,620
Take me to question him.

289
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,240
Wait.

290
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,240
There's one more thing.

291
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,000
What is it?

292
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,200
An Official Zhou was sent down.

293
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:49,920
Official Zhou?

294
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,640
Yes,

295
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,140
a clerk from the Ministry of Justice.

296
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,180
When Wang Er came
to report the case a few days ago,

297
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,700
we waited for Magistrate Guo to return
before making a decision.

298
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,520
But unexpectedly,

299
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,520
the higher-ups sent Official Zhou here.

300
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,040
Do you know this person?

301
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,300
Never heard of him.

302
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,240
He doesn't seem like
a high-ranking official,

303
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,280
but he sure

304
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,080
acts the part.

305
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,560
His accompanying guards

306
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
look like they're from the palace.

307
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,040
Yesterday,
he took over the administrative office,

308
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,780
and we couldn't get a word in.

309
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,280
Magistrate Guo. Young Madam Guo.

310
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,720
You should go in quickly.

311
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,680
That Official Zhou

312
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,640
is about to torture Wang Er.

313
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,640
Come on!

314
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,480
Wang Er,

315
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,000
you claim you found
this severed arm by chance.

316
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,240
But without witnesses or evidence,

317
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,600
it's clear you're a crying thief
to cover your own guilt.

318
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,460
Guards,

319
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,200
bring the torture instruments.

320
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,320
Sir! Sir!

321
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:35,880
I'm innocent!

322
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,320
Stop.

323
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:36,920
Sir.

324
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,000
Who dares

325
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,400
to disturb the court!

326
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,240
Cao Xuanxuan.

327
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,640
Guo Zijie, magistrate of Yan City.

328
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,920
Official Zhou.

329
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,120
She

330
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,920
is my wife.

331
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,600
Magistrate Guo.

332
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
I've heard much

333
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,000
about you two.

334
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,400
I see

335
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,480
Young Madam Guo
lives up to her reputation.

336
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,120
Not as much as your boldness.

337
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,000
I've never heard of torturing

338
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,240
the informant

339
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,520
before a case is clarified.

340
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,560
I have my own methods
for handling cases.

341
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,400
It's not your place,
as a woman, to interfere.

342
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,340
Everyone has their own way
of handling cases.

343
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,780
I don't see anything wrong
with Official Zhou conducting

344
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,080
a thorough investigation.

345
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,800
Since Official Zhou is here,

346
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,600
I dare not overstep.

347
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,000
I await your instructions.

348
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,360
Did you hear that,

349
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,640
Young Madam Guo?

350
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,720
Magistrate Guo said so himself.

351
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,560
Long He.

352
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,440
Take Wang Er away.

353
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,840
No one is allowed to visit him

354
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,480
without my order.

355
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,580
Anyone who does
will face the same punishment.

356
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,240
Sir!

357
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,400
Sir!

358
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,360
I'm innocent!

359
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,920
I'm just a liquor seller!

360
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,320
I don't know anything!

361
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,240
I'm innocent! Sir!

362
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,560
Sir!

363
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,960
Sir...

364
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,160
What's wrong with you?

365
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,840
What did you mean by what you just said?

366
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,640
Don't be mad.

367
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,720
(Upright and Just)

368
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,000
Don't be upset, please?

369
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,520
You must be tired.

370
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,480
What shall we have for lunch?

371
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,780
Buddha Jumps Over the Wall

372
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,800
at Tianxiang Pavilion?

373
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,320
Roast duck at Pinxiang Pavilion?

374
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,120
There's an amazing
new crab roe noodle shop

375
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,440
on West Street.

376
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,160
Want to try it?

377
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,680
Why are you like this now?

378
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,160
You've been so absentminded
ever since you came back.

379
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,700
Zhou Shaoliang
was sent by the higher-ups.

380
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,040
If he can solve the case,

381
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,040
that's great.

382
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,460
Isn't it quicker
to have someone else take over?

383
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,120
A severed arm has been discovered.

384
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,720
Someone might already be dead.

385
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,800
This is a murder case!

386
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,960
I don't think

387
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,600
he's an incompetent official.

388
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,240
Maybe he knows what he's doing.

389
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,280
Let's not worry about it anymore.

390
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,440
Xuanxuan.

391
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,320
I just want to cherish

392
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,680
the time we have together now.

393
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm returning to my room.

394
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,800
Think about it.

395
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,180
I don't think Guo Zijie

396
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,220
is as impressive
as the rumors make him out to be.

397
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,560
The Grand Mentor worries too much.

398
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,360
He even instructed you
not to lose to him.

399
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,840
He has his considerations.

400
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,720
This isn't the place to talk.

401
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,800
We'll talk when we get back.

402
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,400
Yes.

403
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,700
(Guo Residence)

404
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll leave this matter

405
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,920
to you, then.

406
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,360
I'll get it done.

407
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:17,960
What?

408
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,120
A severed arm?

409
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,800
Maybe a wild dog dug it up?

410
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,800
Do you think anyone saw us?

411
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,020
Certainly not.

412
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,380
It was pitch black that night,

413
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,980
and we were very cautious the whole way.

414
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,240
It must have been a wild dog.

415
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,620
(Chang Residence)

416
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,320
Go.

417
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:43,960
No.

418
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,040
This is not a matter to take lightly.

419
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,040
We need to find out

420
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,160
what's going on.

421
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,000
Yes.

422
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,280
Young Master.

423
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,780
The clothes in the courtyard
have piled up so much already.

424
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,200
This should've been Lian's task,

425
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,800
but I've searched everywhere
and still can't find her.

426
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,160
Shouldn't you go to Madam Wang for this?

427
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,780
Never bother me
with such trivial matters again!

428
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,080
Yes, Young Master.

429
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,520
Sir,

430
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,520
your letter.

431
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:36,720
All right.

432
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,440
Leave us.

433
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,660
(To: Zhou Shaoliang)

434
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,840
(Stay humble and patient.
I will arrive soon.)

435
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
Did the Grand Mentor give

436
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,160
any new instructions?

437
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,720
Nothing in particular.

438
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,400
He just said he would

439
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,960
come to Yan City soon
to oversee the investigation

440
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,000
and warned me not to disappoint him.

441
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,720
I don't get it.

442
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,440
The Ministry of Justice handles
so many cases every year.

443
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,400
Why does a severed arm case in Yan City

444
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,840
attract both the Grand Mentor's
and Lord Su's attention?

445
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,240
And why must you and Guo Zijie

446
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,280
compete over it?

447
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,820
(Yan Administrative Office)

448
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,520
Magistrate Guo and Young Madam
are in the back courtyard.

449
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,540
I can take you to them.

450
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,440
It's fine.

451
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,020
I'm no longer the private secretary.

452
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,360
I'll wait here instead.

453
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,680
Sun Weiyan!

454
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,120
Xuanxuan.

455
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,960
You came.

456
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,960
I won't go in.

457
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,840
I'll tell you what I know.

458
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,480
I've been in Yan City all along.

459
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,280
I've been teaching in a village.

460
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,600
Wang Er is the parent
of one of my students.

461
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,560
He's an honest liquor seller.

462
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,500
When he was taken
by the administrative office,

463
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,200
I feared they'd arrested
the wrong person,

464
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,260
so I came to check.

465
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,640
But I can rest easy
knowing that you're here.

466
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,920
I'll take my leave now.

467
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,520
Oh, right.

468
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,880
I'm in Wang Village outside the city.

469
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,480
If you ever

470
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,280
need my help,

471
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,040
come find me.

472
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,400
Got it.

473
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,840
Wang Village.

474
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,800
I'll remember that.

475
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,760
You saw him, didn't you?

476
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,760
Are you sure

477
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,400
you won't handle cases anymore?

478
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,320
Xuanxuan.

479
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,200
I don't want

480
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,680
to get involved in any cases again.

481
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,520
If I hadn't become

482
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,680
a magistrate

483
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,000
and had just stayed home with Father...

484
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,120
He wouldn't...

485
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,760
Zijie.

486
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,320
None of this is your fault.

487
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,640
Don't blame yourself.

488
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,880
Pull yourself together

489
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,920
and be the Guo Zijie you used to be.

490
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,720
Xuanxuan.

491
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,480
Yan City hasn't had any major cases

492
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,980
in the past three years,

493
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,180
but now things keep happening
one after another.

494
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,160
I think

495
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,540
that person definitely
has a hand in all of this.

496
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,640
And that Zhou Shaoliang.

497
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,640
He's clearly not here
with good intentions.

498
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,720
I must get

499
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,540
to the bottom of this case.

500
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,160
Don't worry.

501
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,320
You have me.

502
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,520
Sir,

503
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,720
the Grand Mentor
had already promised you

504
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,640
the position of secretary,

505
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,740
but then Guo Zijie showed up
out of nowhere.

506
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,800
Though,

507
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,080
from the looks of him,

508
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,880
he can hardly hold a candle to you.

509
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,840
The position will be yours.

510
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,800
Anyone who garners such importance
from both my mentor and Lord Su

511
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,760
must not be underestimated.

512
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
But...

513
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,720
Right.

514
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,920
Deliver the case files
on the severed arm

515
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,200
to Guo Zijie.

516
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,640
What?

517
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,600
Those are all your findings.

518
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,560
Why give them to him?

519
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,000
The files don't contain
anything significant.

520
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,880
Even if we don't give them to him,

521
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,820
he'll eventually uncover
the same information.

522
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,120
He just got back recently.

523
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,760
There's no need to take advantage
of these petty things.

524
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,800
From now on,

525
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,700
we'll rely on our own abilities.

526
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,760
No harm in giving them to him.

527
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,960
Look at him.

528
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,000
He wouldn't dare

529
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,040
contradict you.

530
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,040
Long He.

531
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,280
I'm still young and inexperienced.

532
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,320
Many people in the court
don't respect me.

533
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,560
This competition

534
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,320
is my chance.

535
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,760
Guo Zijie must investigate this case,

536
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,800
whether he wants to or not.

537
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,800
I intend to win fair and square.

538
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,720
I will prove to everyone

539
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,600
who the superior investigator is.

540
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,020
Official Zhou sent me to deliver this.

541
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,440
Goodbye.

542
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,440
All the clues are in here.

543
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,120
You don't want to go through them?

544
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,740
What's there to go through?

545
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,800
Let's begin.

546
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,160
I'm sorry, I wasn't...

547
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,080
He is...

548
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,120
This part and this part.

549
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400
Well...

550
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,640
I think everything looks good.

551
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,500
No problem at all.

552
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,160
My new "general"

553
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,280
is getting fatter.

554
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,480
I've raised you well.

555
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,000
Young Master. Young Madam. Your tea.

556
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,560
Look...

557
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,680
Anything else?

558
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,320
I think I've seen the man

559
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,560
who just left before.

560
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,320
That's Official Zhou's guard, Long He.

561
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,560
You've seen him before?

562
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,000
I just remembered.

563
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,310
You and Young Madam weren't here.

564
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,930
A few people heard
about Master's passing

565
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,260
and came to offer their respects.

566
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,120
That man

567
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,960
was with the group that came.

568
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,880
Right.

569
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,040
I was busy at the office that day,
so I didn't notice.

570
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,960
He's been here before?

571
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,120
How do you remember

572
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,740
something from so long ago so clearly?

573
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
Actually,

574
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,960
I once saw you playing with a magic cube

575
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,040
and bought one for myself.

576
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,140
But no matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't solve it.

577
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,160
When those people came,

578
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,620
one of them saw me playing with it

579
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,800
and solved it instantly.

580
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,720
He left a strong impression.

581
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,560
A young man...

582
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,720
And he came with Long He...

583
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,440
It must've been Zhou Shaoliang.

584
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,920
I'm not sure.

585
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,280
But I do recall

586
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
that when I escorted them out,

587
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,530
there was a luxurious sedan chair
waiting outside.

588
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,960
I've never seen anything like it

589
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,720
in Yan City.

590
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,760
All right. You may leave.

591
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,240
Yes.

592
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,822
Little cricket...

593
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:50,243
Take a look.

594
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,527
New...

595
00:26:58,105 --> 00:26:59,312
Take a look.

596
00:27:00,857 --> 00:27:02,314
All right. Pack these up for me.

597
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:04,563
Take a look.

598
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,520
I remember now.

599
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,680
What did you remember?

600
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,440
Zhou Shaoliang is connected to that man!

601
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,280
Are you sure?

602
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,440
Yes.

603
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,040
This case is not as simple as it seems.

604
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,080
That man has appeared again,

605
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,240
and Zhou Shaoliang

606
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,600
reveres him.

607
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,400
If I'm right,

608
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,640
that man's authority

609
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,200
surpasses Zhou Shaoliang's.

610
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,800
Don't worry.

611
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,040
If it really is him,

612
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,840
I won't let anyone hurt you.

613
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,080
I'll protect you no matter what.

614
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,880
Zijie,

615
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,000
thank you.

616
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,160
But

617
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,520
we're investigating this case

618
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,280
to uncover the truth

619
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,040
and to help others.

620
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,640
I know

621
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,160
you need some time right now,

622
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,440
so I'll take a look
at the case file myself.

623
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,660
You think it over.

624
00:28:31,036 --> 00:28:32,820
(Last Letter of Guo Shouyi)

625
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:44,740
(Last Letter of Guo Shouyi)
(Follow your heart.)

626
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,480
(Father,)

627
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,400
(what do you mean by this?)

628
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,540
(Yan Administrative Office)

629
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,200
Young Madam Guo.

630
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,240
Why are you here so early?

631
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,720
I came to see

632
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,300
if there were any overlooked clues.

633
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,280
Where's Magistrate Guo?

634
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,500
Did he not come with you?

635
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,440
He...

636
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,160
Who are those people?

637
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,480
After you and Magistrate Guo left,

638
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,080
Miss He Chun also disappeared.

639
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,240
That man over there

640
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,320
is the new coroner.

641
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,180
The office hasn't had
many cases recently,

642
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,180
so he's doing miscellaneous tasks
in the mortuary.

643
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,440
The two beside him aren't local.

644
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,800
They moved here with their family

645
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,160
a few days ago.

646
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,600
I vaguely remember

647
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,680
their surname is...

648
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,040
Chang.

649
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,320
They're a wealthy family.

650
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,680
Got it.

651
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,880
(Yan Administrative Office)

652
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,560
Mr. Xu,

653
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,880
please help us.

654
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,200
My mother has an odd illness.

655
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,320
She says there are voices

656
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,480
talking in her head.

657
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,040
Really?

658
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,120
Yes.

659
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,660
I've searched for famed physicians,

660
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,840
but none could cure her.

661
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,760
Finally, I found a shaman.

662
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,200
He said it's a demonic illness

663
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,720
and needs some human flesh
as medicine.

664
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,400
Where am I supposed to find human flesh?

665
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,720
I heard

666
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,000
the administrative office
found a severed arm.

667
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,240
That's my chance, isn't it?

668
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,280
You want the severed arm?

669
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,880
But the case hasn't been solved yet.

670
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,320
This... This won't do.

671
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,880
Mr. Xu,

672
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,160
take pity

673
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,580
on my young master's filial piety.

674
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,160
No, I can't...

675
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,320
I've heard Official Zhou

676
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,880
came from the Ministry of Justice.

677
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,920
If they didn't have proof,

678
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,630
would they have arrested
the liquor seller?

679
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,240
The case

680
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,960
is already as good as solved.

681
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,360
Keeping the arm serves no purpose.

682
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,280
Why not help

683
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,760
my young master
fulfill his duty as a filial son?

684
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,360
But...

685
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,760
Mr. Xu.

686
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,000
I...

687
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,920
Take it.

688
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,280
Mr. Xu.

689
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,560
How much can you earn

690
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,480
as a coroner each year?

691
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,760
This money is enough

692
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,040
to make you

693
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,720
a wealthy man somewhere else.

694
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,720
We're all just trying to make a living.

695
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,400
Why be so rigid?

696
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,080
All right.

697
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,440
I'll be right out.

698
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,240
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

699
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,840
My young master

700
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,120
will remember your kindness.

701
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,040
No need.

702
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,240
I can't stay here any longer anyway.

703
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,720
Take care of yourselves.

704
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,120
Young Master,

705
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,040
the severed arm is in our possession.

706
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,280
We can rest easy.

707
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,180
(I know everything you've done.)

708
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,000
That person brought up the severed arm

709
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,720
to threaten us.

710
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,600
Now that we have it,

711
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,860
there's little they can do.

712
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,360
Get rid of it.

713
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,040
It stinks.

714
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,760
Father.

715
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,680
If...

716
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,320
If my brother had become an official

717
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,640
instead of me,

718
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,600
would none of this have happened?

719
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:32,540
(Tomb of Guo Shouyi
Father of Guo Zijie)

720
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,680
I'm the only one left

721
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,880
in the Guo family.

722
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,400
I don't know

723
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,880
how to hold this family together.

724
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,640
All I want now is to keep Xuanxuan safe,

725
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,560
protect my family,

726
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,560
and stay far away from these conflicts.

727
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,040
I'm so afraid

728
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,680
of losing anyone else.

729
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,280
Father,

730
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,000
I'm unfilial.

731
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,920
That you are.

732
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,440
Why are you here?

733
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,960
If Magistrate Guo were alive

734
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,640
to see you hesitating and cowering

735
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,800
over solving a case,

736
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,440
he'd probably jump out of his grave

737
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,720
to lecture you.

738
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,120
What do you mean by that?

739
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,400

He solved the case of the Hong family
massacre that took 32 lives.

742
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,280
What?

743
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,120
