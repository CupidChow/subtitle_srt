Mr. Ning,

23
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,140
do you have any enemies?

24
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,120
Not that I know of.

25
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,520
I

26
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,000
never do

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,240
anything inhumane.

28
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,800
If others show me respect,

29
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,760
I will show them even more in return.

30
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,880
Let's go.

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,360
Excuse me.

32
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,880
Do you have another young master?

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,680
Yes,

34
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,220
we have one.

35
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,560
Does your master favor
the second young master more?

36
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,640
Yes,

37
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,880
he does favor Young Master Xian

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,160
because he's been

39
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,960
well-behaved and sensible
since he was young.

40
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,680
Then does he have

41
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,080
any distinguishing features?

42
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,400
I grew up with him.

43
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,800
He doesn't have any noticeable features.

44
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,100
He does have a mole on his neck though.

45
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,040
Where?

46
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,820
On the left.

47
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,240
Here?

48
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,520
Yes.

49
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,280
That's right.

50
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,100
It's on the left.

51
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:02,920
All right.

52
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,520
Thank you.

53
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,180
Let's go.

54
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,738
Everything has been taken care of.

55
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,060
So it's no problem.

56
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,880
You're indeed right about that.

57
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,220
It's all thanks to Mr. Li.

58
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:16,280
Indeed.

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,720
Fu.

60
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,520
Fu!

61
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,080
Yes, Master.

62
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,600
Master.

63
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,880
What's the matter, Master?

64
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,440
Master,

65
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,000
is your joint pain acting up again?

66
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,280
Many guests have arrived.

67
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,440
Yet, I couldn't go and greet them.

68
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,280
Has Zijie returned?

69
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,120
Not yet.

70
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,560
Tell the butler

71
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,360
not to wait for me.

72
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
Start the feast

73
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,360
and receive the guests.

74
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,520
Yes, Master.

75
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,520
Stop right there.

76
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,160
Where are you going?

77
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,700
Master gave me a task to complete.

78
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,620
Come back here.

79
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,640
Do you think I can't order you around

80
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,680
because you are Guo Zijie's servant?

81
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,040
Guo Zijie still has

82
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,200
to address me respectfully.

83
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,580
I dare not disrespect you.

84
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,600
Madam Guo,

85
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,480
what can I do for you?

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,400
Why did Master call you?

87
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,400
Master...

88
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,000
His joint pain is acting up again.

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,380
He told me to tell the butler

90
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,020
to receive the guests on his behalf.

91
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,200
Master's birthday feast
is an important occasion.

92
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,080
How could he let an outsider
to handle it?

93
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,840
You don't have to inform the butler.

94
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,960
I'll go myself.

95
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:41,960
Madam Guo,

96
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,600
aren't you going in

97
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,400
to see Master?

98
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,040
We have many guests waiting.

99
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,280
I'll see how things go later.

100
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
Gentlemen,

101
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,160
sorry to keep you waiting.

102
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,400
Sorry to keep all of you waiting.

103
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,160
My deepest apology.

104
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,840
I apologize for the delay.

105
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,700
No need to apologize.

106
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,380
Welcome.

107
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,920
My husband

108
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,240
is not feeling well.

109
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,920
So I'll be greeting everyone.

110
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:10,920
Please

111
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,840

112
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,400
Welcome.

113
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,560
- Thank you, Madam Guo.
- Thank you, Madam Guo.

114
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,880
Someone, serve the dishes.

115
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,000
Have a seat.

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,440
Come.

117
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,320

Yuan,

124
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,880
Madam Guo ordered

125
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,260
to hurry up and serve the wine.

126
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,200
Madam Guo?

127
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,640
Where's Master?

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,520
I don't know about this.

129
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,700
You better be quick.

130
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,720
(Guo Shouyi)

131
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,800
I'll stab you to death.

132
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,720
Stab.

133
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,280
Die.

134
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,200
Die.

135
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,480
I'll stab you to death today.

136
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,680
Stab.

137
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,400
Why are you in such a rush?

138
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,040
Young Master Zilu,

139
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,820
someone is performing a ritual
at the door.

140
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:06,920
Stab.

141
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,240
Stab.

142
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,560
Stab you to death.

143
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,200
Miss.

144
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:14,840
Stab.

145
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,680
Who are you?

146
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,560
Stab you to death.

147

Catch her!

148

This...

150
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,480
How dare mortals like you

151

try to catch me?

152
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,160
Miss,

153
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,000
why are you acting all mysterious

154
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,960
at the Guo Residence?

155
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,600
Acting mysterious?

156
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,680
This is a spell.

157
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,040
Your Old Master

158
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,160
will not live through the night.

159
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,940
What nonsense are you talking about?

160
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,560
Catch her!

161
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,260
Stop right there!

162
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,720
What took you so long

163
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,360

Let's sit down.

194
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,320
Try this.

195
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,520
All right.

196
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,280
Please enjoy your meal.

197
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,000
Not bad.

198
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,800
It's really not bad.

199
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
Madam Guo?

200
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,480
Madam Guo.

201
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,640
What's the matter, Madam Guo?

202
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,600
Madam!

203
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,760
- Madam.
- Madam Guo.

204
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,240
It hurts.

205
00:09:17,872 --> 00:09:18,869
Madam, are you all right?

206
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,440
Madam Guo!

207
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,680
What's going on?

208
00:09:23,392 --> 00:09:23,996
Madam Guo.

209
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,640
It's painful.

210
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,640
Madam Guo, what's the matter?

211
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,080
What's wrong, Madam Guo?

212
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,632
Madam Guo!

213
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:31,865
Madam Guo!

214
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,760
Madam Guo!

215
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,680
She threw up blood!

216
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,760
Madam Guo!

217
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,640
Master!

218
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,440
Master!

219
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,200
Master.

220
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,160
Fu,

221
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,440
why is it so noisy outside?

222
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,980
A girl is performing a ritual outside.

223
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,340
She claimed she was using a spell
to curse you to death.

224
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Is this for real?

225
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,880
Madam Guo is...

226
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,840
She's...

227
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,760
Tell me

228
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,440
what happened.

229
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,240
Something happened to Madam Guo.

230
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,240
Master.

231
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,760
Take me there now.

232
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,400
Hurry.

233
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:00,920
Someone.

234
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,360
Hurry.

235
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,100
Hurry up.

236
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,960
Let me help, Master.

237
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,600
Don't rush.

238
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,120
Make way! Make way!

239
00:10:17,472 --> 00:10:18,200
Master is here.

240
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:21,036
Hurry up and take a look.

241
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,480
Go and see what happened.

242
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,440
Why did she suddenly...

243
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,160
Master,

244
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,480
Madam Guo is...

245
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,240
What happened?

246
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,760
Everyone,

247
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
I am not feeling well

248
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,920
today.

249
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,160
I can't walk properly.

250
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,120
So I couldn't come out

251
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,240
to greet all of you.

252
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,200
Well, your health is important.

253
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,120
Now, this happened.

254
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,520
It is truly a blow

255
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,800
to the Guo family.

256
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,680
How can this be your fault?

257
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,400
That's right.

258
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,320
Someone is trying
to take advantage of the chaos

259
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,520
to do something wicked.

260
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,580
Could Madam Guo really

261
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,120
have been cursed to death

262
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,320
by that girl just now?

263
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,080
Cursed to death?

264
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,600
Cursed?

265
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,920
Madam Guo didn't die from a curse.

266
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,200
She was poisoned.

267
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,240
Poisoned?

268
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,200
That's right.

269
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,920
But she looks like
she has been poisoned.

270
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,240
There's poison in the dishes?

271
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,080
The food is poisoned?

272
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,200
Mr. Song,

273
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,640
please check my pulse.

274
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,320
Everyone,

275
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,120
don't panic.

276
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,040
This poison is extremely potent.

277
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,100
A person would die
within moments of being poisoned.

278
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,780
But none of you

279
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,920
are showing any symptoms.

280
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,020
So you're not poisoned.

281
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,980
We drank from the same pot
of wine with Madam Guo.

282
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,920
Why was she

283
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,040
the only one poisoned?

284
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,040
That's right.

285
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,000
That's weird.

286
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,960
That's too strange.

287
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,680
Could it be

288
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,320
the cup was laced with poison?

289
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,800
The cup?

290
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,960
The cup?

291
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,720
Mr. Song,

292
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,960
do you know

293
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,120
what kind of poison this is?

294
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,960
I don't know such poison.

295
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,000
In this world,

296
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,240
there even exists a poison

297
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,740
that even Mr. Song doesn't know about?

298
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,520
I'm afraid

299
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,240
this poison

300
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,400
isn't from Central Plains.

301
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,720
Not Central Plains?

302
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,860
Then where is its origin?

303
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,800
What's the matter?

304
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,240
Why is everyone gathering here?

305
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,160
Make way.

306
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,600
Father.

307
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,120
Madam Guo?

308
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,760
Fu,

309
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,600
bring Father back to his room.

310
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,820
Madam Guo.

311
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,232
We still don't know who's behind this.

312
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,927
This poison...

313
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:58,738
Does this poison

314
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:00,080
only work on women?

315
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,792
Who on earth poisoned her?

316
00:13:01,792 --> 00:13:02,400
That's right.

317
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,360
Everyone,

318
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,200
An unexpected incident has happened
at the Guo residence today.

319
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,400
Kindly make your way back

320
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,120
to your residences for now.

321
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,260
We will apologize to you all
at a later time.

322
00:13:16,898 --> 00:13:17,909
Come on, let's go home.

323
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,916
How could such a thing happen?

324
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,960
Madam Guo.

325
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,600
Madam Guo.

326
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,360
Are you sure this is the place?

327
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,820
Stop right there!

328
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,000
Why are there so many of you?

329
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,200
What are you up to?

330
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,280
Who are these people?

331
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,140
Tell them to leave.

332
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,880
This doesn't concern them.

333
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,960
I brought the money.

334
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,080
Please let Xian go.

335
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,000
Put aside the money.

336
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,560
I brought the money.

337
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,080
Let Xian go.

338
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,080
Don't you think this kidnapper

339
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,860
is very strange?

340
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,760
It's all right.

341
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,000
I've reported this

342
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,640
to the administrative office.

343
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,560
They'll send people

344
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,480
to surround this place.

345
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,640
He won't get away.

346
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,560
They have nothing to do with this.

347
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,320
I'll pay you.

348
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,560
Please let Xian go.

349
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,640
Tell them to leave.

350
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,440
I'm counting on you.

351
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,160
Let Xian go.

352
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,480
If you don't leave,

353
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,560
your son will die.

354
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,520
Stop right there!

355
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,480
Don't go near them.

356
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,120
Xian will get hurt.

357
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,960
Mr. Ning,

358
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,320
don't worry.

359
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,200
We're here to help.

360
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,900
It will be fine.

361
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,000
But...

362
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,400
But...

363
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Don't come any closer!

364
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,380
If you take another step,

365
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
I will kill him!

366
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,120
Stop!

367
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,120
You...

368
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,280
A scarecrow?

369
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,440
You despicable bandit!

370
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,160
How dare you trick me?

371
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,200
Where's Xian?

372
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,800
Mr. Ning,

373
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,280
don't you recognize

374
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,160
your son?

375
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,040
What?

376
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,640
What nonsense are you talking about?

377
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:37,920
Ning Xian,

378
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,600
are you going to keep denying it?

379
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,240
I...

380
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,000
Do you know who he is?

381
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,880
He's the County Magistrate of Yan City,

382
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,920
Guo Zijie.

383
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,960
Ning Xian.

384
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,020
Put that dagger away.

385
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,520
Do you want

386
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,480
to take that mask off yourself,

387
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,300
or do you want me
to take it off for you?

388
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,520
Xian?

389
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,320
Young Master?

390
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:35,920
You...

391
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,920
What is this...

392
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,160
You, defiant child.

393
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,480
How could you do such
a ridiculous thing?

394
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,560
It's so infuriating!

395
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,320
When have I ever been stingy

396
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,720
with your food or clothing?

397
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,840
As a scholar,

398
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,040
why do you need so much money?

399
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,640
Father.

400
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,680
I asked you

401
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,600
for money before.

402
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,440
But you kept refusing me.

403
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,560
That's why I had to resort to this.

404
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,400
I asked you what you needed
the money for

405
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,700
and you weren't being clear.

406
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,840
How could I give you any?

407
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,520
Ning Xian

408
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,880
is trying to help his brother, right?

409
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,880
What?

410
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,680
You did all this

411
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,600
for your gambling brother?

412
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,360
Father,

413
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,940
he almost got beaten to death

414
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,960
by loan sharks.

415
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,760
He is also your son.

416
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,520
How could you bear to kick him out

417
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,440
and ignore him?

418
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,780
Family matters should stay
within the family.

419
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,080
I'll deal with you later.

420
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,260
If it weren't for Magistrate Guo

421
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,400
and Miss Xuanxuan today,

422
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:48,960
I...

423
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,400
It's all right.

424
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,720
Mr. Ning,

425
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,200
your son

426
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,440
is just a bit mischievous.

427
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,780
Good thing no harm was done,

428
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,420
and it didn't turn into a big disaster.

429
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,240
I will always

430
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,760
remember

431
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,440
your help.

432
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,160
Mr. Ning, please spare the formalities.

433
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,560
It's my duty.

434
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,200
Besides,

435
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,000
it's all thanks to Xuanxuan.

436
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,560
Thank you, Miss Xuanxuan.

437
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,440
No need to thank me.

438
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,320
Well,

439
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,560
can I ask Ning Xian a question?

440
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,120
Miss Xuanxuan,

441
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,520
please go ahead.

442
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,440
You're pretty incredible

443
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,760
to think of such a method.

444
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,400
Who taught you

445
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,920
all these?

446
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,800
Is he here?

447
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,280
I...

448
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,480
I...

449
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,360
Next time,
don't be so mischievous again.

450
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,000
Let's go.

451
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,720
Someone.

452
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,560
Prepare the carriage.

453
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,680
It's all right.

454
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,680
At this hour,

455
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,220
the birthday feast has already ended.

456
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,300
We can go back on our own.

457
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:13,760
But...

458
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
As for Old Master Guo,

459
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,520
I'll personally go

460
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,320
and apologize

461
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,920
at a later time.

462
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:31,960
Father,

463
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,640
get some rest.

464
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,360
I'll excuse myself.

465
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,600
Go.

466
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,360
I'll take my leave too,

467
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,080
Master.

468
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,320
This happy occasion

469
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,400
has turned into a sad one.

470
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,960
Zijie still hasn't returned.

471
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,360
What should we do?

472
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,480
Don't panic.

473
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,000
As long as I'm here,

474
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,740
nothing will go wrong
in the Guo Residence.

475
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,600
It's strange.

476
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,000
Why did Madam Guo welcome
the guests today?

477
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,000
Didn't my father usually leave this

478
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,760
to you?

479
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,200
If I hadn't been busy
in the kitchen today,

480
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,440
and Madam Guo wasn't so eager
for attention,

481
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,800
I'm afraid...

482
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,960
How dare they commit a crime
at Guo Residence.

483
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,280
Don't worry.

484
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,240
I will definitely find the culprit

485
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,440
to avenge Madam Guo.

486
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,520
Also,

487
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,000
did my father

488
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,520
go to the sitting room hall today?

489
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,000
Did he mention anything

490
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,000
about the succession
of Guo Residence?

491
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,440
We should wait for Zijie
to return and talk about it.

492
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,440
I...

493
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,280
You're something else, old man.

494
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,680
All you care about is Zijie.

495
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,040
When I become the head
of Guo's household,

496
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,920
I'll deal with you.

497
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,780
What are you talking about?

498
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,360
I get it.

499
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,520
I won't get in your way.

500
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,420
I'll wait for you in front.

501
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,400
It's already late.

502
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,560
You must be sad that you missed
your father's birthday feast.

503
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,720
A little.

504
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,720
It's all right.

505
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,920
Let's

506
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,840
hurry up and leave.

507
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,720
So we can get back soon.

508
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,640
Even if we rushed home,

509
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,800
they would be asleep.

510
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,560
Let's sit there.

511
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,040
Come.

512
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,600
By the way,

513
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,360
I forgot to ask you.

514
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,760
What exactly happened

515
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,800
in that locked room?

516
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,640
I can understand the woodshed.

517
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,000
It's filled with straw,

518
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,220
which could easily cover up
the traces of a scarecrow.

519
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,880
But how did Ning Xian suddenly disappear

520
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,000
right before us

521
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
at Ning Residence?

522
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,920
The water barrel.

523
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,240
What water barrel?

524
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,680
The water barrel

525
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,000
has a hidden compartment.

526
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,200
When I first saw it,

527
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,800
I didn't notice anything unusual.

528
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,960
But later, I thought about it carefully.

529
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,240
The depth of the barrel

530
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,560
and the angle of its reflection

531
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,440
were off.

532
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,160
Plus,

533
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,960
Ning Xian had obvious
water stains on him.

534
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,080
That's

535
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,440
how I came to this conclusion.

536
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,120
So that's how he did it.

537
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,760
My wife is so clever.

538
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,520
Who's your wife?

539
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,040
I need to quickly write this case

540
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,160
into my Yan City Diaries.

541
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,160
Are you still writing that book?

542
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,840
Yes.

543
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,200
I'm almost finished.

544
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,360
You almost finished?

545
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,920
Why?

546
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,200
I thought you liked that book very much.

547
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,740
I even planned to write it quickly

548
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,300
and give it to you as soon as I finish.

549
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,240
Actually,

550
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,320
you don't have to finish it quickly.

551
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,840
How can I not rush

552
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,040
the things my wife likes?

553
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,680
Come on.

554
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,920
Where are we going?

555
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,960
Go home

556
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,080
and ask Father
to propose marriage on my behalf.

557
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,960
What's the matter?

558
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,040
You don't want to?

559
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,880
Let's go.

560
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,360
Master,

561
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,600
I've prepared carriages

562
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,720
to send the guests home.

563
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
So don't worry.

564
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,240
Who do you think

565
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,480
is behind

566
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,480
Madam Guo's death?

567
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,000
Well, I...

568
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,440
I have no idea.

569
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,200
I'm curious about the poison.

570
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,160
Mr. Song said

571
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,160
this type of poison

572
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,600
seems to be from Western regions.

573
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,480
You should

574
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,720
help me walk to the storeroom.

575
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,880
Master,

576
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,200
it's not convenient

577
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
for you to walk with your leg like this.

578
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,720
Zijie is not home yet.

579
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,360
Go.

580
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,600
Go to the storehouse.

581
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,480
Slow down.

582
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,520
Master, not too fast.

583
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,040
Xuanxuan!

584
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,640
Run!

585
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,240
It's fine.

586
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,800
Zijie!

587
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,280
Zijie!

588
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,680
Hang it there, Zijie.

589
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,120
Zijie!

590
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,480
Zijie!

591
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Hang in there.

592
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,120
Hyah!

593
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,280
Whoa!

594
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,400
Get in quick!

595
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,880
Run!

596
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,120
You, get in quick!

597
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,080
Hyah!

598
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,120
Magistrate Guo!

599
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,640
Zijie,

600
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,040
hang in there.

601
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,360
We're almost home.

602
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,360
His old injury hasn't healed yet.

603
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,880
Now, there's new one.

604
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,960
Several days ago,
he suffered serious internal injuries

605
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,000
while trying to save you.

606
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,840
Zijie,

607
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,400
hang in there.

608
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,680
When we reach home,

609
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,160
I'll ask Father to propose,

610
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,840
and we'll get married, all right?

611
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,280
Please hold on.

612
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,680
Hyah!

613
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,880
Master?

614
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,400
Master?

615
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,720
Master.

616
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,720
Master,

617
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm coming in.

618
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,480
Master!

619
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,520
Master?

620
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:13,920
Master.

621
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,520
Master.

622
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,680
Master!

623
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,120
Master!

624
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,920
Master!

625
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,680
Someone!

626
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,280
Someone, help!

627
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,520
Whoa!

628
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,360
Xuanxuan!

629
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,360
Look!

630
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,920
Carry Zijie back to his room.

631
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,520
All right.

632
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,120
Fetch the physician.

633
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,080
All right.

634
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:59,140
(Funeral)

635
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,760
Mister,

636
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,880
how is he?

637
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,240
His life is not in danger.

638
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,600
But he lost a lot of blood.

639
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,620
There's nothing to worry about for now.

640
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,220
You only need to take good care of him.

641
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,280
Thank you.

642
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,520
What's going on?

643
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,800
In just one night,

644
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,880
both Master and Madam Guo had...

645
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,560
Now, Young Master Zijie
is in this condition.

646
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,480
Zijie,

647
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,520
don't worry.

648
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,680
I will find the person

649
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,400
who killed your father.

650
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,160
Zijie.

651
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,680
Zijie?

652
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,000
Get out of here!

653
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,540
Just listen to what you're saying.

654
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,880
Zijie is ill.

655
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,600
As his brother, is it wrong

656
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,640
for me to visit him?

657
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,660
So you still remember
you're his brother.

658
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,640
We don't welcome you.

659
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,400
Get out now!

660
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,120
Fine.

661
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,600
No need to be upset.

662
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,280
Since it's not convenient
to visit today,

663
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,160
I'll come another day.

664
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,360
Let's go.

665
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,680
Butler,

666
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,200
come here.

667
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,480
Young Master Zilu.

668
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,640
Guo Zijie was definitely going to die.

669
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,680
Then He Chun showed up out of nowhere.

670
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,560
However, Guo Zijie is unconscious

671
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,840
and probably won't survive.

672
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,080
Why not take this opportunity

673
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,960
to seize control?

674
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,880
Young Master Zilu.

675
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,040
I deserve to die.

676
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,960
I deserve to die.

677
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,000
I deserve to die.

678
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,040
I deserve to die.

679
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,920
I deserve to die.

680
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,960
I deserve to die.

681
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,320
Dali.

682
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,000
I deserve to die.

683
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,520
Da...

684
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,800
Get up.

685
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,720
Dali,

686
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,320
you've been loyal to me for many years.

687
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,100
You may have failed me many
times. But you worked hard.

688
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,200
You can leave.

689
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,320
Young Master Zilu,

690
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,320
don't kick me out.

691
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,520
I'll make sure

692
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,380
to handle things properly from now on.

693
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,320
You should know

694
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,040
the consequences of staying
at Guo Residence.

695
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,800
After Fu finished his chores,

696
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,080
he went to see Master.

697
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,520
When he opened the door,

698
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,960
Master had already...

699
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,400
That was

700
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,040
what had happened.

701
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,120
First, it was Madam Guo.

702
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,920
Then it was Master.

703
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,740
There have been continuous crimes
in the residence.

704
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,040
It's simply unforgivable.

705
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,720
Now, Young Master Zijie

706
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,000
is still unconscious.

707
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,760
What do we do now?

708
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,160
Don't worry.

709
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,240
Guo Residence

710
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,360
still has me.

711
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,920
Later, I want you people

712
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,120
to move all the furniture

713
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,520
and these lanterns out

714
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,960
of this...

715
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,640
What a coincidence.

716
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,680
You're here too.

717
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,440
That's perfect.

718
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,200
Perfect timing.

719
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,920
You can get to work.

720
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,600
Go ahead.

721
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,200
Go.

722
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,320
Remember this.

723
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,600
The Guo family cannot go
a single day without a head!

724
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,080
Get back to work!

725
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,520
Go!

726
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,840
Yes, Young Master Zilu.

727
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,720
Was he behind all these?

728
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,920
With that mind of his,

729
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,840
could he come up with such a trick?

730
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,680
By the way,

731
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,760
I will be very busy after this.

732
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,200
Please watch Zijie carefully.

733
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,000
Remember.

734
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,440
Never leave him alone.

735
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,360
We still have Mr. Sun and He Chun.

736
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,080
With the three of us
going up against him,

737
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,160
you can rest assured.

738
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,880
He Chun will investigate with me.

739
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,520
Then...

740
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,880
What about Mr. Sun?

741
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,880
Even if he's around,

742
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,360
don't leave Zijie alone.

743
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,640
I'm counting on you.

744
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,160
He Chun,

745
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,600
Zijie is in such a state.

746
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,280
I will need to depend on you

747
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
in the investigation.

748
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,160
Don't worry.

749
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,780
I will take on any task

750
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,840
without hesitation.

751
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,800
If Zijie finds out

752
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,280
Father has passed away
after he wakes up,

753
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,160
he will certainly feel sad.

754
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,560
We must find the killer

755
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,120
before he wakes up.

756
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,200
You called him Father now.

757
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,880
I wonder

758
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,480
who could be so vicious
to attack Magistrate Guo like this.

759
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,980
Where are you going?

760
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,360
