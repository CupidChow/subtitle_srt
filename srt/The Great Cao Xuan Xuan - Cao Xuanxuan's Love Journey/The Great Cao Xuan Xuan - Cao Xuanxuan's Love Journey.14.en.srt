He Chun.

22
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,070
Xuanxuan.

23
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,230
What are you holding?

24
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,230
Before Master Guo's birthday banquet,

25
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,350
Magistrate Guo asked me

26
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,350
to help prepare a gift.

27
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,870
The Western painter's skills
were amazing,

28
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,200
so I decided to commission
a painting for Master Guo.

29
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,270
However,

30
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,480
his neighbor told me
that the painter had suddenly died.

31
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,190
So I had another painter

32
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,240
make this one instead.

33
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,280
Suddenly died?

34
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,470
He Chun,

35
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,400
can you help me with something?

36
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,000
Visit a few places
and gather some information for me.

37
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,150
Got it.

38
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,590
Hup!

39
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,790
Excuse me.

40
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,830
Can I help you?

41
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,910
Do you know
where the famous Master Zhang

42
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,950
is now?

43
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,910
Master Zhang?

44
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,350
I've lived here my whole life.

45
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,200
Never heard of anyone by that name.

46
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,910
Never heard of him?

47
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,670
Never.

48
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,230
Is the Western painter

49
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,190
still at your residence?

50
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,430
A few days after you left,

51
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,070
we found him

52
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,790
in the cellar.

53
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,790
He'd been tied up

54
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,870
and starved to death.

55
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,270
Starved to death?

56
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,070
Miss He Chun.

57
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,230
What brings you here?

58
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,270
I came to ask you something.

59
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,310
Where is Sun Yi?

60
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,110
Sun Yi?

61
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,430
It's odd.

62
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,670
After that incident,

63
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,870
I never saw him again.

64
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,710
I heard

65
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,550
he left Yan City.

66
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,550
Left Yan City?

67
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:01,830
Hup!

68
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,110
Xuanxuan.

69
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:05,990
Sit.

70
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,430
How's the investigation going?

71
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,150
Sun Yi and Master Zhang

72
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,200
are nowhere to be found.

73
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,140
The painter is dead.

74
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,510
As you requested,

75
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,590
I went to Zhao Village

76
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,520
and Lyu Residence.

77
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,870
I even questioned people

78
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,990
near the Guo Residence.

79
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,030
Sun Yi, Master Zhang, and the painter

80
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,830
are all suspicious.

81
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,550
I believe the three of them are tied

82
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,590
to whoever is behind

83
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,950
all of this.

84
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,020
Do we need to tell Magistrate Guo?

85
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,030
I never intended to hide it from him.

86
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,470
But he only recently

87
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,510
got back on his feet.

88
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,270
I don't want to overwhelm him.

89
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,740
I'll tell him when the time is right.

90
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,580
(Zhai Residence)

91
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,510
(What's going on?)

92
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,510
(Is Master leaving again so soon?)

93
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,870
Hurry!

94
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,030
Wake up!

95
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,030
How are you feeling?

96
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,830
Wake up!

97
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:38,750
Get up!

98
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,590
Master Zhai.

99
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,190
Master Zhai.

100
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,430
Wake up!

101
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,710
I...

102
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,910
You wanted to see me?

103
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:06,910
Speak up.

104
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,310
It's nothing.

105
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,990
Nothing?

106
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,110
I'm off, then.

107
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,940
There's something.

108
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,390
There is...

109
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,390
Yes.

110
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,630
There's something.

111
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,310
Right.

112
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,230
Chang Zheng confessed

113
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,870
that he mistook the body

114
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,270
for Lian's

115
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,510
because someone left him a note.

116
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,270
Who do you think wrote it?

117
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,150
Didn't we discuss this earlier?

118
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,350
Right.

119
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,150
Right...

120
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,710
We did.

121
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,710
So, who do you think

122
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,470
wrote it?

123
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,740
Did you hit your head or something?

124
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,750
This...

125
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,870
This is for you.

126
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:00,630
What's this?

127
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,430
Something good.

128
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,950
Don't get the wrong idea!

129
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,990
I gave some to Zijie and Xuanxuan

130
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:10,950
too.

131
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,070
Fine.

132
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:17,910
Thanks.

133
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,630
Sun Weiyan!

134
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,010
Why did you have to run your mouth?

135
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,900
(Tomb of Lian)

136
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:55,260
(Lian)

137
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,340
(Tomb of Lian)

138
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,950
Lian.

139
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,870
Rest in peace.

140
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,950
I've avenged you.

141
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,300
(Seven days ago, Chang Residence)

142
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,470
Hup!

143
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:27,820
(I know everything you've done.)

144
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:29,220
(Tomb of Lian)

145
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,580
If I had known this would happen,

146
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,870
I wouldn't have listened to your father.

147
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,830
We should've run away together
from the start.

148
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,540
(Yan Administrative Office)

149
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,750
Magistrate Guo!

150
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,150
Magistrate Guo!

151
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,390
Wait!

152
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,670
Which one of you

153
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,790
is Magistrate Guo

154
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,670
of Yan City?

155
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,510
That's me.

156
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,540
What's the matter?

157
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,150
I'm Shangshan, the butler

158
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,150
of the Zhai Residence.

159
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:27,830
Magistrate Guo,

160
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,270
you must help

161
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,270
my master!

162
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,660
What happened to your master?

163
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,230
Sir.

164
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,950
Do you have a case to report?

165
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:42,470
Go ahead.

166
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:43,750
This is

167
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,550
Official Zhou.

168
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,950
He'll be assisting me.

169
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,710
I'd prefer to speak

170
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,270
with Magistrate Guo.

171
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:50,910
Sir.

172
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,870
Magistrate Guo is right here.

173
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:58,950
This way, sir.

174
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,830
My master...

175
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,750
We'll talk inside.

176
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,270
Don't worry.

177
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,420
Whatever the matter,

178
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,230
I will get to the bottom of it.

179
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,390
This incident happened three days ago.

180
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,110
Why didn't you report it sooner?

181
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,510
Up until a few days ago,

182
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,920
Master Zhai was preoccupied
with spiritual cultivation

183
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,070
and rarely returned.

184
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,830
He instructed us

185
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,550
not to disturb him,

186
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,710
even if

187
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,230
he didn't come home for days.

188
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,710
He even told us

189
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,510
not to be startled

190
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,390
if anything frightening happened.

191
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,030
We thought

192
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,470
it was perhaps

193
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,550
part of some spiritual practice.

194
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,790
Besides,

195
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,270
even if something terrible

196
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,470
had happened to him,

197
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,830
there would be a body.

198
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,870
He wouldn't have

199
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,190
completely vanished

200
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,790
into thin air!

201
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,750
Then why are you

202
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,790
reporting this now?

203
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,310
A few days ago,

204
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,750
I heard rumors

205
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,230
about dismembered remains being found.

206
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,990
I didn't pay much attention

207
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,430
at the time.

208
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,790
But last night,

209
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,750
I heard

210
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,710
that the remains

211
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,790
were male.

212
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,230
How could I

213
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,830
possibly stay calm?

214
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,470
Master Zhai

215
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,800
has always been kind to me.

216
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,910
After so many years...

217
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,230
Oh, Master Zhai...

218
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,630
Bring him a chair.

219
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,710
Calm down, sir.

220
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,670
Take your time.

221
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,880
Does Master Zhai have
any distinctive marks

222
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,670
on his legs for identification?

223
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,310
I...

224
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,150
I'm not sure about his legs.

225
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,190
I do recall

226
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,630
he had

227
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,710
a scar

228
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,950
on his left arm.

229
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,110
The first arm we found

230
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,070
was the right arm.

231
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,910
We can't yet confirm

232
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,510
if the arm and the leg
belong to the same person.

233
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,590
We thought

234
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,790
the remains belonged to Lian.

235
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,350
In any case,

236
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,190
Master Zhai has gone missing,

237
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,830
and it's highly likely
he met with foul play.

238
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,630
What about the sedan bearers?

239
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,710
We brought

240
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,710
them back.

241
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,070
The physician said

242
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,190
they had been drugged with a heavy dose.

243
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,080
We gave them several doses of medicine.

244
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,790
Fearing another incident,

245
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,230
I had the servants

246
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,710
watch over them.

247
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,990
They didn't wake up

248
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,830
until the evening of the following day.

249
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,110
I questioned them repeatedly.

250
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,910
They said

251
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,270
they were knocked unconscious

252
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,220
shortly after leaving the residence.

253
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,550
Based on the timing and distance,

254
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,470
it's unlikely the bearers were involved.

255
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,390
Sir,

256
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,830
can you tell us

257
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,950
how many people are in the Zhai family?

258
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,350
13

259
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,910
in total.

260
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,510
What?

261
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,880
Do you suspect it's someone
within the household?

262
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,190
It's just a theory.

263
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,830
If the dismembered body
belongs to Master Zhai,

264
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,430
then the murderer

265
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,350
must harbor a deep grudge against him.

266
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:09,730
True.

267
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,710
Investigate

268
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,870
Master Zhai's relationships thoroughly.

269
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,670
Understood.

270
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,550
He Chun.

271
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,270
Go with him.

272
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,790
Well?

273
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,430
Based on the deceased's
skeletal structure,

274
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,950
the victim was male,

275
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,310
approximately

276
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,670
60 years old,

277
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,630
and about 170 cm tall.

278
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,830
The thigh was cleanly severed,

279
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,350
likely with a very sharp blade.

280
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,910
Judging by the degree of decomposition,

281
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,710
the victim died about three days ago.

282
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,150
In the past year,

283
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,150
only Master Zhai's physical description
matches the victim.

284
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,430
This is likely Master Zhai.

285
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,030
Who could be so cruel?

286
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,670
Killing a man
and then dismembering his body?

287
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,150
Why is he here?

288
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,630
If that's the case,

289
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,470
it's highly probable

290
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,320
that someone in the Zhai family
committed it.

291
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,150
That's impossible.

292
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,230
According to Shangshan,

293
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,750
Master Zhai was alive

294
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,750
in the residence on the first night.

295
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,270
By morning, a severed arm

296
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,670
was discovered

297
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,740
several kilometers away.

298
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,390
If the arm belongs to Master Zhai,

299
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,380
it means the killer
would've had to murder him,

300
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,040
transport the remains
to the dumping site,

301
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,750
and return before dawn!

302
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,390
Even though Shangshan insists

303
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,350
all 12 Zhai family members

304
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,390
have alibis

305
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,390
for that night,

306
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,350
it doesn't completely rule them out

307
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,790
as suspects.

308
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,750
Nonsense.

309
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:12,670
Let's go.

310
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,860
(Justice and Integrity)

311
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,150
I've examined the body.

312
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,670
It is Master Zhai's.

313
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,190
Zhou Shaoliang suspects

314
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,630
the Zhai family is responsible.

315
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,750
That means the murderer

316
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,790
is within the Zhai Residence?

317
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,110
Zhou Shaoliang wouldn't make

318
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,310
a mistake about something like this.

319
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,470
All right.

320
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,790
We'll wait outside.

321
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,470
You two discuss.

322
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,790
If Zhou Qin is behind this,

323
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,510
then we can't trust anything
the Zhai family says.

324
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,350
But if it is Zhou Qin,

325
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,260
why would he send Zhou Shaoliang
to solve the case?

326
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,110
I can't figure that out either.

327
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,590
I feel Zhou Shaoliang genuinely wants

328
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,190
to solve this case.

329
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,870
What kind of person

330
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,510
is Zhou Shaoliang?

331
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,110
I might actually know something

332
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,510
about him.

333
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,070
This official document came today.

334
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,190
Take a look.

335
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,540
(Official Document)

336
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,360
Lord Su has ordered Zhou Shaoliang
and you to compete.

337
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,680
Whoever solves the case first

338
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,080
will be promoted to Secretary
of the Ministry of Justice.

339
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,230
So I think

340
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,110
Zhou Shaoliang is trying

341
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,350
to outdo me.

342
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,350
No matter what,

343
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,390
Zhou Qin is his mentor.

344
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,830
We need to be cautious.

345
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,350
All right.

346
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,060
I'll go question Shangshan again.

347
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,430
Be careful.

348
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,670
I will.

349
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:07,990
Lord Su.

350
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,900
We found something.

351
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,310
Let's go.

352
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,870
- Hup!
- Hup!

353
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,670
- Hup!
- Hup!

354
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,270
- Hup.
- Hup.

355
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:44,334
Lord Su.

356
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,030
Look.

357
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,630
The audacity of that Zhou Qin!

358
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,760
Please be appeased, Your Lordship.

359
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,670
Our men have already rushed to Yan City.

360
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,670
Zhou Qin doesn't know we're here.

361
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,470
Everything

362
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,110
is under your control.

363
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,495
Once I return to the capital...

364
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,350
Right.

365
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,710
What's the situation in Yan City?

366
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,790
Reports indicate

367
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,780
the deceased is from the Zhai Residence.

368
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,750
The Zhai family?

369
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,190
Yes.

370
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,510
Sir!

371
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,510
Please wait.

372
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,310
May I ask you a few more questions?

373
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,390
Of course.

374
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,910
Anything to help catch the one

375
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,920
who murdered my master.

376
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,030
Ask anytime.

377
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,510
On the night Master Zhai

378
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,710
met his tragic end,

379
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,200
are you certain all 12 members
of the Zhai family

380
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,280
were at home?

381
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,870
I'm certain.

382
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,870
None of them went out.

383
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:46,590
When we heard

384
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,670
Master Zhai's scream

385
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,510
and found the sedan chair,

386
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,980
we all returned to the residence.

387
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:52,750
Every night,

388
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,830
I patrol

389
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,710
each courtyard

390
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,590
and room.

391
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,870
I can confirm

392
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:57,910
that

393
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,230
no one left.

394
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,950
Thank you.

395
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,780
Magistrate Guo,

396
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,070
another arm has been found.

397
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,470
Notify Shangshan.

398
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,110
Yes.

399
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,608
Indeed.

400
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,217
That's terrifying.

401
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,630
Excuse us.

402
00:21:57,933 --> 00:21:59,080
What a horrid smell!

403
00:21:59,595 --> 00:22:00,920
It reeks...

404
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:05,830
Go check it out.

405
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:11,133
It's a murder.

406
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:11,780
Yes.

407
00:22:17,151 --> 00:22:18,099
What is it?

408
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,768
Let's go see.

409
00:22:18,973 --> 00:22:19,577
Come on.

410
00:22:28,128 --> 00:22:29,506
This is alarming!

411
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,590
Butler,

412
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,950
please verify.

413
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,310
Master Zhai!

414
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,710
Such a tragic death!

415
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,310
Master Zhai...

416
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,790
Master Zhai...

417
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,190
Long He.

418
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,190
Let's go.

419
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,590
Odd.

420
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,150
Odd indeed.

421
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,270
What's wrong?

422
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,030
I passed by the location

423
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,400
where the first arm was found.

424
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,310
And this place.

425
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,550
I think

426
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,720
this is a "white tiger."

427
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,030
A "white tiger"?

428
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,390
It's a term

429
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,550
from the six-line divination.

430
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,990
Why would the killer

431
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,390
align their actions with divination?

432
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,670
I've got it.

433
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:03,950
It's a copycat.

434
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,390
I've seen it in novels

435
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,190
and films.

436
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,670
Some killers

437
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,190
follow specific patterns

438
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,070
to achieve a particular goal.

439
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,870
Novels?

440
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,910
Why would they follow

441
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:17,750
a divination pattern?

442
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,230
I might be able to help.

443
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,220
There's a master diviner where I live

444
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,840
who's an expert in the Book of Changes.

445
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,460
Everyone goes to him
for fortune-telling.

446
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,340
He's very accurate.

447
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,630
That could work.

448
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,310
While the Book of Changes

449
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,230
is a profound study,

450
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,030
no one has fully understood it.

451
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,860
Well, we're not going
for fortune-telling.

452
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,700
He might offer some insights
into the case.

453
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,030
All right.

454
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,540
He Chun and I will pay him a visit.

455
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,870
Let's head back.

456
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,390
What are you doing?

457
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,550
Nothing.

458
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,630
Nothing?

459
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,710
Does it look good?

460
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:44,870
Yes.

461
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,550
You look beautiful in everything.

462
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,510
Smooth talker.

463
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,070
You do look good!

464
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,350
How good?

465
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,310
Very good!

466
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,430
Get on.

467
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,550
I'm a man.

468
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,590
I can't let you carry me.

469
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,710
It won't be the first time.

470
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:24,670
Get on.

471
00:26:32,046 --> 00:26:32,646
Hold on tight.

472
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,630
That diviner

473
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,190
sure lives far away.

474
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,550
Sorry for the trouble.

475
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,790
I don't believe
in fortune-telling or face-reading.

476
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,950
The Hetu and Luoshu

477
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,110
are vast and profound.

478
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,390
I don't believe in them either,

479
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,030
but I think they might be

480
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,190
connected to this case.

481
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,630
There's a tea house ahead.

482
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,390
Let's stop by.

483
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,590
The tricks in Zhou Qin's books

484
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,390
always follow traditional methods.

485
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,670
I doubt he would

486
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,310
step outside his logic.

487
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,430
The killer should be

488
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,110
within the Zhai Residence.

489
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,420
What's the matter?

490
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,510
How can a serious woman
look so charming?

491
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,150
Smooth talker.

492
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,710
We have a case to solve.

493
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,190
There.

494
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,270
Cases are endless.

495
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,880
When we get to the Zhai Residence,

496
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,350
we'll interrogate them properly.

497
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:43,550
Don't worry.

498
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,470
We're in public.

499
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,670
You're my wife.

500
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,180
What's there to be shy about?

501
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:19,910
Let's go.

502
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,420
(Zhai Residence)

503
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,030
All right. I've heard you.

504
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:32,750
You're dismissed.

505
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,110
Yes.

506
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,880
You must be tired

507
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,940
after standing so long.

508
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,750
I'm fine.

509
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,430
I can manage.

510
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,140
Let's carry on.

511
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,420
Why don't you sit down for a bit?

512
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,470
My name is Ouyang Mingyue.

513
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,990
Master Zhai is my uncle.

514
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:02,710
Your uncle?

515
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,390
So,

516
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,110
you've been living with your uncle?

517
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,590
Yes.

518
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,390
I was told my parents passed away

519
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,870
when I was very young,

520
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,590
and my uncle took me in.

521
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,390
I've lived in the Zhai Residence

522
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,830
ever since I can remember.

523
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,320
What were you doing
the night of the incident?

524
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,390
I was in my room with the maid,

525
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,990
copying scriptures.

526
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,670
When I heard my uncle scream,

527
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,350
I went out to check with everyone else.

528
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,790
Did you notice

529
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,910
anyone coming
or going from the Zhai Residence

530
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,910
after the incident?

531
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,110
I don't know.

532
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,510
After checking,

533
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,910
I returned to my room
to continue copying scriptures.

534
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,590
Your uncle died,

535
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,750
and you still had the mood
to copy scriptures?

536
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,550
I'm just staying here.

537
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,110
I rarely interacted with my uncle.

538
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,670
I don't get involved

539
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,260
in the Zhai family's matters.

540
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:56,910
Understood.

541
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,150
You may leave.

542
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,190
Leave us.

543
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,990
Are you Master Zhai's daughter?

544
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,350
Yes.

545
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:21,950
Was my father

546
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,590
really murdered?

547
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,350
Don't worry.

548
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,910
We'll uncover the truth.

549
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,750
What were you doing

550
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,340
the night of the incident?

551
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,590
I retired early that night.

552
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,190
I only found out what happened

553
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,030
when the maid woke me up.

554
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,310
Then,

555
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,030
how's your relationship
with your cousin,

556
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,230
Ouyang Mingyue?

557
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,150
Mingyue...

558
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,590
We're close.

559
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,070
She takes good care of me.

560
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:53,950
Why?

561
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,870
Is there something wrong with her?

562
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:05,870
Nothing.

563
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,190
Just a routine inquiry.

564
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,270
You can leave now.

565
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:17,950
I feel like

566
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,870
everyone in this family

567
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,190
is behaving

568
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,310
rather strangely.

569
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,630
Agreed.

570
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:27,790
Sit down.

571
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,430
You must be tired
from standing all day.

572
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,670
I'm fine.

573
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,470
I'm not tired.

574
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,400
Are you hungry?

575
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:35,550
A little.

576
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,910
I'll make you

577
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,470
some noodles later.

578
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:39,430
All right.

579
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:40,750
This spot.

580
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,710
Yes, ma'am.

581
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,030
Refill, please.

582
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:50,710
Coming right up.

583
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,270
You're drinking this like it's liquor.

584
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,190
Drinking so much.

585
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,780
Are you just trying
to make conversation?

586
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,750
Your refill.

587
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,750
Enjoy.

588
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,990
I'm done.

589
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,070
I can't drink anymore.

590
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,670
It's a long journey.

591
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:10,790
Who knows

592
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,950
when we'll find water again?

593
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,030
Hand it over.

594
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,070
The flower looks lovely on you.

595
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,590
Just the flower?

596
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:50,790
What's wrong?

597
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,670
Finally, two easy targets.

598
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,270
Search them.

599
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,230
Please, have mercy!

600
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,070
Mercy, my lady!

601
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,310
Instead of earning an honest living,

602
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,790
you're doing these harmful deeds.

603
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,070
Please, have mercy.

604
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,390
Give us another chance.

605
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,710
We won't dare do this again.

606
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,750
We're only doing this

607
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,670
out of desperation.

608
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,700
We won't do it again.

609
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,590
We're serious!

610
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,030
Please give us another chance.

611
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,310
If there's a next time,

612
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,630
I won't let you off.

613
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:30,350
Now go!

614
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,390
Yes...

615
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:31,950
Hurry!

616
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,750
Thank you!

617
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,470
Come on!

618
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:45,510
Sun Weiyan?

619
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,670
Sun Weiyan?

620
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:48,550
Come on.

621
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,390
Let's get out of here.

622
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,150
Sun Weiyan!

623
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,590
I'm fine.

624
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,190
It's minor.

625
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,940
You don't even know martial arts.

626
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,980
Why shield me?

627
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,310
I'm a man.

628
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,790
I couldn't put you in danger.

629
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,910
You fool.

630
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:18,990
I'll go deal with them.

631
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:19,710
No need.

632
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,800
We'll get someone
to take care of them later.

633
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:22,630
Let's go.

634
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,420
(Yan Administrative Office)

635
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,350
Zijie...

636
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,030
What happened to you?

637
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,910
Don't ask.

638
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:41,830
Ran into a crooked inn.

639
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,870
Are you all right?

640
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:43,910
I'm fine.

641
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,510
He Chun already helped bandage me up.

642
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,150
I let myself go for just a while,

643
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,580
and Yan City has become such a mess.

644
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:49,750
Oh, right.

645
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,830
This is the master diviner

646
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,350
I told you about.

647
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,150
Sir,

648
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:59,910
I'd be most grateful

649
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,950
for your assistance.

650
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,550
Spare me the small talk.

651
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:04,910
Give me liquor

652
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,590
or

653
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:07,870
give me money.

654
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,870
Pay him, then.

655
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,910
I've heard the story.

656
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,390
Take me to the scene.

657
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:25,470
