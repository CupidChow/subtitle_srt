21
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,950
What do you mean?

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,510
Guo Shouyi, Former Secretary

23
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,870
of the Ministry of Justice.

24
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,510
He solved the case of the Hong family
massacre that took 32 lives.

25
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,390
What?

26
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,230
You never knew?

27
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,110
My father was once an official?

28
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,390
Not just any official.

29
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,270
He had a respectable reputation.

30
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:44,790
No.

31
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,110
Impossible.

32
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,710
This can't be true.

33
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,740
All officials and officers are recorded.

34
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,550
Check the records

35
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,270
if you have any doubts.

36
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,990
Like father, like son.

37
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,470
I thought

38
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,790
you'd be my rival.

39
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,150
But surprisingly...

40
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,710
Guo Zijie...

41
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,870
Get it together.

42
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,790
Do not disappoint me.

43
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,270
Zijie.

44
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,430
Your mother

45
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,270
insisted that this bracelet
must be passed

46
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,350
to your future wife.

47
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,910
Your job now

48
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,750
is to keep it safe.

49
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,150
You helped solve the case

50
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,030
with the Lyu family.

51
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,550
Unbelievable!

52
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,630
You're getting better at this.

53
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,470
Well played, Father.

54
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,710
Perhaps

55
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,070
we could have another game.

56
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,590
Never mind.

57
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,270
The work outside is done.

58
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,070
At home,

59
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,190
the work mustn't be left unfinished.

60
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,790
You've really
crossed the line this time.

61
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,350
Why didn't you talk to me

62
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,590
as soon as you came back?

63
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,790
I heard

64
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,950
you got into a fight with Zilu.

65
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,350
He is your brother!

66
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,190
Was it really necessary?

67
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,380
(Command)

68
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,190
(Follow your heart.)

69
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,910
(Uphold justice with your heart.)

70
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,870
(Do as the heart tells you.)

71
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,940
(Do as the heart tells you.
Written by Guo Shouyi)

72
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:53,870
Father.

73
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,030
I think I get it now.

74
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,780
(Yan Administrative Office)

75
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,070
Xuanxuan.

76
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,030
What is going on?

77
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,310
Perfect timing, Magistrate Guo.

78
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,070
The bunch of you,

79
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,310
tell Magistrate Guo

80
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,870
what you've done.

81
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,590
The new coroner

82
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,470
took off with the severed arm.

83
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,910
All new recruits must get
their backgrounds checked.

84
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,870
How did they get away so easily?

85
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,550
Miss He Chun left.

86
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,190
The coroner's pay is too low.

87
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,310
We couldn't find any suitable candidate.

88
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,310
Only the newcomer named Xu
would take the job.

89
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,590
The newcomer

90
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,550
was not a local.

91
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,430
We wanted to do a background check,

92
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,230
but we were all grunts.

93
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,750
With Mr. Sun gone,

94
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,750
we had no idea what to do.

95
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,590
We thought we should wait
until your return.

96
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,800
We didn't know...

97
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,110
You didn't know.

98
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,150
We assumed

99
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,470
Master Guo had no one
to take over his place,

100
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,550
but I am genuinely taken aback

101
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,190
by the incompetence
of your subordinates.

102
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,070
The blame is on me.

103
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,630
My deepest apology.

104
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,630
I'll get to the bottom of this.

105
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,630
I won't fail the people.

106
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,990
Does that mean

107
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,710
you'll investigate this case?

108
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,190
This happened in Yan City.

109
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,110
This is my responsibility.

110
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,030
Zijie.

111
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,750
Are you serious about this?

112
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,030
Relax.

113
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,430
Very well.

114
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,510
In that case,

115
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,590
I'd like to see

116
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,870
if you are a true detective.

117
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,590
Let's find out

118
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,910
who can solve the case first.

119
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,510
I'll gladly accept the challenge.

120
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,230
Wait and see!

121
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,710
We're not going to lose!

122
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,550
Stand up.

123
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,750
Yes. Much obliged.

124
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,390
What makes you come around?

125
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,870
I'll tell you later.

126
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,230
Xuanxuan.

127
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,350
I've been mistaken the whole time.

128
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:30,870
I thought

129
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,870
what Father wrote in the letter

130
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,790
told me to protect my loved ones.

131
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,990
But today,

132
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,350
I finally understand the message.

133
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,110
So, Father handed over

134
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,310
the family business to
your brother and made donations

135
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,870
to get you a job

136
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,830
so you could inherit his legacy.

137
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,590
That's the Guo Zijie I know.

138
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,230
But I wonder where He Chun went.

139
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,550
If it's just the two of us,

140
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,190
we can't handle all the work.

141
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,350
Let's see.

142
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,790
Miss He Chun

143
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,260
will arrive this evening.

144
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,830
Did you contact her?

145
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,110
I sent her a letter

146
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,230
on our way here.

147
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,030
I guess I owe you

148
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,070
a big thank.

149
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,590
Don't mention it.

150
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,550
But He Chun alone might not be enough

151
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,710
to deal with the work.

152
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,470
Sun Weiyan is not a bad person.

153
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,950
He was only blinded by greed.

154
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,470
I don't have a grudge against him.

155
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,430
It's just that

156
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,870
we grew up together.

157
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,150
After what he did,

158
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,750
I don't know how to face him.

159
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,950
I get it.

160
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,030
When a lifelong friend

161
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,110
does horrible things,

162
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,270
anyone would harbor a grudge.

163
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,630
But we can always move on.

164
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,230
Right?

165
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,670
Right.

166
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,350
The spoken Tao...

167
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,310
The spoken Tao...

168
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,550
Is not eternal.

169
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,510
Is not eternal.

170
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,150
- The spoken name...
- The spoken name...

171
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,590
Is not eternal.

172
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,390
Is not eternal.

173
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,430
Heaven and Earth...

174
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,270
Had no name in their origin.

175
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:26,910
We're here.

176
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,790
Had no name in their origin.

177
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,390
Watch your steps.

178
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,430
The named is the Mother of all.

179
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,750
The named is the Mother of all.

180
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,550
- The spoken Tao...
- The spoken Tao...

181
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,870
- Is not eternal.
- Is not eternal.

182
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,630
Hurry.

183
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,550
- The spoken name...
- The spoken name...

184
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,630
is not eternal.

185
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,710
Look.

186
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,870
He's over there.

187
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,470
Heaven and Earth...

188
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,550
Had no name in their origin.

189
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,190
The named

190
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,230
is the Mother of all.

191
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,550
The problem between you two

192
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,430
has to end at some point.

193
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,710
Whatever choice you make,

194
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,140
you'll have my support.

195
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:01,830
All right?

196
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,310
Let's go.

197
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,190
Come on.

198
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,110
Sir, you have guests.

199
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,550
Xuanxuan!

200
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,710
What...

201
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,110
What brought you here?

202
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,270
Have you heard

203
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,310
about the severed arm?

204
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,320
The office needs a private secretary.

205
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,870
But I heard you had already

206
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,350
hired another one.

207
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,550
Yes.

208
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,550
Zijie!

209
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,070
Sit.

210
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,950
Does this mean

211
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:18,990
I can go back?

212
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,750
But what I did...

213
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,950
All water under the bridge.

214
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:26,830
Forget it.

215
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,150
Zijie has forgiven you.

216
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,830
Can I still trust you?

217
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,510
Zijie.

218
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,190
I won't let you down.

219
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,590
I've lost my father.

220
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:47,910
I was deceived.

221
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,070
I must catch that liar.

222
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:51,990
You have my word.

223
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,590
Any lead on the case so far?

224
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,710
That kid over there,

225
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,430
who is he?

226
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,430
De,

227
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,390
come here.

228
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,190
This is

229
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,990
the kid I told you about.

230
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,990
The son of Wang Er.

231
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,310
A lovely kid.

232
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,990
Are you...

233
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,990
the detective of Yan City?

234
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,870
How do you know?

235
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,310
The teacher tells us stories

236
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,390
about the detective

237
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,230
and Miss Xuanxuan every day.

238
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,750
My teacher says

239
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,390
you two are the smartest people

240
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,470
in this world.

241
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:38,750
Good boy.

242
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,430
My father isn't a murderer.

243
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,550
You will

244
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,390
help save my father,

245
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,070
right?

246
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,950
I even asked around.

247
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,470
Wang Er's

248
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,670
wine delivery routes

249
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,550
are very clear.

250
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,470
Besides,

251
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,000
he has no enemies in the village.

252
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,910
I doubt this was his doing.

253
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:01,750
De,

254
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,540
come closer.

255
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:05,990
See this?

256
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,590
This man

257
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,510
is the greatest detective in Yan City.

258
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,550
He will help you

259
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,670
solve your father's case.

260
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,310
Pinky swear.

261
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,630
Pinky swear.

262
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,590
A pinky swear with him.

263
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,470
I'll help.

264
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,790
Go on, De.

265
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,800
Play with the kids.

266
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,590
What a lovely kid.

267
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,350
Yeah.

268
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,110
He is the best student we have

269
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,630
in this classroom.

270
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,230
Stop staring.

271
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,230
I thought

272
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,430
he was cute.

273
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,510
When are you two

274
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,550
going to have one too?

275
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,070
Don't start spewing nonsense.

276
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,710
I am simply concerned.

277
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,990
I don't need your concern.

278
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,470
By the way,

279
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,070
why isn't He Chun

280
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,710
here with you today?

281
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,470
Do you miss her?

282
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,400
Do you want to know?

283
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,750
Just asking.

284
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,350
Yeah.

285
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,070
Just asking.

286
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,310
You are mean.

287
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,110
I won't tell you.

288
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,030
Xuanxuan contacted He Chun.

289
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,390
She will meet up with us later.

290
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,350
Are you coming?

291
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,590
Now?

292
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,390
See you.

293
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,950
Wait.

294
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,750
I'll go too.

295
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,070
Let me get changed

296
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,070
and talk to the students.

297
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,820
We'll be at the entrance.

298
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,320
Yes.

299
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,150
Wait for me!

300
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,070
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

301
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,270
- Teacher!
- Sir!

302
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,710
Sir, where are you going?

303
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,950
Are you ever coming back?

304
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,830
Could you please stay with us?

305
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,630
Sir, don't leave us.

306
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,750
We're going to miss you.

307
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,910
We'll miss you.

308
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,910
Please don't go.

309
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,550
Please stay.

310
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,830
Mr. Sun, goodbye.

311
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,350
You can study.

312
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,510
When you have knowledge,
you won't get bullied.

313
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,270
Study?

314
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,710
Can someone like me study too?

315
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,630
Do not lament over
the lack of followers,

316
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,540
for there are
carriages and horses in books.

317
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,470
So, why not?

318
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:27,870
I am

319
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,830
going to finish

320
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,110
an important job.

321
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,190
I'll visit you again.

322
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,310
Goodbye, sir!

323
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,870
Goodbye, sir!

324
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,990
Goodbye!

325
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,350
Goodbye, Mr. Sun!

326
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,230
Where did you go?

327
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,110
Wait for me!

328
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,550
Wait for me!

329
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,670
Zijie!

330
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,700
(Guo Residence)

331
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,910
That cursed

332
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,750
new coroner is less than worthless.

333
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,790
With the arm missing,

334
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,310
we don't even have a lead.

335
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,110
We've solved more complicated cases.

336
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,310
This time,

337
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,700
we can still solve it.

338
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,590
Young Master Zijie.

339
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,750
Official Zhou wants to see you.

340
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,070
Where is he?

341
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,430
He's here.

342
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,710
Let's meet him.

343
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,470
Get some rest.

344
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,800
I'll take a look.

345
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,110
Zijie.

346
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,390
Welcome back.

347
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,430
Perfect.

348
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,670
Come with me.

349
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,270
Young Master.

350
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,870
Young Master!

351
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,470
You can go now.

352
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,550
What is this about?

353
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,510
You look skittish.

354
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,230
Get it together.

355
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,700
The administrative office
found a severed leg.

356
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:35,910
What?

357
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,710
Is it a leg this time?

358
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:41,950
Who could've done this?

359
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,430
Who is trying to bring me down?

360
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,150
Sir,

361
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,790
let's discuss it later.

362
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,510
I heard it was an old officer

363
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,510
who found the leg.

364
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,590
The leg is on the way to the office.

365
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,750
It will arrive by tomorrow morning.

366
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,870
What's the plan?

367
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,990
Sir,

368
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:59,630
we might as well

369
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,430
finish

370
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,310
what we started.

371
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,590
What does that mean?

372
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:21,910
Sir.

373
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:27,950
Magistrate Guo.

374
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,630
Having leisure

375
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,310
despite the unsolved case?

376
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,830
Has your investigation had any results?

377
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,270
Long He.

378
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,140
(Official Document)

379
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,110
(A blood-stained arm.)
Zijie, they found a severed leg.

380
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,030
The leg

381
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,070
was found at the clearing
west of the city.

382
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,590
Official Zhou.

383
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,870
From what I know,

384
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,150
the arm and the leg

385
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,430
were found 4 kilometers apart.

386
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:57,950
4 kilometers?

387
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,510
Quite a distance.

388
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,470
What do you make of this?

389
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,670
Given the distance apart,

390
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,190
are we sure
they come from the same victim?

391
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,430
But if they were left there
by the same culprit,

392
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,230
why would they discard
the body parts so far away?

393
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,630
It doesn't add up.

394
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,310
Thanks to your coroner

395
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,670
who took the arm,

396
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,510
otherwise

397
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,070
we could've examined it.

398
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,830
Magistrate Guo.

399
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,110
The report came on a swift rider.

400
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:31,990
The severed leg will be here

401
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,270
by tomorrow morning.

402
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,030
It's getting late.

403
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,750
I shan't bother you.

404
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,870
Long He.

405
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,590
The arrogance!

406
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,230
His arrogance is criminal!

407
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,470
Leave them be.

408
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,360
Let's see who solves the case first.

409
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,150
Are you sure about this plan?

410
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,230
Sir,

411
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,910
at this point,

412
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,110
it's our only option.

413
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:04,470
Old man,

414
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,230
hand over the bag!

415
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,350
Who are you?

416
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,230
(Clear Blue Sky)

417
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,190
Zhou Shaoliang is really

418
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,510
getting on my nerves.

419
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,270
But why would he inform you of the leg?

420
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,350
Don't you find it odd?

421
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,740
I was about to ask you.

422
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,870
Did you hear about him

423
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,070
in the Capital?

424
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,230
Of course.

425
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,960
It's the first time I've met him,

426
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,270
but he's renowned as the clerk

427
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,910
of the Ministry of Justice.

428
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,790
By the way,

429
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,270
he was Grand Mentor Zhou's

430
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,430
most favored disciple.

431
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,230
Grand Mentor Zhou?

432
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,150
Was it Zhou Qin?

433
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,150
So, Zhou Shaoliang studied under him.

434
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,910
Is there a problem?

435
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,390
My father mentioned him.

436
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,430
Zhou Qin.

437
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,540
Born in the 13th year
of the Qinglong Era.

438
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,760
Favored by the late emperor.

439
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,500
Appointed as
the Crown Prince's teacher.

440
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,560
Due to his contributions,
His Majesty promoted him

441
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,580
to Grand Mentor.

442
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,110
Zijie.

443
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,990
Are you suspecting him?

444
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,990
But Zhou Qin is a man

445
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,150
with power and status.

446
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,670
Why would he come after you?

447
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,550
At first, I thought it was personal.

448
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,630
But according to Xuanxuan,

449
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,150
someone who came

450
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,110
from the same place as her

451
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,110
was planning all of this.

452
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,070
I suspect

453
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,150
his target is Xuanxuan.

454
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,670
He's the one Xuanxuan mentioned!

455
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,710
We have to let her know immediately.

456
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,110
But this is all just speculation.

457
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,230
If Zhou Qin really is behind all this,

458
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,390
we don't have the means

459
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,270
to go against him

460
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,030
We should investigate further.

461
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,710
As you wish.

462
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,110
So...

463
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:52,790
Zijie,

464
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,630
where is

465
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,910
Miss He Chun?

466
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,070
What's wrong?

467
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,270
Do you miss her?

468
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,190
No.

469
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:03,950
Just asking.

470
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,510
She and Xuanxuan have been
very mysterious lately.

471
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,670
Who knows what they are up to?

472
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,190
But since Xuanxuan says

473
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,230
He Chun will be back today,

474
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,420
there shouldn't be a problem.

475
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,760

talked about.

483

Xuanxuan.

484
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,990
I don't mean to lie to you.

485
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,150
I'm worried for you.

486
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,390
But you know

487
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,670
I am the target.

488
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,230
If they are the mastermind...

489
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,030

any obstacles together.

503
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,110
Could you tell me more

504
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,580
about Grand Mentor Zhou?

505
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,310

Zhou Shaoliang seems flustered.

513
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,590
I bet he didn't find anything useful.

514
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,630
Hence,

515
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,550
no need to worry.

516
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:14,910
I think

517
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,470
we are in the lead.

518
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,110
Zijie!

519
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,870
Sir, take a seat.

520
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,630
What is it?

521
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,790
Fine, let him have the seat.

522
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,070
Where's Xuanxuan?

523
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,270
She left this morning
like she was sneaking away.

527
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,870
Good sir, calm down.

528
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,760
What is this about?

529
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,510
Take your time.

530
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,590
Official Zhou is here.

531
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,590
Please tell us

532
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,950
the predicament you're facing.

533
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,670
My name is Li Jiu.

534
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,950
A rich guy named Chang
had recently moved here.

535
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,350
My daughter, Lian,

536
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,950
went to work for him.

537
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,030
However,

538
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,350
she hadn't contacted us in a long time.

539
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,550
I was worried sick for her,

540
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,920
so I went to the Chang Residence
to look for her.

541
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,910
But the people there told me

542
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,200
my daughter had resigned

543
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,830
and went home.

544
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,070
My poor daughter!

545
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,710
The wicked family must have harmed her!

546
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,030
Long He.

547
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:27,790
Yes.

548
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,070
Is the severed leg here?

549
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,190
Show it to him.

550
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,910
The leg was delivered

551
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,830
by an old officer.

552
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,630
He walks slowly.

553
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,720
Our men are escorting him.

554
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,740
He should be here soon.

555
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,800
This evidence is important!

556
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,660
Show some competence!

557
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,310
What's so funny?

558
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,510
You lost the arm

559
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,950
we could've examined.

560
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,230
What?

561
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,110
A severed arm?

562
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,390
Was my daughter dismembered?

563
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,870
Calm down.

564
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,710
It's too early to draw any conclusion.

565
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,590
Lian wasn't the one

566
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,520
who got dismembered.

567
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,350
He Chun!

568
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,990
Who are you?

569
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,070
What makes you say that?

570
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,510
What is in the bag?

571
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:01,910
Sir,

572
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,350
the severed limb.

573
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,310
Very well.

574
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,550
Bring them in!

575
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,310
I ran into Coroner Xu.

576
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,830
He was sneaking out of the city.

577
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,870
So, I arrested him.

578
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,390
According to him,

579
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,080
Chang Zheng claimed his mother was ill,

580
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,660
and spent a fortune on a severed arm.

581
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,310
I sensed foul play.

582
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,550
So, I follow Chang Zheng
and his servant.

583
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,350
As expected,

584
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,230
the two ambushed the old officer

585
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,190
to steal the leg.

586
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,550
I caught them red-handed.

587
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,150
Very well.

588
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,110
You two, come clean.

589
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,670
He Chun.

590
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,590
You said the dismembered body

591
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,870
was not Lian.

592
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,950
Can you confirm it?

593
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:50,710
Yes.

594
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,350
The deceased

595
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,310
was clearly a male.

596
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,510
It can't be Lian.

597
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:55,990
What?

598
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,670
How can this be?

599
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,190
What's going on?

600
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,910
I can ask you the same thing.

601
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,030
Who did you kill?

602
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,500
(Seven days ago)

603
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,910
Lian.

604
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,110
You look pretty.

605
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,550
Working here is a waste of your beauty.

606
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,870
Young Master...

607
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,590
If you serve me,

608
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,510
I'll make sure

609
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,080
you get the finest things

610
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,150
in life.

611
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,670
I was born into a poor family.

612
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,030
I'm not worthy of you.

613
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,390
Please let me go.

614
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,710
I'll take great care of you!

615
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,350
Young Master!

616
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,350
Let me go!

617
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,030
Let me go!

618
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,510
Stop it.

619
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,630
I'll scream for help.

620
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,710
But I like you.

621
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,070
Why would you scream?

622
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,470
Let go of me!

623
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,670
Was that really necessary?

624
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,550
You killed my mood.

625
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,430
Lian?

626
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,110
What now?

627
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,590
Sir, I'm wronged!

628
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,630
I never killed anyone!

629
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,630
Never!

630
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,590
Perhaps you will confess

631
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,790
with some harsher punishment.

632
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:06,790
Long He.

633
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,510
Yes.

634
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,390
Guards.

635
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,110
Yes!

636
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,230
Magistrate Guo!

637
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,160
Great Detective Guo!

638
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,110
I know your stories!

639
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,030
You say it's wrong
to punish with a fair trial!

640
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,230
I'm innocent!

641
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,710
- I'm innocent!
- We've been wronged!

642
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,390
Magistrate Guo is merciful,

643
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,870
but not to everyone.

644
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,470
People like you

645
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,350
deserve the beating.

646
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,230
Strike them.

647
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:35,430
Sir!

648
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,990
Sir, I didn't do it!

649
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,390
I'm innocent!

650
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,270
Sir!

651
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,390
Sir!

652
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,030
I'm innocent, sir!

653
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,110
Magistrate Guo!

654
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,870
You informed He Chun before all this.

655
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,070
You've impressed me.

656
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,110
Even if you found some leads,

657
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,710
how did she get informed?

658
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,550
It's a secret.

659
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:55,910
You won't tell me?

660
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,520
Are you telling me now?

661
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,670
- Fine.
- Will you tell me?

662
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,310
I'll say it.

663
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,440
It's all thanks to Xuanxuan.

664
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,240
Xuanxuan?

665
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,870
What is going on here?

666
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:04,910
Fine,

667
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,230
I'll tell you.

668
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,190
I made

669
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,710
a promise to Miss He Chun.

670
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,270
If anything happens,

671
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,230
we'll leave a mark
at the office entrance.

672
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,790
When she sees it,
she will go into hiding.

673
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,750
Then, she will go to the rouge store

674
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,150
west of the city for my note.

675
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,590
Why didn't you tell me?

676
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,310
I only got the lead this morning.

677
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,390
I didn't have the time.

678
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,190
I owe you a big thank.

679
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,030
Don't get so formal with me.

680
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,470
But I have to wonder.

681
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,710
Since the body isn't Lian,

682
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,950
where could she be now?

683
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,990
We'll know soon.

684
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,070
Sir!

685
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:40,990
Sir!

686
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,150
Sir!

687
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,480
Chang Zheng confessed.

688
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,790
After they killed Lian,

689
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,120
the buried her on Huilong Hill.

690
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:48,830
Come,

691
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,110
to Huilong Hill.

692
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,750
He Chun?

693
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,150
The deceased is a woman.

694
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,630
Around 20 years old.

695
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,790
The body is complete.

696
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,190
No signs of dismemberment.

697
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,270
She was so young.

698
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,950
Poor thing.

699
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,390
Chang Zheng and Dalong thought

700
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,950
someone had dismembered Lian,
who they buried here.

701
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,830
They wanted to destroy
the remaining evidence.

702
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,430
So, they lied about
the mother being sick

703
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,070
to get the severed arm

704
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,150
and steal the leg.

705
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,310
They deserved it.

706
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,030
But if they hadn't made a mistake,

707
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,710
it could take forever

708
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,060
before anyone found out
what happened to Lian.

709
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,030
But did the severed limb belong to?

710
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,030
Miss He Chun.

711
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,270
Did the arm

712
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,110
and leg

713
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,260
come from the same person?

714
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,550
Time was running short.

715
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,900
I need to examine them again.

716
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,030
Carry on.

717
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,270
Thankfully,

718
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,350
we can now prove Wang Er's innocence.

719
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,550
Contact Lian's family.

720
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,830
Give her a proper send-off.

721
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:27,510
Yes.

722
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,940
Head back to the office.

723
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,750
Come here.

724
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,480
