21
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,640
The method

22
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,680
is known as

23
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,200
memory implantation.

24
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,320
Memory implantation?

25
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,680
Memory implantation?

26
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,520
Memory implantation?

27
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,480
Does that mean
someone altered my memory?

28
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,200
(It's said the Zhai Village's)

29
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,360
(alchemy room used to be grand.)

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,560
(It was very similar
to Shangqing Temple in Yanzhou.)

31
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,160
(When you were a kid,)

32
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,840
(your father brought you there, right?)

33
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,920
(I was fortunate enough
to see that alchemy furnace.)

34
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,160
(It was indeed unprecedentedly grand.)

35
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,640
(Who did Master Zhai believe in?)

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
(Your father loves you.)

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,620
(He must've told you before, right?)

38
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,600
(Try and recall.)

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,040
(Master Zhai killed your father.)

40
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,720
(You were in the temple at that time)

41
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,240
(and you saw everything, right?)

42
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,360
(Right?)

43
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,520
It can't be.

44
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,640
How could it be?

45
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,760
I saw it.

46
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,520
I saw it myself!

47
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Young Lady Mingyue!

48
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,520
Are you all right?

49
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
How could this happen?

50
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,560
Sit.

51
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,640
Sit down.

52
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,200
Young lady Mingyue...

53
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,280
Mingyue.

54
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,040
Mingyue.

55
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,760
Miss Keqin,

56
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,880
since Ouyang Mingyu made you believe

57
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,400
you were that girl,

58
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,020
she must've told you about
everything she went through.

59
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,980
Try to recall

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,980
what she told you.

61
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,920
When I was a kid,

62
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,040
Mingyue told me

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,080
that Master Zhai was actually my uncle.

64
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,280
He killed my parents.

65
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,360
As for how they died,

66
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,100
Mingyue didn't say much about it
at first.

67
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,480
It wasn't until six months ago

68
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,900
that she told me what exactly happened
back then.

69
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,540
Spared no detail.

70
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,600
That makes sense.

71
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,080
In Ouyang Mingyue's mind,

72
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,880
Master Zhai killed her parents.

73
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,480
Someone kept insinuating to her

74
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,400
that she had created an illusion

75
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,640
of her father

76
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,600
being killed,

77
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,040
and she mistook it for the truth.

78
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,600
Mingyue.

79
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,200
Sir,

80
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,000
judging by Ouyang Mingyue's reaction...

81
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,040
Mingyue.

82
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,960
I think

83
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,400
- something's off.
- Mingyue.

84
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,640
Sir,

85
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,880
this reminds me.

86
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,280
When I went to Zhai Village
for investigation,

87
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,640
I didn't find any evidence,

88
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,520
but I heard rumors among the villagers

89
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,040
that Master Zhai was on bad terms
with the married couple

90
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,660
and had killed his brother-in-law.

91
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,120
It wasn't related to the case,

92
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,520
so I didn't think much of it.

93
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,520
In other words,

94
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,280
Ouyang Mingyue

95
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,480
believed in those rumors

96
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,000
when she was a kid

97
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,660
and held grudges against him.

98
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,840
So when someone planted hints,

99
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,000
she imagined new memories.

100
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,360
No, it isn't.

101
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,920
It must be your lie.

102
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,240
When I reviewed old cases,

103
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,960
I noticed there were

104
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,700
several cases of
saltpeter explosions in Zhai Village.

105
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,600
My father died in the explosion...

106
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,960
Mother.

107
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
What's happening?

108
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,600
It's all right.

109
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,880
Don't worry. It's all right.

110
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,720
Dear.

111
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,880
Dear.

112
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,760
Wake up.

113
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,480
Answer me.

114
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,240
Wake up.

115
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,240
Dear.

116
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,240
Mother, I'm back.

117
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,720
Mother.

118
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,880
Mother.

119
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,120
Mother...

120
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,400
Mother!

121
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,040
Mingyue,

122
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,120
I'll take you home.

123
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,360
From now on, my house is your house.

124
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,120
The Ouyangs are

125
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,320
so pitiful.

126
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,720
That husband and wife died,

127
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,980
leaving their child all alone.

128
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,000
If you ask me,

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,360
Zhai must be behind all this.

130
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,600
Yeah.

131
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,560
He must be the murderer
of the Ouyang couple.

132
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,640
Mingyue will be on her own from now on.

133
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,400
What will she do?

134
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,080
How tragic.

135
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,280
Shameless.

136
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,000
Father, Mother!

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,960
Young Lady Mingyue...

138
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,480
Uncle...

139
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,840
Ouyang Mingyue,

140
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,640
who gave you

141
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,200
those hints?

142
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,640
I looked into you before.

143
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,880
You know nothing
about divination skills.

144
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Who taught you that?

145
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
Ouyang Mingyue.

146
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,920
Young Lady Mingyue.

147
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,680
Ouyang Mingyue!

148
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,500
Young Lady Mingyue!

149
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,160
Ouyang Mingyue.

150
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,760
Tell me

151
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,080
who it was.

152
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,480
This is very important to me.

153
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,920
Ouyang Mingyue, answer me.

154
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,560
Xuanxuan.

155
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,720
Give her some time.

156
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,320
We'll ask again when she calms down.

157
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,980
Come here.

158
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,760
The truth will be out sooner or later.

159
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,000
Take Ouyang Mingyue away.

160
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,200
Young Lady Mingyue.

161
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,760
Is something wrong with her mind?

162
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,180
If so, we can't get any information
from her.

163
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,720
It must be Zhou Qin.

164
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,100
No one knows how to implant memories
except him.

165
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,720
That's enough to expose him.

166
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,440
We'll catch him.

167
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,080
Zijie,

168
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,040
I'll go out for a while.

169
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,240
It's late.

170
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,080
Where are you going?

171
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:00,960
Nothing.

172
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,840
Don't worry.

173
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,040
Young Madam Guo.

174
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,000
What brings you here?

175
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,000
I just came to check.

176
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,840
Has anyone been here recently?

177
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,520
No.

178
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,620
Magistrate Guo instructed us
to guard this place.

179
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,220
We wouldn't dare let anyone in.

180
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,800
All right.

181
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,560
You may go.

182
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,000
But...

183
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,920
You've been working hard these days.

184
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,720
Take the silver and have some drinks.

185
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,120
I won't tell Magistrate Guo.

186
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,270
Thank you, Young Madam Guo.

187
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,760
- Thanks, Young Madam.
- Go ahead.

188
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,280
(Master Zhai)

189
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,480
(had his four limbs cut off)

190
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,960
(and he still tried to swallow
the bark.)

191
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,920
(There must be a reason why
he did this.)

192
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,600
(What would it be?)

193
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,000
Young Madam Guo.

194
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,120
Mister,

195
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,520
why are you here?

196
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,600
Who would've thought

197
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,680
that on the night
of Master Zhai's incident,

198
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
Mingyue hid him here?

199
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,320
This place is only

200
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,220
two streets away from Zhai Residence.

201
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,880
If I had

202
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,040
searched

203
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,640
a bit further,

204
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,880
perhaps he

205
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,760
wouldn't have...

206
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm ashamed to face him.

207
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
So I came here

208
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,880
to burn some joss paper for him.

209
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,000
Mister,

210
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,040
get up.

211
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,320
Mister,

212
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,680
I have a question for you.

213
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,240
Do you know

214
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,200
this?

215
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,480
Yes, I do.

216
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,320
It belongs to Master Zhai.

217
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,680
He always carried it with him.

218
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,240
Why is it with you?

219
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,760
I happened to find it.

220
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,160
I'd like to know

221
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,720
what tree bark this is.

222
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,400
I have no idea.

223
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,720
Master Zhai

224
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,160
never talked about this.

225
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,840
Even the family didn't know.

226
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,400
I only

227
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,800
noticed it

228
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,000
when I helped him

229
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,760
change his clothes.

230
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,440
No one knows

231
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,600
Master Zhai had this.

232
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,880
Not even Ouyang Mingyue?

233
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,680
She definitely doesn't.

234
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,680
Mingyue

235
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,200
wasn't close

236
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,760
with Master Zhai.

237
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,880
They

238
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,240
hardly even spoke.

239
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,640
So

240
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,400
there's no way

241
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,880
she would know

242
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,680
Master's belongings.

243
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,920
Do you know

244
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,320
where Master Zhai

245
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,160
got this from?

246
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,320
Two years ago,

247
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,720
Grand Mentor Zhou

248
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,000
held a birthday banquet.

249
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,280
Master Zhai requested an invitation

250
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,280
and went to the capital for the banquet.

251
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,760
Master Zhai

252
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,280
and Zhou Qin didn't know each other.

253
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
Where did the invitation

254
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,000
come from?

255
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
Young Madam Guo, let me tell you this.

256
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,320
Those invitations

257
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,960
can be bought for a price.

258
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,240
Back then,

259
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,960
it was me who handled this
for Master Zhai.

260
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,160
It cost

261
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,880
5,000 taels of silver.

262
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,000
By right,

263
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,240
Master Zhai is gone,

264
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,120
and I shouldn't

265
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,480
reveal this.

266
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,600
All right.

267
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,880
Mister,

268
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,800
I understand.

269
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,840
Thank you for telling me all this.

270
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,360
Please don't let anyone know about

271
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,880
our conversation tonight.

272
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,560
Also, don't mention this

273
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,440
to anyone.

274
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,760
Is it

275
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,560
very important?

276
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,000
It concerns someone's life.

277
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,480
All right, Young Madam Guo.

278
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,480
Xuanxuan,

279
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,040
you're back.

280
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,760
You're awake.

281
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,880
Where did you go?

282
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,120
I went out.

283
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,120
You're suspecting
that Zhou Qin killed Master Zhai

284
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
and blamed it on Mingyue,

285
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,480
aren't you?

286
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,680
Before Master Zhai died,

287
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,620
he had this piece of bark in his mouth.

288
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,200
This bark

289
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,160
must be related to the murderer.

290
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,960
But Ouyang Mingyue confessed.

291
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,020
The evidence is solid.

292
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,800
She's the murderer.

293
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,320
Even if it's related to Zhou Qin,

294
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,760
at most, he might've taught her

295
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,120
methods to kill.

296
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,680
How could he have possibly killed
Master Zhai himself?

297
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,280
We need to

298
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,760
investigate what happened

299
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,040
two years ago.

300
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,240
Come with me.

301
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,040
Sir,

302
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,040
hasn't this case been solved?

303
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,800
Why are you going to such lengths?

304
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,520
Long He,

305
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,480
what kind of person do you think

306
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,960
could come up with a method

307
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,480
like memory implantation?

308
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,200
Memory implantation?

309
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,480
So, you believe Cao Xuanxuan's theory?

310
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,120
I say there's no such thing
as memory implantation.

311
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,600
Ouyang Mingyue

312
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,560
must be overthinking.

313
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,880
When I was in my hometown,

314
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,120
I saw people

315
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,720
with mental problems.

316
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,920
They all had confused minds.

317
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,560
At Ouyang Mingyue's
public hearing tomorrow,

318
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,360
everyone in the city

319
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,280
will come to hear the final verdict.

320
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,280
I'm worried

321
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
that any wrong judgments

322
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,760
will cost innocent lives.

323
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,240
Sir,

324
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,880
whether there's memory implantation
or not,

325
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,240
there's no doubt
that Ouyang Mingyue is the murderer.

326
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,480
Ouyang Mingyue

327
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,160
must be executed.

328
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,600
But...

329
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,360
Take a seat.

330
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,540
Lord Su'll come to Yanzhou
for the ancestor event.

331
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,700
Grand Mentor will come
to make preparations in advance.

332
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,560
He should arrive in a few days.

333
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,680
Are you planning to tell them about

334
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,080
these baseless suspicions?

335
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,920
Guo Zijie is ahead of us this time.

336
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,280
If they find out about it,

337
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,520
they'll blame you for missing out.

338
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,400
Mentor...

339
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,120
Long He,

340
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,280
what do you think of Mentor?

341
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,840
Grand Mentor?

342
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,920
Needless to say,

343
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,400
over the past two years,

344
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,720
he has offered insightful opinions

345
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,980
in the imperial court

346
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,600
as well as plenty of novel ideas.

347
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,200
We once had a chat.

348
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,960
He said

349
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,480
the land is round

350
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,880
and that we're standing on a sphere.

351
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
That's strange.

352
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,960
Extraordinary, indeed.

353
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,800
This is bad.

354
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,100
We need to tell Xuanxuan
and the rest immediately.

355
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,880
Sir.

356
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,120
We'll talk outside.

357
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,600
What's the matter?

358
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,920
Master Zhai's body disappeared.

359
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,360
Stay here with Xuanxuan.

360
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,520
Yes.

361
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,800
Come with me.

362
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,400
Yes.

363
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,680
It's you?

364
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,960
It was you who gave me the hints

365
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,600
about the memory of my parents.

366
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,760
Why did you do this to me?

367
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,960
If you hadn't believed

368
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,640
in rumors,

369
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,960
how would it have been possible

370
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,360
to influence you?

371
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,000
You beast!

372
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,280
Drop your innocent act.

373
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,240
You killed the man

374
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,560
and severed all his limbs.

375
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,240
What woman

376
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,520
would have the courage to do so?

377
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,880
You've never been a kind person.

378
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,320
Don't panic just yet.

379
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,040
Until the last moment comes,

380
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,840
you won't know

381
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,280
who wins

382
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,120
or loses.

383
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,600
What are you getting at?

384
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,680
What does that mean?

385
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,480
Shaoliang.

386
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,120
Shaoliang.

387
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,800
Mentor?

388
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,360
Why are you here, Mentor?

389
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,320
We haven't met

390
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,720
for a long time.

391
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,440
Where are you going?

392
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,280
I was just about to
interrogate a prisoner.

393
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,360
No rush.

394
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,040
Well,

395
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,320
can you share the case

396
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,320
with me?

397
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,640
Mentor,

398
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,280
but...

399
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,880
Why?

400
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,680
Do you intend to

401
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
defy me?

402
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,280
I wouldn't dare.

403
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,120
Come on.

404
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,080
Let's go.

405
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,000
(Justice and Integrity)

406
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,600
Mentor,

407
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,720
although the case has been solved,

408
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,680
I believe there are still
many unresolved doubts.

409
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,000
Shaoliang,

410
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,440
what do you

411
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,480
think of Cao Xuanxuan?

412
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,680
Young Madam Guo?

413
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,380
She has remarkable insights

414
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,680
into the case.

415
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,600
If it weren't for

416
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,720
her new ideas,

417
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,540
I'm afraid I couldn't have been
able to solve it so smoothly.

418
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,840
She's truly a rare,

419
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,960
extraordinary woman.

420
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,840
Ask yourself this.

421
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,000
Who is more talented,

422
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,880
you or her?

423
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,720
I've disappointed you.

424
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,880
With her backing Guo Zijie,

425
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,960
it's no wonder

426
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,440
that you lost.

427
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,640
This case is

428
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,000
indeed bizarre.

429
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,760
Beyond what ordinary people
would dare to imagine.

430
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,800
Yet this extraordinary woman

431
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,320
managed to solve it.

432
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,920
Mentor, what do you mean?

433
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,480
Everyone knows

434
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,880
Guo Zijie was an incompetent fool.

435
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,520
Ever since he had Cao Xuanxuan,

436
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,520
he's become

437
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,400
a celebrated detective.

438
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,680
Even many high-ranking officials

439
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,680
have praised him.

440
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,400
Don't you find that odd?

441
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,440
Please enlighten me, Mentor.

442
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,320
Have you reviewed

443
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,540
all the cases Guo Zijie has solved
over the past year?

444
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,340
The Directorate of Prisons
keeps records of them.

445
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,580
I've studied them carefully.

446
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,760
They are all rare and strange cases.

447
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,680
That's right, then.

448
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,960
Why does he always encounter

449
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,120
such peculiar cases,

450
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,440
and

451
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,320
why are he and his wife

452
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,160
the only ones able to solve them?

453
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,440
Um...

454
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,720
You need to understand

455
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,160
that Guo Zijie bought the position
of county magistrate.

456
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,960
After three years in office,

457
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,920
he would have to return to his hometown
and become a farmer

458
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,760
if he made no political achievements.

459
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,880
But look at

460
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,400
the situation now.

461
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,360
Mentor,

462
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,360
are you suggesting

463
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,560
that they staged everything themselves?

464
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,920
Forget it.

465
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
There's no need to overthink.

466
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,720
Lord Su is

467
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,080
arriving soon.

468
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,200
Have you

469
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,100
had the temporary imperial abode ready?

470
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,720
I've sent someone to clean it.

471
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,600
We can't afford

472
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,960
to slight Lord Su, you know?

473
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,080
His Highness has a bad temper.

474
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,800
Do arrange

475
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,300
more attentive servants.

476
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,800
Yes, Mentor.

477
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,840
Long He.

478
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,520
Yes.

479
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,440
See Mentor off.

480
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,200
Yes.

481
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:14,800
Sir.

482
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,160
Has Mentor settled in?

483
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,800
Yes.

484
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,280
However,

485
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,280
while escorting Grand Mentor back,

486
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,440
I heard him mumble,

487
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,920
"Extraordinary people

488
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,200
solving bizarre cases."

489
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,120
What does that mean?

490
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,920
Mentor is

491
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,160
also an extraordinary man himself.

492
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,920
Zijie,

493
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,560
why did you bring me to the prison?

494
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,500
To interrogate Ouyang Mingyue.

495
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,600
Ouyang Mingyue?

496
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,000
What does Master Zhai's missing body

497
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,240
have to do with her?

498
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,840
The person who stole the body

499
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,000
and the one who implanted memories
into Ouyang Mingyue

500
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,940
are the same person.

501
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,700
They're also

502
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,240
the mastermind targeting Xuanxuan.

503
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,840
So we need to interrogate Ouyang Mingyue

504
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,900
and see if we can get anything from her.

505
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,080
But look at her current state,

506
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,000
what could we get from her?

507
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,600
Let's interrogate her first.

508
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,000
Move aside.

509
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,840
By the order of Official Zhou,

510
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,300
no one is to interrogate the prisoner

511
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,220
without his permission.

512
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,200
How dare you!

513
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,140
I'm the county magistrate of Yan City.

514
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,700
This office is my jurisdiction.

515
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,960
Why can't I go in?

516
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Are you trying to defy

517
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,560
the county magistrate?

518
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,560
Don't be rude.

519
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,520
Magistrate Guo,

520
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,080
what's going on here?

521
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,780
I need to interrogate Ouyang Mingyue.

522
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,800
Magistrate Guo,

523
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,880
I'm afraid this isn't appropriate.

524
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,000
Official Zhou,

525
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,520
this is very crucial to me.

526
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,880
Could you

527
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,960
cut me some slack?

528
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,200
Why do you need to

529
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,400
interrogate Ouyang Mingyue?

530
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,480
You have to inform me

531
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,440
if this concerns the case.

532
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,400
It's a personal matter.

533
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,440
All right.

534
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
Today's the last day of Ouyang Mingyue.

535
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,640
If you wish to interrogate her,

536
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,520
please go ahead.

537
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,400
Let them in.

538
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,600
Yes, sir.

539
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,600
Thank you.

540
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,720
Ouyang Mingyue.

541
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,800
Ouyang Mingyue.

542
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,480
Look at me, Ouyang Mingyue.

543
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,040
What happened to her?

544
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,960
Ouyang Mingyue.

545
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,920
I'm Guo Zijie.

546
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,600
Do you remember me?

547
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,800
Ouyang Mingyue,

548
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,520
do you remember

549
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,320
who implanted memories

550
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,400
into you?

551
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,200
You do?

552
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,520
Father,

553
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,600
you're here.

554
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,880
Father,

555
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,920
I've avenged you.

556
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:18,960
Father.

557
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,720
Father.

558
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,240
Zijie!

559
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,440
Snap out of it, Ouyang Mingyue!

560
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:22,920
Zijie.

561
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,680
Tell me now.

562
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,040
What had happened?

563
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,640
What had happened?

564
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,320
Zijie,

565
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,120
she's lost her mind.

566
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,420
You can't get anything from her.

567
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,400
Calm down.

568
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,360
- Ouyang Mingyue.
- Zijie.

569
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,260
We should leave.

570
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,360
Answer me, Ouyang Mingyue.

571
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,440
Father.

572
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,040
Father.

573
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,080
Father,

574
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,360
I've avenged you.

575
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,440
I've avenged you.

576
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,160
Father.

577
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,080
Father, do you hear me?

578
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,640
I've avenged you.

579
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,640
Father.

580
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,760
Father.

581
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,760
- Come and see what happened.
- What's going on?

582
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,160
Today, Ouyang Mingyue will be sentenced.

583
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,280
I heard that she killed his uncle.

584
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,560
- Keep your voice down.
- Did you hear that?

585
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,440
- How did you know?
- Magistrate Guo is coming.

586
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,440
I have a bad feeling.

587
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,880
Has Master Zhai's body been found?

588
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,880
Ouyang Mingyue is still locked up
in the prison.

589
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,680
Though she's not in her right mind,

590
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,640
nothing should go wrong.

591
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,200
But I feel so uneasy.

592
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,600
Go and check on her.

593
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,640
Sir,

594
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,200
don't worry.

595
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,440
We're keeping an eye on her.

596
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,480
Nothing will happen.

597
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,840
I just checked on her.

598
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,640
She's still in the prison.

599
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,040
Xuanxuan,

600
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,680
don't overthink.

601
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,360
Yes.

602
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,340
We have all the evidence and witnesses.

603
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,000
Even if Zhou Qin were capable,

604
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,940
he couldn't do anything now.

605
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,040
Xuanxuan,

606
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,120
you've strained yourself these days.

607
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,200
Go get some rest.

608
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,520
I'm fine.

609
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,680
He Chun.

610
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,880
Where's the prisoner?

611
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,440
Bring the prisoner Ouyang Mingyue
to the court.

612
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,800
Mighty and just.

613
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,600
- Kneel.
- Kneel.

614
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,840
Ouyang Mingyue,

615
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,200
you murdered your uncle

616
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,040
by dismembering him

617
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,640
before taking his life.

618
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,520
Such cruelty

619
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,040
is unimaginable.

620
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,760
Do you plead guilty?

621
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
I'm asking you,

622
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,440
do you plead guilty?

623
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,480
Ouyang Mingyue,

624
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,560
you can't evade judgment

625
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,200
by remaining silent.

626
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,320
Yesterday, you admitted

627
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,560
to killing Master Zhai in court.

628
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:06,920
Today,

629
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,560
I'll sentence you to

630
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,920
immediate execution.

631
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,860
(Command)

632
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,120
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

633
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,640
You corrupt official.

634
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,720
Guards,

635
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,880
take her back to the prison

636
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,320
to await execution.

637
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,280
Yes, sir.

638
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,680
- Move.
- Move.

639
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,480
You corrupt official!

640
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,440
I don't plead guilty.

641
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,800
I was framed!

642
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,560
Insolence!

643
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,880
With all the evidence and witness here,

644
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,280
how dare you deny your crime?

645
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,080
Hold on.

646
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,320
I'm not denying it.

647
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,040
I'm telling the truth.

648
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,880
You

649
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,600
and you.

650
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,400
All of you!

651
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,480
All of you are trying to harm me!

652
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,560
I will admit to nothing.

653
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,960
Ouyang Mingyue,

654
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,600
you confessed yesterday,

655
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,320
and you're trying to retract it.

656
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,640
It seems

657
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,960
there's more to this matter.

658
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,760
Tell me everything.

659
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,520
I'm here under orders to investigate.

660
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,240
If there has been injustice,

661
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,360
I'll ensure you get justice.

662
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,040
It's true that I killed my uncle.

663
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,080
But you've also found out

664
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,480
that someone altered my memory.

665
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,040
All I want is to avenge my parents.

666
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,000
What have I done wrong?

667
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,480
The true culprit is the person
behind the scenes.

668
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,480
Why must I bear all the blame alone?

669
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,680
Even if your memories are altered,

670
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,520
it doesn't absolve you

671
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,160
of the truth of killing Master Zhai.

672
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,000
As for who manipulated you,

673
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,840
you didn't state it clearly.

674
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,480
The person is unknown.

675
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,360
Once I get to the bottom of it,

676
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,600
they will face their punishment.

677
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,920
Did you all hear him?

678
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,880
How incredible of him.

679
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,480
Well said.

680
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,440
I didn't state it clearly?

681
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,360
Because I'm afraid.

682
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,880
I'm just a defenseless woman.

683
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,520
You might harm my life.

684
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
Ouyang Mingyue,

685
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,720
what do you mean by that?

686
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,440
Don't you know that, Magistrate Guo?

687
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,220
The person who's trying to harm me

688
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,840
is closely tied to you.

689
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,600
What are you implying?

690
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,680
Why did the trial stop?

691
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,080
- She withdrew her confession.
- She's not the murder?

692
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,400
- What happend?
- It's so strange.

693
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,000
- She was wronged?
- So strange.

694
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,240
- What? She's innocent?
- How strange!

695
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,400
Maybe she was truly wronged.
Let see what's going on.

696
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,120
Sir,

697
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,400
I've searched everywhere.

698
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,480
There's no sign of her.

699
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,660
We've no idea where she is.

700
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,200
Official Zhou,

701
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,160
what is this?

702
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,960
It was her.

703
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,320
Magistrate Guo's wife.

704
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,280
The person who implanted memories
into me

705
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,520
