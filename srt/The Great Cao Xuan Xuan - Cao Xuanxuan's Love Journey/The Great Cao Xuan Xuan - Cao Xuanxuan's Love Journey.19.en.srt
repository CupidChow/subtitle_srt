We're from the administrative office.

23
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,780
We're here to investigate.

24
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,380
Please enter.

25
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,260
Mr. Sun.

26
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,580
It's him.

27
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,740
I ran the errand for Master that day.

28
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,660
The letter was handed to him.

29
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,460
Let's check it out.

30
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,580
Sir.

31
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:40,900
May I ask

32
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,380
if you delivered a letter

33
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,540
for a man named Guo two months ago?

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,220
Each industry has its own rules.

35
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,420
Our customers paid us
to deliver letters,

36
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,420
so we can't tell others
their information.

37
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,460
Sir.

38
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,340
Help us out.

39
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,260
This matter is very important
to our young master.

40
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,860
I must say.

41
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,300
Do you know what rules are?

42
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,220
Leave.

43
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,060
Sir.

44
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,260
I was sent by Yan City's Magistrate Guo.

45
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,980
This letter is very important to us.

46
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,340
Magistrate Guo?

47
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,340
I know him.

48
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,780
He's a good official.

49
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,380
Sirs.

50
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,420
I'm sorry for being rude.

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,380
Please come with me.

52
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:12,940
Sure.

53
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,580
This way.

54
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,580
Come on.

55
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,220
What month was it?

56
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,100
How is it?

57
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,880
Did you find it?

58
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,460
Alright.

59
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,420
Please wait.

60
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,820
Please look carefully.

61
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,220
I found it.

62
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:29,860
It's here.

63
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,140
I remember it now.

64
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,860
You asked me to deliver
the letter that day, didn't you?

65
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,100
Hello.

66
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,780
Help me deliver a letter.

67
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,540
To the capital?

68
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,620
I love

69
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,460
sealing wax.

70
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,580
The sealing wax of the letter

71
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,220
you asked me to deliver was very nice.

72
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,500
I vaguely remember that the person

73
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,420
in the capital who received the letter

74
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,460
looked like

75
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,900
a high-ranking official.

76
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,140
A high-ranking official?

77
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,740
Yes.

78
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,700
Fu.

79
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,440
Do you remember who Master Guo

80
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,220
asked you to deliver
the letter to that day?

81
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,340
I don't know.

82
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,020
Master

83
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,220
didn't tell me.

84
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,540
This is troublesome.

85
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,940
I know Master Guo used
to be an official,

86
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,100
but he had

87
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,060
many former colleagues.

88
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,660
The capital is far away.

89
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,660
How shall we investigate
in such a short time?

90
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,540
Anyway,

91
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,740
that's all I know.

92
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,860
I told you everything.

93
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,580
Please

94
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,220
tell that to Magistrate Guo.

95
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,060
Thank you.

96
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,700
No problem.

97
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,100
Please take care.

98
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,300
Take care.

99
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,100
Mr. Sun.

100
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,140
Is what he said useful?

101
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,420
Could we save Young Madam?

102
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,420
Why does a kid like you

103
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,460
worry so much?

104
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,020
I'm already 15.

105
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,780
Stop treating me like a kid.

106
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,940
I understand everything.

107
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,500
Tell me what you understand then.

108
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,660
I

109
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,980
understand a lot of things.

110
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,580
Just like

111
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,820
when they said you're a bad person,

112
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,200
but I didn't believe it.

113
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,060
I've watched
your friendship with Young Master

114
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
for so many years.

115
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,340
How could it be fake?

116
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,540
Look.

117
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,680
They didn't understand.

118
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,260
I'm the only one who guessed it right.

119
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:16,820
Mr. Sun.

120
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,300
You must help Young Master

121
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,820
save Young Madam.

122
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,460
When I first arrived in the residence,

123
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,020
the old staff in the residence
bullied me.

124
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,420
Young Madam

125
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,220
asked the butler

126
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,420
to transfer me to Young Master.

127
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,380
Not only that,

128
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,340
before Young Madam woke up,

129
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,140
I'd never seen Young Master

130
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,380
smile as happily

131
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,820
as he does now.

132
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,740
Don't worry.

133
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,980
I will save

134
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,060
Young Madam.

135
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,700
As for you.

136
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,220
The butler is old now.

137
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,780
Stop being so naughty.

138
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,900
You have to take good care

139
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,660
of the Guo family.

140
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,540
Sure.

141
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,420
Go.

142
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,380
(I wonder)

143
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,060
(how's it going with He Chun.)

144
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,060
Mr. Sun.

145
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:05,940
Coming.

146
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,260
Go.

147
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,700
Go.

148
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:21,780
Who is it?

149
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,580
Miss Yiyi.

150
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,340
Miss...

151
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,940
Who are you?

152
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,420
I'm...

153
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,340
Sir.

154
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,660
How was it?

155
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,020
I brought her here,

156
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,180
but...

157
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,660
Miss Yiyi.

158
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,380
They don't look alike.

159
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,500
They don't look alike at all.

160
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,540
Aren't they sisters?

161
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,300
Sisters should look similar.

162
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,220
They...

163
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,900
They don't look alike at all.

164
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:00,940
Thank you.

165
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,700
Xuanxuan and Yiyi are twin sisters,

166
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,180
but they don't look alike at all.

167
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,460
Is there

168
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,700
nothing we can do?

169
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,140
There is a way.

170
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,060
Zijie.

171
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,660
Xuanxuan said before

172
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,860
that there is another way.

173
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,580
What is it?

174
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,620
Dress her up in disguise.

175
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,020
Maybe we can get away with it.

176
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,140
Will it work?

177
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:38,980
Why don't

178
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,300
you two give it a try?

179
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:40,980
Sure.

180
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,380
Miss Yiyi.

181
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,420
This way, please.

182
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,580
Miss He Chun.

183
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,220
Hurry up.

184
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,580
The drug effect won't last long.

185
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,220
Thank you.

186
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,900
Xuanxuan.

187
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,580
Xuanxuan.

188
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:37,860
Xuanxuan.

189
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,260
He Chun.

190
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,580
Xuanxuan.

191
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,940
Don't worry.

192
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,060
I'm fine.

193
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,740
Who is she?

194
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,420
I brought her here to save you.

195
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,940
Xuanxuan.

196
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,460
It's me.

197
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,420
Does it look good?

198
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,020
Xuanxuan.

199
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,020
I've never forgotten you

200
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,260
all these years.

201
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,100
I thought life with the Guo family

202
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,900
would be better for you,

203
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,100
but I didn't expect

204
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,980
you to end up in this situation.

205
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:13,940
Yiyi.

206
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,140
Stop talking.

207
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,220
Hurry and leave.

208
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,020
Let's go.

209
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,620
No.

210
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,420
I can't let you suffer for me.

211
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,100
I can't implicate innocent people.

212
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:21,940
You can leave

213
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,620
without me.

214
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,420
But

215
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,420
you're the only one

216
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,700
who can find the truth.

217
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,180
Hurry.

218
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,020
I believe

219
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,900
you're the only one

220
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,300
who can end all this

221
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,580
and save more people.

222
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,700
Yiyi.

223
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,380
I'll come back to rescue you.

224
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,820
Let's go.

225
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,980
Hurry.

226
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,420
Hurry.

227
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,140
Please

228
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,020
be careful.

229
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,900
Be careful.

230
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,820
How dare you?

231
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,380
Are you two

232
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,460
trying to escape?

233
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,020
Move aside!

234
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,580
Young Madam Guo.

235
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,100
I have something to ask you.

236
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,900
Can I have a word with you?

237
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,260
Don't worry.

238
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,780
I mean no harm.

239
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,980
What do you want to say?

240
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,020
This way, please.

241
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,780
Xuanxuan.

242
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:38,860
Don't worry.

243
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,740
I'll be fine.

244
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,180
Why are they not here yet?

245
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,220
Maybe it's a long way off.

246
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,620
But Zijie,

247
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,740
you must trust He Chun.

248
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,980
She'll bring Xuanxuan over.

249
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,660
Young Madam Guo.

250
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,700
Please sit.

251
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,620
Young Madam Guo.

252
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,820
I have a question to ask.

253
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,220
How do you

254
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
pronounce this word?

255
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,980
(Returns to Unity)

256
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,620
Returns.

257
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,540
Returns?

258
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,360
Is it from the phrase,
"The world returns to unity?"

259
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,860
That's right.

260
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,380
You saw Zhou Qin wrote it, right?

261
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,060
I told you I'm not

262
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,660
the only one who can write
simplified Chinese characters.

263
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,900
Do you believe me now?

264
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,300
You doubted your mentor long ago,
didn't you?

265
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,100
Zhou Shaoliang.

266
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,100
Stop being so stubborn.

267
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,020
He isn't someone you should follow.

268
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,020
Stop talking.

269
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,780
I'll only give you one day.

270
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,340
If you can't prove your innocence,

271
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,140
I will personally escort you
to the capital.

272
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,820
The person locked up in prison

273
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,900
is your sister, right?

274
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,220
If you want her to switch you out,

275
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,020
change your clothes first.

276
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,700
Don't reveal any flaws.

277
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,020
Zhou Shaoliang.

278
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,900
You're a good man.

279
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,820
Zijie.

280
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,900
Xuanxuan.

281
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,280
We've waited for you for a long time.

282
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,340
Can I not come back?

283
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,540
Yes.

284
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,420
Xuanxuan.

285
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,340
Are you alright?

286
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:26,860
I'm fine.

287
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,620
I'm alright.

288
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,300
Look.

289
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,460
Did you find anything

290
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,940
in the past two days?

291
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,140
We found out

292
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,620
that Mr. Zhao

293
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,420
had a dispute

294
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,220
with Zhou Qin.

295
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,140
Master Guo wrote to the capital

296
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,580
a few months ago,

297
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,540
but

298
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,580
these clues

299
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,500
don't seem to be of much use.

300
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,780
Not necessarily.

301
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,260
Do you suspect

302
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,780
that the victims of these cases

303
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,020
aren't committed randomly

304
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,900
by Zhou Qin,

305
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,300
but that he did it deliberately?

306
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,940
Master Zhai

307
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,020
has evidence against Zhou Qin.

308
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,580
Mr. Zhao and Zhou Qin
have different political views.

309
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,420
What about Master Guo?

310
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,940
We all know

311
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,380
that Master Guo's accident

312
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,660
has nothing to do with Zhou Qin.

313
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,540
That's not necessarily true.

314
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,460
Think about it.

315
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,300
Mr. Zhao is already dead.

316
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,140
Zhou Qin hasn't left Yan City yet.

317
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:29,820
And

318
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,540
the method

319
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,940
you taught Ning Xian to do last time...

320
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,060
I thought

321
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,540
he was just spying on me.

322
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,980
But now that I think about it,

323
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,260
I'm not the only one he's spying on.

324
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,700
You mean

325
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,600
Zhou Qin might have been
spying on Master Guo too?

326
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,340
When you say that,

327
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,220
I remember

328
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,420
spotting someone suspicious

329
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,940
near Guo Residence.

330
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,600
They could have been watching us.

331
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,620
In that case,

332
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,860
Zhou Qin probably
wouldn't have spared Master Guo

333
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,180
even if Guo Zilu had done nothing.

334
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,700
At this point,

335
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,380
we can only make bold assumptions.

336
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,460
We left someone out.

337
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,660
Fu Miao.

338
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,220
Fu Miao

339
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,900
is just a poor scholar.

340
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,940
What does he have to do with Zhou Qin?

341
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,620
Don't forget.

342
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,380
Fu Miao was from somewhere else.

343
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,020
What did he do?

344
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,300
Where did he live?

345
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,820
Well...

346
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,860
Looks like we can only

347
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,460
meet Zhao Xiaolin again.

348
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,300
Slow down.

349
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,500
I heard from Dou a few days ago

350
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,220
that Zhao Xiaolin

351
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,730
seems to have returned to Zhao Village.

352
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,960
We'll go to Zhao Village then.

353
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,540
Sure.

354
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,220
He Chun.

355
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,680
Take Xuanxuan with you.

356
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,700
Leave the rest to me.

357
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,100
I'm here.

358
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,300
Don't worry, Magistrate Guo.

359
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,660
Be safe.

360
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,660
Don't worry.

361
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,660
Zhao Village is right ahead.

362
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,580
Xiaolin.

363
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,540
Xiaolin.

364
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,500
Xiaolin.

365
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,620
Who is it so early in the morning?

366
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,460
Miss Xuanxuan, Miss He.

367
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,060
Come in.

368
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,180
Miss Xuanxuan.

369
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Why are you here?

370
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,140
We...

371
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,340
I've heard

372
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,300
all about you.

373
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,220
But no matter what others say,

374
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,420
I believe

375
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,900
you wouldn't have done that.

376
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,460
Zhao Village is quite far.

377
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,740
They probably won't realize
you're here for now.

378
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,420
Rest here.

379
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,140
Actually,

380
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,940
we're not here to seek refuge.

381
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,740
There are some things we want to know.

382
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,580
You want to find out from me?

383
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,060
We want to know

384
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,340
Fu Miao's background.

385
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,900
My husband?

386
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,900
Does he have anything to do with it?

387
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,700
Come on.

388
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,700
Let's go in and talk.

389
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,300
Sure.

390
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,580
Have some tea.

391
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,700
Xiaolin.

392
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,780
Don't do anything first.

393
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,660
Tell us about your husband.

394
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,540
My husband

395
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,460
sought refuge here two years ago.

396
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,540
I heard his village

397
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,980
was flooded.

398
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,620
He had no way to go,

399
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,220
so he sought refuge here.

400
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,860
Back then,

401
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,940
I pitied him

402
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,220
and took him in.

403
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,020
Then...

404
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,980
Where

405
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,980
was your husband from?

406
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,380
He never mentioned it.

407
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,660
However,

408
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,500
a peddler who traveled
all over the country once said

409
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,660
my husband's accent

410
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,340
sounded like a capital native.

411
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,340
It's probably nonsense.

412
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,420
Xiaolin.

413
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,460
Think about it carefully.

414
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,340
There must be
something special about Fu Miao.

415
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,420
My husband was a scholar,

416
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,540
but

417
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,860
he was obsessed

418
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,140
with these papers.

419
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,980
I don't know why.

420
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,500
Paper like this

421
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,620
doesn't look like something

422
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,780
a village scholar can afford.

423
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,060
Yes.

424
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,100
It's already good enough

425
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,380
that we villagers can write.

426
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,300
But he has high demands.

427
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,940
He even thought
the paper from Yanzhou's Yunmo Workshop,

428
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,380
which cost five silver taels a piece,

429
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,580
wasn't good enough.

430
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,660
He knows a lot about paper.

431
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,900
He also told me

432
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,700
that there was no good wood.

433
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,660
If he had good wood,

434
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,860
he would be able to make

435
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,020
paper that's way better
than Yunmo Workshop.

436
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,060
Did he say

437
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,260
what kind of wood makes good paper?

438
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,220
I think he told me before.

439
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,340
I think it's called

440
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,140
paper mulberry.

441
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,380
Paper mulberry?

442
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,220
Where's the sapling?

443
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,540
He brought some with him

444
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,740
when he fled his village,

445
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,700
but it was a long time ago.

446
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,540
I don't know if I can still find it.

447
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,660
Xiaolin.

448
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,580
Could you help us find it?

449
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,780
It's important to us.

450
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:51,900
Sure.

451
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,060
I'll find it.

452
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,060
Let's go.

453
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,140
Give me a moment.

454
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,900
I'll go find it.

455
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,500
I found it.

456
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,420
This is it.

457
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,420
When it was still a seedling,

458
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,940
he buried it in the yard.

459
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,580
I thought

460
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,980
of making it our daughter's dowry

461
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,540
when we give birth to a girl.

462
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,420
He laughed at me

463
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,700
for not recognizing some treasure

464
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,660
and said

465
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,500
the paper made from it

466
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,460
seemed to be tens of thousands of times

467
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,940
more expensive than a dowry box.

468
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,260
Miss Xuanxuan.

469
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,860
Is there really such expensive paper?

470
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,540
I don't know yet.

471
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,420
What do you think?

472
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,620
Is this the same
as what Master Zhai had in his mouth?

473
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,380
The one in Master Zhai's mouth
was a piece of bark,

474
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,100
but its texture is very similar to this.

475
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,900
And I've never seen

476
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,060
this kind of tree in Yanzhou.

477
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,660
In that case,

478
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,300
it's possible that it's paper mulberry.

479
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,820
Paper mulberry?

480
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,460
Can paper mulberry

481
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,660
be used to make paper?

482
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,220
What's special about it?

483
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,900
Well...

484
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,860
He Chun. Let's go back
to Yan City first.

485
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,260
Sure.

486
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,540
Are you leaving already?

487
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,140
Is what I said

488
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,700
helpful to you?

489
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,380
Xiaolin.

490
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,580
Thank you.

491
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,820
You've been a great help to us.

492
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,340
Thank you.

493
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,660
That's good.

494
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,940
Miss Xuanxuan.

495
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,880
What's the matter?

496
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,100
A few months
before my husband's incident,

497
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,300
he seemed

498
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,180
to be

499
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,500
very close

500
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,100
to a wealthy man from Yan City.

501
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,100
A wealthy man?

502
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,620
Is his surname Zhai?

503
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,540
I'm not sure about this.

504
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,940
I've only seen him once from afar.

505
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,420
That person smelled like medicine.

506
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,220
He didn't smell like a good person.

507
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,660
I also told my husband

508
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,820
to have less contact with him.

509
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,260
One night,

510
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,180
he came to my house

511
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,100
and talked with my husband all night.

512
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,380
I don't know what they talked about,

513
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,660
but the next day

514
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,020
my husband went out
with a pile of old books.

515
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,100
I was afraid he would go astray,

516
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,180
so I followed him secretly.

517
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,260
I only saw him put the books

518
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,020
somewhere in the west of the city.

519
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,620
It's called...

520
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,420
Chen Er's Book Store.

521
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,180
Chen Er's Book Store?

522
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,380
I asked about it before.

523
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,060
My husband told me

524
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,220
that scholars

525
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,740
love to make notes on old books
after reading them.

526
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,420
Students who can't afford a mentor

527
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,140
love to buy books with notes.

528
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,780
That's why

529
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,460
he sold these old books.

530
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,060
I don't think

531
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,100
I've seen anyone send money over
in a few days,

532
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,260
so I thought

533
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,980
no one bought the books.

534
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,620
This is the wooden token
that allows you to collect those books.

535
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,020
Take it.

536
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,920
You should be able
to take back the old books.

537
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,780
I don't know

538
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,980
if this will help you.

539
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:56,660
Xiaolin.

540
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,460
Thank you.

541
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,460
It's nothing.

542
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,980
We'll leave now.

543
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:01,820
Sure.

544
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,020
Take care.

545
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,080
- Sure.
- Take good care of yourself.

546
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,607
(Yan Administrative Office)

547
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,940
Zijie, you drank too much.

548
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,540
Zijie.

549
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,060
Zijie, you drank...

550
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,100
You're drunk.

551
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:21,700
Zijie.

552
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,660
Magistrate Guo.

553
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,500
Get out of the way!

554
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,540
Don't stop me.

555
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,100
How dare you stop me?

556
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,660
Zhou Shaoliang!

557
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,980
Release Xuanxuan!

558
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,500
Zhou Shaoliang!

559
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,060
Sir.

560
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,220
What's going on over there?

561
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,060
Cao Xuanxuan was caught.

562
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,140
Guo Zijie is making a scene.

563
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,980
Zhou Shaoliang!

564
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,940
Don't make a scene.

565
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,220
Don't make a scene.

566
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,100
Don't make a scene.

567
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,260
Zijie, what are you doing?

568
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,940
My good magistrate.

569
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,140
Zhou Shaoliang!

570
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,740
Don't make a scene.

571
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,740
Release Xuanxuan!

572
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,540
Alright.

573
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,780
What are you standing there for?

574
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,460
Drag him out.

575
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,900
It doesn't matter.

576
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,700
Let him be.

577
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,660
The convict woman will be
escorted to the capital tomorrow.

578
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,020
His tenure as magistrate

579
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,500
will come to an end.

580
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,500
He can't make a fuss

581
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,860
even if he wants to.

582
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,740
Release Xuanxuan!

583
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,460
Alright.

584
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,260
Stop making a scene.

585
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,700
Stop.

586
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,020
- Stop it, Zijie.
- You jerk!

587
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:28,940
Let's go.

588
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,900
Let's go.

589
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:30,900
Let's go home.

590
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:31,900
Let's go home.

591
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,180
Magistrate Guo, take care.

592
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,920
(Yan Administrative Office)
Magistrate Guo.

593
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,000
- Take care.
- Take care, Magistrate Guo.

594
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,420
Let's go.

595
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,820
Chen Er's Book Store's old books.

596
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,140
Good quality at a low price.

597
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,540
Take a look.

598
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,660
Miss.

599
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,780
What books do you need?

600
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,780
(Chen Er's Book Store, Fu Miao)

601
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:05,900
Thank you.

602
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,380
Take care.

603
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,420
Let's go.

604
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,700
Xuanxuan.

605
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,180
Thank you for bringing me clothes.

606
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,540
I feel more comfortable
after changing into clean clothes.

607
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,320
You're too kind.

608
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,140
Look at this.

609
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,540
I found it.

610
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,460
Paper mulberry
is used to make Chengxin paper.

611
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,020
Chengxin paper?

612
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,380
What's that?

613
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,180
Is it expensive?

614
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,680
It's for imperial use only.

615
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,580
Paper mulberry is precious

616
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,700
and difficult to plant.

617
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,480
So the annual production
isn't even enough for one ream of paper.

618
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,820
Even His Majesty

619
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,420
only uses it

620
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,180
for important

621
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,420
imperial edicts and letters.

622
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,280
Because it's only for imperial use.

623
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,940
There's a secret marking

624
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,980
on each piece of paper.

625
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,460
If His Majesty
rewarded it to an official,

626
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,460
you can find

627
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,620
the year it was awarded

628
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,660
through the secret marking.

629
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,900
These paper-making techniques

630
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,100
are secret techniques
of the Yan family of the capital.

631
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,540
They know the secret markings well.

632
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,140
Even with just a glance,

633
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,660
they can tell
which year it was produced.

634
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,540
So attempting to substitute it

635
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,380
is impossible.

636
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,340
But the Yan family seemed

637
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,700
to have been robbed
two years ago.

638
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,460
The whole family was killed.

639
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,380
Even children
as young as two or three years old

640
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,380
weren't spared.

641
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,060
So these two years,

642
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,900
Chengxin paper

643
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,940
is almost extinct.

644
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,360
Lord Su sent someone
to investigate it thoroughly

645
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,780
but there has been no news so far.

646
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,660
In that case,

647
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,220
Fu Miao

648
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,540
was most likely
a member of the Yan family.

649
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,660
It's possible.

650
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,840
Let's continue investigating.

651
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,620
Sure.

652
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,340
Xuanxuan.

653
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:01,940
He Chun.

654
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,260
Mr. Sun.

655
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,260
Why are you here?

656
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,100
Zijie asked me to come over first

657
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,580
to help you find some clues.

658
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,300
How's it going?

659
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,580
You came just in time.

660
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,100
Here.

661
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,260
Which ones you haven't checked?

662
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,380
These.

663
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,500
Get some rest.

664
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,780
Leave the rest to me.

665
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,460
Let's go help him.

666
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,620
Xuanxuan.

667
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,860
Look at this page.

668
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:02,820
Look.

669
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,340
The paper can actually be split in two.

670
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,940
Such a technique

671
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,340
can only be done by the Yan family.

672
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,360
(Fragrance reaches Changan,
City clad in golden armor)

673
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,580
Look.

674
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,660
(Fragrance reaches Changan,
City clad in golden armor)

675
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,540
Young.

676
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,500
Inexperienced.

677
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,860
Fragrance reaches Changan.

678
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,140
City clad in golden armor.

679
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,700
Isn't this a rebellion poem?

680
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,300
How rebellious.

681
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,620
Zhou Qin is too bold.

682
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,780
I get it now.

683
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,420
It all makes sense.

684
00:29:58,992 --> 00:30:01,620
(Two Years Ago)

685
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,340
Here.

686
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,620
I propose a toast to all of you.

687
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,820
Thank you

688
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,900
for putting aside your work

689
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,260
and rushing over

690
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,820
to celebrate my birthday.

691
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,060
Thank you.

692
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,060
Please drink.

693
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,020
Enjoy the food and drink.

694
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,820
Good wine.

695
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,020
Here, Mr. Zhao.

696
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,460
I propose a toast to you.

697
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,380
Grand Mentor Zhou.

698
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,060
Here.

699
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,740
Help me

700
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,820
put in

701
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,060
a good word

702
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,220
with Lord Su.

703
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,180
Of course.

704
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:38,620
Here.

705
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,320
Grand Mentor Zhou.

706
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,180
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

707
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,260
Thank you.

708
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,220
Bottoms up.

709
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,140
Bottoms up.

710
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,700
Drink more.

711
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,500
Please enjoy.

712
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,500
Master Zhai.

713
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,780
Grand Mentor.

714
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,620
You're as strong as always.

715
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,340
Thank you.

716
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,220
Here, have a drink.

717
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,460
Here's a toast to you.

718
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,620
Good wine.

719
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,300
Here.

720
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,220
Drink.

721
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,020
Master Zhai, you must drink more.

722
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:13,980
Master Zhai.

723
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,900
I remember it now.

724
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,420
A few days ago,

725
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,340
they gave me
a piece of the best Lingzhi herb.

726
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,100
I'll go get it

727
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,220
and give it to you.

728
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,500
Here.

729
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,920
I'll go get it after drinking this.

730
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,540
Drink.

731
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,340
Master Zhai, wait for me.

732
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,740
Wait a moment.

733
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,420
Sure.

734
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,220
Grand Mentor.

735
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,820
He obviously came in.

736
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,660
(Young, Inexperienced, Fragrance reaches
Changan, City clad in golden armor)

737
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,580
Go away!

738
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,100
Sorry.

739
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:41,500
Sir.

740
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,740
Sorry to bother you.

741
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,940
So you mean

742
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,540
Zhou Qin

743
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,580
wrote the rebellion poem on this paper,

744
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,260
and Master Zhai

745
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,220
happened to find it

746
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:56,940
and stole it?

747
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,020
This doesn't make sense.

748
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,540
This is Chengxin paper.

749
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,980
Zhou Qin is meticulous.

750
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,780
Would he make such a low-level mistake?

751
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,820
Do you remember

752
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,980
I told you

753
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,460
that he and I

754
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,900
were from the same era?

755
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,020
We

756
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,180
have a lot

757
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,380
of beautiful paper.

758
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,020
What if

759
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,460
he had just arrived here

760
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,740
and didn't know

761
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,140
the importance of Chengxin paper?

762
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,700
But even if he doesn't know

763
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,540
the importance of Chengxin paper,

764
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,580
he could have

765
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,820
just killed Master Zhai.

766
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,460
Why did he harm

767
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,900
Mr. Zhao and the Yan family?

768
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,220
They're all innocent.

769
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,980
There were many people that day.

770
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,100
Zhou Qin

771
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,980
might not know

772
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,500
who took the rebellion poem.

773
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,180
He could only check one by one.

774
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:41,700
The first person

775
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,180
he suspected was Mr. Zhao.

776
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,100
As for the Yan family,

777
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,580
the Yan family

778
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,940
knows the secret markings well.

779
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,620
Even if Zhou Qin

780
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,620
destroyed all the palace files,

781
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,420
he could not deceive the Yan family.

782
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,500
So the Yan family can't stay

783
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,260
no matter what.

784
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,380
But even if your speculations are right,

785
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,780
why did Master Zhai

786
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,660
give Fu Miao something

787
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,980
that concerns

788
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,960
his life and fortune?

789
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,100
Maybe Master Zhai

790
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,220
went to the Yan family

791
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,580
for verification

792
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,740
after he got proof.

793
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,740
After the Yan family's incident,

794
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,100
he returned to Yan City

795
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,100
with the proof

796
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,500
and happened

797
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
to meet Fu Miao.

798
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,260
He begged Fu Miao

799
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,900
to hide the letter

800
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,020
in an old book

801
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,460
with the splitting technique

802
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,820
because they knew

803
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,780
Zhou Qin

804
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,620
would be transferred to Yan City soon.

805
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,580
Your analysis makes a lot of sense,

806
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,100
but it still seems weird to me.

807
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,420
Think about it.

808
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,420
How come

809
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,180
none of these things connect?

810
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,220
We can connect them.

811
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,380
However,

812
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,260
we need someone.

813
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,140
Someone who knows him very well.

814
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,140
Who's that?

815
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,940
It's getting late.

816
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,700
This person

817
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,980
should be here soon.

818
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,180
Let's go.

819
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,380
Xuanxuan, why did you bring us here?

820
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,740
You'll find out later.

821
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,580
Xuanxuan.

822
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,900
Zijie?

823
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,420
You're here.

824
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,420
Zijie, you've lost weight.

825
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,780
You can be affectionate later.

826
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,980
Who we're looking for?

827
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,500
He's here.

828
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,060
Zhou Shaoliang?

829
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,500
Why are you here?

830
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,620
He's the person we're looking for.

831
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,140
We shouldn't stay here too long.

832
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,140
Let's go in and talk.

833
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,420
- Sure.
- Sure.

834
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,020
Let's go.

835
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,500
We

836
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,500
just found some clues

837
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,940
in a book.

838
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,900
That book
contains a splitting technique,

839
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,700
which is sandwiched

840
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,920
between the paper.

841
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,600
There's a piece of proof in the middle.

842
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,060
We've confirmed it. It's safe.

843
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,740
Give it to him.

844
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,460
(Young, Inexperienced, Fragrance reaches
Changan, City clad in golden armor)

845
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,540
Your speculation

846
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,860
may be right.

847
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,100
More than two years ago,

848
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,800
Mentor was infected with the epidemic.

849
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,220
The imperial physician has ordered us

850
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,380
to prepare for his funeral.

851
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,220
But later,

852
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,220
Mentor miraculously recovered.

853
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,940
Since then,

854
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,860
Mentor's personality
changed drastically.

855
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,460
But I didn't think much of it back then.

856
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,020
It was Mentor's birthday,

857
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,180
so I organized
a birthday banquet for him

858
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,900
to congratulate him
for recovering from a long illness.

859
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,660
During the birthday banquet,

860
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,180
something
was indeed stolen from Mentor's home.

861
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,340
Mentor was furious,

862
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,380
but he refused

863
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,220
to say what he lost

864
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,660
no matter how I asked.

865
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,140
He just asked me

866
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,340
for a list
of everyone who was there that day.

867
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,940
Not only the guests,

868
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,100
but even the kitchen cleaners

869
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,180
weren't spared.

870
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,300
Was

871
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,780
the Yan family

872
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,780
killed after that?

873
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,700
That's right.

874
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,300
The Yan family was killed

875
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,500
a few days after the birthday banquet.

876
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,340
I was taking office
in Shuntian Prefecture at that time.

877
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,620
I found out

878
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,180
that several outsiders

879
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,700
had visited the Yan family.

880
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,420
I thought

881
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,180
they were just a few scouting bandits,

882
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,580
but now it seems...

883
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,780
That person

884
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,460
