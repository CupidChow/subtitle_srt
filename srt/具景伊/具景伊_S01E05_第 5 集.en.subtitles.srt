1
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,968
HE DESERVES TO DIE, SO KILL HIM

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,262
I KILLED HIM LIKE YOU SAID
BECAUSE HE DESERVED IT

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,430
KILL HIM!

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,098
SAVE HIM?

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,350
OVERLY SUSPICIOUS
EVIDENCE, HIKIKOMORI

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,518
I DO AS I PLEASE?

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,522
MY GOSH!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,359
CURIOUS?

9
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,277
THEY ALL DIED!

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,197
A HUSBAND-KILLER?
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE

11
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,240
SOMETHING IS FISHY

12
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,493
MUST WE ALL LIVE?

13
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,411
WE MUST

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,164
A NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN INSPECTOR

15
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:51,217
Where the hell are they? Where?

16
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:55,638
Ms. Na.

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,976
That was a trident goby.
They live in the estuary.

18
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,773
-Hey.
-Kyung-yi, this isn't…

19
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,108
Je-hui!

20
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,612
Na Je-hui!

21
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,781
This isn't the sea.

22
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,324
It's not the sea?

23
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,786
Focus, will you?

24
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,954
Get it together! Focus!

25
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,547
EPISODE 5

26
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,926
"This isn't…"

27
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,136
"This is not…"

28
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,891
Not what?

29
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,977
"This is not the sea."

30
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,313
That must be it, right?

31
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,946
Probably. Given the situation they're in.

32
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,031
She said the water is salty.

33
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,076
They're not in the sea,
but the water level is rising.

34
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,122
How can there be tides
if they're not at sea?

35
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,457
The seawater and freshwater
must overlap there.

36
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,710
The water is salty, and there are tides,
but it's not the sea.

37
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,089
That's why we couldn't see it.

38
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,387
How many brackish lakes
are there around here?

39
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,388
Get me a map.

40
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,560
This is 911. How can I help you?

41
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,564
Two people are locked inside
an abandoned box container on a lake.

42
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:28,940
The location is…

43
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,655
They can't be far away
from the area of operation.

44
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,300
Je-hui!

45
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,074
Na Je-hui!

46
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,082
Ms. Na…

47
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,501
Over here! Hurry!

48
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,591
Ms. Na. She's…

49
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,309
Ms. Na is still down there.

50
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,685
She's stuck down there.

51
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,979
Please, we need help over here now!

52
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,360
Ms. Na…

53
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,752
-Ms. Na.
-Je-hui!

54
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,212
-Je hui!
-Ms. Na.

55
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,296
Je-hui!

56
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,345
Je-hui.

57
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,611
What about Ms. Na?

58
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,200
Is she okay?

59
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,375
She's in the OR. She injured her neck.

60
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,088
Did you see them?

61
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,678
Did you see them
when you were kidnapped? Tell me.

62
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,766
Didn't you say you're smart?

63
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,437
Tell me how you were moved, what you
smelled or heard. Everything you remember.

64
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,523
Is this what's…

65
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,401
important to you right now?

66
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,694
It was K's helper.

67
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,156
In a way, you made contact with K.
This is a chance for us.

68
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,370
I know what you're thinking.

69
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,206
But we don't have time to waste here.

70
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,169
Do you want to catch them or not?

71
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:45,011
Ms. Na and I were in the car.

72
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,682
First, our voices started to change.

73
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,435
What's wrong with my voice? I sound funny.

74
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,314
Why won't this budge?

75
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,026
So we tried to open the windows,
but we couldn't.

76
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,820
Then we lost consciousness right away.

77
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,079
When we came to,

78
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,917
we realized we were
in some big wooden box.

79
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,759
I don't know how they moved us
from the car to the box--

80
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,649
One person would have been
enough to move you two.

81
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,709
Let's say you're right.
But we were in the middle of a mudflat.

82
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,045
How would they have got us there?

83
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,674
If the container was
already there to start with…

84
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,850
You and Je-hui wouldn't
weigh over 150kg combined,

85
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,394
so there was no need
to use heavy equipment.

86
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,230
So what are you saying?

87
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,489
Can you go check on Ms. Na?

88
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,840
Welcome.

89
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,760
All right.

90
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,180
The date…

91
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,018
When was the date again?

92
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,028
You can't just…

93
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,029
DATE RANGE

94
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,363
…use that as you please.

95
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,073
JUNG AN-JA, LEE YU-BIN, SEO JI-MIN

96
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,497
DYNAMIC

97
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,915
You know,

98
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,127
when we rent out our vehicles,

99
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,505
we always check our customers' IDs.

100
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,924
It was probably fake.

101
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:29,926
By the way,

102
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,970
are you really a cop?

103
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,102
He hasn't returned the vehicle yet!

104
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,773
Hello? This is Dynamic.

105
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,317
One of our red ATVs hasn't been returned.

106
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,818
-Wait. Again.
-Yes.

107
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,779
Can you look for the vehicle?

108
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,369
This…

109
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,081
I've seen this gesture before.

110
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,923
CHIEF SHIN
IT'S IN FRONT OF WOLMI OBSERVATORY

111
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,050
I need to go and pick this…

112
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,010
Where did they go?

113
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,070
Goodness. They totally trashed it.

114
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,863
Do they have no conscience?

115
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,907
Thanks, though.

116
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,702
Exactly. They must have no conscience.

117
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,413
Did you see where the driver went?

118
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,499
There are no security cameras around here.

119
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,419
He parked it here
then went to the restroom.

120
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,421
And he just left afterward.

121
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,848
The past couple of days have been weird.

122
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,100
Goodness.

123
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:05,521
It's been way more entertaining
than watching a game of go.

124
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,068
What did you see?

125
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:15,406
We just watched a grown woman
rummaging through the trash can.

126
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,325
Not that.

127
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,701
And yesterday,

128
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:23,789
we saw a woman
coming out of the men's room.

129
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,916
When we saw her leaving the men's room,

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,753
we thought the world had gone crazy.

131
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,130
But what happened afterward
was a bigger spectacle.

132
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,214
What happened?

133
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:36,719
A group of people went over to her
and identified themselves as police.

134
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,180
Then they took her with them.

135
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,600
By the way, I listened in,

136
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,353
and it sounded like
she did drugs or something.

137
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,437
-What?
-Drugs.

138
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,981
Kids these days can be so scary.

139
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,818
Did the girl you saw look like this?

140
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:55,821
No.

141
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,908
This is the photo of that man over there.

142
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,456
Not him. This girl.

143
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,537
-Goodness. What's that?
-What's that?

144
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,301
Yes. That's the girl.

145
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,179
Yes. That's the girl we saw.

146
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,072
She knew everything.

147
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,700
She approached me knowing everything.

148
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,694
You're Mr. Jang's wife! The lady cop!

149
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,488
She knew everything.

150
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,364
What would you have done?

151
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,158
She approached me knowing everything.

152
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,744
To kill without getting caught.

153
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,789
I would try to understand my target first.

154
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,293
And I would think of
the most fitting way to kill them

155
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,128
to disguise it as an accident.

156
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,672
You indeed are different.

157
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,425
That little girl

158
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,763
has been killing people
based on what I told her.

159
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,781
QUICK DELIVERY

160
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:44,949
JANGPUNGBANJEOM

161
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,750
Is that my breakfast?

162
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,924
Your breath stinks
because you didn't brush your teeth.

163
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:02,841
Take it.

164
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,262
Hey!

165
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:12,226
You should have listened to me.
Why were you being so reckless?

166
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,229
Hey!

167
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,109
Reflect on what you've done.

168
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,613
HOLDING CELL 2

169
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,995
You're the one being reckless right now.

170
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,751
Come in.

171
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,921
-Hello.
-Hi.

172
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:47,386
I work with Ms. Na.
My name is Oh Gyeong-su.

173
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,138
-I see.
-Hello.

174
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,356
I'm sure she'll pull through.

175
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,566
I hope so.

176
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:05,696
Did my daughter do something wrong?

177
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,241
No. We got into an accident
while we were after a criminal.

178
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,409
I see.

179
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,163
Excuse me.

180
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,668
Hello?

181
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,378
Pardon?

182
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,924
Hey, she wants to speak to you.

183
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,258
-Me?
-Yes.

184
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,094
Hello?

185
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,096
Get to work. Don't just sit around.

186
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,182
-Let's do what we can now.
-What?

187
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,392
What?

188
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,896
My goodness.

189
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,398
Oh, my.

190
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,487
Song Yi-kyung. A member
of the Drama Club at Dorim University.

191
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,739
Her aunt, Jung Jeong-yeon,
works for your company.

192
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,115
She went to Bongbaek Girls' High.

193
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,826
After growing up in the States,
her aunt raised her here.

194
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,329
I need as much information
as you can find on her.

195
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:59,041
You want me to compare what I find
to K's profile we came up with, right?

196
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,502
The K we know grew up in Seattle.

197
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:06,006
Find out if Song Yi-kyung lived in Seattle
and if anything happened there too.

198
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,841
Where are you going now?

199
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,470
The GPS guidance will begin.

200
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,138
To catch Song Yi-kyung.

201
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,022
Seattle…

202
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,525
But I'm really scared.

203
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:26,944
I think

204
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,698
someone set me up to bully me.

205
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,533
I still have to question you.

206
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,119
So you're not a US citizen.

207
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,997
You currently live
in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. Correct?

208
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,832
Yes.

209
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,917
Who should we call?

210
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,878
Did you know about this?

211
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,468
My aunt.

212
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,808
Gosh. She's going to be scared
when she gets the call.

213
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,353
Did both of your parents pass away?

214
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,818
Have you ever taken what I said seriously?

215
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,488
Why are we talking about that here?

216
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,866
You always disrespect me.

217
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,327
You must think you're better than me.

218
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,749
Let's put an end to this today.

219
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,795
What are you doing? What do you…

220
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,548
You just stay here.

221
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,516
Are you Song Yi-kyung's family?

222
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,186
Could you come to the police station?

223
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,777
-Yi-kyung!
-Yi-kyung!

224
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,000
Yi-kyung!

225
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,614
Where could you be?

226
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,116
Yi-kyung.

227
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,369
Please help me find Yi-kyung.

228
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,889
-Yi-kyung.
-Aunt.

229
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,477
Are you all right?

230
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,394
Yes.

231
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,776
Yi-kyung is like a miracle to me.

232
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:41,073
A young girl was all alone
in the forest for a week.

233
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,661
But there wasn't a scratch on her,
and she wasn't dehydrated at all.

234
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,165
Yi-kyung still doesn't remember it?

235
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,335
No. That's why it's a miracle.

236
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,965
I believe that it was my sister
who kept her safe.

237
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:10,519
You know how little kids
scribble everywhere.

238
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,145
That's probably it, right?

239
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,317
I heard she recently played with fire.

240
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:21,280
Oh, that?
I heard she played with a lighter

241
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,991
while she was over at a neighbor's house.

242
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,077
But nothing serious happened.
There was no big fire.

243
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:32,040
What kind of relationship
did Yi-kyung have with that neighbor?

244
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,627
Well, she always said hello to him.

245
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,631
And the old man also adored her.
That's about it.

246
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,675
How could you do this?

247
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,969
What you did was inhumane!

248
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:47,347
Areum was my family!

249
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:51,685
Did you hear him?
He called a dog his family.

250
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,980
That's just absurd.

251
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,607
-Areum!
-Goodness.

252
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,109
Unbelievable.

253
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,404
Yi-kyung.

254
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,449
What are you doing?

255
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,409
Aunt, why is that man crying?

256
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,704
That old man did something bad…

257
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,623
-Areum!
-…so he's heartbroken.

258
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,417
Stop it already.

259
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,461
Let's go.

260
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,506
Let's go. Okay?

261
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,468
What am I going to do?

262
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,804
You poor thing!

263
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:41,109
Yi-kyung. Why did you play
with the lighter?

264
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,611
I'm sorry.

265
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,033
What do you think of that old man?

266
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,242
That old man?

267
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:54,081
My aunt told me that
the old man did something bad,

268
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,875
so some man cried.

269
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,670
Then how do you feel when you see people

270
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,172
doing something bad?

271
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,341
Are you upset?

272
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,510
Are you happy?

273
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,012
Or are you sad?

274
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,972
It's dark.

275
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,475
-It's dark?
-Yes.

276
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,771
That's a pretty way to put it.

277
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,815
It's dark.

278
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,715
Yi-kyung.

279
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,093
Yi-kyung.

280
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,055
Aunt!

281
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,809
Are you okay?

282
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,986
Song Yi-kyung!

283
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,238
Song Yi-kyung.

284
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,575
Song Yi-kyung!

285
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,453
She went home. Who are you?

286
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,709
Song Yi-kyung!

287
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,379
Are you sure you'll be okay?

288
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,256
Come on.

289
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,675
I'm fine. Go to work!

290
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,202
She should
just be a good girl and go home.

291
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,912
Where is she going now?

292
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,473
Song Yi-kyung was on the campus
during Park Gyu-il's incident.

293
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,143
During Kim Min-gyu's incident
in Tongyeong, there was a festival

294
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,311
at her college.

295
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,980
But she didn't participate
in the Drama Club's activities.

296
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:28,193
It's possible that she was there
when K murdered him.

297
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,281
She was at Bongbaek as well.

298
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,246
It's acute alcohol intoxication,
and he hasn't gained consciousness.

299
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:44,668
I haven't told his family yet,
but he doesn't have much time left.

300
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,048
Thank you.

301
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,527
PATIENT NAME: AN ***-CHEOL
MALE, AGE 54

302
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,078
Why are you still alive?

303
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:29,337
If you don't die,
who's going to pay for your medical bills?

304
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:35,051
Stop torturing Mom, will you?

305
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:44,894
Kill him.

306
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,440
It looks like he deserves it. So kill him.

307
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,817
Who are you?

308
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,864
You can't?

309
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,491
Then should I do it for you?

310
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,163
Can you?

311
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,548
Can I?

312
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,601
You didn't see anything.

313
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:16,277
BONGBAEK GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

314
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,672
Why do you keep following me?

315
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,466
It's you, right?

316
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,926
I'm going to scream.

317
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,887
Why are you doing this to me?

318
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,306
Maybe I'm wrong.

319
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:49,436
I'm sorry. I must have
mistaken you for someone else.

320
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,447
What are you, an idiot?

321
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,865
Why did you come and find me?

322
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,202
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

323
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,294
-I'll help you.
-With what?

324
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,671
It must be hard
to clean up the garbage alone.

325
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,424
I'm doing just fine on my own.

326
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,678
I found this when I was cleaning the room.

327
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,430
This can be evidence too.

328
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,224
I think what you're doing is great.

329
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,517
Whatever happens,

330
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,603
I'll help you.

331
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,105
Because you saved me.

332
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,876
You can't take that back.

333
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,806
Hey, we're in trouble.

334
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,892
You're the one in trouble, you idiot.

335
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,560
How dare you set me up?

336
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,187
That's not important.

337
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,772
You said what I did was great.

338
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,107
You told me
you'd help me whatever happened.

339
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,945
Do you know
how scared and frustrated I was?

340
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:24,864
That woman knows everything.
She was even at the station.

341
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,659
And she must have found out
where you live by now.

342
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,787
Hey. Come here.

343
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,790
So you need to come to your senses!

344
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,667
At this rate, we'll go to jail.

345
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:39,003
And your aunt will find out
everything, and I'll get fired.

346
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,174
And your lover

347
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,970
will also find out
who you really are, right?

348
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,224
You aren't worried about me.

349
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,143
You're just worried about yourself.
That's why you reported me.

350
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,900
You want me gone
now that you have someone you love.

351
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,784
What a flimsy chain.

352
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,953
ARMY
LEE DAE-HO

353
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,836
At times, it seems

354
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,630
you still don't know who I really am.

355
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,258
What will you do next?

356
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,182
I'll call you.

357
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,018
Answer my calls, okay?

358
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,861
Judging from her recent sessions,

359
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,655
Yi-kyung is stable and at peace now.

360
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,365
Don't worry.

361
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,451
Have you ever

362
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,578
had the feeling

363
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,998
that Yi-kyung may be a very good liar?

364
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,958
-A liar?
-Never mind.

365
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:02,128
I must have said that
since I'm worried about her.

366
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,755
Forget what I said.

367
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,256
Okay.

368
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,866
Wait!

369
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,785
Hey, hold on.

370
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,703
Which unit?

371
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,708
You had one too many drinks.

372
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,462
-What's wrong?
-Hold on.

373
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,588
-Gosh.
-Oh, my.

374
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,173
-Hey.
-Be careful.

375
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,300
-Gosh.
-I'm so drunk.

376
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,344
Gosh. I'm so drunk.

377
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:54,681
-Gosh.
-Goodness. Ma'am.

378
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,016
Oh, dear. Ma'am.

379
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,267
Gosh.

380
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,019
Let's get you back up.

381
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,604
Are you all right, ma'am?

382
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,776
I bet you are the life of the party.

383
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,444
Sir!

384
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,116
Gosh.

385
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,366
She has the same passcode as me.

386
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,330
The door is open.

387
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,846
It isn't trapped, which means
there are no murder weapons here.

388
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,100
So this is
just a regular college girl's place

389
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,811
where no one would find anything unusual.

390
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,856
What are we looking for here?

391
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,532
Why isn't she answering her phone?

392
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,034
The person you have called is unavailable.

393
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,912
You will be connected
to voicemail after the tone.

394
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,756
There should be things
only we'll be able to recognize.

395
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,112
PRODIN

396
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,495
Narcotic painkiller.

397
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,666
These are for severe injures
like broken legs.

398
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:47,205
She must have a lamp here

399
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:51,626
because she frequently
does something while she's here.

400
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,092
She's not the type to read books.

401
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,346
What does she do here?

402
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,913
It's not K.

403
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,624
Don't move. They will just leave.

404
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,214
Yi-kyung.

405
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,758
Are you home, Yi-kyung?

406
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,679
What am I trying to find here?

407
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,976
I'm such an awful aunt.

408
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:01,630
Hello? I think someone broke into…

409
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,466
Ma'am!

410
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,176
Oh, my God!

411
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,844
-You startled me.
-Ma'am.

412
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,433
We must have startled you.

413
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,123
Is he really her boyfriend?

414
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,296
I did see a photo of him once.

415
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,801
Well, are you sure they're dating?

416
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,389
Why else would she give him her passcode?

417
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,644
Then why are you here?

418
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,855
Well…

419
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,736
I was the one who set them up.

420
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,821
So…

421
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,032
they invited me over for dinner today.

422
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,575
Right?

423
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,957
She didn't tell me about that.

424
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,627
Then when I came in, why did you--

425
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,213
I fell asleep for a second.

426
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,590
The two of you together?

427
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:32,012
Wait. You dozed off too, didn't you?

428
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,055
Goodness.

429
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,144
By the way, what's taking her so long?

430
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:41,397
I wonder if something happened to her.

431
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,732
She said she was meeting a friend.

432
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,652
Was she really expecting you?

433
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,280
A friend? She doesn't have any friends.

434
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,324
She does!

435
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,368
Who? Other than me and him.

436
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,877
I understand.

437
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:06,464
Yi-kyung went through a lot
when she was young.

438
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,469
Do you want to join us?

439
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,764
No, wait.

440
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,893
Seeing how she didn't invite you,

441
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:22,104
there might be something
she wants to talk to us about in private.

442
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,858
That's fine. I should get going.

443
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,194
Ms. Koo.

444
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,656
Thank you for taking care of Yi-kyung.

445
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,284
And I hope you'll continue

446
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:37,953
to help her.

447
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:44,793
I'm not sure
if I'm in any place to help anyone.

448
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,340
Do you think she went there?

449
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,133
Where?

450
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,718
The place she likes to visit.

451
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:06,190
Excuse me.
This is an international phone call.

452
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,075
What?

453
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,370
My mother?

454
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,831
Oh, no.

455
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,169
Is she conscious?

456
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,050
No. I'll be there.

457
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,469
I'll be there as fast as I can.

458
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,265
Oh, no.

459
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,600
Gosh, Mom…

460
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,026
What's wrong?

461
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,612
It's a family matter.

462
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:57,908
Oh, dear.

463
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,995
-I should go.
-Okay.

464
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,838
I was about to call you.

465
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,840
See if Song Yi-kyung
or Jung Jeong-yeon have

466
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,593
any private containers
under their names by the Han River.

467
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,386
Ms. Na woke up.

468
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:25,436
Are you listening?

469
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,522
What are you doing?

470
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:33,611
You weren't responding,
so I thought you went deaf or something.

471
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:38,115
So that girl is K
and she's leaving Korea soon?

472
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:39,950
So you were listening.

473
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,537
Did you call Director Yong?

474
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,623
We can't make a fool of ourselves.

475
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:50,461
We should go incognito
and catch her at the airport.

476
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,341
You seem to know what's best for us.

477
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,055
I didn't inform the director yet.

478
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,058
You can make
a judgment call and contact her.

479
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,185
As you well know,

480
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:09,938
I'm suspicious of everything,
so I can't take any action.

481
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,944
A leader is supposed to make decisions
for a loose cannon like me.

482
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,908
Did something happen to you
while I was unconscious?

483
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,326
Have you run out of alcohol?

484
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,003
What is this?

485
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,464
If your dad sees that,
it might break his heart.

486
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,795
Gosh.

487
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:18,507
Mr. Kim, you're always out of shape.

488
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:22,052
It's because you make bets
on the golf course instead of playing.

489
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,596
So tell me. Did you beat Mr. Park?

490
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:28,559
Well, he's no match for me.

491
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,352
Whatever.

492
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,855
Actually, he's hoping to treat you

493
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:35,858
to a nice meal for your help
regarding Washington.

494
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,485
There's no need.

495
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,238
Seong-tae's here.

496
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:44,533
Mother.

497
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:47,703
Mom!

498
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,920
Hyeon-tae, I didn't know
you were coming too.

499
00:45:57,546 --> 00:46:00,716
I just came to ask the monk
if everything was going well.

500
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,093
Have you been well?

501
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,137
I'm fine as long as you are.

502
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,097
So how are you?

503
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,183
I'm doing well, as usual.

504
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,687
Right, Mom? I'm well, aren't I?

505
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,940
I guess you haven't seen
each other in a while.

506
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,736
I'll prepare the water for tea.

507
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,700
Hyeon-tae. You stay outside.

508
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,161
Tell them you visited while taking a hike.

509
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,289
Okay. Actually,
I was about to head back down.

510
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,166
Have a great time, you two.

511
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:05,322
Candidate No Hye-ji is on the rise.
Young people like her too.

512
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,450
She's fierce and strong.

513
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,827
I can feel she will bring a storm.

514
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:14,831
In other words,
she can be seen as a game changer.

515
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,501
She will bring a storm.

516
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:21,797
But the storm won't lift you
to a higher place.

517
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,801
It's a destructive storm.

518
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,555
She's just small fry.
Seong-tae doesn't need to worry about her.

519
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,933
-Who's the biggest fish?
-Okay.

520
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:41,483
He's a lawyer and the CEO
of KD Peace Lab, an IT company.

521
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,944
As he's known
for his ethics and integrity.

522
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,655
We'll have to watch out for him
if he decides to run.

523
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,825
But he said he wouldn't go into politics.

524
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:52,494
Why are you so naive, Seong-tae?

525
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,706
People who say that
are the ones you need to watch out for.

526
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,166
He does a lot of good deeds.

527
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,836
So I thought about bringing him on board.

528
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:04,631
You always told me to make friends
of those who would be a threat.

529
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,594
KO DAM, FORTUNE
BORN 12 O'CLOCK, AUGUST 17, 1977

530
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,388
By the way…

531
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,057
What is it? Do you see something?

532
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,311
What does he do?

533
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,272
What the world knows about him

534
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:23,150
is just a small fraction
of who he actually is.

535
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:32,743
Hello?

536
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,286
It's not this one.

537
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:37,581
-Hey!
-I'm sorry, ma'am.

538
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:43,670
Damn it.

539
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,884
This better be very important.

540
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,848
Really? Are you sure?

541
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,145
Poor Grandma. I hope she's okay.

542
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:04,066
Okay. I'll go to the airport right away.
See you later.

543
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,827
Ms. Na, you aren't well enough.

544
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,456
When is the flight?

545
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,917
Jung Jeong-yeon
and Song Yi-kyung bought tickets

546
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,252
for Flight AE720 departing at 6:20 a.m.

547
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,921
You should be in bed right now.

548
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,840
Come with me, or back off.
It's over if we lose her now.

549
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,848
Gosh. Where is it?

550
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,320
It's about time I saw her.

551
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,777
You're sure the windows are tinted, right?

552
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,035
Why can't they just
catch her on their own?

553
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,706
Why do I have to be here too?

554
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,040
Gosh.

555
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,419
Stop complaining and focus.

556
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:51,089
Even if she's in disguise,
she can't change her build or gait.

557
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,346
The airport is huge.
Will we really be able to find her?

558
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:02,726
She can try all she wants,
but there's only one place she can go.

559
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,193
Come on. Stop that. My goodness.

560
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:14,446
Sit down. Gosh, don't do that.
Your back must hurt.

561
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,908
Are you checking the cameras?

562
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,201
Yes.

563
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,248
My gosh. There are so many monitors here.
I don't know where to look.

564
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,920
Watch closely.

565
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:33,423
If you lose her now,
she might stay in the States for good.

566
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,258
Just the thought of it scares me.

567
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,093
Like I briefed you,

568
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,346
we'll catch her
unless she gets wind of it.

569
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,557
How will this go down?

570
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:43,767
When she shows up,

571
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,728
they'll say something is wrong
with her ticket and bring her in.

572
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:47,646
Right?

573
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,773
Yes, it will be done
as quietly as possible.

574
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,110
What will you do afterward?

575
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,530
We don't have enough evidence
to hand over to the police.

576
00:51:56,613 --> 00:52:01,034
Shouldn't we talk about that
once we have her in our custody?

577
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:02,410
I know you have faith in us.

578
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:05,622
What? Of course I do.

579
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:08,250
I have complete faith in you, Ms. Na.

580
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,925
Goodness.

581
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,804
Jung Jeong-yeon is here.

582
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,310
And Song Yi-kyung?

583
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,062
I don't see her yet.

584
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:37,362
The phone is turned off.

585
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,281
You will be connected

586
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:41,157
-to voicemail after the tone.
-Her phone is off again.

587
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,659
Your call will be charged…

588
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,245
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE BOARDING GATE

589
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:55,505
You won't find her just by
staring into the screen like that.

590
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,091
Look.

591
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,678
If she shows up
just because I keep my eyes peeled…

592
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:13,106
…that would be a rigged play.

593
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:46,932
START A NEW LIFE AFTER WORK
WITH HAN RIVER LEISURE SPORTS

594
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:56,900
START A NEW LIFE AFTER WORK
WITH HAN RIVER LEISURE SPORTS

595
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,490
Hey, you.

596
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,242
Did you look into what I asked yesterday?

597
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,916
A container numbered 52
at a windsurfing place

598
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,710
was rented under Song Yi-kyung's name.

599
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,564
What if she doesn't show up?

600
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,198
It's hot.

601
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:47,993
It's going to burn the roof of my mouth.

602
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:52,998
Hey.

603
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:57,419
Am I supposed to drink the tea
or your saliva?

604
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,884
Passengers of Flight AE720
departing at 6:20 a.m.,

605
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,679
please come to Gate 25 now.

606
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:12,267
Passengers of Flight AE720
departing at 6:20 a.m.,

607
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:15,687
please come to Gate 25 now.

608
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,112
Song Yi-kyung's phone is on.

609
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:25,864
-What? Let me see.
-Here.

610
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,409
She's coming. Yes.

611
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,995
-She's entering the airport, right?
-That's right.

612
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,121
-She's coming.
-Yes.

613
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,123
Hey, hold it up properly.

614
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:39,753
Passengers named Song Yi-kyung
and Jung Jeong-yeon

615
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:43,465
of Flight AE 720 departing at 6:20 a.m.,

616
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:46,134
please board the plane now.

617
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,806
I heard it. Can you confirm it?

618
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,282
I'm not the only one
who can't find her. Right?

619
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:23,088
Passengers, Song Yi-kyung
and Jung Jeong-yeon,

620
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,048
for Flight AE 720 departing at 6:20 a.m.,

621
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:29,260
-please board the plane now.
-Come on, Yi-kyung.

622
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,597
Yi-kyung. Where are you? Are you here?

623
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,557
Oh, no. What do I do?

624
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:39,771
I just woke up. I'm really sorry, Aunt.

625
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,482
What are you talking about?

626
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,152
I'll go to the airport
and get on the next flight.

627
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,320
You should go ahead.

628
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:49,697
I'm really sorry, Aunt.

629
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,658
Did something happen?

630
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:53,576
No.

631
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:57,455
I'm really sorry about this.

632
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,749
I'll be there
as soon as possible. Just go.

633
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,585
If you're late to see
Grandma because of me,

634
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:05,755
I'll be heartbroken
for the rest of my life.

635
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,467
Okay. I'll wait for you there.
Then you have to hurry--

636
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,274
GPS TRACKING
TARGET ACQUIRED

637
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,884
Let me know if you need help.

638
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,803
Let me know if you need help.

639
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,098
Let me know if you need help.

640
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:00,059
Let me know if you need help.

641
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,021
Let me know if you need help.

642
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:06,107
Let me know if you need help.

643
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,747
Stop pouting.

644
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,333
It was fun. I felt like
I was in a James Bond movie.

645
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:26,503
But we didn't do this
just to have some fun.

646
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,962
I'll look into it.

647
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,048
"Look into it"?

648
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,092
Now?

649
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,472
Incompetent people
who never deliver what they promise.

650
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:39,849
I hate people like that.

651
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,893
-I--
-Stop it.

652
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:50,235
SEOUL MAYORAL ELECTION
HEO SEONG-TAE LEADING THE POLLS

653
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,864
Everyone has a talent of their own.

654
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,494
And my talent is that
I'm a good judge of character.

655
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:04,415
As long as you do a better job
of supervising your people,

656
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:07,710
you'll be going places.

657
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:16,135
Then let's make sure
we all know where our places are.

658
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,762
That's why you're here.

659
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,428
You were right.

660
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:01,180
They were there to catch you.

661
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:05,226
But there were
a lot more people than you expected.

662
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:08,062
How many? Like five?

663
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:10,648
No. Multiply that by ten.

664
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:13,735
Hey.

665
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,904
I guess I'm very important.

666
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:20,116
My heart suddenly swells with pride.

667
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:25,121
People who aren't even cops
came over there to catch me?

668
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:28,541
Hey, you should ask for my autograph.

669
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:33,713
What were they doing there? Idiots.

670
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:48,978
No freaking way.

671
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,147
How did she know I was here?

672
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,997
Someone died from a snake bite!

673
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,125
That's Yi-kyung,
the girl I told you about.

674
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,001
-She's a terrible actress.
-She's adorable though.

675
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:57,088
However, K is unlike
most murderers we've known.

676
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,340
Since we don't know
what kind of person she is…

677
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,591
He's definitely not human.

678
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,051
Now I have no choice but to kill you.

679
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:05,388
There are so many people to kill,
but only one of me.

680
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,849
I apologize.
I'll do better from now on!

681
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,934
How dare you?

682
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:12,270
We've found K's next target.

683
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:16,023
Judging by what you just said,
you want something from me, right?

684
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:18,860
Is there any way to kill him
without anyone knowing?

685
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:21,195
I, too, have had the urge to kill someone.

686
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:22,697
Foolishness and arrogance.

687
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,408
You need to have both to be able to kill,
but I had neither of them.

688
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:27,952
It has to be perfect this time.

689
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:30,580
How should I kill you?

690
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:59,961
