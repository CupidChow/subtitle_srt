HE DESERVES TO DIE, SO KILL HIM

00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,262
I KILLED HIM LIKE YOU SAID
BECAUSE HE DESERVED IT

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,430
KILL HIM!

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,098
SAVE HIM?

WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,359
CURIOUS?

00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,277
THEY ALL DIED!

00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,197
A HUSBAND-KILLER?
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE

00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,240
SOMETHING IS FISHY

12
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,493
MUST WE ALL LIVE?

13
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,411

I'm going to fall ill
if I keep overworking like this.

20
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,897
The doors are opening.

00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,580
EPISODE 4

00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,725
PHOTOS OF THE SCENE

23
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,875
Did they make
a separate task force for me?

24
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,006
1. MURDERS DISGUISED AS ACCIDENTS,
NATURAL DEATHS, SUICIDES

25
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,553
2. BIG OR SMALL,
THE VICTIMS ALL DID SOMETHING WRONG

26
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,432
Not bad.

27
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,353
Why doesn't our team have get-togethers?

28
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,232
How about you and I
go have a drink as two men on the team?

29
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,071
What is it? Are you that happy?

30
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,119
Did you leave something? How clumsy.

31
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,371
I'll be heading home then.

WATER ONCE A DAY

33
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,488
Even if I wear perfume,

34
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:08,076
the smell wears off
by the evening due to the smell of trash.

35
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,494
It's better not to wear any.

36
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,662
It's worse when the smells mix.

37
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:26,969
What's his deal?

38
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,985
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

39
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,738
Damn it.

NT LIFE INSURANCE TOWER

41
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,897
God, he's tenacious.

42
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,868
Damn it!

43
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,186
Is he an athlete or what?

44
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,408
As an IT expert, I can say for sure

45
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,994
that this video
wasn't uploaded to the web.

46
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,707
Judging by how it was directly transmitted
on the electronic display,

47
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,835
it's highly likely that
a skillful hacker played a part in this.

48
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,589
But the key point
is the message it's relaying.

49
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,800
"The true culprit is still out there."

50
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,347
It means the young woman arrested
on the scene might be another victim.

51
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,474
We have a valuable guest today.

52
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,018
He was at the crime scene
when it happened.

53
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,980
Username Poirot. Thank you
for your three-month subscription.

54
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,108
You told me that the man seemed a bit odd

55
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,485
even before he was stabbed.

56
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:37,822
That's right. He was staggering and--

57
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,616
Gosh, 5,000 won! I'm shocked!

58
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,744
I'm dumbfounded.

59
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,580
Do we even have to watch
these garbage videos online?

60
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:51,252
The most important leads
can often be found watching them.

61
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,213
Hey, you. Did you find it?

62
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,424
My name is Gyeong-su.

63
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,635
Gosh, have you still not found it yet?

64
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,888
Why is he even on the team?

65
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:13,441
The animation they used
was broadcast locally in Seattle in 2003.

66
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,026
The title is The Way to ABC.

67
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,864
Tell me everything.

68
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:23,033
It's a simple animation
that was created for preschoolers.

69
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,286
This red bear is Annie.

70
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,955
This yellow lizard is Bonnie.

71
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,999
And this green one is Cindy.

72
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,959
As for the rest of them…

73
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,712
Just tell me the important stuff.

74
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,299
Says the person
who wanted to hear everything.

75
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,635
Gosh, you whine a lot.

76
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,932
The episode they used for the video

77
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,186
begins with one of the characters
dropping some pancakes on the floor.

78
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,606
Then they argue about
who dropped the pancakes.

79
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:57,860
Hey, you.

80
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,739
So which one of them dropped the pancakes?

81
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,283
It's Gyeong-su.

82
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,910
Is the red one Gyeong-su?

83
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,623
No. My name is Gyeong-su,
so call me by my--

84
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,836
Is that important right now?

85
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,923
It wasn't any of them.

86
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,508
What?

87
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,677
The culprit was the camera
that was filming them.

88
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,888
The one holding the camera to be exact.

89
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,224
Her name is Didi.

90
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,982
Gosh, I got goosebumps.

91
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,610
Is this really for kids? It's a bit deep.

92
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:49,203
The story is similar to the message
the murderer wanted to relay.

93
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,955
What about it?

94
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,500
They hacked the display in a hurry
and uploaded the video

95
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,085
to protect the suspect.

96
00:13:56,168 --> 00:14:00,172
And they chose an animation
that not many people here know

97
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,091
but matched their intended message.

98
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,385
Since this was improvised,

99
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,720
it probably means that it's likely

100
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,098
that the culprit grew up
watching this animation.

101
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:13,060
Someone who was a preschooler
in Seattle in 2003?

102
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:16,355
That means they're in their twenties now.
That's too young.

103
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,650
Gosh, I can't see straight.

104
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,861
Gosh.

105
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,241
Darn it. I finished it.

106
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,661
Oh, dear.

107
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,317
She can't be that desperate
for alcohol, can she?

108
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,908
When did you leave, Santa?

109
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,576
Weren't you here just a moment…

110
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,871
Hold on.

111
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,876
Gosh, what's this smell?

112
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,505
Gosh. What's that in your hair?

113
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,883
Is this grease?

114
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,690
SOMEONE BROKE IN HERE LAST NIGHT

115
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,068
I'M CERTAIN IT WAS K

116
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,633
They just look ordinary.

117
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:14,765
I mean, I've been here since last night.

118
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,229
I didn't see anyone who looked suspicious.

119
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,815
Can you rewind to
when that person entered the building?

120
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,446
Gosh, how can we find them
when we have so much footage?

121
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,830
Spending time with me
must have made you dubious as well.

122
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,833
We have our gut feelings.

123
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,127
I'm sure he chased them for a reason.

124
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,879
And why would they run away
if they were innocent?

125
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,844
You can't help but run. Got it.

126
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,054
Santa.

127
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,724
I won't punish you
for being late for work today,

128
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,559
so stop this and go take a shower.

129
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,104
We can't have
two smelly people at the office.

130
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,981
How is it two?

131
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,609
You don't have to lie
about why you couldn't shower.

132
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,070
Was it really a lie?

133
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,574
Forget it. Let's get back to work.

134
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,380
Goodness. Santa is cleaning again.

135
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,049
He must be stressed out.

136
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,978
Everything's clean and tidy.

137
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,190
Santa! Don't spray that with water!

138
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,221
BRAND NEW MENU

00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,015
This looks really good.

141
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,018
-Eat slowly and chew well.
-Okay.

142
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,107
Something's fishy.

143
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,858
Babe.

144
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,819
Our love will last forever.

145
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,585
Enjoy.

146
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,047
You don't think we should move?

147
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,260
We have nowhere else to go anyway.

148
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,971
How can we stay there
when it was bugged once?

149
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,934
Gosh.

150
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,737
We should tighten the security.

151
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,782
They'll only catch on if we move now.

152
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,205
Are you sure we're safe here?

153
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,375
They must know my name and how I look.

154
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,422
Did you do something wrong?

155
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,091
-What?
-If not, don't worry.

156
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,051
They don't kill
those who don't deserve it.

157
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,761
Santa is alive and well too.

158
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,307
Still…

159
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,643
Hold on. Is this food safe to eat?

160
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,451
You're such scaredy-cats.

161
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,038
I guess it's safe.

162
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,290
It's not poisoned.

163
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,459
They must've heard us talking about them

164
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,879
being in their twenties
and having lived in Seattle.

165
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,964
Yes, since they bugged us.

166
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,801
-It was a woman.
-What?

167
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,512
Are you sure? You didn't see their face.

168
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,724
I'm certain. It was a woman.

169
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:30,354
A woman in her twenties
who spent her childhood in Seattle?

170
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,522
That doesn't make sense.

171
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,446
Stop playing hard to get.

172
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:44,243
He may be a divorcee,
but he's handsome and has a nice job.

173
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,453
Why are you being so picky?

174
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,082
Is it because of your niece?

175
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,292
Or are you looking for a bachelor?

176
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,670
No, that's not it.

177
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:58,006
I want love at first sight.
You know what I mean?

178
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,008
That electrifying feeling, okay?

179
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,427
That's what I need.

180
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,429
Did you come to work last night?

181
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:05,889
No.

182
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,475
I went straight home
after doing some legwork.

183
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,102
But it says you were.

184
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,104
Maybe it's an error.

185
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,946
JUNG JEONG-YEON, 21:40

186
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,031
Your lover is calling you.

187
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,117
MY PUPPY

188
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,413
Hi, my puppy.
Are you rehearsing today as well?

189
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,165
Okay.

190
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,377
Yi-kyung.

191
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,839
Never mind.

192
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,300
Don't skip your meals.

193
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,677
Bye.

194
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,061
JUNG JEONG-YEON, 21:40

195
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,438
Put him in the rice box.

196
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:59,693
Let go! Let go of me!

197
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,279
Father!

198
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:09,828
Your Majesty! You cannot do this!

199
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,497
Hold it.

200
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,294
Let's take a breather.

201
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,631
Already?

202
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,843
But I'm fine.

203
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,402
She hurt her right leg?

204
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,119
My leg's asleep.

205
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,316
What brings you here?

206
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:23,819
Wait.

207
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,654
Are you here to see me?

208
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,073
You can't act to save your life.

209
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,244
That won't work on me.

210
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,414
You're the only person
who's honest with me.

211
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,917
Don't you have friends?

212
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,378
Do I?

213
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,588
Does that matter?

214
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,549
I'm sure you know that.

215
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,843
Didn't you grow up in the US?

216
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,595
Then it must have been hard
to make friends.

217
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,013
Did Mr. Jang tell you that?

218
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,475
Did you watch that animation
that was on the news when you were there?

219
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,020
Right. What was that?

220
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:00,856
It was so creepy.

221
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,693
-Where were you last night?
-You seem very interested in my affairs.

222
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,612
I'm blushing.

223
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,949
You haven't answered
a single question of mine.

224
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,462
Father.

225
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,425
What did I do to deserve to die?

226
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:33,013
Why do you want me to die
without telling me why?

227
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,475
All that I wished for was…

228
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,020
What did he wish for again?

229
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,733
What do you wish for?

230
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,819
For you to answer me properly.

231
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,696
I see.

232
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,999
I did live in the US,
but I haven't seen that animation.

233
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,667
Yesterday, I rehearsed.

234
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,297
And it's true
that I don't have any friends.

235
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:13,011
Sometimes I want to
pour my heart out to someone.

236
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,888
But there's no one.

237
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,014
You have your aunt.

238
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,559
That's not the same as having a friend.

239
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,895
She's someone I need to look after.

240
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,564
She could be shocked by what I tell her.

241
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,149
Right.

242
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:31,029
Mr. Jang was a great listener.

243
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:33,615
Right?

244
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:38,036
You must really like
stepping over boundaries.

245
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,871
I just want us to be friends.

246
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,377
It's time.

247
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,849
The light shines through at this hour,
and it's beautiful.

248
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,686
It feels like you can even inhale it.

249
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:40,890
Bye.

250
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,520
Goodbye.

251
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,964
I should do something about that woman.

252
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,593
Oh, that doll? It's resting right now.

253
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,095
I gave it a checkup as you asked.

254
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,349
Its dad must have taken great care of it,
seeing how healthy it is.

255
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,393
The stuffing was clean and dry.

256
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,729
Didn't you find anything else inside?

257
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,857
Or was it made
with a special kind of fabric?

258
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,941
Not at all.

259
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,694
A sad doll often has its stuffings lump up

260
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,696
or has insects inside.

261
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,365
But it's very healthy.

262
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:42,035
So I even performed
psychotherapy on it for free.

263
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,953
Psycho…

264
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,292
So there's nothing special about it?

265
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,002
Of course there is.

266
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,380
He gave birth to it himself.

267
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,382
"Gave birth?"

268
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,510
I've never seen a doll like that
in my 20 years on the job.

269
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,929
He designed and made that doll himself.

270
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,265
So he pretty much gave birth to it.
Don't you think so?

271
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,691
We had it inspected
and it was made with ordinary materials.

272
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:17,695
The only thing of note
was that it was handmade.

273
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,407
But many people
make dolls like this, right?

274
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,367
What?

275
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,494
Where's Ms. Koo?

276
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,123
Ms. Na?

277
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,667
You can wrap up and go home.

278
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,050
Am I the only one working here?

279
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,927
BLEACH

280
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:49,102
How will you survive in this world

281
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:53,732
being as suspicious as you are?

282
00:28:55,233 --> 00:29:00,405
How will you survive in this world
being as suspicious…

283
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,704
Excuse me.

284
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,665
I lost my sister.

285
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,626
Could you please lend me your phone?

286
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,130
We came here together,
but she disappeared.

287
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:21,092
Hold on. What will you do with the phone?

288
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,053
I'm going to call her.

289
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,849
You know her number by heart?

290
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,060
Something's fishy.

291
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,772
Why me?

292
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,649
There are so many people here.

293
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,443
So why me?

294
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,154
-Why?
-What?

295
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,490
Su-yeon!

296
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,909
Hey!

297
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,619
Hey!

298
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:49,996
Thank you!

299
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,831
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

300
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,734
Yes?

301
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,070
Ms. Koo, it's me.

302
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,074
They called to ask for help.

303
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,455
And I don't think I can say no
because I'm afraid they'll hurt Seon-mi.

304
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,582
I have to do this.

305
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:40,088
And you're the only person
I can ask for help.

306
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,256
IT'S YOUR TURN TO HELP

307
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,549
What should I do?

308
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:46,302
Yoon Jae-yeong's
received one message so far.

309
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,347
"Incheon Station, exit one,
1 p.m., the day after tomorrow."

310
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,557
That's it.

311
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,727
She wasn't told what to bring
or who to meet.

312
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,982
She'll probably be given her next order
once she arrives there.

313
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,775
Her next order?

314
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,152
Are you saying someone will die again?

315
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,573
Whatever it may be,

316
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:10,368
we'll be able to see how K works.

317
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,624
Sorry.

318
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,294
What took you so long?

319
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,170
Gyeong-su filled me in on my way here.

320
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,006
Are you sure it's K?

321
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,216
-Am I sure?
-Over 51-percent certain?

322
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,761
Yes, since she said they'd be even now.

323
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,014
-Okay. Then--
-Stop right there.

324
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,307
What?

325
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:34,809
What's the matter?

326
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,186
Are you trying to pull a fast one on me?

327
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,689
Who are you calling?

328
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,859
K reached out to her.

329
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:47,405
If she's to give Ms. Yoon the next order,
that means K will be at Incheon Station.

330
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,492
We'll have to scope the area,
so we'll need backup.

331
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,203
She'll find out.
This needs to be discreet.

332
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,873
What are you talking about?

333
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,126
Speaking of which…

334
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,224
K knows about all of us, right?

335
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,354
We need to tighten the security even more.

336
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,856
The information we have
should be kept to ourselves.

337
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,359
Let me check your phone.

338
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,070
What is this?

339
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,113
Why were you late today?

340
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,579
Who is it?

341
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,831
It's private.

342
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,084
I know everything about you.

343
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,378
Is it Director Yong?

344
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,005
Did you already call her?

345
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,298
It's not her.

346
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:50,677
Then who is it?

347
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,513
Let me see.

348
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,938
What is it? How's the fever?

349
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:05,066
Na Na is up and looking for you.

350
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,609
What should I do?

351
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,197
I'm busy right now.

352
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,456
K wants Yoon to aid her in murder.

353
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,875
She's forcing a civilian
to take part in a murder.

354
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,879
Shouldn't our priority be to protect
Ms. Yoon and the next victim?

355
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,924
What if K sees Director Yong's men
and catches onto us?

356
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,510
What will happen
to Ms. Yoon and her daughter then?

357
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:35,263
-You don't know that for--
-It's highly possible

358
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,515
since she seems to be smarter than you.

359
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,060
Ms. Koo.

360
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:42,770
Any other ideas?

361
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,064
-Let's tell the police--
-Do you think that'll work?

362
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,649
You want there to be another victim.

363
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,819
-Right?
-What?

364
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:53,573
You don't care if someone dies
as long as you have a lead on K.

365
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,951
You haven't changed one bit.

366
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,371
You're at it alone again
since you don't trust anyone.

367
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,957
You don't even trust your teammates
so you surveil them.

368
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,544
You'll risk anything and everything
just to solve this puzzle.

369
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,838
This is just like back then.

370
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,032
I don't think
we should talk about this at home

371
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,534
and definitely not at the station.

372
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:55,176
I just want to
hear your side of the story.

373
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,013
You can be honest with me, can't you?

374
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,041
Do you know how desperately I prayed

375
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:32,171
that you wouldn't hurt anyone
by suspecting others again?

376
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:39,595
Unlike you, I've changed.
I'm not making the same mistake.

377
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,057
I killed him.

378
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,728
That's your conclusion
after all those years?

379
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,147
Yes.

380
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,234
I think I killed my husband.

381
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,071
But why? Why did he die?

382
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:02,034
Because someone he trusted
started looking at him in contempt?

383
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,286
Could that be why?

384
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,204
What if that's not it?

385
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,416
What if he killed himself
so that I wouldn't find out

386
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,752
all the dirty things he'd done?

387
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,173
Even if I was to relive that moment,

388
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,758
I'd suspect him just as I did then.

389
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,845
I have no choice.

390
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,310
I feel so sorry for him.

391
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,153
How close were you to my husband?

392
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,821
What?

393
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,615
Who's Na Na's dad?

394
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,499
I understand that you don't trust anyone.

395
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:54,795
But I bet no one in this world
cares about you more than I do.

396
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,467
I won't be there when you regret this.

397
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,024
Hey, you.

398
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,195
Tell Ms. Yoon that we'll help her.

399
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:25,159
Are we really doing this?

400
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,747
Haven't you been listening all this time?

401
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,795
What are their names?

402
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,880
This one's Jack.

403
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,257
-Jack.
-This one's Tommy.

SONG YI-KYUNG

405
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,185
Do you have a lover I don't know about?

406
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,896
It was a spam call.

407
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,774
I don't have a lover.

408
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,152
Gosh.

409
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:03,906
I didn't realize
you were the jealous type.

410
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,117
I can be sulky too.

411
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,536
That's not how you speak in a dialect.

412
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,080
Are you speaking a Gyeongsang dialect?

413
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,749
I was born in Gyeongsang Province

414
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,334
but I grew up in Bongbaek.

415
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:19,255
My dad worked there
as a school janitor until he died.

416
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:23,092
I see. I'm sorry.

417
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,095
He deserved to die.

418
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:29,473
He was a drunkard and a wife-beater.
You know the story.

419
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,143
Was it the alcohol that killed him?

420
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,770
Yes.

421
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,440
That's why I never drink.

422
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,860
So you better not sulk
even if I don't drink with you.

423
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,530
All right. I'll give you a free pass.

424
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,409
I'm such a downer, aren't I?

425
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,245
I love learning more about you.

426
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,831
I'd like to know more.

427
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,210
Should we go on a trip to the beach?

SONG YI-KYUNG

429
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,048
We'll book a hotel with an ocean view.

430
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,477
-Are you okay?
-Yes, and you?

431
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,437
I'm still new to wheelchairs.

432
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,396
Are you okay?

433
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,440
Are you all right?

434
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,484
Yes, I'm fine.

435
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,403
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

436
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,822
No. I'm fine.

437
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,499
Aren't you going to pick up?

438
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:39,835
She looks fine. Let's go have lunch.
We're going to be late.

439
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:40,753
What?

440
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,672
You're okay, right?

441
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,634
I'm sorry. Let's go.

442
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,261
-But--
-She says she's fine.

443
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,514
Let's go.

444
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,233
Hold on.

445
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,446
I'm sorry, but I can't talk right now.

446
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,157
Pick up my calls on time from now on.

447
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,034
Don't make me feel lonely.

448
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,619
Okay.

449
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,249
I'm famished. Let's go eat.

450
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,500
I'm starving.

451
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,229
Gosh.

452
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,233
Ms. Na.

453
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,360
Ms. Na.

454
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,155
Ms. Na.

455
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:53,951
I bought a variety of drinks
because I didn't know what you like.

456
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,622
You like milk tea. I'll make note of that.

457
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,417
Not really.

458
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,462
If you don't like sweet beverages,
don't drink it. I'll have it.

459
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,046
I don't hate it either.

460
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,508
You know exactly what Ms. Koo likes

461
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,385
but not what you like.

462
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:18,350
Why are you so nice to her?

463
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:20,936
I mean…

464
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:25,483
I get that she was a former colleague
who you admired and liked.

465
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:30,779
But let's be honest. The way
she's treating you is just not right.

466
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,156
Is this…

467
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,784
Is this because of her late husband?

468
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:39,914
What?

469
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:44,710
This may sound cruel,
but it's Ms. Koo's fault

470
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,462
that her husband died

471
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:53,385
I understand that you may feel guilty
for not stopping her.

472
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:58,891
But I don't think you deserve
to be treated like this.

473
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,809
Don't let her walk all over you.

474
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,150
Insert your card.

475
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,071
Aren't you getting out?

476
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,831
I didn't know but I think I like milk tea.

477
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,876
-I want this drink from now on.
-Yes, ma'am.

478
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,463
Drive home safely.

479
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:48,691
Someone saw Seong-u
and that student together that day.

480
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,280
Objectively speaking, he is a suspect.

481
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,283
I think I should question him--

482
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,325
No.

483
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,203
I'll do it. I have to.

-Dad.
-Hey.

487
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,591
Where is she?

488
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,676
-Hey. Come here.
-What?

489
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,180
Come in.

490
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,150
It's better here, right? It's quiet too.

491
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,027
How did you…

492
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:16,820
Hey.

493
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,198
You should thank her first.

494
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:24,578
I'm sorry. I should've taught her better.

495
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,622
Thank you.

496
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,249
She even brought us a gift.

497
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,252
Nonsense.

498
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:36,215
She's smart and hardworking.

499
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:41,178
I hadn't heard from her for a while
and was worried if something happened.

500
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,432
But now, I understand.

501
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,102
Thank you for your kindness.

502
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,188
Don't mention it.
We've known each other for…

503
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,982
quite some time now.

504
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,527
But the only lead
we have so far is that doll.

505
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:57,986
You see,

506
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,824
I like to see results.

507
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:07,913
See her out.

508
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,957
Okay.

509
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,509
I'll be waiting for your call.

510
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,063
Why did the elevator stop?

511
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,773
It was scorching hot in there.

512
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,777
-Why wasn't the AC on?
-Gosh, that was a pain.

513
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:39,862
This is so irritating.

What about you?

517
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,699
You should shower and sleep for tomorrow.

She's asleep.

What's the plan?

524
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:40,524
I'm meeting Ms. Yoon early in the morning.
Everything's planned out.

525
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:41,692
You did well.

526
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,528
I'll take it from here.

527
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,364
I'm going to intervene
if it gets dangerous.

528
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:50,158
We need to catch K
without anyone dying.

529
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,535
That was my plan anyway.

530
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,247
I've got it all planned out.

531
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,656
Since K has already ransacked our office,

532
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,326
it's safe to say
that our identities have been exposed.

533
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:35,495
Let's not show ourselves
in case something happens.

534
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,970
Our target is on the move.

535
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,001
It's too small. Don't get in.

536
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,120
Little miss.

537
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,789
Are you getting off at the Museum Station?

538
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:05,335
My husband asked me
to tell someone that he lost his phone.

539
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,796
Is it you?

540
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,842
Yes. It's me. Thank you.

541
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,461
-Let's go.
-No.

542
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,339
What is that?

543
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,174
What's inside?

544
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,571
Why did she do that?

545
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,114
She must have been threatened.

546
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,951
I think K caught on.

547
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,288
What's that water bottle?

548
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,709
Did you see what she was told to do?

549
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,711
No, I couldn't.

550
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:13,880
There's something in the bottle.

551
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,508
Poison? Like that time with Park Gyu-il?

552
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,051
What about you, Santa?

553
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,073
SAFETY CHECKLIST

554
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,416
NAME OF RIDE, DATE OF MANUFACTURE
SAFETY INSEPCTOR, DATE OF INSTALLATION

555
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,354
We need to find our target.

556
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,772
You should stop her instead!

557
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,441
We can't stop here.

558
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,776
What if it really is poison?

559
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:59,694
We're facing a temporary issue
with the power supply.

560
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,864
Everything is fine,
so please enjoy your time!

561
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,096
Hey, look!

562
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:36,523
No!

563
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,489
You can't do this!

564
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,784
Get out!

565
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,828
Get out! Get out of here!

566
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:52,789
Get out! It's dangerous!

567
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,308
We were duped.

568
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:20,567
RESTRICTED NUMBER:
NO ONE IS GOING TO DIE

569
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,987
I just did as I was told.

570
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,113
Mom.

571
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:27,782
Seon-mi.

572
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:36,249
Why would K do something so useless?

573
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:38,835
Who knows? She could just be pretending.

574
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,211
Maybe…

575
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,719
What's with your voice? Wait.

576
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,679
What's wrong with my voice?

577
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:55,226
-What's wrong?
-I think we inhaled helium.

578
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:58,730
Hold on.

579
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:00,273
I sound funny.

580
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:04,611
Doesn't it open?

581
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,198
Why won't this budge?

582
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:14,954
How about the windows?

583
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:20,460
Kyung-yi.

584
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:25,632
Ms. Na.

585
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,093
Ms. Na.

586
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,020
WOLMIDO LIGHTHOUSE ROAD

587
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:48,029
She was never going to make
Yoon Jae-yeong kill anyone.

588
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:52,325
They were warning me not to chase them
by hurting those around me.

589
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,038
She knows how to hurt me.

590
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,031
-That hurts.
-Are you okay, Ms. Na?

591
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:35,285
Yes. And I'm not deaf either.

592
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,370
Where are we? How long have we been here?

593
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:42,834
First, let's find a way
to get out of here.

594
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,544
Hold on.

595
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:48,673
-Gyeong-su, can you…
-Yes?

596
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,509
Can you pull on this?

597
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:54,220
Hold on, I have cramps.
I'll give it a try.

598
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,527
There's a phone.

599
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:11,905
A cell phone.

600
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,449
Where are we?

601
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,951
Here. I think this might open.

602
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,244
Okay. Push.

603
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,455
-One, two, three.
-…Two, three.

604
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,594
Where are we?

605
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,900
What is this place?

606
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:50,860
Where are we?

607
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,325
Ms. Na.

608
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:58,243
MS. KOO KYUNG-YI

609
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,369
You have a call.

610
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:03,790
Kyung-yi.

611
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,584
We're locked up somewhere.

612
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,295
The water is rising.

613
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,631
Where are you?

614
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,219
Je-hui!

615
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:25,979
Hurry!

616
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,233
That was cool.

617
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,110
Right?

618
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,696
Move aside.

619
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:37,323
Move aside. All right.

620
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:44,872
The bird that just brushed
past General MacArthur's nose

621
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,749
was the blue rock thrush.

622
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:49,502
"The blue rock thrush"?

623
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:50,962
Take a look.

624
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:00,305
Wait a minute! Three o'clock.

625
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:02,181
That's the grey-capped greenfinch.

626
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,934
Wait a minute! Eleven o'clock.

627
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,062
That's the warbling white-eye.

628
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,230
Wait a minute!

629
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,066
What is this sound?

630
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,284
Hold on!

631
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:23,870
It's the grey-headed woodpecker.

632
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,208
What's wrong? Dizzy?
Do you have a headache?

633
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,336
Goodness.

634
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:34,839
Anyway, I hope to see you
at our next gathering.

635
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:35,757
Okay?

636
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:37,717
All right.

637
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:49,687
PROTECT OUR BABIES

638
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,189
"Our babies"?

639
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:57,195
Where have you gone?

640
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:04,535
Yes, I know. Hooray for birds.

641
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,245
I'll see you there.

642
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,290
Excuse me.

643
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:11,793
What is it?

644
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,295
May I see what's in your hand?

645
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:15,505
What?

646
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,757
We received a tip-off.

647
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,133
It won't take long.

648
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:20,635
Here.

649
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:21,844
POLICE

650
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,772
You should come to the station with us.

651
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:35,525
What? Why all of a sudden?

652
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,573
That's not mine.

653
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:44,951
We can talk when we get there.

654
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,160
-It's not mine.
-I see.

655
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:48,413
-Some old guy gave it to me.
-Let's go first.

656
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,873
Some bird-crazy grandpa gave it to me!

657
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,166
-Okay.
-Where are you?

658
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,086
I don't do drugs.

659
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:57,630
-We can talk when we get there.
-Come on.

660
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,006
Gosh!

661
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:13,813
All done.

662
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:26,701
I think it's an abandoned container.

663
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:29,036
I see no windows, so maybe for freight.

664
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:32,290
She probably couldn't
have moved them that far.

665
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:34,083
They should be within a 30km radius.

666
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,669
It won't be hard to spot
a container that's by the sea.

667
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,129
You're at sea, right?

668
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:40,798
Yes. The water is salty.

669
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:49,807
Ms. Na, are we floating at sea?

670
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:51,934
It's the Yellow Sea.

671
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,312
The tide is rising.

672
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:55,855
Once it's the high tide, we'll…

673
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:59,984
Will we die in here once it fills up?

674
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:03,279
Have we got her location yet?

675
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:07,533
We have two hours until high tide.

676
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:11,245
I told you
that this was all a misunderstanding.

677
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,831
Can I go home yet?

678
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,666
You were caught red-handed.

679
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:18,127
Come on.

680
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,172
This is so unfair.

681
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:25,218
You got it all wrong.

682
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,470
Officer Kim, come here.

683
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:28,513
Yes, sir.

684
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,355
Can I go home?

685
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:39,315
Are you taking me home?

686
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:42,276
Let's go. Follow me.

687
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,612
-Goodbye, sir.
-Come on.

688
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:48,991
-Sir, I can't sleep in here.
-Okay.

689
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:50,910
-Sir, please let me go.
-Yes?

690
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,245
Sleep tight.

691
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:56,207
This is so not fair!

692
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:03,089
I'm going to miss out on all the fun.

693
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:08,427
Where the hell are they? Where?

694
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:13,933
Focus, will you?

695
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,227
Get it together! Focus!

696
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,107
What is she doing?

697
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,234
The battery is running low.

698
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,201
Ms. Na.

699
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:35,997
Ms. Na.

700
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:40,877
That was a trident goby.
They live in the estuary.

701
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,837
What does that mean?

702
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,922
Na Na loves fish.

703
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:51,304
-Hey.
-Kyung-yi, this isn't…

704
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:57,310
This isn't the sea.

705
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,228
It's not the sea?

706
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:04,275
What should we do now?

707
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:07,862
Stay sharp.
We're not going to die here.

708
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:11,198
Je-hui!

709
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:14,118
Na Je-hui!

710
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:49,153
Two people are locked inside
an abandoned container on a lake.

711
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:51,530
-The location is…
-Ms. Na is still down there!

712
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:52,531
What about Ms. Na?

713
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:55,242
We're wasting precious time right now.

714
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,954
She knew everything.
She approached me knowing everything.

715
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:03,209
That little girl has been killing people
based on what I told her.

716
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:05,127
Why are you still alive?

717
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:06,879
Kill him. It looks like he deserves it.

718
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,965
You can't? Then should I do it for you?
