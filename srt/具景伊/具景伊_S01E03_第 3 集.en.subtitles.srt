1
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,968
HE DESERVES TO DIE, SO KILL HIM

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,262
I KILLED HIM LIKE YOU SAID
BECAUSE HE DESERVED IT

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,430
KILL HIM!

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,348
SAVE HIM?

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,350
OVERLY SUSPICIOUS
EVIDENCE, HIKIKOMORI

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,518
I DO AS I PLEASE?

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,522
MY GOSH!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,067
CURIOUS?

9
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:26,985
THEY ALL DIED!

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,406
A HUSBAND-KILLER?
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE

11
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:32,323
SOMETHING IS FISHY

12
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,618
MUST WE ALL LIVE?

13
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,536
WE MUST

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,164
A NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN INSPECTOR

15
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,507
You and Mr. Jang are very different.

16
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,178
Just tell me what you know.

17
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,598
Were you and the janitor close?

18
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:04,355
Well, he worked at the school.
So I just said hello to him.

19
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:09,027
You know that he passed away
while staying in the hospital. Right?

20
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,780
Did any of your friends visit him there?

21
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,618
I don't think anyone knew
which hospital it was.

22
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,535
Why do you ask?

23
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,288
A high school student
visited him at the hospital.

24
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,290
I wondered if it was one of you.

25
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,631
That sounds suspicious. Who was that?

26
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,091
I was just checking.

27
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,220
Does it sound suspicious?

28
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,691
Was there anything unusual
on the last day of school?

29
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,068
Like someone suspicious.

30
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,655
No. I went home early.

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,370
Didn't the janitor pass away
because he drank too much?

32
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,746
Was there something else?

33
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,748
What makes you think that?

34
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,460
You make it sound like
there's something else.

35
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,046
So I wondered if someone poisoned him.

36
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,174
No. He passed away
from acute alcohol intoxication.

37
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,722
The students must have been very shocked.

38
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,475
Right. Some of them cried.

39
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,697
It was

40
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,116
a bit sad for me too.

41
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,829
He always said hello and smiled at us.

42
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,458
And he adored the cats too.

43
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,922
He's probably in a better place.

44
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,182
I hope so.

45
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,025
Now I understand why
Mr. Jang told me about you.

46
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,319
He did?

47
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,407
I don't want to admit it,
but we are similar…

48
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,079
you and I.

49
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,838
Why are you pretending not to know me?

50
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,927
Song Yi-kyung from the Drama Club
at Bongbaek Girls' High School.

51
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,762
I'm sure you recognized me right away.

52
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,228
You're Mr. Jang's wife! The lady cop!

53
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,520
Right?

54
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,397
Right?

55
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,157
You changed so much!

56
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,911
You've gotten even louder. Go away.

57
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,372
Why is she so rude to my niece?

58
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,083
Well…

59
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,670
I recently heard about Mr. Jang.

60
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,423
Had I known,
I would have attended his funeral.

61
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,725
I never thought
he'd do something like that.

62
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,480
But…

63
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,527
Mr. Jang must be in a better place, right?

64
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,199
Right?

65
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,423
Gosh. You're so chatty.

66
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,175
Just go. Go away.

67
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,234
EPISODE 3

68
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,779
This is enough to save our team, right?

69
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,531
For now.

70
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,619
I'll talk to Mr. Hyun.
Get ready to transfer to his team.

71
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,455
Pardon?

72
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,666
Team A will welcome you
if you bring them what we've done.

73
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,127
What? I don't want to.

74
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,047
This isn't about what you want.

75
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,382
This is about if I can trust you or not.

76
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,343
Na Je-hui, born in Incheon.

77
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,804
Your dad was a cop.
Your mom was a music teacher.

78
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,474
You're Catholic.
Your role models are Sir Alex Ferguson

79
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:53,394
and Ms. Koo Kyung-yi.
And your favorite dish is grilled bulgogi.

80
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,604
What are you doing?

81
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,815
Working with competent subordinates
is your work motto, isn't it?

82
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,068
Like me.

83
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,988
I'll stay on Team B.
I'm sure you'll find me useful.

84
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,284
Just for the time being then.

85
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,536
Because we're short-staffed.

86
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:15,750
Speaking of bulgogi, there's
a good bulgogi restaurant near here--

87
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,126
Sure. Enjoy your meal.

88
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,546
It's really tasty.

89
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,452
Sleep some more.

90
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,876
I should get you some herbal tonics.

91
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,087
You're always swamped with work.

92
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,717
Open up.

93
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:17,270
It's bitter. I don't like it.

94
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,522
You should learn to work with others.

95
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,983
Don't try to shoulder it alone.

96
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,242
Don't try so hard.

97
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,578
Stop.

98
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,872
You have colleagues,

99
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,249
and I'm here for you too.

100
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,169
I said, stop.

101
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,803
She really must be nuts.

102
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,059
Yi-kyung.

103
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,071
Awesome.

104
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,040
Dad.

105
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,793
Dad.

106
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,588
Dad.

107
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,342
Help me.

108
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,389
Help me, Ocean Warrior.

109
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,145
Help me.

110
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,731
Louder.

111
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,067
Help!

112
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,444
Ocean Warrior!

113
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,122
I'm alive. I'm back.

114
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:07,046
Thank you, Ocean Warrior. I love you!

115
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,174
All right.

116
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,010
Please let's have some food now.

117
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,554
Didn't you eat yet?

118
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,267
She said she wouldn't eat
without Mommy. What could I do?

119
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,477
You didn't eat, right?

120
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,524
That's it. You're done playing.

121
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,067
Go wash your hands. Let's eat.

122
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:35,866
-No. That's how you do it.
-What then?

123
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,369
When I flick my wand,

124
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:42,832
you have to say, "Thank you. I love you."

125
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,459
Okay.

126
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,670
Thank you.

127
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,338
I love you.

128
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,466
But I didn't do my chant.

129
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,844
Mom, you don't know anything.

130
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,097
-Grandpa!
-All right. My goodness.

131
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,603
Dad, do you want some money?

132
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,731
You're not supposed to ask me first.

133
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,319
Never mind. You're breaking your back
paying back the debt.

134
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,114
How much are we talking though?

135
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:16,907
Gosh.

136
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,827
PUREUN CHILDREN'S FOUNDATION

137
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,663
Why don't we look over there
and smile together?

138
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,000
Goodness. Good job. Over there too.

139
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,546
Good job. Why don't we look over there?

140
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,424
Good job.

141
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,884
Excuse me. Ma'am.

142
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,260
Mr. Kim.

143
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,805
I told her it wasn't a good time,
but she just…

144
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,853
It's fine.

145
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,272
It's all right. You're welcome.

146
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:52,985
Here.

147
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,447
Is it good?

148
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,492
It must be easy for you
since you're a mom.

149
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,329
I guess so.

150
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,457
We're working together now,

151
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,751
so I did some research.

152
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,881
Please invite me next time you go hiking.

153
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,217
I know a peanut tofu restaurant
on the way down.

154
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,969
Gosh. I see that
you did some research on me too.

155
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,474
So what brings you here?

156
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,479
I'd like to be the bridge
between you and Kyung-yi from now on.

157
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,064
What?

158
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:34,318
Does talking to you instead of Ms. Koo

159
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,570
make a huge difference?

160
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:40,282
I'm the team leader,
and Ms. Koo is a member of my team.

161
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,202
I've learned
a few things working at the company.

162
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,205
At the end of the day,
I'm the one who's responsible for my team.

163
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,790
I wanted to make that clear.

164
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,502
You must be ambitious, seeing how you're
setting up the chain of command.

165
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,296
You must be a midnight baby.

166
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,550
I knew you were something else
for hiring Ms. Koo

167
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,468
who isn't easy to handle.

168
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,890
All right.
I will go through you from now on.

169
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,934
Thank you, ma'am.

170
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,979
What else? Since you're here,
tell me everything on your mind.

171
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,690
If we succeed…

172
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,986
I noticed that you didn't mention
how much you'll pay us.

173
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,827
Sweetheart.

174
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,581
I feel like you're my own daughter,

175
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,499
so let me give you a piece of advice.

176
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,296
You're too young
to be chasing after money.

177
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,760
Are you planning to decide
how much you'll pay us after--

178
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,638
No. That's what scoundrels do.

179
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,309
Don't chase money. Chase power.

180
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:51,270
Then money is bound to follow.

181
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:56,317
Don't act so proud either.

182
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,152
You should know how to lower yourself.

183
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,946
Whether it's for money, people, or men.

184
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,823
I'm sorry.

185
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,952
That's how you get them.

186
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,418
Ma'am, can I say something?

187
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,296
Our team was able to
halve the loss to 600 million--

188
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,633
No. You may not.

189
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,761
You bragged about your performance,
but look at the loss.

190
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,305
You know that
a simple apology won't do, right?

191
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,765
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,517
So tell me.

193
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,477
Are you resigning?

194
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,287
If you give us one more chance,

195
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:54,041
we will do everything we can
to the best of our abilities.

196
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,794
As long as
you don't send us to the basement,

197
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,922
you will see us working our butts off.

198
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,840
That sounds great. Go to the basement.

199
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,302
Ma'am, please.

200
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:10,057
You can climb back up step by step
with better performance.

201
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,350
Doesn't that sound fun?

What is this?
Did you order food without me?

214
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,049
I can't have jjajangmyeon.
I'm on herbal tonics.

215
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,304
That was fast.

216
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,695
"Call me if there's anything you need."

217
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,751

00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,921
"Heart attack at a museum in Jeonju."

219
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,715
What's all this?

220
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,677
-Do they have anything to do with work?
-We'll be staying up all night.

221
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,347
Given the load,
shouldn't they form their own team?

222
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,765
They can't do that.

223
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,766
Why not?

224
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,935
Because I'm better.

225
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,187
Another delivery?

226
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,941
-You're from Namdaemun, right?
-Yes.

227
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,943
Bye.

228
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,323
It's real whiskey.

229
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,618
This isn't whiskey-flavored Baigan liquor.
It's real whiskey.

230
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,125
My gosh. Nice.

231
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,003
What's all this?
Can someone please explain?

232
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,931
Do you promise not to tell anyone
what I'm about to tell you now?

WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE
A SERIAL MURDER CASE THAT HAS NO SUSPECTS

236
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,570
THERE'S A SERIAL KILLER NAMED "K"

237
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,618
I knew this day would come.

238
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,954
A serial murder
without any evidence or a suspect.

239
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,124
I am pretty smart, yes.

240
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,711
Fine. I, Oh Gyeong-su,

241
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,173
will catch that serial killer.

242
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,300
Gyeong-su.

243
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,970
-Cut the gibberish and move these boxes.
-Okay.

244
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,270
What did you say?

245
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,315
-"Why is he even here?"
-"Why is he even here?"

246
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,205
By the way,

247
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,918
all these dead people
don't have anything in common.

248
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,547
They all died in different ways.

249
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,925
Even their age, sex,
and neighborhoods are all different.

250
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,845
Why do you think they died?

251
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,055
We're looking for the killer.

252
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,267
Don't think about why they are dead.
Think about why they were killed.

253
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,396
Since they lived
in different neighborhoods

254
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,606
and belonged to different communities,
and were of different sex,

255
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,859
it probably wasn't
about a personal grudge.

256
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,279
Since the murders were planned
over a long period of time,

257
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,614
they weren't murdered
in the heat of the moment.

258
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:22,161
Why was it them,
out of all the people in the world?

259
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,998
Maybe it was a professional killer.

260
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,887
Maybe the killer has an office
and accepts cases.

261
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,559
"I kill anyone for a price."

262
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:57,905
Or they might have targets
assigned to them like an assassin.

263
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,757
Or maybe there's a secret meeting

264
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,384
where they decide who to kill next.

265
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,510
RELIGIOUS CULT

266
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,108
That could be it.

267
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:42,241
There will be a meteor shower tonight

268
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,869
from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.

269
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:49,164
Park, who illegally leaked
a video of his girlfriend,

270
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,833
has been released after paying a fine.

271
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,919
-How is that possible?
-Court took the fact

272
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,047
-that he's a med student…
-People like him should be eradicated.

273
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,799
…into consideration for his sentencing.

274
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,926
-Since one of the victims took…
-He's awful.

275
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,678
…their own life,

276
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,347
a women's organization is arguing
that the punishment isn't severe enough

277
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,809
compared to the suffering
the victims are still going through.

278
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,394
The prosecution announced

279
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,896
that they would appeal
against the court's decision.

280
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,736
So he's a bad man.

281
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,592
BLOOD SAUSAGE SOUP

282
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,248

283
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,339
Aunt. I'll make your wish come true.

284
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,757
What's my wish?

285
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,634
Teaching those scumbags a lesson.

286
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,349
Do you want to be a cop this time?

287
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,020
You're so tiny.

288
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,107
Just be careful
and stay away from men like that.

289
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,194
I'm serious.

290
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,072
I'll protect you from now on.

291
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:52,079
My one and only aunt, Ms. Jung Jeong-yeon.

292
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,373
Okay. Fine.

293
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,250
Come on, hurry.

294
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,627
-Get the tickets.
-Okay.

295
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,253
-We're not late, right?
-No.

296
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,049
Everyone must be dead.

297
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,053
Medusa must have turned
everyone into stone.

298
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,766
Medusa is awake!

299
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,943
Open your eyes and face your hideous self.

300
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:31,159
"Open your eyes
and face your hideous self."

301
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:42,462
Today, I'm going to drink
some milk tea, my favorite beverage.

302
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,842
Isn't it beautiful?

303
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,511
How can I drink this? It's so pretty!

304
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:53,098
Despite that, I'll go ahead and try it.

306
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,027

308
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,910
-He's an asshole.
-This one?

309
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,872
I'll introduce you to the lawyer
who handled my case.

310
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,707
His uncle is a former prosecutor.

311
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,799
-Hello.
-Hello.

312
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,303
-I'm here to check the security system.
-Come on in.

313
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:39,227
Lately, routers have become
very vulnerable to malware.

314
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,146

-Okay.

Listen, Santa.

00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,061
This one might be it.
Write down everyone's name,

347
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,813
and then randomly draw a name.

348
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,064
If your name gets picked,

349
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,692
then you are it. You'll be killed.

350
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:56,943
Or…

351
00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:01,281
they could just draw a ball
like in a lottery draw,

352
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,366
then kill the person whose name shows up.

353
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,827

00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:27,724
Corporate card!

359
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,726
You startled me.

360
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,812
You won't be able to finish all of that.

361
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,608
We don't even have a fridge in our office.

362
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,402
They're on sale.

363
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,155
They are on sale.

364
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,657
I love discounts

365
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,785
I love corporate cards

366
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,286
I can buy anything

367
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:52,165
GRILLED DUMPLINGS

368
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,932
By the way,

369
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,351
I rarely say stuff like this.

370
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,145
Thank you.

371
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,440
I was really surprised.

372
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,779
I often thought that
there was no point in living.

373
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,531
But…

374
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,117
I'm starting to think that maybe

375
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,078
it wouldn't be

376
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,747
such a bad idea to keep living.

377
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,541
Is that important right now?

378
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,918
-What?
-Do your job right.

379
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,419
Why aren't you dodging them?

380
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,088
A way to ruin a touching moment.

381
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,257
That's not what's important right now.

382
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,050
Forget it and focus on our game.

383
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,885
We have to take over the base today.

384
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,929
-Go.
-Okay. Fine.

385
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,681
-Hurry. Go.
-Kill them all.

386
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,397
So is this the play this time?

IF YOU GET A VIDEO, I'LL BUY IT FOR 50

404
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,852

-Let's go drink.
-No.

414
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,554
-Hey. Will that be enough?
-You.

415
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,140
-That'll be fine. Look at this.
-Hey, you.

416
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,599
You're pretty smart.

417
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,526
Over there. The maid cafe.

418
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,570
We're selling draft beer.

Have some makgeolli.

-It was so funny.
-Hello, Clovees.

425
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,342
There's an announcement.

426
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,137
You all know that
good manners come first. Right?

427
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,430
-Yes.
-Yes.

428
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:20,266
The show begins at 7 p.m.
Our girls will go second.

429
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,477
I'll assign the club leaders
their seats first.

430
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,519
-Okay.
-Okay.

431
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,396
And after today's show,

if they aren't too tired,

433
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,818
we might be able to have
a mini fan meeting.

434
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:31,986
YOU LOOK PRETTIER TODAY

435
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,614
Root for them with your everything, okay?

436
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,990
-Yes!
-Yes!

437
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,784
Then let's get you seated.

438
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,077

-Hey.

443
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,538
Hello.

444
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,964
-Should I start here?
-Sure.

445
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:37,260
Gosh. I'm going out for a smoke.

446
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,513
Let's go smoke.

447
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,516
I'm good for now.

448
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,309
-Really?
-Go on without me.

449
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,103
Okay.

451
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:24,974
When do you get off?

452
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,060
Me? When does my shift end?

453
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,979
I'm on Unit Three for the night shift.

454
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,065
So I get off at around 9 p.m.

455
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,992
Didn't we agree
to speak casually at the gym that day?

456
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,410
Right.

457
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,745
Yes, we did.

458
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,580
We should.

459
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,957
Gosh.

460
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,461
I don't usually speak with honorifics.

461
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,261
How about a beer after work?

462
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,889
Or do you have to work out?

463
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,354
I don't see Han Yeong-ji here.
I thought you got an offer.

464
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,190
Right. I fully prepared for this.

465
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,650
THERE'S ANOTHER ME WITHIN MYSELF

466
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:19,362
The changing room here
must have crappy security, right?

467
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,575
Hey. You sure are smart
for stuff like this.

468
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,160
Gosh.

469
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,329
Come on.

470
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,539
I'm sorry. Oh, no.

471
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,709
If you are sorry,

472
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,632
shouldn't you
at least give us some freebies?

473
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,175
Sorry?

474
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:45,096
-Give us some freebies.
-Free food.

475
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,306
-Okay.
-Okay?

476
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,725
We ran out already?

477
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:53,688
Thanks.

478
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,566
Who was that?

479
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,576
It's on the house.

480
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,217
That's considerate of you.

481
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,561
There are so many pretty girls.

482
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,315
Come on. Stop it.

483
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,192
I rarely fall for a girl at first sight.

484
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,861
-But you're different.
-That punk.

485
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,612
Give me your number.

486
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,995
Throw it at someone you like!

487
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,379
What was that?

488
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,006
Come get some!

489
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,135
Come on then!

490
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,262
-Hey.
-I got you.

491
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,145
We love you!

492
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,608
Don't push.

493
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,736
FAIR-SKINNED GODDESS

494
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,136
What's wrong with him?

495
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,972
He shouldn't have drunk so much.

496
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,071
Over here!

497
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,256
"Open your eyes."

498
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,012
They're so pretty!

499
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,848
Over here!

500
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,186
Please delete…

501
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,731
the video you have of me.

502
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,779
Please delete it.

503
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:55,286
Answer me. If you don't, I'll stab you.

504
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,206
Answer me!

505
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,094
Why? Why did you do it?

506
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,597
How could you do something like that?

507
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,017
I asked you to delete it!

508
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,852
What?

509
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:21,729
-What's going on?
-What is it?

510
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,939
-What was that?
-I don't know.

511
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,859
-What's going on?
-What is it?

512
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:27,902
What the heck?

513
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,946
-Hey.
-What is she doing?

514
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,990
-What?
-What just happened?

515
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,116
What did she just do?

516
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,243
Somebody call the police!

517
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,871
-Help him!
-Get some help!

518
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,165
-The police…
-Help him.

519
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,501
-Where are the police?
-Is he okay?

520
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,670
-What happened?
-No way.

521
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:50,508
-I can't believe this.
-What's going on?

522
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,551
-What happened?
-Look.

523
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,178
What happened?

524
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,264
SAUNA

525
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,268
-Here.
-Thanks.

526
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,105
If you don't dry your hair,
you'll catch a cold.

527
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,151
I've never had anyone nagging me
about my health.

528
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,113
I wasn't nagging.

529
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:57,032
Do you think we have time for breakfast?

530
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,619
The loser of the race
is buying breakfast too, right?

531
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,205
What's that?

532
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,836
I DID IT

533
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,629
Damn it.

534
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:15,634
NT LIFE INSURANCE TOWER

535
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:34,695
I DID IT

536
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,836
-Going where?
-To see Park Gyu-il.

537
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,590
Isn't he the victim of the campus murder?

538
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,924
He died.

539
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,426
Ms. Na.

540
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,976
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BILLBOARD
ON GWANGHWAMUN? I DID IT

541
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,772
Why are you acting like a detective?
Just focus on our case.

542
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,149
I'm getting a feeling
that it has to do with…

543
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,109
Gosh. Why did he lock the doors?

544
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,819
You think K is behind that?

545
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,031
What took you so long?

546
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:21,116
To the autopsy room at Samhan Hospital.

547
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,661
They won't let you see the body
without permission.

548
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,621
Should I call them for you?

549
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:28,165
No. We should just keep it
to ourselves for now.

550
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,125
I think he might find a way.

551
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:35,881
What makes her so reckless?

552
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,926
This must be why she thinks K did it.

553
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,351
1. MURDERS DISGUISED AS ACCIDENTS,
NATURAL DEATHS, SUICIDES

554
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:50,312
2. BIG OR SMALL,
THE VICTIMS ALL DID SOMETHING WRONG

555
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:54,608
"People who wanted the victims dead
don't end up becoming suspects."

556
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,319
That's why she's going all the way there?

557
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,990
What's gotten into you? It's not like you.

558
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,160
Gosh. Don't be so dramatic.

559
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,121
You don't have to go that far.

560
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:11,083
You told the whole world that the girl
they arrested isn't the real culprit!

561
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:14,253
Why not just turn yourself in
if you want to rot in jail?

562
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:16,338
Do you think the police can't catch you?

563
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,006
That's right.

564
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,468
I doubt they'd even figure out
how I killed him.

565
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,432
Just leave them here!

566
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,267
These books are evidence now!

567
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,393
How so?

568
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,146
They aren't evidence.

569
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:36,150
They aren't DNA samples or murder weapons.
They're nothing.

570
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,529
Please use your brain.

571
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,118
Don't put us in danger.

572
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,245
If you keep this up,

573
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:51,123
I won't help you anymore. Got it?

574
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,085
Help me?

575
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,295
You?

576
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:57,963
You're helping me?

577
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,893
That's enough.

578
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,103
Don't test me.

579
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:15,856
Okay.

580
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,745
Come on!

581
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,458
Put them back now.

582
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,045
Gosh. You're so adorable.

583
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:41,798
AUTOPSY ROOM

584
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,015
-What the hell?
-I'm sorry.

585
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,730
The floor here is quite slippery,
isn't it?

586
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:58,941
He's clean.

587
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,531
Hey, stay focused.
I get that you're hungry, but…

588
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:08,700
You're right. He's clean.

589
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,078
Who are you?

590
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:12,996
I'm with the police.

591
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,709
I get that he was drunk and asleep,

592
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,671
but there aren't any defense wounds
on his arms or wrists.

593
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,091
Did they assign
another detective on the case?

594
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,551
Are you sure you're a cop?

595
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:27,970
What…

596
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,931
Don't come any closer!

597
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,560
A small girl held a knife against him.

598
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,605
And she was about to stab him!

599
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:43,402
Goodness. Do you have to act it out?

600
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,993
If he was even a bit conscious,

601
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:53,370
the girl would have been
easily overpowered.

602
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,831
She wouldn't have stabbed him once.

603
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,472
-Gosh.
-Is he a detective too?

604
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,765
So how many stab wounds?

605
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,976
I found six stab wounds, ma'am.

606
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:19,271
-Did you check him for drugs?
-I haven't gotten that far yet.

607
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,606
I'm sorry to interrupt.

608
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,191
But what's your name
and which station are you from?

609
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,278
What about you then? Who are you?

610
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,947
Me? I'm the medical examiner.

611
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:33,827
Then who is this man?

612
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,538
EVIDENCE

613
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,249
Don't move.

614
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,044
I found an important clue.
Don't move, everyone.

615
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,084
Hello.

616
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,126
2021 COLLEGE FESTIVAL

617
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:27,464
I lost my wallet
during the water balloon fight

618
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:30,217
at the festival.

619
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:34,763
Which department
was in charge of that activity?

620
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,057
I see.

621
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:41,603
The water balloon fight
wasn't a part of the program?

622
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,946
You're empty-handed. Is it not ready yet?

623
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:53,323
-They--
-Couldn't you steal the test results?

624
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,325
Why are you even on this team?

625
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,828
It was mostly atropine,
chlorphenamine and lidocaine.

626
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,080
Next was fluticasone furoate.

627
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,792
And they only found small traces of
nernizol, ilfrizom, and spiburon.

628
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,046
That was amazing.

629
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:12,342
-Are you sure?
-They wouldn't give me the test results.

630
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,844
So I memorized all of them.

631
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,556
I don't think they are poisonous.

632
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:21,351
When Kim Jong-nam died in Malaysia,

633
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:24,813
two women applied something on his face.

634
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,858
They were fine after touching it
with their bare hands,

635
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,526
but he died in ten minutes.

636
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:33,572
So the drugs are safe on their own,
but fatal when mixed.

637
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,832
Nernizol mixes well with oil.

638
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,429
Ilfrizom.

639
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:01,641
It floats at room temperature but
latches itself onto any mucous surfaces.

640
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,148
Throw it at someone you like!

641
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:15,530
As for spiburon, other than
its fishy smell, it's just like water.

642
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,830
They must have become poisonous
when they were mixed.

643
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,999
That won't be enough.

644
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:29,920
But if argentanium is added,
it will be fatal enough.

645
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:32,631
If used with anti-inflammatory drugs,
it leaves no trace.

646
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,927
He had the spray
for his nasal inflammation.

647
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,471
It was detected in the drug test too.

648
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:42,933
Seriously. You're only good
at memorizing things.

649
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:49,898
How did they get him to show up
exactly where they wanted him to be?

650
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:01,034
They had it all planned.

651
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,912
Over there. Show me that one.

652
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,877
This man. Follow this man.

653
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,714
I can't see his face.

654
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,508
Right here.

655
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,095
What's going on?

656
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,102
There he is.

657
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,734
Wait. The footage is missing again.

658
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,321
We saw him at the gate,
so he probably left.

659
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,116
Where is he?

660
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,997
Right there! Gosh,
I spotted him right away. Amazing.

661
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,002
"Sunshine Dormitory."

662
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,795
How do you know it's him?

663
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,423
He's wearing the same red sneakers.

664
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,677
Thanks for the cooperation.

665
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:05,515
By the way, some of the footage
is missing. Were they deleted?

666
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,227
Well, we have a lot of data in our system.

667
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:13,398
They sometimes come back after a while.

668
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:18,069
Okay. Have a good day then.

669
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,215
Don't move an inch!

670
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,134
If you come near, I'll shoot!

671
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:43,178
You're not a student there.
Why were you there?

672
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:45,639
I am free to go wherever I want.

673
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,599
I went because I wanted to. So what?

674
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,142
Should I get a warrant?

675
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:52,145
Should I call your parents
in your hometown first?

676
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:53,688
Tell me the truth.

677
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,191
Why did you bring the water balloons?

678
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,277
I just did because someone asked me

679
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,529
to bring them to the festival.

680
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,156
Who asked you?

681
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,742
How the heck would I know?

682
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:08,995
Then you must have received
something in return. How much was it?

683
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,040
No. I didn't receive anything.
I just helped.

684
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,626
You just helped?

685
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,504
Someone contacted me out of the blue.

686
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:20,173
And I expect you to help me out then.

687
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,645
Let's do it again.

688
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,946
Keep going. You're doing great.

689
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:51,621
Who is it? Who put you up to it?
I'm sure you know who it is.

690
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:55,375
You can't get a warrant anyway.
I only put the water balloons there.

691
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,669
A man died
because of those water balloons.

692
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,212
You are a suspect in a murder!

693
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:00,588
Nonsense!

694
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:03,008
I know that girl stabbed him.

695
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,217
Manager!

696
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,387
You know who we're talking about.
You just gave yourself away.

697
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,687
Get out of here.

698
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:18,898
What's going on?

699
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,526
You can't come in unless you live here.

700
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:24,320
-We just came to ask some questions.
-Stop bothering him.

701
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,031
He already suffered enough.

702
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,615
-It's not that.
-Get out.

703
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:30,285
-Okay. We're leaving.
-Get out of here now.

704
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:32,454
-Okay. We're leaving.
-Leave now.

705
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:33,872
Hurry.

706
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,505
He's just a pawn.
I doubt he knows who K is.

707
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,136
SUNSHINE DORMITORY

708
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:17,832
SUNSHINE DORMITORY

709
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,960
But he can lead us to K.

710
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:41,648
To catch the mother,
we must release the baby.

711
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,946
You're so old-fashioned.

712
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:54,077
We put pressure on him.
He'll go to his mommy.

713
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:07,549
Please tag your card first.

714
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,051
Put on a mask.

715
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,222
-Are you DC570?
-Yes.

716
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:20,770
As you can see, it works fine.
And there aren't any scratches.

717
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:31,781
Thank you.

718
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:33,741
Thank you.

719
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,703
Go after him.

720
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:55,096
SUNSHINE DORMITORY

721
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,318
SANTA: HE WENT BACK
TO HIS ROOM RIGHT AWAY

722
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,405
This doesn't make sense.

723
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,997
Yes. I just bought the camera.

724
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,540
Did you pack for our trip?

725
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,168
Yes. It's in good condition.

726
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:31,216
The silver button with our vlogs?

727
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:34,427
We might as well get the gold button.

728
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,732
The doors are opening.

729
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,276
Please mind the gap.

730
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:55,448
Please mind the gap.
The doors are closing now.

731
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,035
It's nothing.

732
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,455
There's some strange woman,
so I'll take the next one.

733
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,999
Hold on. I need
to send someone a photo first.

734
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,918
Someone asked me for a favor.

735
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:08,753
I'll call you later.

736
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:30,567
ANONYMOUS

737
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:36,072
She's not a cop.
She's just an insurance inspector.

738
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,786
He's handsome. Who is he?

739
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,249
Why are you hiding it from me?

740
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:47,417
What's his name?

741
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,043
-How old is he?
-Again.

742
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:50,336
There you go again.

743
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,255
Gosh. We came here to exercise,

744
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:54,799
but I get why
you've been on that thing the whole time.

745
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:57,468
Let me see him again.
Do you have any other photos?

746
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,178
We're not dating yet.

747
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,764
Goodness. "Dating"?

748
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,059
Then what are you two doing?

749
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,065
He's been chasing me around.

750
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,360
It must be so good to be young.

751
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,618
He's been begging me to go out with him.

752
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,703
I should get going.

753
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,079
What? Now?

754
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,623
-At this hour?
-Yes.

755
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,207
Wait. What about me?

756
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:33,755
Fine. Since I have no one to meet,
I'll just work out all by myself.

757
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:36,049
-Don't come home so late.
-Sure.

758
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,503
NT LIFE INSURANCE
JUNG JEONG-YEON, PLANNER

759
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:24,263
NT LIFE INSURANCE TOWER

760
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:30,061
Santa will bring you something
that might be an important clue.

761
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,271
I don't care what you do with it.

762
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,774
-Find out everything you can.
-Where are you?

763
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,151
I need to be somewhere.

764
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:38,528
FOR THE PUBLIC'S SAFETY AND HAPPINESS
INSEO POLICE

765
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,541
Hey. Wait.

766
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,668
What is it?

767
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:55,461
I'm her lawyer.

768
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,716
Even so. There are
set hours for visitations.

769
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,968
I am entitled to see my client by law.

770
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,511
Are you going to stop me?

771
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,682
Should I make a scene?

772
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,934
Go ahead. Make it quick.

773
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,650
The food got cold.

774
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:25,575
Please get us some food. Two servings.

775
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,584
Gosh. I need to drink soju with this.

776
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,462
Aren't you going to eat?

777
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,092
Then let me have some of your soup.

778
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:47,305
I added too much kkakdugi,
so it got a bit salty.

779
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,185
You're not a lawyer, right?

780
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,061
So you can talk.

781
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,105
Are you here to ask me why I did it?

782
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,858
No, and no.

783
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,072
I'm not a lawyer,

784
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:08,117
and I didn't come here
to ask you why you did it.

785
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,080
Instead of that,

786
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,750
I want to ask you something else.

787
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,585
Did someone offer to help you?

788
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:21,589
Did anyone offer you help
then ask for your help in return

789
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,633
or ask you to pay them back next time?

790
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,344
No one offered any help.

791
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,431
Then they didn't get to you yet.

792
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:31,724
What?

793
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,937
There is one person who helped you.

794
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,897
Someone is telling the whole world

795
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,399
that they killed Park Gyu-il, not you.

796
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:44,862
They're taking the risk of being caught
to clear your name.

797
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,113
But…

798
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:48,866
I stabbed him.

799
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,702
Do you know
how hard it is to kill someone?

800
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:54,539
Your hand is all busted.

801
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:57,625
It takes a lot of strength
to stab someone.

802
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,752
Especially for petite people like you.

803
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:03,047
The deepest wound you made on him
was 4.2cm-deep.

804
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,841
You missed the vital point.

805
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,260
Then…

806
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:10,263
Right. You didn't kill anyone.

807
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:12,932
You just stabbed a dead man.

808
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:20,398
In this case, you should hire a lawyer
to aggressively defend yourself

809
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:22,608
for attempted murder or damaging a corpse.

810
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:25,611
Tell everyone what kind of bastard he was

811
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,446
and that you didn't mean to kill him.

812
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:30,575
Say that you were physically
and mentally unstable.

813
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:33,536
You'll get out
before you get too old with some luck.

814
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,329
But…

815
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:37,707
I still stabbed him.

816
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:38,833
Right.

817
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,420
You'll have to live
with that for the rest of your life.

818
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,131
But you still didn't kill him.

819
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:51,470
Who was it then? The person who helped me.

820
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:52,889
A murderer

821
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,641
who only kills people that deserve it.

822
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:57,435
Are they bad then?

823
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,021
Or are they good?

824
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,774
Call me if that person
ever comes to you for help.

825
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,612
-Why would I?
-I need to catch them.

826
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,740
That person was the only one
who cared about me.

827
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,992
How could I betray them?

828
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:19,665
What would you have done?

829
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,292
What do you mean?

830
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:23,586
To kill without getting caught.

831
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:26,047
You're asking me that? A cop?

832
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,217
It's interesting to think about.

833
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:38,017
I would try to understand my target first.

834
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:40,603
What they eat and where they frequent.

835
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,732
And I would think
of the most fitting way to kill them

836
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:46,275
to disguise it as an accident.

837
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:51,739
You indeed are different.

838
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,075
And I wouldn't do it myself.

839
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:56,869
If I show myself,
I'll get caught eventually.

840
01:05:58,245 --> 01:05:59,538
Then how?

841
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:03,084
I'd find people who would never betray me,
and make them my accomplices.

842
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:08,798
People who'd never betray you?
Is that even possible?

843
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:13,094
No.

844
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:15,304
That's why I don't kill people.

845
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,099
Come on.

846
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,689
"People who would never betray me…"

847
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:40,848
We need to catch K without anyone dying.

848
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:42,892
I should do something about that woman.

849
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,643
You want there to be another victim.

850
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:48,105
You don't care if someone dies
as long as you have a lead on K.

851
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:51,275
This may sound cruel,
but it's Ms. Koo's fault.

852
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:53,194
What did he wish for again?
What do you wish for?

853
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:56,072
For you to answer me properly.

854
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:00,159
Do you know how desperately I prayed

855
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:04,371
that you wouldn't hurt anyone
by suspecting others again?

856
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:07,249
They were warning me not to chase them
by hurting those around me.

857
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:10,002
-No!
-They know how to hurt me.

858
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,754
That was cool.

859
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,923
Tell me where you are!

860
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:16,092
Na Je-hui!

861
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:20,721
We were duped.

862
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:11,582
