1
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,754
You know what it means
to give it to K, right?

2
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,298
It's like asking K to kill Heo Hyeon-tae.

3
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,050
If K watches the rest of the video,

4
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,179
will she try to kill them all?

5
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,723
Don't say such a scary thing.

6
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,643
I'd appreciate it if she killed them.

7
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,501
Here's the "Koo Kyung-yi Special"
you ordered.

8
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,546
There you go.

9
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,509
What would you like to eat first?

10
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,678
It's hard to decide.

11
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:40,517
Stop thinking. This one first, of course.

12
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,902
We took the train so we could rest.
Why do you look so upset?

13
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,323
I could hear you racking your brain
from way over there.

14
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,575
I can't help it.

15
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,578
I used to wonder
what was going on in your mind.

16
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,539
But I now know I don't have to do that.

17
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,791
If I just do as you say

18
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,960
everything turns out okay.

19
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,296
Are you telling me
to stop being so suspicious?

20
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,841
No. I'm telling you to have an egg.

21
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,095
K is just like you.

22
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,639
But she's still young

23
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,850
and is alone.

24
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,441
EPISODE 11

25
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,861
Are you okay?

26
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,697
CHEONLIM PARK SERVICE

27
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,032
Don't look down. Look up ahead.

28
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,993
Okay.

29
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,541
Are you okay?

30
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,544
Thank you for your help.

31
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,922
You must be worried a lot
about the election.

32
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,841
Right?

33
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,720
You saw me fall. I'm embarrassed.

34
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,891
I tripped over while I was thinking
about the welfare of our citizens.

35
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,061
It really is you! Unbelievable!

36
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,355
Right now you have
the highest approval rating.

37
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,443
Yes. You're very interested in politics
for a young woman.

38
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,986
The future looks bright.

39
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,114
No, I know nothing about politics.

40
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:21,326
But I know you because you're so popular,
Mr. Heo Hyeon-tae.

41
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,662
-It's Heo Seong-tae.
-This is so cool.

42
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,666
How's your handsome brother doing?

43
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,752
Does he have…

44
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,254
Maybe I shouldn't ask this.

45
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,174
-Hyeon-tae doesn't have a girlfriend.
-Really?

46
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,968
He's totally my type. Where is he?

47
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,596
Pardon?

48
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,266
Where is Hyeon-tae now?

49
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:04,202
-The person you have reached…
-Where's this bastard Kim?

50
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,333
He's probably home.

51
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,211
He wasn't.

52
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,800
Who are you?

53
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,178
He's the type I need to kill.

54
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,557
A lot of people tell me
that he doesn't deserve to live

55
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,102
and that I should kill him first.

56
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,396
My ears are about to bleed.

57
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,317
You told them not to let anyone in.

58
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,069
Anyone?

59
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,781
Is anyone here? Help!

60
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,658
Anyone?

61
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,451
Help--

62
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,706
You're always worried about
your brother ruining your career.

63
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,292
If Hyeon-tae dies now…

64
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,006
"The mayoral candidate
who lost his younger brother."

65
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,509
That's really heartbreaking.

66
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,886
You'll be elected for sure.

67
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,642
I won't have to worry
about that bastard making trouble anymore.

68
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,857
There's no answer.

69
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,151
Go inside and check, idiot.

70
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,986
Can I do that?

71
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,487
Check inside.

72
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,578
I finally found him.

73
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,585
Hyeon-tae, we need to go.

74
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,893
Why doesn't she just shave my head
and make me a monk?

75
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,729
Why is she on my case all the time?

76
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,190
My feet hurt.

77
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,900
I can't believe I have to--

78
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,239
Hyeon-tae.

79
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,700
Heo Hyeon-tae!

80
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,453
Heo Hyeon-tae!

81
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,248
Heo Hyeon-tae!

82
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,958
What? Did he run away?

83
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,300
Who are you?

84
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:25,885
Did my mom send you?

85
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,056
You're terribly lucky.

86
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,101
Get in. A killer is after you.

87
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,688
EXPENSIVE GALBI
PRIVATE PARKING

88
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,576
You're late.

89
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,828
Where is he?

90
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,997
I'm sorry we finished
all the meat without you.

91
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,709
Your son hasn't eaten yet,
so you two can eat together.

92
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,461
Where is he?

93
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,432
Mom.

94
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,642
Mom.

95
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,311
He was a handful.

96
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,313
You understand, right?

97
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,361
Mom.

98
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,362
Mom!

99
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,658
I should…

100
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,121
thank you, shouldn't I?

101
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,419
I'll make it worth your while
for saving his life.

102
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,296
What about the next time?

103
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:52,221
You know K. She'll never give up.

104
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,850
You startled me.
Are you a ghost or a person?

105
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,937
You're awfully lucky.
I do have a keen eye for people.

106
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,442
That's enough chitchat.

107
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,860
What now?

108
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,237
What will you do?

109
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,366
I'll take care of my family business.

110
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,039
There's only one way for you

111
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,875
to keep your precious son alive.

112
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,419
I guess you don't know.

113
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,005
Hiding him away won't work.

114
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,048
What?

115
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,676
Are you telling me
to turn myself in with my son?

116
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,304
Bingo.

117
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,560
I'm here, Ms. Yong!

118
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,522
Don't believe a word she says.

119
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,065
How is she…

120
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,485
I knew it. I knew it already.

121
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,029
Hyeon-tae. Where is he?

122
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,280
-Hyeon-tae.
-Enough.

123
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,159
Thanks for saving him from K.

124
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:59,121
But you aren't interested in us.
You just want to outsmart her.

125
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,043
So I won't thank you too much.

126
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,422
I told you the solution.

127
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,219
Mr. Kim. Take care of him.
Can I count on you to do that?

128
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,679
Pardon?

129
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,974
Oh, my goodness!

130
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,767
Goodness.

131
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,940
How did you… Hey, get out of there.

132
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,318
Come on now. Hey.

133
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,488
Hey.

134
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,081
You're so naive.

135
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:46,836
They have too much to lose.
Did you think they'd turn themselves in?

136
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,382
They'll cover it up somehow
and live like nothing happened.

137
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,471
Is it right to let people like them live?

138
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,016
How far did you get?

139
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,687
I've identified them all.

140
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,566
PERSONAL INFORMATION

141
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,585
Did you eat galbi?

142
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,964
Galbi?

143
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,762
We were working so hard in here
eating cup noodles.

144
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,847
That looks delicious.

145
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,689
You're right.
They won't turn themselves in.

146
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:54,445
She'll make a safe house or a bunker
or even an underground tunnel to hide him.

147
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,697
I doubt that will stop K.

148
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,115
If I were K,

149
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,787
I'd do anything to find the person
I want to kill the most.

150
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,665
If I were K…

151
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,461
K RAMYEON

152
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,796
Ramyeon?

153
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,009
Ramyeon.

154
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,804
But you've had galbi.

155
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:23,516
I did. Let me have a sip.

156
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,525
That was good. It washed down the grease.

157
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,365
If I were K…

158
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,039
If I were K,

159
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,291
I wouldn't

160
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,044
bother to look for someone who is hiding.

161
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,339
I'd find a way to lure him out.

162
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:58,843
No.

163
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:02,888
If you touch it, the fish will swim away.

164
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,515
What should I do then?

165
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,059
You should give it something to eat.

166
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,187
You have to lure them with food

167
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,398
or pick up a big rock

168
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:17,361
and throw it in the water.

169
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,573
The fish will be shocked
and jump out of its house.

170
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,032
Grandpa.

171
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,910
-I'm sorry.
-What are you teaching her?

172
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,497
But that's what we did when we were young.

173
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,291
Is your daughter still so busy?

174
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,751
Of course she is.

175
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,341
You'll vote for Heo Seong-tae, right?

176
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,137
If you vote for anybody else, I'll just--

177
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,432
It's Mr. Heo Seong-tae.

178
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,143
-What?
-Breaking news. The video titled

179
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,644
"H's Crime Exposed"

180
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,689
allegedly contains
the criminal behavior of a public figure.

181
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,275
-The video has 300 thousand views
-The screen's too small.

182
00:12:56,358 --> 00:13:01,071
-Turn up the volume.
-and is spreading rapidly online.

183
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,116
The video shows a man
who appears to be Heo Hyeon-tae,

184
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,620
Heo Seong-tae's younger brother,
inhaling illicit drugs.

185
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:11,123
Suspicions have been raised
that he virtually committed murder

186
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:15,294
refusing to rescue him as he was drowning.

187
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:19,256
What? What on earth is going on?

188
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,927
-What do they call it? Bencio?
-No,

189
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,139
-It's "bendición." It means blessing.
-Okay.

190
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,436
A man is dying,

191
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,105
but I love how you're all frozen

192
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,441
because of what I said.

193
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,151
Because of what I said.

194
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:46,033
This file is solid proof that this voice
does not belong to Mr. Heo Hyeon-tae.

195
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,618
-Is that so?
-Yes.

196
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,664
I'm Heo Hyeon-tae, the ambassador
of Pureun Children's Foundation.

197
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,208
It has a different shape.

198
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,545
Therefore, this video has been fabricated.

199
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,798
I'm sure of it
as a sound engineering expert.

200
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,591
I see. Thank you.

201
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,346
You shouldn't be so sure
of anything that easily.

202
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,559
Good work. Thank you.

203
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,996
Hey.

204
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,748
What about the 8 and 9 o'clock news?

205
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,334
I talked to the panels Mr. Kim
and Assemblyman Son.

206
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,295
What about the radio tomorrow morning?

207
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,464
We need that show on our side
to have the whole day going for us.

208
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,258
They will stick up for us.

209
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,509
Okay.

210
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,555
Why do you look so tired?

211
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,182
You need to look good at a time like this.

212
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,518
Book an appointment
for a massage tomorrow.

213
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,811
Mother.

214
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,646
Yes, tell me.

215
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,816
Where is Hyeon-tae?

216
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,528
I killed that jerk,
so don't worry about him.

217
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,487
No.

218
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,032
I want to kill him.

219
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,495
You must be very stressed out.

220
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,436
Mother.

221
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,527
No matter what it takes,

222
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,989
I promise I'll set things right

223
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,576
even if I have to swallow my pride.

224
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,329
Seong-tae, my son.

225
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,499
You will not be wronged.

226
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,752
Deepfake is a serious societal problem
in the United States.

227
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,713
Such fabrications
promote distrust among the populous.

228
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,173
Bullshit.

229
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,217
It's obviously Rabbit.

230
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,885
The reflection in the video

231
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,222
exactly matches the features
of Heo Hyeon-tae.

232
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,599
Meanwhile, CAM TV

233
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,768
received a tip-off that Hyeon-tae,

234
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:21,689
who is said to be in the States,
is actually hiding somewhere in Korea.

235
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,773
What is this?

236
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:26,819
It's a jolt, a shock, and chaos.

237
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,948
The whole country
is looking for him at the moment.

238
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:34,618
Heo Hyeon-tae.
Where could he be right now?

239
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,745
A bastard like that deserves to die.

240
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,398
Who is it?

241
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,614
Who are you?

242
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,287
You're no match for me.

243
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,638
What's this?

244
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,893
Yes.

245
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,228
There's hair in my--

246
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,272
Today,

247
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,943
I will kill you.

248
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,653
What?

249
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,908
Today's menu will be abalone porridge.

250
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,869
Are you okay with--

251
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,079
It's hot.

252
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:11,799
Being locked up in this dump
must be driving me insane.

253
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,135
What did I ever do?

254
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,435
The citizens firmly believe in me
and love me

255
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:29,149
despite these ridiculous slanders
and manipulations,

256
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,361
so I, Heo Seong-tae,
will take a big step--

257
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,529
-What?
-What's that?

258
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,905
Remember Lee Jun-hyeon!

259
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,740
Let go!

260
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,492
-Remember Lee Jun-hyeon!
-Yes.

261
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,870
I'm okay.
The elephant does not feel a fleabite.

262
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,497
Remember Lee Jun-hyeon!

263
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,124
I, Heo Seong-tae,

264
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,835
will keep walking my path!

265
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,653
Assemblyman Park says

266
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,573
that he can't make it today.

267
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,182
I should swallow my pride.

268
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,058
Right?

269
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,874
You're here.

270
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,083
What do you want?

271
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,711
I can tell when people need something,

272
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,380
but I just can't tell with you.

273
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,264
That felt great.

274
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,853
I feel like I'm the king of the world.

275
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,777
What I need is…

276
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,573
No, my teeth will ache.

277
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:46,203
You must have something
since you're acting so arrogant.

278
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,375
You don't have anyone else to turn to.

279
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,711
You came to me because you don't.

280
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,426
I hate to admit it

281
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,637
but you're right.

282
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,982
I don't want anything else.

283
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,405
Don't let him die.

284
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:27,202
But I don't have the "power" to do that,

285
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,829
so I can't guarantee you anything.

286
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,999
I do have a plan,

287
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,294
but I'm not sure if I can pull it off.

288
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:39,965
Besides, it's something that's
never going to work if you doubt me.

289
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,309
I'll do as you say.

290
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,984
This isn't as easy as it looks
because of my knees.

291
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,485
Get up.

292
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,280
You're making me uncomfortable.

293
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,457
How obedient.

294
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:23,383
Stop doubting me from now on
and do exactly as I say.

295
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,313
She must be crazy.

296
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,566
She's so funny.

297
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,443
I'm sorry.

298
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,280
I think it's you who's crazy.

299
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,117
Impressive.

300
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,788
You've changed a lot since I last saw you.

301
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,540
Why are you here?

302
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,792
I know.

303
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,920
You missed my pretty face so much.

304
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,925
So how are you going to do this?

305
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,103
Why did you get so brave?

306
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,774
We'll kill everyone
so there's nothing to be afraid of.

307
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:24,486
Seeing you be so audaciously
made me brave.

308
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,405
Did you think that was me?

309
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,284
That's amazing.

310
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,547
It wasn't me who released the video.

311
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,423
Then who did?

312
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,845
She must have thought he'd be safer
if more eyes were on him.

313
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,182
Who else would be crazy enough
to do such a thing?

314
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:03,316
SAMSY, IT'S AN EXCLUSIVE

315
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,362
ARE YOU A SUBSCRIBER?

316
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,702
LET'S BUILD A HOPEFUL FUTURE
HEO SEONG-TAE

317
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,876
That woman is nuts.

318
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:31,928
Are you drinking again?

319
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,639
That's not important right now.

320
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,058
Did you know about this?

321
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,769
Know what?
That Heo Hyeon-tae deserves to die?

322
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,479
You obviously didn't.

323
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:46,318
The video of Heo Hyeon-tae's yacht trip
wasn't the only thing in here.

324
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,237
There were other files.
They were deleted recently.

325
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,120
Unbelievable. I knew something was off.

326
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:01,583
Of course, Ko Dam had
more than just Hyeon-tae's video.

327
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:06,421
Did Ms. Koo delete them
because she was worried I'd do something?

328
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,590
I can't believe her.

329
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:12,135
I can't restore them here.
That cop lady must have them.

330
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,182
Let's find and kill them all.

331
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,017
Those bastards don't deserve to live.

332
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,605
You used to sound
like a coward all the time.

333
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,274
Now you're talking.

334
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,027
Where is that woman right now?

335
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,154
Forget about Ms. Koo.

336
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:35,242
We'll go after the person

337
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,371
who may like me the most.

00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,355
You were impressive, Mr. Kwak.

343
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,150
Do you know what "the real truth" is?

344
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,527
Truth is--

345
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,820
The pizza's here.

346
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,082
By the way, why are you serving us?

347
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,253
Because I feel like I should be.

348
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,297
It feels as if I made it.

349
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,174
Did you make this? It's delicious.

350
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,843
No, I didn't.

351
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:36,803
Eat up.

352
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,994
I'm going to have these next.

353
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,371
They're mine. Don't touch them.

354
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,339
Everything turned out the way you wanted.

355
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,382
Director Yong gave in,

356
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,884
Heo Seong-tae's been ruined,

357
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,221
and Heo Hyeon-tae isn't dead.

358
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,226
You're amazing.

359
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,522
Shouldn't we have let him die, though?

360
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,067
We can lure K using the others.

361
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,404
I can't stop feeling
like we're fighting for the bad guys.

362
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,326
I'll get back to the office.

363
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,660
Gyeong-su.

364
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,746
Yes.

365
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,879
Your fly is open.

366
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,929
-Don't lie to me.
-I must say

367
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,224
the color of your underwear
goes perfectly with your character.

368
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:07,769
It shows that you're
burning with passion inside.

369
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,397
It's not open.

370
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,285
Get a hold of yourself, Gyeong-su.

371
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,375
A startup disk…

372
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,506
Wait.

373
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,300
TAKE A PEEP AT THESE HOT BODIES
SUBWAY BATHROOM CREEPSHOP

374
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,468
"Creepshop."

375
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,264
I'm sure it's "creepshot."

376
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,480
"There are more jerks to kill."

377
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,900
"Give them to me, I'll kill them."

378
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:06,578
"Rendezvous in the 3rd compartment
of the men's restroom on the 7th floor."

379
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,455
K?

380
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,273
Don't be mistaken. I'm not on your side.

381
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:38,735
I'm giving this to you
only because I want to kill them.

382
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,238
I'll catch you next time I see you.

383
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,324
I'll catch you…

384
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,746
Here we go!

385
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,881
Why are you so serious, Gyeong-su?

386
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,216
Mr. Jung?

387
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,554
Thanks to you,
I was able to focus on my sphincter.

388
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,766
Great.

389
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,853
That was great.

390
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,362
Gyeong-su.

391
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,824
You don't seem to be
performing well these days.

392
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,451
You can come and talk to me anytime.

393
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,953
And enjoy pooping.

394
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:31,788
Okay.

395
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,676
Was I mistaken?

396
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,263
Have I gone mad
like Ms. Koo because I've been thinking--

397
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,639
You got it right.

398
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,689
You…

399
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,276
Don't be mistaken. I'm not on your side.

400
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,113
Okay. I won't and I'll kill them for you.

401
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:19,002
These people are pure evil.

402
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,170
I'm sure that's why Ko Dam kept it.

403
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,506
He could've used it to blackmail
or to make news.

404
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,342
I'll catch you next time I--

405
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:30,305
Yes. Please do. Now give it to me.

406
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,396
Ms. Koo will bawl her eyes out
if she finds out about this.

407
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,815
I'll catch you before that happens.

408
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:43,943
You--

409
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,490
CRIMINAL DIVISION 1 PROSECUTOR
KIM HWAN-HUI

410
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,368
Hello.

411
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,982
Are you kidding me?

412
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,324
What's this?

413
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:42,085
EYE EXAM ROOM

414
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,801
Can you try these on?

415
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:50,760
Okay.

416
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,275
What's this?

417
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,458
Paul. Come here.

418
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,711
Let it go. It's dirty.

419
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,629
It's dirty. Let go of it.

420
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,047
What…

421
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,726
What's this?

422
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,190
Be quiet!

423
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,835
-What are you doing?
-It's nothing.

424
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,732
You seem really busy.

425
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,485
By the way, you look more suspicious
dressed like that.

426
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,695
Why did you come here?

427
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,615
Because you have something to say to me.

428
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,206
PUREUN CHILDREN'S FOUNDATION

429
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,123
Give it to me.

430
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,501
PLANTING TREES FOR CHILDREN, OUR FUTURE

431
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,002
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

432
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,880
Trees…

433
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,841
always…

434
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,887
remain in their place no matter what.

435
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,932
Whether it snows

436
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,309
or rains.

437
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:07,188
Whether the wind blows

438
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,067
I miss the past thirty years--

439
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,736
Get lost before I bury you with the trees.

440
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,994
Ms. Yong, don't just plant trees

441
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,163
and please give us a word
about the situation.

442
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,675
Regardless of whether

443
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,095
the accusations are true or not,

444
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,932
I'd like to make a public apology

445
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,603
for the disturbance my son caused

446
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,898
as his parent.

447
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,317
I am sorry.

448
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:56,946
Take pictures.

449
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,869
I firmly believe it will soon be revealed

450
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,414
whether the accusations are true or not.

451
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,209
And Hyeon-tae is

452
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,379
not able to return to Korea at the moment

453
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:18,259
due to business matters involving
national interests.

454
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,553
So please

455
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,724
be understanding.

456
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:30,855
You murderers!

457
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,524
-Ms. Yong!
-Ms. Yong!

458
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:37,028
-Ms. Yong!
-Ms. Yong!

459
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,908
Ms. Yong!

460
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,492
Ms. Yong!

461
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,256
Don't you think you're crossing the line?

462
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,258
Are going to commemorate this moment?

463
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,970
That would just be meaningless.

464
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,681
All right.

465
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,059
Schedule a press conference for Rabbit.

466
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,439
Do as she says.

467
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,983
Okay?

468
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:22,823
Who is it?

469
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,456
Who is it?

470
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,094
Ms. Won?

471
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,012
Ms. Won.

472
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:45,930
Hey.

473
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,723
Ms. Won…

474
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,519
"It's extremely easy to
frame an innocent person

475
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,104
using the latest technology."

476
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:58,359
"My mother is going through so much
because of this lie."

477
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,320
"I'm at a loss for words."

478
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,782
This is waterproof, right?

479
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,492
Of course.

480
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,289
Will they throw things at me?

481
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,000
You know how much they love you.

482
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,585
We'll have experienced security,

483
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,922
and the place will be filled
with fans of yours.

484
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,799
So don't worry.

485
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:28,639
But if it seems too choreographed,
it'll be embarrassing.

486
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,475
Hold on.

487
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,980
It could be Director Yong.

488
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,190
YOUR FAMILY IS TRYING TO KILL YOU.
PREPARE 1 BILLION IN CASH TO STOP THEM.

489
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,569
Man, this is such a lame phishing scam.

490
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:46,824
"Your family is trying to kill you.
Prepare 1 billion in cash to stop them."

491
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,828
Always the same old trick.

492
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,747
Can you believe this?

493
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,374
Give me that.

494
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,293
It's my phone.

495
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:12,641
I won't have to worry
about that bastard making trouble anymore.

496
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,810
Is that Mr. Heo?

497
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,521
That's right. If he dies,

498
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:21,400
my mother and I will be better off,
and the world will be too.

499
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,860
Kill him.

500
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,196
Please kill him.

501
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,783
They put a lot of effort
into this phishing scam,

502
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,368
right?

503
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,162
You talk too much.

504
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,706
Leave me.

505
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,048
You heard it,
so you must know that it's not fake.

506
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,633
Just like that video of yours.

507
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,926
NO TERRIBLE ACTING

508
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,761
Does my mom know about this?

509
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,847
Ask her yourself, moron.

510
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,266
NO CURSING

511
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,314
Your brother isn't the only one
who wants to kill you.

512
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,359
I can't prepare
a billion in cash overnight.

513
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,028
-Then die.
-Five hundred million first.

514
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,697
I'll give you the rest
when I'm perfectly safe.

515
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,033
You know what "perfectly safe" means,

516
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,119
right?

517
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,663
I'll take care of everyone
who wants to kill you.

518
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,124
But can you do as I say?

519
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,417
I'll do anything.

520
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:24,713
But if you don't do your job right,
I'll kill you.

521
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,263
"I'll do anything."

522
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:36,475
"But if you don't do your job right,
I'll kill you."

523
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,853
You're so good!

524
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,820
I really want to kill them.

525
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,323
The brothers are dying to kill each other.

526
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,742
A billion won is quite a lot of money.

527
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,161
Isn't it a shame?

528
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:59,081
With a couple of billion won,
you can start a new life.

529
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:04,503
I'd go to a cottage in southern Spain

530
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,173
with my lover…

531
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,425
Why Spain?

532
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,472
Don't you know? I'm Cassandra.

533
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,475
Hola. Gracias.

534
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:21,562
Right. You have a way out then.

535
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,022
Having second thoughts?

536
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,273
No.

537
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,359
We were supposed
to kill Heo Hyeon-tae anyway.

538
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:28,819
What about you?

539
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,490
Do you think
I'd let a bastard like him off?

540
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,867
This is different from Ko Dam.

541
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,995
Because K actually wanted to kill Ko Dam.

542
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,706
But she wants to kill Heo Hyeon-tae too.

543
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,167
She doesn't want
those bastards to rest in peace.

544
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,503
That's why she kept me alive.

545
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,631
To kill or not to kill,
that is the question.

546
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,216
Hamlet?

547
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:54,637
What's more painful than going to hell
is to be in a living hell.

548
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,764
That's exactly what she's doing.

549
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,557
What will K do?

550
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:04,355
When Heo Hyeon-tae shows himself,
she will put him through living hell.

551
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,612
PRESS CONFERENCE
ON DEEPFAKE ALLEGATIONS

552
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,680
Did you know about this?

553
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,730
I won't have to worry
about that bastard making trouble anymore.

554
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,234
That's right. If he dies,

555
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:54,196
my mother and I will be better off,
and the world will be too.

556
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:55,948
Kill him.

557
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,284
Please kill him.

558
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,912
To help Seong-tae
with his political career,

559
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,665
you made me act like a perfect son.

560
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,709
Now you want me to die?

561
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,003
By the way, I think it's for the better

562
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,797
that the video was brought to light.

563
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,801
Because I was sick of smiling and making
finger hearts when I didn't mean it.

564
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,430
Mom.

565
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,601
This will be the last time
I do as you say.

566
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,687
I'll leave the country
after the press conference

567
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,523
and I'll do whatever I want overseas.

568
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:40,826
What?

569
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,494
Why isn't it working?

570
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,047
What the hell?

571
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,883
Is it because the road's unpaved?

572
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,469
"Is it because the road's unpaved?"

573
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:02,931
Should I shoot you?

574
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,943
Can I have your attention, please?

575
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,405
Due to Mr. Heo's flight
from the US being delayed,

576
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,075
we will begin the press conference
a little later than scheduled.

577
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,702
-What?
-What's going on?

578
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,037
-What do you mean?
-Come on.

579
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,622
-Are you kidding?
-Delayed?

580
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,874
-What?
-Come on.

581
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,126
I have a bad feeling about this.

582
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,940
WE BELIEVE IN HEO HYEON-TAE!

583
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,526
RABBIT WILL REVEAL THE TRUTH

584
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,589
Unbelievable.

585
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,135
You're even carrying a gun?

586
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:31,979
Freeze.

587
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,565
This is a real gun.

588
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,366
If you get in quietly,
I won't kill you now.

589
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,161
Later?

590
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,122
Later…

591
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,332
I'll think about it.

592
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,151
-What?
-We love you Hyeon-tae!

593
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:22,446
-It's Hyeon-tae!
-Hyeon-tae!

594
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,406
-Hyeon-tae!
-Hyeon-tae!

595
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,326
-Hyeon-tae!
-I believe you!

596
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,244
-Hyeon-tae!
-Hyeon-tae!

597
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,288
-Hyeon-tae!
-We know you're innocent!

598
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,540
-Hyeon-tae!
-I can't bear to watch.

599
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,791
-Hyeon-tae!
-Hyeon-tae!

600
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,169
Is that it for Hyeon-tae?

601
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,922
What? No way.

602
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,798
It's only the beginning.

603
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,435
Make yourself at home and lie down.

604
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,737
PRESS CONFERENCE
ON DEEPFAKE ALLEGATIONS

605
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,072
WE BELIEVE IN HEO HYEON-TAE

606
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:09,785
First of all, I regret
to have caused public concern.

607
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,204
Hey! You should apologize!

608
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,457
-What?
-Who is that?

609
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,170
How is it?

610
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,339
I apologize…

611
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,883
I regret it.

612
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:29,221
I can no longer tolerate

613
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:32,349
-the ballooning lies…
-Apologize!

614
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:33,642
-Let go of me.
-Let's go.

615
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:36,520
-Rabbit, how can you do this to me?
-Come on out.

616
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,647
-What's going on?
-Please make way.

617
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,190
-Hyeon-tae!
-Move.

618
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,025
Take care of her.

619
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,571
Hyeon-tae! That is no way to treat a lady!

620
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,239
-Hyeon-tae! Keep talking.
-Move.

621
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,657
-It's okay.
-Move back.

622
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,159
-Hyeon-tae!
-Please move.

623
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,078
-Hyeon-tae!
-Hyeon-tae!

624
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:56,039
-Let me go! Don't touch me!
-Please move out of the way.

625
00:47:57,082 --> 00:48:00,502
Framing an innocent person
using the latest technology--

626
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,337
-"Innocent"?
-He's innocent!

627
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,422
Leave Hyeon-tae alone!

628
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:04,715
This way, please.

629
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,802
-Heo Hyeon-tae!
-Get her.

630
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,453
Goodness.

631
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:41,877
Without realizing it

632
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,173
I'm scared
Please stick close to me

633
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:51,637
Let's start from the beginning together

634
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,014
Our time

635
00:48:54,848 --> 00:49:00,646
I'll trust you

636
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:15,202
A particularly bad person like you
shouldn't be killed like anyone else.

637
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,746
So I'm going to experiment.

638
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:25,212
The trip must have tired you out
since you're old.

639
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:39,017
Your eyelids have melted.

640
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,311
But you can still see, right?

641
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:44,815
Right? Good.

642
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:49,611
Ko Dam worked really hard.
There are a lot of great scenes.

643
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:57,411
There are eyes everywhere these days,
but people don't seem to realize that.

644
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,416
What? Why is this playing first?

645
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,297
Is this hair or underwear?

646
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,845
You recognize him, right?

647
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:18,014
I hear he's some high official
or something.

648
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:46,501
REST AREA
CONVENIENCE STORE

649
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:49,671
Well, he's free to sing naked.

650
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,426
I sing in the shower too.

651
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:58,972
But I don't do this.

652
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:04,644
I want to kill either him or you.

653
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,647
Which one should I kill?

654
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:13,945
Which one should I kill?

655
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,366
Not yet.

656
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:23,622
What's the hurry?
You haven't seen the rest of them yet.

657
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:26,291
REST AREA
CONVENIENCE STORE

658
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:36,927
Next.

659
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,434
She said her daughter died of an illness

660
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,187
and exploited that heart-rending story.

661
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,774
But she didn't know
her baby monitor was recording.

662
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,652
What's the use of deleting it?

663
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:57,739
If you're evil once,
you'll always be evil.

664
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:00,325
Hey, record this.

665
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,912
How are you so stupid?

666
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,121
What's your problem?

667
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,457
-I apologize.
-Pick up the slack!

668
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,543
Okay?

669
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:38,697
Was it you?

670
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,868
Did you send the message?

671
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,954
Blackmailing is a crime.

672
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:23,325
Did you all receive a message?

673
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:28,830
Then do you all have
100 million won in cash in your bags?

674
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,834
Jeez, everyone is rich.

675
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:36,296
Aren't you here for the same reason?

676
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:39,507
Did you believe
they'd delete the video if you paid them?

677
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,637
You're here
because you believed them, aren't you?

678
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,932
I'm here to catch a criminal, okay?

679
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:47,849
Look here.

680
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,268
Your bag looks pretty heavy.

681
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:57,692
Does anyone know who blackmailed us?

682
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,449
It's not one of us, is it?

683
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:09,579
They'll show up
since we brought 100 million won each.

684
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,998
That's a lot of money.

685
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,252
That's 19, 20.

686
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,463
It's two billion won.

687
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,589
I think

688
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,509
there is another person over there.

689
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,771
I didn't think it'd be
a difficult question for you.

690
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,023
Who is worse?

691
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,365
HEO HYEON-TAE, 20 PEOPLE

692
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:00,839
Do you want to take 20 lives
and save your son,

693
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:05,218
or do you want to save 20 lives
and let your son die?

694
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,014
As you must know,

695
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:13,393
your choice will be recorded too.

696
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,694
I'm doing so much work.
Isn't there any other staff?

697
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:24,946
Stop whining.

698
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:30,285
If you say you'll save Hyeon-tae,
that bomb

699
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:34,122
will blow up and everyone there will die.

700
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:41,379
And if you say you'll save 20 people,
Hyeon-tae will…

701
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,091
be blown up and die.

702
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:57,479
If you sacrifice your son
to save 20 lives,

703
00:55:57,562 --> 00:56:00,482
I'll spare them
even though I know how horrid they are.

704
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:03,818
A fisherman can't catch
every fish in the sea, you know.

705
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:06,780
But think about it.

706
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,908
Do those 20 pieces of human trash

707
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:14,037
deserve to live
more than your precious son does?

708
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,302
Are you alive?

709
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,222
I know him.

710
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,516
Candidate Heo Seong-tae?

711
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:49,072
Push the button with your head, okay?

712
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,574
If you don't pick in ten seconds,
I'll kill them both.

713
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,829
Nine, eight, seven…

714
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:58,832
Six…

715
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:04,587
Is he okay?

716
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,386
Five, four,

717
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:16,224
three, two, one.

718
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:23,106
Isn't this unexpected?

719
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,109
I'm touched.

720
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:27,944
Did she know?

721
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,740
Hey, did you already know
that Seong-tae was there?

722
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:41,291
Don't cry.

723
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:51,551
Ms. Yong killed
her good-for-nothing second son

724
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:55,972
and saved her first son
who has a bright future ahead of him.

725
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,223
Mr. Heo.

726
00:57:58,516 --> 00:57:59,517
Mr. Heo, are you okay?

727
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:00,977
Mr. Heo?

728
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,313
It's okay.

729
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,733
You saved 20 pieces of human trash
who were strangers to you.

730
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,486
See? It brought you good fortune.

731
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,407
That's why you need to be good, right?

732
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,079
Hyeon-tae deserved to die.

733
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:25,543
He asked me
to kill his mother and brother.

734
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:26,503
Right?

735
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,962
Yes, he did.

736
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,297
But…

737
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,092
here's the twist.

738
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,972
"The love of tens of thousands of people

739
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:42,227
is less than my love for Ophelia."

740
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,144
MS. YONG

741
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,687
"How far

742
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,274
would you go for Ophelia?"

743
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,026
MS. YONG

744
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:51,778
I'll spare

745
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,572
either these 20 people…

746
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,327
or you, Ms. Yong.

747
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:05,458
If you push this,
you'll instantly explode.

748
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,585
So be careful not to push it by mistake.

749
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:11,005
Will it be 20 people or Ms. Yong?

750
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,507
I won't drag this out.

751
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:15,843
-Ten, nine…
-Do you know anything?

752
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,637
-…eight, seven,
-Eight, seven,

753
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,472
-six.
-six!

754
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,767
What?

755
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,562
She acted selflessly. How boring.

756
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:28,773
She's pretending to be nice.
That's disgusting.

757
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,174
Do you want to look at her face
when killing her?

758
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:11,941
I hate you!

759
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,069
I hate you!

760
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,863
Seriously!

761
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:19,991
You sure took your time.

762
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:11,250
It's a very predictable plan
no one can escape.

763
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,502
Didn't you notice anything odd?

764
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:16,714
Your target has always been
someone you want to see suffer the most.

765
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,174
But there's one thing I don't get.

766
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:21,886
Even if you knew I was targeting them,
you couldn't have known the details.

767
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:23,471
I didn't expect that.

768
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:26,974
Why does Ms. Koo like you so much?
She doesn't know who you really are.

769
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,643
Would a gunshot kill you instantly?

770
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,728
-Should I kill you?
-Now I'll get to experience it too.

771
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:33,564
Who will it be? You or Santa?

772
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:36,984
One, two, three!

773
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:44,570
