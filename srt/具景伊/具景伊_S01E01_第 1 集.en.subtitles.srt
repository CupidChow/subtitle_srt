1
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,968
HE DESERVES TO DIE, SO KILL HIM

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,262
I KILLED HIM LIKE YOU SAID
BECAUSE HE DESERVED IT

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,596
KILL HIM!

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,140
SAVE HIM?

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,350
OVERLY SUSPICIOUS
EVIDENCE, HIKIKOMORI

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,518
I DO AS I PLEASE?

7
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,522
MY GOSH!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,067
CURIOUS?

9
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:26,985
THEY ALL DIED!

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,197
A HUSBAND-KILLER?
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE

11
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,198
SOMETHING IS FISHY

12
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:35,660
MUST WE ALL LIVE?

13
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:36,578
WE MUST

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,164
A NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN INSPECTOR

15
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,919
ENTRANCE

16
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,814
I got you.

17
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,084
Kill them.

18
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,712
Kill them.

19
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,173
You're all dead meat. Kill them.

20
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,592
Kill them all!

21
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,303
Kill them all.

22
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,347
Die. Die!

23
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,727
Let's kill them all.

24
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,983
Great. Die. Come on, die.

25
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,651
Die.

26
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,862
All right. Let's kill them all.

27
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,823
Get them all! Kill them!

28
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,617
Get out! If you don't, we're done!

29
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,331
It froze!

30
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,458
Damn this slow computer.

31
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,211
Sorry, guys.

32
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,922
Apple. Do us a favor
and get a new computer. Do it now.

33
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,549
If we lose this, I'll kill myself.

34
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,050
I've got no reason to live!

35
00:02:56,134 --> 00:03:00,013
Melon. Just ignore the monster
and move in for the kill.

36
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,723
Focus fire!

37
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,892
Now.

38
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,894
Now!

39
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,360
We did it.

40
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:18,489
We did it!

41
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,149
EPISODE 1

42
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,863
-The spirit of blue dragons
-The spirit of blue dragons

43
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,492
-Will push NT Life Insurance to run
-Will push NT Life Insurance to run

44
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,035
I'll work my ass off!

45
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,496
NT LIFE INSURANCE

46
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,875
You guys are already getting along well.
Take good care of Won-sik.

47
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,920
Won-sik, keep working hard here.
Go get it!

48
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,505
I can do it!

49
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,758
INSPECTION TEAM B OFFICE

50
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,808
THE BEST THERE IS

51
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,522
NT LIFE INSURANCE

52
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,982
Why did he leave this here?

53
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,153
A lonely night

54
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,488
What's up?

55
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,824
I forgot something.

56
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,244
Where did it go?

57
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,792
I put it aside for you.

58
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,879
Thank you, Gyeong-su. I appreciate it.

59
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,341
Right. My team leader is
taking us for octopus soup

60
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,594
in Sangmi-dong later
to welcome me to the team.

61
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,305
-I'm good.
-It's too gross for you, right?

62
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,183
But you're coming, right?

63
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,893
Can I?

64
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,064
Even if we're on different teams,
we work for the same company.

65
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,190
Of course you can.

66
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,901
Hold on. I have to talk to him about work.

67
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:03,196
Gyeong-su. How are things progressing
with Ms. Kim Chun-ja?

68
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,655
Oh, that case…

69
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,076
Team A is on that case now
since I was in charge of it.

70
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,827
Now that I'm on Team A,

71
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,580
the case was transferred to the team.

72
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:13,998
-Mr. Kim!
-Coming!

73
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,094
It's not because I find it gross.

74
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,386
Pardon?

75
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,056
I don't eat them because they're inhumane.

76
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,643
Well, I think they're delicious.

77
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,479
And it's good for young men like me too.

78
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,526
What cases do we have left now?

79
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,824
I don't want small cases.

80
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,910
I want a case over 500 million won
that's going to make a mark.

81
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:56,040
A lot of money is riding on this case,
but everyone is passing the buck for it,

82
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,376
saying only an idiot would take it.

83
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,545
REQUEST FOR INSPECTION
MEMBER NAME: KIM MIN-GYU

84
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,046
EXPECTED PAYOUT: 1.2 BILLION WON

85
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,048
Tell me the upside.

86
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,052
Well, you know you're very competent.

87
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,595
And I'm pretty smart too.

88
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,932
So if we work on this together,
we might be able to do something.

89
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,642
And objectively-speaking?

90
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:18,521
This case is bad news. If it goes wrong,
we'll end up in trouble.

91
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,233
The on-site inspection isn't even done.
How can the two of us do anything?

92
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,026
We must have hope!

93
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,447
I can do it. Let's be positive
and challenge ourselves.

94
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,908
Oh Gyeong-su.

95
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,831
Hometown, Daegu.
You have three older sisters.

96
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,666
Your father runs a gochujang factory.

97
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,960
You weren't fit enough
for Police University.

98
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,963
Two years on the job,
a good memory, good presentations,

99
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,507
-and a fan of the Samsung Lions.
-What's going on?

100
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:51,512
Do you know how you stacked up
against your year's batch of new recruits?

101
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,515
I heard that I was at the top.

102
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,058
You were at the bottom.

103
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,978
You didn't look loyal
or serious about the job.

104
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,440
Actually, the way they put it
was harsher than this.

105
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,110
So who do you think made
such an evaluation?

106
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,326
How do you think you got the job?

107
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,997
Who do you think saw your potential?

108
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,169
It was me.

109
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:29,467
I saw it. The fire within you.

110
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,468
It's hot!

111
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,721
See? I can feel it.

112
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:37,475
If people like you put their mind to it,
they can pull anything off.

113
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,394
"Fire"?

114
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,107
Look. 1.2 billion won rests on this case.

115
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:49,862
If you pull this off, you'll get
your promotion way faster than Won-sik.

116
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,740
You get it, right?

117
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,576
Yes. I got it.

118
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,789
But how are we going
to solve this one by ourselves?

119
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,917
We'll need a mercenary.

120
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,629
I got it.

121
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,508
Let's go.

122
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,009
-We're there. Go!
-Let's go!

123
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,136
You're dead!

124
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,355
I turned off the power of computers
while people are playing games.

125
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,314
-What?
-Hey!

126
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,526
-Come on!
-What are you doing?

127
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,694
Die!

128
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,364
No.

129
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,408
No!

130
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:40,997
KOO, 43 YEARS OLD, HWAGUK-DONG

131
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,623
No…

132
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,844
You…

133
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,597
You!

134
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,765
You!

135
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,986
Gosh.

136
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,087
What would you like?

137
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,804
What would you like to order?

138
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,435
Pardon? I can't hear you.

139
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,442
A bowl of udon, yakisoba,

140
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,237
-and dumplings too.
-Okay. I got it.

141
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,955
Kyung-yi.

142
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,427
-A glass of draft beer too, please.
-You got it.

143
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,223
Kyung-yi. Let's talk about work now.

144
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,519
One of our clients went missing.

145
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,783
It happened in Tongyeong.

146
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,285
His name is Kim Min-gyu.

147
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,704
A 35-year-old office worker
at a chemical plant.

148
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,164
Here's your beer.

149
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,171
Enjoy.

150
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,354
He went out for a morning walk
and never came back.

151
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,608
His wife reported him missing.
And he was recently presumed dead.

152
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,861
His wife, Yoon Jae-yeong,
is the beneficiary.

153
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,948
They aren't locals, but everyone knows
they were as happy as parakeets.

154
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,492
They also have a daughter.

155
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,097
Did you know
parakeets are actually parrots?

156
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,434
They have nothing to do
with happy marriages.

157
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,982
And I don't trust
those so-called happy couples.

158
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,527
How would people know if they were happy?

159
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,238
The couple went out of their way
to put on a show.

160
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,281
You still doubt everything.

161
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,535
But I think
they really were happy together.

162
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,378
-The husband was such a family man.
-Look over there.

163
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,172
Were there cameras at his house?
How would you know that?

164
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,132
-Don't interrupt.
-How about a photo?

165
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,092
-Hi.
-Hi.

166
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,177
-One, two, three.
-Hi.

167
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:13,310
I believe in our Almighty Father,
the creator of heaven and earth.

168
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,145
The couple went to church diligently

169
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,356
-and was well-liked too.
-It's hot. Be careful.

170
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,234
There was a low mountain
around their house…

171
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,027
-Dad, here!
-…so he often hiked there.

172
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,154
Nothing stood out
on the day he went missing.

173
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,407
He wore his usual hiking outfit.

174
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,286
The person you have reached is
unavailable. You'll be directed to…

175
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,162
-Mr. Kim!
-Mr. Kim!

176
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,415
But he disappeared without a trace.

177
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,083
-Mr. Kim!
-Mr. Kim!

178
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,461
-Mr. Kim.
-Mr. Kim!

179
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,881
-But they found his blood…
-We found something!

180
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,008
…and the bag he took that day at a cliff.

181
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,718
And his shoes were in the water.

182
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,553
Keep searching.

183
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,679
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

184
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,807
They didn't find his body,
but there was no sign that he survived.

185
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,518
-My husband went missing.
-His wife didn't give up

186
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,853
and kept looking for him.

187
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,646
-She went at it for a while.
-Take a look, please.

188
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,398
Hello. Take a look, please.

189
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,485
I'M LOOKING FOR MY MISSING HUSBAND

190
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,712
They took out a loan to buy a house.
But no loans from private lenders.

191
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,589
They didn't have money problems.

192
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,175
Other than their daughter's
hospital bills for diabetes.

193
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,012
Excuse me. Here's your order.

194
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,270
Enjoy.

195
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,570
I see.

196
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,907
"I see"? That's all you got?

197
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,742
You said no interruptions.

198
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,494
Nothing comes to your mind?

199
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,664
That you're as dense as always.

200
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,377
And that you still can't hide
your real intention.

201
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,670
What intention?

202
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,258
You want me to turn it into
a suicide case.

203
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,719
Right? Like he had some problem

204
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,764
or his marriage was falling apart.
You want me to find some stuff

205
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,182
and spread the word.

206
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,519
Since the company isn't obligated
to make a payout

207
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,981
if he's been diagnosed with depression
and this turns out to be suicide.

208
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,401
It's quite dirty,
but you don't feel guilty at all, do you?

209
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,820
We don't fabricate documents.

210
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,780
And I'll say this again.

211
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,116
See me and the company
as separate entities.

212
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,661
Seeing how you're upset,
you do feel guilty.

213
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,705
I pushed your buttons.

214
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:43,127
I'm not asking you to fabricate anything.
Just get me circumstantial evidence.

215
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,753
How can this not be suicide?

216
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,755
How can you be so sure?

217
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,590
You just said something was off.

218
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,343
You can never tell with people.

219
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,680
They may seem fine, but they could've
killed themselves because--

220
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,115
That's tough.

221
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,412
You'll take the case, right?

222
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:22,041
You barge in and throw me a case
when you can't handle it.

223
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,168
I'm not your errand runner.

224
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,128
It's not like you pay me well either.

225
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,213
And where do I have to go? Tongyeong?

226
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,798
Gosh. That's too far.

227
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,593
You should take care of this case
on your own.

228
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,182
Do they do takeouts here
for the dumplings?

229
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,224
No.

230
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,686
No takeouts?

231
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,899
I meant that you will have no choice
but to take this case.

232
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,705
What are you doing?

233
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,708
I haven't been out for so long,
so I forgot.

234
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,514
You know too much about me.

235
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,518
Goodness.

236
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,980
MESSI FORCE RTX 3080 TI GRAPHIC CARD,
ORSAI T3 RUSH GRAY/CHARCOAL

237
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,524
BEN MOCIUZ EX2710,
ORSAI VIRTUOSO RGB WIRELESS SE

238
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,624
Hello. I'm Oh Gyeong-su
of Investigation Team B from NT--

239
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:27,207
I know too much about you.
And I know exactly what you need as well.

240
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,459
This is Gyeong-su from my--

241
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,881
That's from Switzerland.
You can't force it open.

242
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,552
If you want to open it,
just take the case.

243
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,310
You must think I'm a joke.

244
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,479
I can just buy all this with my own money.

245
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,647
Gyeong-su.

246
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,567
Ms. Koo,
you have 350,000 won in Hyeonyeong Bank

247
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,236
and 1,090,000 won in Daehan Bank.

248
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,197
I rounded them down.

249
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,075
I had more than I thought.

250
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,370
It cost 1.1 million won for the cleaners
and to dispose of the trash.

251
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,748
-After that…
-I didn't ask you to clean the house.

252
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,708
Take it all back.

253
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,960
And where's my computer?

254
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:17,090
I'm not sure
if we can call that a computer.

255
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,551
Gosh. When will we finish all this?

256
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,136
Hey.

257
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,402
Cockroaches!

258
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,697
But this isn't right.

259
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,741
You're forcing this on me.

260
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,452
I feel like my freedom
has utterly been infringed.

261
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,288
If you think I'll take the case
for this computer,

262
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,332
you must be out of your…

263
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,781
Gosh. Look at this.

264
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,702
This is awesome. Isn't it?

265
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:31,123
Did my eyesight get better?

266
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,209
It's so bright.

267
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,297
If you don't take the case,
I'll return this.

268
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,927
Was it Tongyeong?

269
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:48,265
It's getting late.
Go home. It's getting hot here.

270
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,978
INVITED SANTA AND MELONMUSK TO THE PARTY

271
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,564
Guys, I got a new computer!

272
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,691
It won't freeze now. It's amazing!

273
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,612
Gyeong-su will come
and pick you up tomorrow.

274
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,114
Okay. Sure.

275
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,825
That's way too soon though.
Come next week.

276
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,830
Wait. He's coming?

277
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,958
I can't work with someone I can't trust.

278
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,918
Can you even drive?

279
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,962
You even forgot your passcode.

280
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,715
Do you remember
which side the accelerator is on?

281
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,470
Driving is all about instincts.
Anyway, I won't work with him.

282
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,059
Who are you?

283
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,688
I think I introduced myself several times.

284
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,648
Not your job title.

285
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,317
Who are you?

286
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,198
From your accent, you must be from Daegu.

287
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,824
You tried to become a cop, right?

288
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,202
I bet it was your physical test.

289
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,080
You're not the type to work
for someone like Je-hui.

290
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:56,249
It's suspicious that
you still haven't left her team.

291
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,879
Are you trying to take credit
for her work,

292
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,798
move teams, and get promoted?

293
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,929
I don't think I can work with someone
as rude and unhygienic as her.

294
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,605
Are you serious?

295
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,482
-That's it. I'll return it.
-Come on.

296
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,110
We just need a driver, right?

297
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,028
I can find someone trustworthy.

298
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,447
Is there anyone you can trust?

299
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,407
I'm very busy, Kyung-yi.

300
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,251
DOES ANYONE WANT A PART-TIME JOB
AS A DRIVER?

301
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,254
I don't have a license.

302
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,631
Nice. I'll take it.

303
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,133
Are you okay starting tomorrow?

304
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,012
I got myself a driver.

305
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,682
Are you kidding me?

306
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:58,478
You trust some stranger online
over my colleague who I vouch for?

307
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,692
He's not a stranger.

308
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,820
We've been
in thousands of battles together.

309
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,197
I can count on him to have my back!

310
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,832
Well, we will provide you with a vehicle.

311
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:23,044
You'll be hired as a temp,
driving for NT Life Insurance.

312
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:29,134
Inspector Koo Kyung-yi isn't the type
to get along with others.

313
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,469
You must know that firsthand.

314
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:37,058
By the way, may I ask you
about your work experiences?

315
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,574
He's totally not what I pictured.

316
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,659
You're a good judge of character.

317
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,871
He used to be a caregiver
but he's playing games to blow off steam.

318
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,751
He's totally not what I pictured.

319
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,253
Are you sure he's Santa from my team?

320
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,880
Maybe he's someone else.

321
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,007
Okay. What did he say?

322
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:13,011
"When everyone on our team died
and I had only five HP,

323
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,931
I hid, then landed a counterattack
to wipe the other team out."

324
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,350
He calls it
"the Battle of Liberation Day."

325
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,935
He said you'd believe him then.

326
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,812
THE BATTLE OF LIBERATION DAY

327
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:23,897
That's him.

328
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,200
Let's go. Hurry.

329
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,161
Hurry.

330
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,789
Be careful.

331
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,670
All right. Great driving skills, check.

332
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,047
Then please take care of this case.

333
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,265
Wake me up when we get there.

334
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,100
Please.

335
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:05,313
"To be, or not to be,
that is the question.

336
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,816
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

337
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,860
to suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune."

338
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,154
"The fair Ophelia!

339
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,782
Nymph, in thy orisons
be all my sins remembered."

340
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:19,452
"My lord. How does
your honor for this many a day?"

341
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,247
Hey, we're so good. I think we're ready.

342
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,456
Thank you so much.

343
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,166
Horang.

344
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,877
Horang, where are you?

345
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,170
Chunsam.

346
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,549
Bonggu. Myeongtae.

347
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,634
The youngest one is Roy.

348
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,136
Roy.

349
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,388
Hey, what's that?

350
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,348
Has it always been here?

351
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,183
It says it belongs to Yeong-ju.

352
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,644
Who could have sent it?

353
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,938
Come take a look. I'm scared.

354
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,691
-This is creepy.
-Hurry and open it.

355
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,776
I'm scared.

356
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,574
FOR YEONG-JU

357
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,165
Is that you, Kyung?

358
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,292
-What?
-How did you do it?

359
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,794
-It's a surprise.
-Is it a special day today?

360
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,630
Yeong-ju's birthday?

361
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,883
-No way.
-Is it your birthday today?

362
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,552
-Why didn't you tell us?
-It's not my birthday.

363
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,095
How adorable!

364
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,264
-They're so cute.
-So adorable.

365
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,432
What are you doing?

366
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,559
-Hello.
-Hello.

367
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,227
It smells here. Open the windows.

369
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,523
They're so cute!

370
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,150
How are they so cute?

371
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,778
They're so adorable.

372
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,368
Hey, your face is bleeding.

373
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,331
Roy scratched me
while I was putting on the ribbon.

374
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,041
You really got me.

375
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:51,169
Really? You said you like surprises.

376
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,797
Totally. I thought
my heart was going to stop.

377
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,466
Whatever you're doing,

378
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,426
you should stop and start practicing.

379
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,095
Let me just take one more photo.

380
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,222
Take one for me too.

381
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,818
Come on. Do it.

382
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,319
No.

383
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,410
-What a nice day.
-Yes, indeed.

384
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,787
We're sightseeing.

385
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,836
-Bye. Yes.
-You're leaving?

386
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,431
She'll just think it got lost.

387
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,266
Put the rest back in.

388
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,031
Next.

389
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,245
-Bye.
-Hello.

390
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,457
-It's been a while.
-Right.

391
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,624
-How's the new house?
-Good.

392
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:16,212
It's weird that
only her counter has a long queue.

393
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,923
Something is fishy.

394
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,888
I don't think you can return this.

395
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,771
AI VOICE

396
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,106
EDIT MESSAGE

397
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,779
Even I would line up at her counter.

398
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,823
Green onions? What are you making?

399
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,117
-I'll make a salad.
-Really? Sounds delicious.

400
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,786
Bye.

401
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,621
Do you think she's a good person?

402
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,427
She's still driving the used car
her husband bought.

403
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:08,264
She won't be able to cover
the maintenance fee for her car,

404
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,226
her daughter's medical bills
and tuition with her paycheck.

405
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,980
With the insurance payout,
she would be okay.

406
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,066
Right?

407
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,694
Did you buy what I asked?

408
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,568
You can't park your car like that.

409
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,485
DANGER, NO PARKING

410
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,988
Where are you from? Are you a tourist?

411
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,117
You want to buy a house?

412
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,412
I've been here 40 years, born and raised.
Ask me anything.

413
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,249
I like this town.
It's a perfectly sized fishing town.

414
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,001
But is it safe?

415
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,253
I heard someone went missing here.

416
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,462
What?

417
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,090
I heard a married man who moved here
had gone missing.

418
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:28,428
Oh, that? That's not what happened.
It was unfortunate what happened to them.

419
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:32,473
Nothing dangerous
has ever happened here for decades.

420
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,310
I see. I get it.

421
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:39,522
It must be because there's
a competent detective like you here.

422
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,233
Goodness.
You are a good judge of character.

423
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:48,072
By the way, how were they unfortunate?

424
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:52,285
Things were tough for the couple
because their daughter had diabetes,

425
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,578
but he was very diligent.

426
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,205
But he made a false step while hiking.

427
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,624
That was unfortunate.

428
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,292
We couldn't even find his body.

429
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,086
Oh, no.

430
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:07,425
Maybe he took his own life because he was
heartbroken for his sick daughter.

431
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,719
No way. Other people might have,

432
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:13,056
but he wouldn't do something like that
to his beloved wife.

433
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,267
The plant he worked at
had a few job openings.

434
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,561
So he made good money.
Why would he do that?

435
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:22,398
Come on. You never know what really
goes on inside other people's heads

436
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,983
no matter how close you are.

437
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,778
I bet that you don't know
what your wife is thinking either.

438
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,322
Goodness. That's a sore spot with him.

439
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,699
It's hard to believe,
but he's never been married.

440
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,160
Goodness.

441
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,163
I knew it.

442
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,958
Gosh. Look at him blushing.

443
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,542
Hey, be quiet.

444
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:46,381
So a lot of people quit
their jobs at the plant, right?

445
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,174
Is it because they moved to the city?

446
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:51,177
That's not it. They all died.

447
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,137
-They died?
-Come on.

448
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,390
That's no way to welcome
a visitor to our town.

449
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,604
Thanks.

450
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:04,691
What about me?

451
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,698
Over the past two years,

452
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:15,410
workers from the plant Min-gyu worked at
died one after another.

453
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:20,456
That's why we suspected
that something had happened to him too.

454
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,959
Gosh. That's scary.

455
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,086
Was it some contagious disease?

456
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,463
Let's see.

457
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,841
One of them died in a car accident.

458
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,801
One of them died of a heart attack.

459
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,554
Come on. I thought you were fishing here.

460
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,723
Stop gossiping in front of the visitors.

461
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,225
Everyone knows about it,
why keep it a secret?

462
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:42,937
People from the same plant died
one after another?

463
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,444
Something is fishy.

Last night, my dad

484
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:10,024
Came home with a big smile

485
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:15,196
And crayons in his hand

486
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:19,700
He bought crayons for me

487
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,372
This is Sister Yoon Jae-yeong.

488
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,084
What's your name?

489
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,002
I'm Kim Seon-mi.

490
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:34,006
I wanted you two to meet
since you may be in the same boat.

491
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,092
I guess it was meant to be.

492
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,470
What do you mean?

493
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:43,266
Her daughter is also named Kim Seon-mi.

494
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,893
Gosh. Really?

495
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,897
The Lord must have brought us together.

496
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,609

501
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,371
A WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES COMMITS SUICIDE

502
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,998
NO SUICIDE NOTE HAS BEEN FOUND

503
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:16,090
But what do their deaths
have to do with Kim Min-gyu's case?

504
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,553
She's suspicious of many things,
but she's usually right.

505
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,515
I'm doing it because you asked me to,

506
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,810
but I don't feel good about that woman.

507
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,270
I heard some weird rumors too.

508
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,396
Rumors?

509
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,690
Like biting a client who came in
to file a complaint?

510
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,026
They definitely deserved it.

511
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:38,237
But there are other rumors
that are worse than that.

512
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,156
That she killed her husband?

513
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,824
Is that true?

514
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,493
We can always learn something
even from rumors.

515
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,622
Then it's true?

516
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,665
How tragic is my life?

517
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,543
I lost my husband out of the blue.

518
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,926
But those people
from the insurance company

519
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:03,012
looked at me as if I killed my husband

520
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,889
and kept asking me questions.

521
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,227
I wanted to give up everything,
including the insurance payout.

522
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:16,400
But then, I heard God.

523
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,779
"My daughter, do not give up.

524
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,531
It's not just any money.

525
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,368
It's a present from your husband.

526
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,454
And it's a present from me."

527
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,711
You too should never give up, Sister.

528
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,714
The insurance company will bring up money

529
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,050
and ask you questions to break you down.

530
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,636
But don't let them find out

531
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,764
that your husband was
depressed or acting strange

532
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,432
before the accident.

533
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:05,658
We have a duty to serve God.

534
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,787
-I…
-Yes.

535
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:11,956
Yes.

536
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:16,877
We should talk about our hardships
and put them behind us.

537
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,300
I'm all right.

538
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:31,100
Do you think your husband went to heaven?

539
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,060
Pardon?

540
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,563
I sometimes wonder

541
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,400
if my husband went to heaven or hell.

542
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:44,530
If he was the man I knew,
he would've ended up in heaven.

543
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:48,451
But I wonder
if he was really who I thought he was.

544
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:53,873
What if I live a good life
and go to heaven,

545
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,459
but he's in hell?

546
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,295
What do I do then?

547
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,383
I…

548
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,013
I don't believe my husband is dead.

549
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,725
What are you talking about?

550
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,354
If I could, I'd wait for him.

551
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:20,149
He would never
throw away his life like that.

552
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,111
But working all day won't be enough
for me to pay the bills

553
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,906
if my daughter
has to go to a big hospital.

554
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,451
So even if people criticize me
for living off the payout,

555
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,953
I'm putting my daughter first.

556
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,628
I'm sorry. I have to go to work.

557
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,934
-Oh, no.
-No!

558
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,354
What on earth is that?

559
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,940
-No!
-How can this be?

560
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,942
Poor Chunsam.

561
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:06,237
I hadn't seen him for a while,
so I came here just in case.

562
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,323
Did someone beat him up? This is so cruel.

563
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,576
-I don't think he was beaten to death.
-Then what?

564
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,620
How did they die all at once?

565
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,789
TUNA

566
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,796
Doesn't it smell sweet?

567
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,340
It does.

568
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,929
One of them is missing.

569
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,305
That one. Roy.

570
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:34,849
Roy.

571
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,143
-Roy?
-Roy?

572
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,353
-Roy.
-Roy.

573
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,397
-Roy.
-Roy.

574
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,649
Roy!

575
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,360
Roy!

576
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,423
Roy.

577
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:21,270
Someone wanted to kill
and burn them all at once.

578
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,355
Who would do such an evil thing?

579
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,773
Only Roy got away.

580
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,317
Who would it be?

581
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,988
We'll have to find out.

582
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,407
Yes, I looked into it.

583
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,993
I told you to check if it was a suicide.

584
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,536
Why dig into his acquaintances?

585
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,413
Because something is fishy.

586
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,207
I didn't find anything unusual.

587
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,293
It's true that his colleagues died
every 3 to 4 months.

588
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,378
Kim Seop-ryong died of a heart attack.

589
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:54,345
Han Man-gu died
with his mistress in a car crash.

590
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:59,183
And the police got a report
that the last one committed suicide.

591
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,685
Why connect these cases together?

592
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,480
What about that other thing?

593
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,357
Nothing unusual in Yoon's call history.

594
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,442
Just her work, church,
hospital, and kindergarten.

595
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,363
-That's no fun.
-I did find something odd.

596
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:15,783
There's a record of Kim Min-gyu's phone
being tracked after he went missing.

597
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,369
It was turned on
three months after he went missing.

598
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,538
The cops just thought it was stolen.

599
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,999
Which base station pinged
the signal? Was it far from the cliff?

00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,762
Don't your eyes hurt?

606
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,268
Do you see something I don't see?

607
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,146
You always see things I don't.

608
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,025
I can't tell
if anyone would do such a thing.

609
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,236
The cafeteria workers even feed the cats.

610
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,531
Since they feed them,
it'd be easier for them to poison it.

611
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,493
Mr. Jang even asked their names.

612
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,828
-He likes cats.
-He couldn't remember their names.

613
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,997
He said they were smelly.

614
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,666
And the janitor was worried

615
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,752
that no one would be here
to feed the cats during breaks.

616
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:37,466
Hey, that makes no sense.
He could just feed them himself.

617
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,760
Hey. It can't be the janitor.

618
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,762
He really adored those cats.

619
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:57,111
Remember how
the canned tuna smelled sweet?

620
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,237
That's antifreeze.

621
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,907
If you replace oil with antifreeze,
they eat it up, thinking it's tuna.

622
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,575
How do you know that?

623
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:04,952
It's common knowledge.

624
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:06,912
But Roy didn't eat that.

625
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,209
You know, he ran away whenever he saw men.

626
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:15,629
So it has to be a man who knows a lot

627
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:20,509
about students and their routines
since a lot of them go see the cats.

628
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:23,137
And someone
who wouldn't look suspicious for carrying

629
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,264
a sack or antifreeze.

630
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,349
I see.

631
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,309
So who is it?

632
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,855
-What will you do if we get him?
-I'll kill him.

633
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,857
Why should he get to live
when those cats died?

634
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,153
Okay.

635
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,617
We should get a room too.

I don't have smaller bills.

639
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:17,274
So can you give me
that thing instead of change?

640
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,692
Pardon?

641
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,408
I need 20,000 won more.

WE PROMISE YOU A VERY LONG NIGHT

643
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,607
Goodness. What am I going to do?

644
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,902
A lot of people come and go here.

645
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:05,948
I don't think anyone here
would remember your husband.

646
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,575
The thing is,
we don't remember their faces

647
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,452
unless they're particularly handsome.

648
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:15,332
Or unless their you-know-what
is rather exotic.

649
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,794
"Rather exotic"?

650
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:26,593
My husband's is just regular sized.

651
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,347
Gosh. How am I going to find him?

652
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,185
Goodness. I've met all kinds
of weirdos in this line of work.

653
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,854
Some perverts don't do anything.
They just stare at us.

654
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:42,150
But he was probably here
less than a year ago.

655
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,193
A year?

656
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,362
Let's see.

657
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,656
Some guy cried
while taking off his clothes.

658
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:51,743
And some guy kept a mask
and sunglasses on the entire time.

659
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:56,248
Anyway, you're wasting
your time and tears on this jerk.

660
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,752
-Tell me about that bastard.
-Who?

661
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:02,462
The one with a mask.

662
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,508
They probably made contact
through Mironet.

663
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,802
-Sweety.
-Come in.

664
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:14,474
He got a room at an automated motel.
He wanted me to come over fast.

665
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:15,976
Wait.

666
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,034
F205 IS WEARING A MASK. WHAT THE HELL?

667
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:35,621
We don't like that kind of stuff.
So I reported it right away.

668
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,457
Also because of what happened before.

669
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,293
WE PROMISE YOU A VERY LONG NIGHT

670
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,015
Gosh. I have to take it off first.

671
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,063
Gosh.

672
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,691
WE'RE ON STANDBY. JUST DO YOUR JOB.

673
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,319
All right. Let's do it.

674
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:10,280
Sweety, your knee is bleeding.

675
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:15,410
But I guess nothing else happened.
That's all I remember.

676
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,037
When was that exactly?

677
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,164
You're ridiculous.

678
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,874
How am I supposed to remember that?

679
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,544
-You texted your manager.
-Right. The text.

680
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:27,923
MASK

681
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:31,051
I got it. It was October 21.

682
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,386
What's your problem?

683
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,263
Honey.

684
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,849
Gosh. Was that you?

685
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,560
Was that you?

686
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,355
I miss you.

687
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,858
So your manager used this app, right?

688
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:51,238
It leaves no personal information
and the chats get deleted right away.

689
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,656
A lot of people use it.

690
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,368
I won't be able to find anything
even if I look into it.

691
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,707
Anyway, what did you mean by "before"?

692
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,543
People here party on boats
from time to time.

693
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,421
Two girls were sent over there.

694
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,006
One died in a car accident
and the other committed suicide.

695
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,759
Are you talking about the people
from Hyochang Bio?

696
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,429
Gosh. You must've heard the rumor.

697
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:17,681
What rumor?

698
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:23,228
Around that time, they fished out
a dead body from the breakwater.

699
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:26,231
Rumor has it that it was someone
who died while doing chores

00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,358
for the people on the boat.

701
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:31,820
They say that he held a grudge
against them and cursed them,

702
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:34,239
which is why everyone on the boat died.

703
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,950
Hey, I'm not done! Where are you going?

704
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:37,993
Hey!

705
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:41,204
Who's going to pay for this?

706
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,206
It indeed is fishy.

707
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,669
I might be acting hastily in linking
the masked man and Kim Min-gyu together.

708
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,006
But the day of the masked man's appearance

709
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:54,301
happened to be the day
his phone was turned on.

710
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,595
That means he had an itch.

711
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,390
She wanted me to see
if he could have committed suicide,

712
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,642
but I found that he could still be alive.

713
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,938
Did he run away for fear
that the curse might kill him?

714
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:11,985
But can you fake a suicide
all on your own?

715
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:14,780
-Joy to the world!
-Joy to the world!

716
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:17,365
-The Lord is come
-The Lord is come

717
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:21,995
-Let earth receive her King!
-Let earth receive her King!

718
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:27,584
-Let every heart prepare Him room
-Let every heart prepare Him room

719
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:30,670
-And heaven and nature sing
-She's waiting for him.

720
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,756
-And heaven and nature sing
-And heaven and nature sing

721
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:35,634
"I drew my dad I met in my dream."

722
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,260
DREAM

723
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,640
He really did bring her new crayons.
It wasn't a dream.

724
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,433
DREAM

725
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,977
MARCH 14, 2021, RAINBOW

726
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,647
But the day of the masked man's appearance

727
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,399
happened to be the day
his phone was turned on.

728
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:58,323
-He arose a Victor from the dark domain
-He arose a Victor from the dark domain

729
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:03,328
-He lives forever with His saints to reign
-He lives forever with His saints to reign

730
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:07,332
-He arose
-He arose

731
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:15,382
No mother would buy flour-based snacks
for their diabetic child.

732
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,718
She doesn't even let
Seon-mi eat a birthday cake.

733
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,137
It means there's someone else
who likes snacks.

734
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,933
Kim Min-gyu didn't commit suicide
or wasn't murdered.

735
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,812
He's alive, and
Yoon Jae-yeong is harboring him.

736
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,401
And his whereabouts…

737
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,905
I'll have to start looking.

738
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,391
Gosh. Those darned cats.

739
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,067
Goodness. What should I do, sir?

740
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,568
I'm in front of the church.

741
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:43,279
Some man is doing something to a car.

742
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,491
Goodness. He punctured the tire.

743
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:49,369
I'm scared. Please come quickly.

744
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,496
Hurry, please.

745
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,291
We don't have time. Hurry up.

746
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,252
Hurry up.

747
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,198
It's me.

748
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,868
Tell me the birthdays
of everyone in the family.

749
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:32,412
-What are you up to now?
-Breaking in. I need to find him.

750
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,664
-What?
-Hurry. I don't have time.

751
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,841
Nice, Santa.

752
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,594
Well done.

753
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,512
You took off your shoes. How polite.

754
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,139
Great.

755
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:54,350
-Excuse me. Hello.
-Hello.

756
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,644
-Coming through.
-What's going on?

757
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:57,854
Excuse me.

758
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:00,065
-It's a flat tire.
-Why are there cops?

759
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,275
-What…
-What happened?

760
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,152
-Hello.
-Hey.

761
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:08,198
-Is this your car?
-What happened to my car?

762
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,408
We also got a report.

763
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:12,535
I heard some man did it. Goodness.

764
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,412
This is quite vicious.

765
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:15,413
What happened?

766
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,540
Hey. All right. Go home, everyone!

767
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,250
-Nothing to see here!
-What is it?

768
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:23,171
You can't drive your car,
so I'll drop you off at your house.

769
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:25,340
No, it's okay. We can take a cab.

770
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,717
Why waste money on cabs?

771
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,345
Besides, I need to ask you some questions.

772
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,098
Seon-mi, have you been in a police car?

773
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,307
Do you want to ride one?

774
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,559
-Yes!
-You got it. Let's go.

775
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,771
Gosh. You grew a lot.

776
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:46,069
No. He's not here.

777
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,198
Of course, he wouldn't be here.

778
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,618
Where could he be?

779
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,579
Where?

780
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,063
Gosh, my back.

781
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:36,703
Well, isn't it tough raising a kid alone?

782
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,705
It's all right.

783
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,915
Gosh. Being a single mom must be tough.

784
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,669
Anyway, do you have any idea
who might've done this?

785
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,465
Not really.

786
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,471
I heard the insurance payout
is quite a large sum.

787
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,058
People are talking, you know.

788
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:00,894
Since you're not from here,

789
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,146
it must be hard enough
raising a kid alone.

790
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,522
You need a man at home.

791
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:08,359
And kids need their dads to feel safer.

792
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,819
I have a dad.

793
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,237
What?

794
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,576
Right. You have a dad.

795
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,621
I bet he's watching over you
from up there.

796
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,655
Isn't the food ready yet? I'm hungry.

797
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,371
Fifty meters…

798
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,924
Santa, go out through the front door
and search to your left.

799
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:15,051
See if there's a place for a man to hide.

800
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,178
He must be within 50m,
so it won't take long.

801
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,221
Hurry.

802
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:29,148
Seon-mi, remember how I told you
to act in front of other people?

803
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,110
That I shouldn't talk about Dad.

804
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:33,820
I'm sorry, Mom.

805
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,014
Mr. Kim Min-gyu.

806
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:47,143
It's over. Come on out.

807
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:50,521
Mr. Kim.

808
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:53,816
Kim Min-gyu.

809
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,368
Kim Min-gyu! Stop right there!

810
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,079
Kim Min-gyu!

811
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:08,706
Kim Min-gyu!

812
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:10,792
Stop!

813
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,109
Kim Min-gyu.

814
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,364
I'm not him! I'm not!

815
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:55,712
Hey.

816
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,175
Hey. Wait!

817
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:04,679
Listen.

818
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,390
Hey, why don't we talk?

819
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,935
I already found out about you.

820
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,770
It's no use running away.

821
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,551
Damn it. Do I have to go in there?

822
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:01,147
Mr. Kim.

823
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,845
The match between
Go Grandmaster Lee Se-dol

824
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,848
and AlphaGo
was the definition of excitement.

825
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,392
But even the spectators…

826
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:43,898
Gosh, that cat again.

827
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:45,107
Damn it.

828
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,194
Damn it.

829
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:56,452
Gosh, damn it.

830
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:03,417
Why won't it open?

831
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:42,206
"No. Let me drink it."

832
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:48,087
"The drink is poisoned. It's too late."

833
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:51,924
-This one is too serious.
-This one's too boring.

834
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,593
-You try it.
-Come on.

835
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:57,722
How much did he drink
for something like that to happen?

836
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:01,225
I shouldn't be careful with alcohol.

837
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:04,478
-"Drink it."
-"The drink is poisoned."

838
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:08,024
Drinking a lot of alcohol can save you
when you consume antifreeze.

839
01:07:08,774 --> 01:07:10,943
-It cleanses your stomach.
-What?

840
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:15,865
Chunsam and the cats might have survived
if they drank alcohol like the janitor.

841
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:17,366
"Let me drink it."

842
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,077
I wanted to kill him…

843
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,789
but I guess it wasn't enough.

844
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:27,376
What are you talking about?

845
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:32,381
What? I thought you wanted to kill him.

846
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,050
What?

847
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,095
You said you wanted to kill him.

848
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:40,890
Let go. You're hurting me.

849
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,394
-Mr. Jang!
-Stop practicing for a second.

850
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,897
-Gather around.
-No way.

851
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:51,901
-Why? Is this about the janitor?
-She's a cop.

852
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:55,362
Hey, I heard he didn't die.
Wasn't it because he drank too much?

853
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:58,157
By the way, you are his wife, aren't you?

854
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:00,743
I saw her on the Job Shadow Day.

855
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:01,994
-No way.
-No way.

856
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,914
You're usually the ones
to leave school last.

857
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:06,957
She came here to ask you

858
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:09,668
if anyone saw anything
on the day of the incident.

859
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:11,295
Just tell her what you saw.

860
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:13,297
Your cop wife is super cool.

861
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,007
-I'm scared.
-Quiet.

862
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:18,928
-Do you want to talk to them separately?
-Yes. That'll be better.

863
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,641
Can we start with you?

864
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:25,059
I've got nothing.

865
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:26,310
What?

866
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:28,646
I left early that day,
so I've got nothing to say.

867
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:34,151
I will decide
if you have nothing to say or not.

868
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:37,530
BONGBAEK GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL
DRAMA CLUB

869
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:49,226
You should come down here too.

870
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,394
This is bigger than I thought.

871
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:51,687
Help me!

872
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,063
It's a homicide.

873
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:55,232
Kyung-yi. You're not a cop anymore.

874
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,359
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

875
01:09:57,443 --> 01:10:00,946
You must've thought
he was better off dead, right?

876
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,531
You asked them to kill him.

877
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:04,909
I never asked them to kill him.
I didn't do anything.

878
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:07,828
-Then who was it?
-Kill him. He deserves it.

879
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:10,080
That's such a frightening thing to say.

880
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:12,416
Did they do something horrible?

881
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:14,919
So let's catch that murderer together.

882
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:17,379
If word gets out, they might kill you too.

883
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,298
Everyone who was there ended up dying.

884
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,467
If she digs too deep…

885
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,261
-Who are you people?
-…just kill her too.

886
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:26,764
Isn't there anyone else to kill?

887
01:11:59,606 --> 01:12:04,611
