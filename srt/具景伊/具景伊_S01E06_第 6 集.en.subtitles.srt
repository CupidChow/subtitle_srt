1
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,968
HE DESERVES TO DIE, SO KILL HIM

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,262
I KILLED HIM LIKE YOU SAID
BECAUSE HE DESERVED IT

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,430
KILL HIM!

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,098
SAVE HIM?

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,350
OVERLY SUSPICIOUS
EVIDENCE, HIKIKOMORI

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,518
I DO AS I PLEASE?

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,522
MY GOSH!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,359
CURIOUS?

9
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,277
THEY ALL DIED!

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,197
A HUSBAND-KILLER?
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE

11
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,240
SOMETHING IS FISHY

12
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,493
MUST WE ALL LIVE?

13
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,411
WE MUST

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,164
A NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN INSPECTOR

15
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,965
EPISODE 6

16
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,307
A container numbered 52
at a windsurfing place

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,018
was rented under Song Yi-kyung's name.

18
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:04,856
START A NEW LIFE AFTER WORK
WITH HAN RIVER LEISURE SPORTS

19
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,700
I shouldn't ignore my gut feelings.
We're of no use here.

20
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,148
Please don't be here. Please.

21
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:52,195
I hope I get a call
that you've been caught at the airport.

22
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,842
Ms. Koo.

23
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,886
Hello. Are you here to kayak?

24
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,812
Or are you here to see me?

25
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,523
Hey! Why didn't you go to the airport?

26
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,733
Have you been keeping watch on me? Why?

27
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,402
Don't act dumb.

28
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:36,030
Open up. I need to catch a serial killer.

29
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,659
There's a serial killer here?
How frightening.

30
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,704
Will you stop it already?
You can't act to save your life.

31
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:47,458
You sure have a knack
for trampling on a young girl's dreams.

32
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,297
You're quite strong.

33
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,465
As you know, I used to be a cop.

34
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,261
Are you not afraid of me?

35
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,305
That's also a form of confession.

36
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:05,894
Now I have no choice but to kill you.
Your team is still at the airport, right?

37
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,234
What was that?

38
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,656
I thought you were here to catch me?

39
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,784
I'm at a disadvantage here.

40
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,162
You're still young and athletic.

41
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,831
Didn't you think that through?

42
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,000
Hold on a second.

43
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,628
Let me call the police, okay?

44
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,004
Are you kidding me?

45
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,147
My goodness.

46
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,608
Gosh.

47
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,112
Hold on.

48
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,074
I'm not ready yet.

49
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,119
Hold on. Take it easy.

50
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,138
Hey, didn't you learn
to respect your elders?

51
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,683
I did. I'm going easy on you
for old times' sake.

52
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,020
Gosh, that hurts!

53
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,440
I shouldn't have gone easy on you.
What if I go blind?

54
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,192
What is this?

55
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:19,944
What are you doing?

56
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,789
You must really want to die!

57
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,958
You can't kill me.

58
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,043
Why not?

59
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,961
Because I'm not one of them.

60
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,254
What do you mean?

61
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,883
You only kill those who deserve to die,
ones who do nothing but harm others.

62
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,510
That's why you couldn't kill
Je-hui and that other guy.

63
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,220
You saved them before I could.

64
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,097
No, you gave us time.

65
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,640
That's not like you.

66
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,518
If you wanted to kill them,
they'd be dead now.

67
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,771
I'm touched.

68
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,857
I didn't know you thought so highly of me.

69
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:03,863
Then I'll just beat you to a pulp, chop
off one of your wrists, and not kill you.

70
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,617
Let's see. It must be somewhere here…

71
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,370
Hold on.

72
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,169
Wait.

73
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,296
Why do you have that here?

74
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,224
My backup's arrived!

75
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,893
Santa, look! I got her!

76
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,479
Hurry up.

77
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,150
What?

78
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,694
I didn't expect him to just run like that.

79
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,490
That won't work on me.

80
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,643
Help me!

81
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,978
What took you so long?

82
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,396
-She's in there.
-Where?

83
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,987
-Wait, what?
-Where?

84
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,029
Let's go.

85
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,374
Let's hurry!

86
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,556
HAN RIVER POLICE

87
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,482
I think we should cross to the other side!

88
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,154
What's she doing?

89
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,002
Why did you do that?

90
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:26,506
You should've called for backup
instead of throwing that net on us.

91
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,637
It was dangerous.
You could've lost your arm.

92
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,138
And what if I do?

93
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,974
Weren't you helping her get away?

94
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,648
Don't do that again.

95
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,534
Apparently,
the inspector went there out of suspicion.

96
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,954
I think you should
just contact her directly.

97
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:16,931
Don't be absurd.

98
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,434
Do you think
Ms. Na would ever be loyal to me

99
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,770
if I told her
I'd contact Ms. Koo instead of her?

100
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:27,483
I gave her a chance, so I'll trust her.
It was just one mistake.

101
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:32,822
Don't you know that's what I'm doing
with you as well?

102
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,741
Giving you second chances.

103
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,328
I'm doing some thorough research.

104
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:43,165
Word has it that Ko Dam's business
has some issues.

105
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,169
I can't be bothered
to blackmail him with his weakness.

106
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,173
Is there any way to kill him
without anyone knowing?

107
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,635
There you go again.

108
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,763
You take my jokes too seriously.

109
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,475
Had we known how to do that,

110
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,186
we wouldn't be

111
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,231
trying so hard.

112
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,066
Right?

113
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,995
She was never going to be at the airport.

114
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:25,291
She might have known
that we had a lot of people there.

115
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:30,755
This is exactly why I stressed
we should have been more covert.

116
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,885
Why didn't you tell me right away?

117
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:36,886
Tell you what?

118
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,222
That I had a gut feeling
and needed to go to the Han River?

119
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,308
You should've told me before heading here.

120
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,853
When you were so busy
kissing up to your boss?

121
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,775
She could have shown up at the airport.

122
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,360
Or not.

123
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,861
That hurts!

124
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,614
I'm injured too.

125
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:04,121
Just stick to using your brain
and leave the legwork to the others.

126
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,499
That's why they're here.

127
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:11,796
Package delivery!

128
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,134
RECIPIENT: SONG YI-KYUNG

129
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,242
"Joan of Arc."

130
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,536
This is also a playscript.

131
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,748
It's the same binding.

132
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,999
Same as what?

133
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,086
As the books here
that K tried to get rid of.

134
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,381
JOAN OF ARC

135
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,968
What could this mean?

136
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,720
JOAN OF ARC

137
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,217
Go home and take a shower. Please.

138
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,804
Here's a victim of Medusa.

139
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,476
Did you find out anything?

140
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:52,813
No. I just came to check on you
since I hadn't seen you for days.

141
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,024
She's a Drama Club member.

142
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,944
Isn't it natural that she owns
some playscripts?

143
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:06,368
It's suspicious
how she had them case-bound

144
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:11,248
and stored them at her hideout.

145
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,541
"Suspicious"?

146
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,631
Do you think she'll show herself again?

147
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,425
Her cover has been blown,
and she knows we're after her.

148
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,470
If I were her, I'd just stay hidden.

149
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,180
You would.

150
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,391
That sounded offensive somehow.

151
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,811
-If I were her…
-Ms. Koo Kyung-yi?

152
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,148
Seasoned boneless chicken and draft beer…

153
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,192
Over here…

154
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,529
We're from the Bongbaek Station.

155
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,326
What would Bongbaek Station want from me?

156
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,162
I know you were a cop for a long time.

157
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,247
To show our respect,

158
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,416
we decided to come here
instead of summoning you.

159
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,298
If it's okay with you…

160
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:07,888
Let me see it.

161
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,431
Sorry?

162
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:13,519
There must be someone's handwriting
you'd like to compare mine with.

163
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,187
I know my handwriting the best.

164
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,773
So let's not waste paper
and let me do it myself.

165
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,277
You know that's not how it--

166
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,739
If you want to do it by the book,
follow the proper procedures to summon me.

167
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:32,371
I'm sorry. We should have
explained the situation first.

168
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,732
A local newspaper
received an anonymous letter.

169
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,025
A confession.

170
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,194
We got it before they released
an article about it.

171
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,072
The police's honor is at stake.

172
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,871
LETTER OF CONFESSION

173
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,165
"I would like to reveal the truth

174
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,834
about the former teacher
Jang Seong-u's suicide case."

175
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,254
"Jang Seong-u didn't commit suicide.
He was murdered."

176
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:26,008
"And the killer was me,
his wife, Koo Kyung-yi."

177
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,012
"After being guilt-ridden for years,
I'm confessing…"

178
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,558
Guilt? How corny.

179
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,393
Did you write it?

180
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,394
No.

181
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,105
We compared it to some of your writings,

182
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,107
-and they were--
-Similar.

183
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,234
But you deny it?

184
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,364
Can't you see how the "H" looks different?

185
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,076
You're implying
that someone else wrote this.

186
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,244
But who'd do such a thing?

187
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,789
Any ideas who it might be?

188
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,710
You're Mr. Jang's wife!

189
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,755
Had I known,
I would have attended his funeral.

190
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,966
I never thought
he'd do something like that.

191
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,177
We need to catch her
if we want any answers.

192
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,683
But we're wasting our time here.

193
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:26,443
Even if you admit that you wrote this,
it won't be legally valid.

194
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,404
So you can be honest with us.

195
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,617
Do you think I'm lying right now?

196
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,912
You looked anxious since we arrived.

197
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,581
Your record says that ever since he died--

198
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,542
That I've gone insane, right?

199
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,421
An alcoholic who displays antisocial
tendencies with an anxiety disorder.

200
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,924
Also that I may deny
writing the confession

201
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,385
since I'm an impulsive nutjob.

202
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,720
I didn't say that.

203
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,222
But I can tell by the way
you're looking at me.

204
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,682
Come on.

205
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,183
Since you denied it,

206
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:02,730
we'll consider the possibility
that someone forged your handwriting.

207
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,191
However, I'm afraid you need
to tell us what happened

208
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,111
on the day your husband passed away.

209
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,836
So this was what you were after.

210
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,382
Where were you and what were you doing
on the day of the incident?

211
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,343
I was looking for proof.

212
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,102
What proof?

213
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,897
Proof…

214
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,277
that…

215
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,698
he was a bad man.

216
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:06,126
SEONG-U

217
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:13,884
But…

218
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,805
now I'll never know.

219
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,350
I couldn't find anything.

220
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,353
And just as I was leaving the school,

221
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,606
I got a call from the station.

222
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:30,943
My husband had…

223
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,028
Are you okay?

224
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,073
We know you left the school
during his presumed time of death.

225
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,407
What we want to know is--

226
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,826
I found it suspicious.

227
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,831
I thought maybe someone
had disguised his death as suicide.

228
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,128
But the room where he hanged himself
was locked from the inside.

229
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,340
And I found no traces
of anyone having been there.

230
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,974
There was no suicide note.

231
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,979
But he had a clear motive.

232
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,487
The love of his life…

233
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,908
didn't trust him
and began to investigate him.

234
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,785
He must have been…

235
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,542
I just want to hear
your side of the story.

236
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,296
You can be honest with me, can't you?

237
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:37,176
He must have had no reason to live on.

238
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,725
Ms. Koo!

239
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,117
That's Yi-kyung,
the girl I told you about.

240
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,785
The one who's like you.

241
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,082
We're not alike at all.
And she's a terrible actress.

242
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,586
She's adorable though.

243
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,965
And she created the entire set by herself.

244
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,407
Someone died from a snake bite!

245
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,701
Somebody help!

246
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,574
Where are we going?

247
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,704
Take me to the container.
I need to check something.

248
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,710
It's okay.

249
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,753
I'm not sick. Hurry up.

250
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,547
Come on.

251
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,798
Hurry.

252
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,888
Faster.

253
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,767
Faster!

254
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,224
Just like how
it was disguised as a snake bite,

255
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,934
she disguised it with alcohol.

256
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:34,936
And…

257
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,372
One murder per book.

258
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,251
That means…

259
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,419
JOAN OF ARC

260
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,090
Details on her next murder
must be in here.

261
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,802
I can find the murder method in this.

262
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,014
But the question is,
who will be the victim?

263
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,773
Santa.

264
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,777
Santa, what is it this time?

265
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,688
A target K can't give up on…

266
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:46,776
Someone who she believes
she must kill at all costs…

267
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,948
When did he get here?

268
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,255
It's nice and crispy.

269
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,541
Je-hui.

270
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,005
K hasn't disappeared for good.

271
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,842
And she won't
until she carries out her next murder.

272
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,344
We can still catch her.

273
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,421
Yes. It's done.

274
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,594
Who do you think is the next target?

275
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:23,433
If I knew, I wouldn't be here

276
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,311
You're finally doing it.

277
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,270
Doing what?

278
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:31,149
Talking rhythmically.
That's a sign of getting old.

279
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,694
That's what old ladies do
when they're looking for something.

280
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,114
Where is the beef jerky

281
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,909
That I kept here to have later?

282
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:46,081
You're not any different

283
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,999
Where could it be?

284
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,419
You ate them all?

285
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,263
How could I have possibly eaten them all?

286
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,308
You get suspicious too easily.

287
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,603
I respect and admire my teammates.

288
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,105
-And--
-Hold on.

289
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,818
"Respect and admire"? And?

290
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:16,653
Go on.

291
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:27,330
Speaking of which,
someone gave me this advice one time.

292
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,833
"When you're stuck on something,

293
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,794
leave it to someone
who you least expect to solve it."

294
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,046
Who gave such a lousy piece of advice?

295
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,090
Seong-u.

296
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,680
When he couldn't control his class,

297
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:47,976
he'd appoint the quietest student
who didn't seem to have many friends

298
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,519
as the class president.

299
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,147
He said that opened his eyes
to new things.

300
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,233
You can't do it then.
You never trust an unreliable person.

301
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:59,112
An unreliable person

302
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:09,789
An unreliable person

303
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:15,670
An unreliable person

304
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,012
-I deserve better than this.
-Gyeong-su.

305
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,559
You remember my name.

306
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,814
We're looking for K's next target.

307
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,484
I'll give you my full trust,

308
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,820
so feel free
to share your opinion, Mr. Oh.

309
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,033
Well, I do have an idea.

310
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,085
What's the most common way
of catching a culprit?

311
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,546
The culprit always returns
to the scene of the crime.

312
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,381
Beef jerky. Is there more?

313
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,802
Putting yourself in their shoes.

314
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,386
Correct.

315
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,390
However, K is unlike
most murderers we've known.

316
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,143
Since we don't know
what kind of person she is,

317
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,937
we can't put ourselves in her shoes.

318
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,606
I see doubt in your eyes, Ms. Koo.

319
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,316
No, I trust you.

320
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:25,031
So my suggestion is this.
Let's not think in her shoes.

321
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:29,118
Let's dig into
the accomplices who helped her.

322
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:33,122
I may not be able to understand K,
but I can understand Yoon Jae-yeong.

323
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,344
Let's say someone did something to you
and you want to kill them.

324
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,638
Has that ever happened to you?

325
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,769
Then you get a call one day.

326
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,898
They say they'll kill that person.

327
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:04,821
Or the person you've wanted to kill

328
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,489
has died somehow.

329
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,909
Then you'd feel like you'd been chosen.

330
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,120
It'd be enough to make you feel special.

331
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:16,666
Gosh, you talk too much.

332
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:21,671
I'll cut to the chase then.
Feeling special,

333
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:24,966
they'd want to brag about it somehow.

334
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:25,967
I would.

335
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,177
-To people around them?
-No.

336
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,513
They wouldn't be able to do it openly,

337
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,599
so they'd be sly about it.

338
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:37,145
Now, we need to find out how…

339
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,483
Any good ideas, Santa?

340
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,282
"Image search"?

341
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:53,077
No one would be stupid enough
to upload a photo of…

342
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,545
There's one.

343
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,884
How did you know?

344
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,596
It was uploaded to Witter.

345
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,730
"Smelly Prince"?

346
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,319
A cockroach in the playroom.
Yes, that's me.

347
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,446
Just kill me already.

348
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,408
Comments I heard today.
"You're human garbage. An idiot."

349
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:35,745
"You're just useless."
I can't say they're wrong.

350
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,622
Why me of all people?

351
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,582
I want to reveal their true faces.

352
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,209
Give me courage.

353
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,086
I'll kill him and kill myself too.

354
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,463
I couldn't sleep a wink
and I'm back to work.

355
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:46,923
Maybe I'll die.

356
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,263
KIM SU-YONG

357
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,600
He must have
quit his job at an IT company.

358
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,314
Stop. That's him.

359
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,149
OUR BOSS LOOKS AFTER THE EMPLOYEES

360
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,239
He's a celebrity.

361
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,995
Kim Su-yong! Where the hell is he?

362
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,330
Where is he hiding after ruining my life?

363
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,332
He's already quit.

364
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,042
-What? He quit?
-Yes.

365
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,752
-He's not here?
-No, he isn't!

366
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,921
-Goodness.
-What about my money?

367
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,173
-What are you doing?
-What about my money?

368
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,094
Call 911!

369
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,264
-Call 911!
-Call 911!

370
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,306
Are you okay?

371
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,058
-That must have hurt.
-I'm all right.

372
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,561
I'm fine!

373
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,897
That must've hurt. Are you okay?

374
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,607
Oh, no!

375
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,985
-Call 911.
-Hurry.

376
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,319
That looks painful.

377
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,404
My goodness.

378
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,322
Something's fishy.

379
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,998
VICTORY CLEANER

380
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,212
BEER

381
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,224
YOU THINK YOU'LL BE HAPPY?
CRY A RIVER!

382
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,684
TRAITOR

383
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,311
HOW DARE YOU LEAVE US?

384
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:27,106
WASTED THE COMPANY'S MONEY
AND HIS OWN LIFE

385
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,663
Such lovely photos

386
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,624
FIRST STEP TOWARD JUSTICE

387
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,212
Smile.

388
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,588
Loosen up.

389
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,507
One, two, three.

390
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,716
FIRST STEP TOWARD JUSTICE

391
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,223
Mr. Kim, hurry up.

392
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,390
Coming.

393
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,895
I'll take the photo now.

394
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,147
One, two, three.

395
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,570
Su-yong, let's do better
from now on. Okay?

396
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,822
My dear Su-yong!

397
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,535
Excuse me.

398
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,912
Are you from pest control?

399
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:24,789
Yes, sir.

400
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,460
There's a cockroach in the basement.

401
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,796
I see.

402
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,715
Let me take a look right now.

403
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,095
We can't reach him either.

404
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,264
He just left overnight without a word.

405
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,640
He caused us a headache.

406
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:46,227
I knew he was a troublemaker.

407
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:51,649
He borrowed a hefty sum from me.

408
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,696
Did he cause trouble here as well?

409
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,532
I don't want to be spreading gossip,

410
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:03,953
but he was caught
illegally selling company equipment.

411
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,206
Our boss is very forgiving.

412
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,376
He should've been sacked,
but Mr. Ko tried his best

413
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,503
to give him another chance.

414
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,797
Is that so?

415
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,841
Don't you have a photo from then?

416
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,509
Right. I do.

417
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,888
Take a look at this.

418
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,933
You'll know what kind of person he is.

419
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,733
There's only one thing
that breaks my heart.

420
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,819
It's that your actions weren't honest.

421
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,405
But we all make mistakes.

422
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,534
Since Mr. Kim wants to give
his most heartfelt apology.

423
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,622
So let bygones be bygones
and try to work together again.

424
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,835
I'm sorry.

425
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,171
I apologize.

426
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,464
I AM SORRY.
FOR JUSTICE!

427
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,647
-I'll do better from now on!
-You better.

428
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:16,025
And keep your word. You'll never find
a better boss than Mr. Ko.

429
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,861
This is hilarious. I should take a photo.

430
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,795
At times like this,

431
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:39,340
you should show the whole team
how sincere you are.

432
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,549
Pardon?

433
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,343
You will, right?

434
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:10,204
I AM SORRY.
FOR JUSTICE!

435
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:33,394
PLAYROOM

436
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,954
Spot one cockroach,

437
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:55,875
and I can assure you that there are
over 2,000 around here.

438
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:56,917
Two thousand?

439
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,841
Over there!

440
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,181
Excuse me.

441
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,932
I'll leave you to it!

442
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,067
It's just water. It won't kill you.

443
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:23,944
So?

444
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,031
What are you doing here?

445
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,169
What does it say?

446
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,216
"Just kill me already"?

447
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,385
JUST KILL ME ALREADY

448
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,803
ALARM
REMIND IN 5 MINUTES

449
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,227
-It's time to take our supplements.
-Supplements?

450
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:22,920
Thank you.

451
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,673
Did you finish the homework
Mr. Ko gave you?

452
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,385
Mr. Ko provides us with these supplements.

453
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,429
This is how much he cares for us.

454
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,098
Is that so?

455
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,523
These are Mr. Kim's belongings
that he left behind.

456
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,776
See if you can sell any of these,

457
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,611
although I can't guarantee anything.

458
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,659
KIM SU-YONG

459
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:57,913
On top of being
a victim of illicit filming,

460
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:01,834
our client was also accused
of being a murderer.

461
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:06,255
I will do my best to erase such videos
throughout the web

462
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:11,260
and help the victims
return to their normal lives.

463
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,346
I see courage in her eyes.

464
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:18,225
Kim Su-yong is indeed abroad.
K must have given him an alibi.

465
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:22,813
Judging by the vibe I got,
I think he was bullied at work.

466
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,400
Could the next target
be one of the employees?

467
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,945
Ko Dam can see
all his employees' monitors from his desk.

468
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:33,324
Mr. Kim was shoved
into a room without any windows.

469
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,286
I'm sure his boss played a part in it.

470
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,708
Let's ask him ourselves.

471
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,793
-Ask Ko Dam?
-Yes.

472
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:47,963
Okay.

473
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:55,012
Wait. We might be able
to find a lead here.

474
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,849
Who am I kidding?

475
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,145
I don't even see a scheduler.

476
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,696
Can't you see that this is fake?

477
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,220
LAW FIRM GOTHAM

478
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,149
But that's like a part of my body.

479
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,956
It's just a can.

480
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,300
INSPECTION, DISINFECTION, STERILIZATION

481
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,469
Why did he keep this?

482
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,971
There's nothing inside.

483
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:31,650
Oh, it's a startup disk.
I know what that is.

484
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,448
What's all this?

485
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,246
Damn it. Did he see me?

486
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,374
I'm sorry.

487
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,585
I should have greeted you at the entrance.

488
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,880
Ms. Yoon has told me so much about you.

489
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:54,590
What did she say?

490
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,425
That she owes you a lot.

491
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,469
I'd like to thank you as well.

492
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,888
You're a CEO, a lawyer,

493
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,766
and also running for office.
We're sorry for barging in.

494
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,225
Running for office? Nonsense.

495
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,896
I'm too busy to even think about that.

496
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,900
People seem to want
a righteous person like you to be elected.

497
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,031
Please have some.
It's sweet and refreshing.

498
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,741
Goodness, you didn't have to.

499
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,744
This is my favorite drink.

500
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:30,042
Right. So what can I help you with?

501
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:34,046
One of our clients
has been bullied for a long time.

502
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,548
But it isn't something
our company can help them with.

503
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:40,219
Since you're a lawyer, I thought maybe
you'd know how I could help them.

504
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,056
Are they preparing
a lawsuit or a formal complaint?

505
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:48,102
Rather than legal proceedings,
they seem to want revenge.

506
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,480
I'm afraid I can't help you with that.

507
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,942
There's something we need to check first.

508
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:58,695
We have yet to confirm
if their claims are true.

509
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:02,116
We don't know
whether they are really in pain.

510
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,534
There's no evidence, you see.

511
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:08,414
Pain is something
that can't be shared with others.

512
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:12,501
There's no way for a third party
to tell whether it's true or not.

513
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:16,213
Don't you think their cries of pain

514
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,715
are the real evidence?

515
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,178
You must trust others easily.

516
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,472
I do get double-crossed a lot.

517
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:38,402
All right, then.
I'll trust you and confide in you.

518
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:39,695
He's a young man.

519
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:43,740
He claims that he was
bullied incessantly by his boss.

520
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,994
He was forced to stand
on a desk for hours on end.

521
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,288
The boss encouraged the other employees

522
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:52,166
to make him an outcast and assault him.

523
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:56,044
As someone who's also running
a company, my heart goes out to him.

524
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,172
Despite being grown-ups,

525
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:02,718
they always tend to bully
one person like little kids.

526
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:06,513
But it's not like I can scold them
since they're all adults.

527
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:12,895
The company should
provide him with a safe work environment

528
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,772
where everyone can get along.

529
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,987
How can we help him?

530
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,241
You should collect
the records he has of his time there,

531
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,659
like diary entries or texts.

532
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,537
Medical records would be great.

533
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,916
I don't think
he could even think that far,

534
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,292
but I'll ask.

535
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,045
And this.

536
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:49,181
This is my personal number.

537
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:52,351
Tell him I'd love to help him
and to give me a call.

538
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,145
And he doesn't need to worry
about paying me.

539
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,107
Why would you go this far?

540
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,360
Because I can hear it.

541
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,529
His screams of suffering.

542
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,115
Did you see that?

543
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,661
He wore worn-out shoes and a cheap watch.

544
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:13,163
He's too perfect if you ask me.

545
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,250
He'd be a pain in the neck
if he ran for mayor.

546
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,044
I don't think
he took part in the bullying.

547
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,046
Will you investigate the employees?

548
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,966
-Five, four…
-Kyung-yi.

549
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,552
…three, two, one.

550
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,594
Aren't you coming?

551
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,852
I'll leave them here.

552
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:44,903
How may I help you?

553
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:52,369
Did you drop something?

554
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:12,389
He'll never reveal his true feelings.

555
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:15,642
No matter how furious he gets,
he won't show it right away.

556
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,103
Goodbye.

557
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,821
Kim Su-yong…

558
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:32,367
Kim Su-yong, you bastard.

559
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,622
Kim Su-yong.

560
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:41,752
How dare you try to get cute with me?

561
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,546
How dare you?

562
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:49,259
How dare you?

563
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,471
How dare you get cute with me?

564
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,139
Damn it!

565
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,141
There they come.

566
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:07,402
Did something happen in there?
They put out an APB on Kim Su-yong.

567
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,322
He sure is incredible.

568
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,324
What about the disk?

569
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:14,493
Turns out, it was a startup disk.

570
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:17,162
It's programmed
to upload files automatically.

571
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:20,832
It was set up so that hundreds of files
would be uploaded to Mironet.

572
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,334
It was quite meticulous.

573
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,627
What kinds of files?

574
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,255
How do I put this?

575
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,634
They're the kind of files
that I've never laid eyes on before.

576
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:37,724
Does this mean that Kim Su-yong
ran a side gig on Mironet?

577
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,194
Look at him.

578
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,279
What's he doing?

579
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,671
What? Where did they go?

580
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,133
-I'm right here.
-My goodness!

581
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:14,720
Why were you spying on us?
Who put you up to this?

582
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,723
I'm a democratic citizen.

583
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,933
Call the police.

584
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:22,436
-Are there no police?
-No!

585
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,478
Gosh.

586
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,605
Samsy from Crazy About Mystery TV?

587
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,942
-Are you a subscriber?
-My goodness! Samsy!

588
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,987
Goodness, Samsy!

589
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,031
Gosh, Mr. Samsy!

590
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,962
You better erase the footage
you have on us while I'm still being nice.

591
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:51,131
Allow me to apologize on her behalf.

592
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,424
Your autograph, please.

593
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,886
I'm willing to believe
that you're not Ko Dam's people

594
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,847
since she's subscribed to my channel.

595
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,015
Of course.

596
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,143
So tell me.

597
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:07,105
What were you doing at Ko Dam's law firm?

598
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,482
For a new video?

599
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,900
CAM…

600
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,239
This is an extremely delicate matter.

601
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,410
Please make a vow.

602
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,287
I won't tell a soul.

603
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,165
Me neither.

604
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,293
What are you--

605
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,669
I can vouch for her.

606
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:37,135
If I told you that Ko Dam,

607
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:40,722
the righteous lawyer,
was actually two-faced,

608
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,183
would you believe me?

609
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:46,895
No way.

610
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,606
Elaborate.

611
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,691
A never-before-seen footage.

612
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:58,406
For the past five months,
I've been following him around.

613
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:02,494
And for the first time ever,

614
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:06,998
I filmed him communicating with aliens.

615
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,459
-Seriously?
-I'm leaving.

616
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,546
Ms. Na, wait for me.

617
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,673
Wait for me.

618
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,926
CRAZY ABOUT MYSTERY TV

619
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,344
One who seeks the truth

620
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,473
is like a lonely wolf
prowling in the desert.

621
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,309
May I see the footage?

622
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:32,023
It wasn't easy to get this footage

623
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,609
since Ko Dam was extremely cautious
of his surroundings.

624
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,112
In the footage,
he's on the phone with someone.

625
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:41,324
Once you watch it,
you will be utterly shocked.

626
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,118
What is it?

627
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:52,752
Uploadyay ethay ampuscay footage
on ethay ainmay agepay.

628
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:53,962
Did you hear that?

629
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:59,134
Uploadyay ethay ampuscay footage

630
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:03,805
on ethay ainmay agepay.

631
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,348
What was that?

632
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,851
He seems to be speaking in tongues…

633
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:18,403
"Upload the campus footage
on the main page."

634
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,657
How did you decipher that?

635
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,367
Are you…

636
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,580
It's pig latin.
Haven't you tried this with your friends?

637
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:30,457
I didn't have any friends then.

638
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,336
"Upload the campus footage
on the main page"?

639
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:35,545
What does that mean?

640
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:40,008
It must mean
the video with Yoon Mi-ae in it.

641
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:43,011
It caused a huge commotion
because someone died over it.

642
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,680
Didn't Ko Dam say
that he completely erased…

643
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,685
-He didn't.
-Even if you erase it,

644
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,562
it keeps popping up on Mironet.

645
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,524
It's on the main page as we speak.

646
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:58,944
CAMPUS FEMALE COED
ORIGINAL SEX VIDEO

647
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:06,409
It's the same file
Kim Su-yong was uploading.

648
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:07,786
What?

649
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:10,538
KD Peace Lab uploaded that footage?

650
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,916
But Ko Dam is helping Ms. Yoon.

651
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,502
And then he uploaded it again
behind her back

652
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,754
through his own company.

653
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:20,548
Or should I say, Mironet?

654
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,426
He'd do this for money?

655
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,180
I don't know what he is,
but he's definitely not human.

656
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,516
-I'm shocked.
-I'm shocked.

657
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,646
-I'm dumbfounded.
-I'm dumbfounded.

658
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,815
-Samsy.
-Yes?

659
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,235
-I apologize in advance.
-Why?

660
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,328
You should find a new topic.

661
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:07,262
Be careful, or you'll put a hole
through your hand.

662
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,150
-Mr. Kim!
-Yes, ma'am.

663
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:22,861
This new hand cream is so slippery.

664
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,196
This is different from shooting a gun.

665
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,490
When did you learn archery?

666
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,368
My father taught me when I was little.

667
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,495
I see.

668
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,582
Before your mother
ruined your entire family?

669
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,425
We've found K's next target.

670
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:47,927
Who is it?

671
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,014
Shall we walk?

672
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:58,188
You haven't told me
what you're going to do with K.

673
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:00,607
What? Didn't we agree

674
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:03,401
to talk about that after catching her?

675
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,571
Why are you so determined

676
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,616
to catch her?

677
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:14,829
A terrifying killer is on a spree
murdering people left and right.

678
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,790
Someone needs to catch her.

679
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,709
I'm the one risking my life,

680
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,253
so I'd appreciate it
if you could be honest with me.

681
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:28,384
But you're not one of my people yet.

682
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,221
Even if I trusted you,

683
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:33,848
how could I trust your teammates?

684
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:37,143
If I told you what I'll do with her,

685
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,813
they'll blabber about it.

686
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,273
Just thinking about it makes my ears ache.

687
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:45,860
Democracy sure is
a pain in the neck. Don't you agree?

688
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:49,322
You don't trust your subordinates.
You control them.

689
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:50,949
I see.

690
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,202
How?

691
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,496
One of them is a coward.

692
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,916
He always flees
when he's put in a dangerous situation.

693
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,210
Just scaring him will do the trick.

694
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:08,091
Another one has a good memory
but lacks insight.

695
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:11,636
He can't make conclusions
even when he's given a lead.

696
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,513
I just need to confuse him a bit.

697
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,015
As for Kyung-yi…

698
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,562
I'm the one who dragged her out.

699
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,815
If needed, I can shove her
back into her room.

700
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,902
Judging by what you just said,

701
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,030
you want something from me, right?

702
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:36,744
I want to be by your son's side
when he enters the Blue House.

703
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:41,833
Hey, Mr. Kim!

704
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,255
Hey, Mr. Kim!

705
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,804
I'm sorry, ma'am!
I just wanted to take a look!

706
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,098
Oh, dear! Did I hit you?

707
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:09,569
K shouldn't have been born.

708
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,447
Whoever it is,

709
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:16,117
someone needs to make it
as if nothing's ever happened.

710
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:19,996
So who is it?

711
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,459
Ko Dam is her next target.

712
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,672
AUNT PIGGY'S

713
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:43,019
Let me show you
how to enjoy this even more.

714
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:45,772
First, pick up
a piece of lettuce and perilla leaf.

715
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,524
Place the perilla leaf this way.

716
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,068
Then place a piece of garlic on top.

717
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:52,487
And then the meat…

718
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,449
Why are you in such a hurry?

719
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:16,302
If K is really hell-bent
on killing Ko Dam,

720
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:19,013
shouldn't we just let her?

721
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:22,934
Even if we report this,
he will only get a slap on the wrist.

722
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:26,729
Have you gone insane?

723
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:30,233
Ms. Na and I almost died because of her.

724
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,360
You crossed the line.

725
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,207
But Ko Dam is such an evil bastard.

726
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,211
Bastard?

727
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:52,964
Yes, that's true.

728
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,510
Gosh, I wish I could just kill him.

729
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:58,595
Then do that.

730
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,348
But I lack the courage to do that.

731
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,976
Do you think courage is
what you need to commit murder?

732
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,396
There are two things
you need to kill someone.

733
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,567
I, too, have had the urge to kill someone.

734
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,986
But I lacked those two things.

735
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:16,154
What are they?

736
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:18,072
Foolishness and arrogance.

737
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,952
You need to have both to be able to kill,
but I had neither of them.

738
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,749
Hey! You're burning all the meat!

739
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:30,793
Stop acting so serious and flip the meat!

740
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,963
-Ma'am.
-What?

741
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,131
Three more servings, please.

742
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,178
What took you so long?

743
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:42,472
Kim Su-yong is
coming back to Korea in a week.

744
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:48,811
She'll kill Ko Dam
while Mr. Kim has a clear alibi.

745
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,189
We have a week left then.

746
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:57,612
It's a tight schedule for all of us.

747
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:05,703
How did it go?

748
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:08,081
I spoke with her.

749
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:11,125
Is this the meat Gyeong-su craved so much?

750
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,461
Well, it looks delicious.

751
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:20,176
Enjoy it while you can.
We'll be busy starting tomorrow.

752
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,578
Why did you want to see me?

753
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:51,874
Where is it?

754
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,043
Here it is.

755
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,422
KIM JONG-HAN LAW FIRM
LAWYER KIM JONG-HAN

756
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,298
I already have a lawyer.

757
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,927
Switch over to him. I heard he's reliable.

758
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:04,470
Why?

759
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,723
Is there something wrong with Mr. Ko?

760
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,766
Oh, him?

761
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:14,313
Turns out, he's quite evil.

762
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:17,316
I can't say I'm a good person either.

763
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:20,528
Gosh, just listen to me.

764
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:23,865
He'll call you tomorrow morning,
so at least talk to him.

765
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:25,324
Don't worry about the costs.

766
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,873
Did you have barbecued bulgogi?

767
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,125
Yes.

768
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,423
It's not bad to smell barbecued bulgogi

769
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:42,842
first thing after staying home
for an entire week.

770
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,973
They even deliver. It's Aunt Piggy's.

771
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,614
-Geon-uk.
-Yes?

772
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:07,366
Wait.

773
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,702
Do I snore in my sleep?

774
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,371
I've been trying to fix it.

775
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:14,582
What's the matter?

776
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:19,378
It's such a hassle
picking you up every morning.

777
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:21,464
You live too far.

778
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:25,343
Don't pick me up then.

779
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:28,054
I'll take the subway to work
like I used to.

780
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:33,351
How about you save me the hassle
and go to work together?

781
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:35,853
What?

782
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,981
Let's move in together.

783
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:43,444
You, Darong, and me.

784
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:47,865
I guess you don't want to.

785
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,827
Not at all. I'm just taken aback.

786
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:54,205
I don't know if I deserve this.

787
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:55,790
Why not?

788
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:59,919
What is it?
Have you been doing things behind my back?

789
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,298
Aren't you coming?

790
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,800
We'll be there soon.

791
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,636
Take your time.

792
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:10,471
I'm not rushing you.

793
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:12,890
Let's go.

794
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:17,937
Dae-ho.

795
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:27,572
I'd like that. Let's move in together.

796
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:07,737
He was glaring at me.

797
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:11,574
-I told him he should've thrown it away.
-That's right.

798
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,498
You're right. It is a woman.

799
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:23,002
-She reeks.
-That's rich coming from you.

800
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:24,462
Hold on.

801
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:27,965
Excuse me, miss!

802
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:32,178
Would you like to have a drink with us?

803
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,512
Then how about a meal?

804
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,765
It will be our treat.

805
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:38,684
How does that sound? I think she likes it.

806
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:40,937
Let's go.

807
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,397
Come on, now. You should keep walking.

808
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:46,025
-Did you drink?
-Yes.

809
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:48,778
Just go, all right?

810
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:55,451
Come on. Go.

811
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,249
Did you come to save them, not me?

812
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,918
You don't need my help.

813
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,212
That's true.

814
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,090
You look terrible.

815
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:12,176
Where are you going?
Let's go to the hospital.

816
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,179
You came way too late.

817
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:19,141
I knew you'd take some time,
but I didn't think it'd be this long.

818
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:22,728
I searched every nook and cranny for you.

819
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:27,733
We should carry out our plan.
We're on a tight schedule.

820
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,527
While you're looking like that?

821
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,321
Is that for me?

822
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:40,079
All right. Thanks.

823
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,164
Thank you very much.

824
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,378
Eat slowly.

825
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,775
What a collection.

826
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:12,153
Do you want me
to drink it and kill myself?

827
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:16,032
Well, someone will die.

828
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:17,450
Did you buy them?

829
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,828
No. That woman from
the Hongcheon greenhouse brought them.

830
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:24,498
She thanked me for killing her brother
and kept asking how she could help.

831
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,794
So I accepted her offer this one time.

832
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:31,505
You said he deserved to die

833
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:34,675
for ruining his sister's life.

834
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:37,386
That bastard deserved to die.

835
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:39,847
I knew you'd understand.

836
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:45,478
Hold on.

837
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,983
There are so many people to kill,
but only one of me.

838
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,943
If Ko Dam is next,

839
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:55,112
it has to be perfect this time.

840
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:58,949
-That woman is watching him.
-What?

841
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:01,952
That's why you need to make it perfect.

842
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,997
My aunt is already in the US,

843
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,625
so I was going to fly out
after killing this scumbag.

844
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:09,710
But it's getting more interesting!

845
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:13,881
Let's do a perfect job!

846
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:15,674

33RD ALUMNI MEETING

01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:28,098
There will be a showcase demonstrating

01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:29,725
This will be when K strikes.

867
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:33,771
This will be the main course.

868
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:35,522
We can't just let him die.

869
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:36,690
We'll have to stop her.

870
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:40,694
That's what K is like. We can't expect
when and where she'll strike.

871
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:43,739
-What do we do then?
-She'll have her people out there.

872
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:45,658
That will be the chink in her armor.

873
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:48,077
You'll get caught if you keep using that.
We need to make this perfect.

The showcase will proceed as scheduled,

875

We want the same thing, Ms. Jung.

877
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:58,671
We both don't want anyone to die
