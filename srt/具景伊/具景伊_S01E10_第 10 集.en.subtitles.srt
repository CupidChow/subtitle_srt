1
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,506
I'M ALL YOURS

2
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,140
Ms. Koo?

3
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,730
What is it?

4
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,667
What are you doing? Pick it up.

5
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,301
What is this?

6
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,638
EPISODE 10

7
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,933
A FEW HOURS AGO

8
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,267
I'm not lying.

9
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,979
While they were making kimchi,
Dragon said she'd kill Rabbit.

10
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,731
It was crazy.

11
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,817
So Rabbit didn't go to Hawaii?

12
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,318
Hawaii?

13
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,570
He got buried in a kimchi pot.

14
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,406
-That's unbelievable.
-It is.

15
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,243
I could never live with Dragon.

16
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,704
What about his surfing picture
that was posted?

17
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,872
It was all fake.

18
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,915
-Was it?
-Yes.

19
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,750
-Was it Photoshopped?
-Yes.

20
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,087
-I thought it was real.
-Poor Rabbit.

21
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,131
I got it.

22
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:21,808
REAL TRUTH JOURNAL

23
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,191
SHE MADE KIMCHI OUT OF HER SON

24
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,824
I can't believe there's a spiderweb.

25
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,725
"100 GREAT PEOPLE OF KOREA"

26
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:19,073
In the beautiful land of Korea

27
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,660
-Dangun laid the foundation
-Who are you?

28
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,456
With humanitarian ideals
He founded the nation

29
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:30,084
There are a lot of great people
From generation to generation

30
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,544
It will tighten if you move.

31
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,507
Don't move.

32
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,469
Run through the Manchurian Fields

33
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,262
Gwanggaeto the Great

34
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,098
General Isabu of Silla

35
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,608
HEO HYEON-TAE, ALSO KNOWN AS RABBIT…

36
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,193
Is "Rabbit" Heo Yeon-tae?

37
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,656
So where did he go?

38
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,368
I don't know

39
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,663
Why does she want me to kill
a tabloid journalist?

40
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,290
Got anything else?

41
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,503
You have ten seconds.

42
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,838
Or people will think you killed yourself.

43
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,550
-Over there.
-Where?

44
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,429
It's next to the beer.
The container with the white lid.

45
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,641
Don't leave me here.

46
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:53,584
The history continues

47
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,943
You made all that fuss
just to kill one person.

48
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,697
I heard you blew up the entire karaoke.

49
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:30,788
That made me really happy though.

50
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,925
I got you.

51
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:47,221
It made the smoke rise and rain flowers.

52
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,683
Your words are too difficult
for me to understand.

53
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,478
I didn't want it to be another boring job.

54
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,397
Plus you said you'd pick up the pieces.

55
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,733
I wanted to test your ability.

56
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,402
Don't you worry.

57
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:05,281
I should've worked with you sooner.

58
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,993
Why did I let a coward do the job?

59
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,122
Are you comfortable?

60
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,833
Lie down. It's comfortable.

61
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,511
Is there anyone else?

62
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,346
Are there more bad men?

63
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,476
What does it feel like
when you're on the job?

64
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,146
Why would you want to know?

65
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,403
Does it feel like
everything is going your way?

66
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,658
Like you can do whatever you want?

67
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,751
I feel great when things go
the way I planned.

68
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,712
But more than that…

69
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,632
Well…

70
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:10,388
It feels as if I'm doing
what needs to be done.

71
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,561
Open your eyes. You look creepy.

72
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,106
Director Yong!

73
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,358
He startled me.

74
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,986
-They're going to make the announcement!
-Hold it.

75
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,197
Don't move.

76
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,535
Look at him.

77
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,872
What do you think?

78
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,166
Here's the result
of the Future Hope Party's

79
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,877
mayoral primary election.

80
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,587
Does he need to poop?

81
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,633
Heo Seong-tae was elected

82
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,886
as the mayoral candidate
for the Future Hope Party.

83
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,557
I feel great at times like these.

84
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,436
When I can easily see through people

85
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,355
and when things go exactly the way I want.

86
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,356
Dear citizens.

87
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,612
I'll honor the opinion of the members
of the party wholeheartedly.

88
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,447
Thank you once again.

89
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,368
K, you're going to get busier.

90
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,962
This feels nice.

91
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,884
AND AT THE PRESENT TIME…

92
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,930
Gosh, how many years
was it for abandoning a corpse?

93
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,391
It's a maximum of seven years.

94
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:42,021
If I go to jail for this,
my parents will pass out.

95
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,399
Did Yi-kyung send it?

96
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,734
In my opinion,

97
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:50,321
Director Yong and Yi-kyung
don't go together well.

98
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,533
I knew she'd get in touch
with you somehow.

99
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,285
So who is this supposed to be?

100
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,038
We can ask him.

101
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,124
Hey, mister.

102
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,919
She must have lost it.

103
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,379
Mister, wake up.

104
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,923
He opened his eyes!

105
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,843
He's moving!

106
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,266
Why can't you tell the difference
between the living and the dead?

107
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,685
He's alive.

108
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,313
A dead person
wouldn't have a complexion like this.

109
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,109
It's the basics.

110
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,735
Please spare me.

111
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,825
What does she want him to do
with a living person?

112
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,704
She wants him dead.

113
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:49,797
It was a woman, right?

114
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,593
She strangled your neck.

115
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,222
I'll spare you, so tell me.

116
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,557
What did she say?

117
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,733
Don't be blinded by money

118
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,986
Let's listen to General Choe Yeong

119
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,904
Is this why you have to die?

120
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,823
I gave you what you wanted, now let me go.

121
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,742
-What?
-Please?

122
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,910
I'll take a look at it first.

123
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,996
It's what Director Yong is looking for.

124
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,831
It's what Ko Dam gave me.

125
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,875
-Ko Dam?
-Ko Dam?

126
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,883
There was a rumor that he was
gathering dirt on influential people.

127
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,344
He gave me one of them.

128
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,805
An influential man like Ko Dam

129
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,725
gave info to a journalist like you?

130
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,686
It sounds fishy.

131
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,439
It was given to me

132
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,901
because I was infamous
for my articles on the Heo family.

133
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,737
What you said upset me.

134
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,698
You probably stole it. A tip-off, my ass.

135
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,951
Why are you so suspicious?

136
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,413
Have some faith.

137
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:09,335
How you got it isn't important.
The source is Ko Dam for sure.

138
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,546
So what was it?

139
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,258
It was a ten-minute
surveillance video of a dock.

140
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,677
It was a sunny day

141
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,013
by the beach.

142
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,849
There were a few boats.

143
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,853
The waves were crashing.

144
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,817
"I can't live like this."
Hong Gyeong-nae

145
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,404
The short-lived reign of Kim Ok-gyun

146
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,530
The seagulls

147
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,990
were crying.

148
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,909
An Jung-geun is a patriot

149
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,536
Lee Wan-yong is a traitor

150
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:47,623
The history continues

151
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,751
Is that all?

152
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,754
Yes. That's all.

153
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,427
So nothing happened in the video.

154
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,263
He gave you false info to screw you over.

155
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,809
Was the dock in Tongyeong?

156
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,687
Is it a famous place?

157
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,022
How does everyone know?

158
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,817
She knew it too.

159
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,655
-Long live Ryu Gwan-sun, Dosan An Chang-ho
-I know there's something.

160
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:23,534
Children's Day Bang Jeong-hwan

161
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,871
Lee Su-il and Shim Sun-ae

162
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,916
-I don't have time.
-General's Son Kim Du-han

163
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,002
Let's… Yi Sang?

164
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,136
The history continues

165
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,515
The history continues

166
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:54,315
You sang fantastically! Good job!

167
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:10,456
Mister. When you wake up,
you'll see a man with a mean face.

168
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,416
"When you wake up,

169
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,252
you'll see a man with a mean face."

170
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,463
Can you tell him to find out what this is?

171
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:26,555
"Can you tell him
to find out what this is?"

172
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,183
That's what she said.

173
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,477
"A mean face."

174
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,232
Me?

175
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,901
Are you high?

176
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,862
Where's the video?

177
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,292
I almost got it.

178
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:56,794
I got it.

179
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,255
Got it.

180
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:01,966
Darn it.

181
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,729
Who should I give it to?

182
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,158
What? Me?

183
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,412
What? Me? Why me?

184
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,039
K told you to do it.

185
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,001
Why are you doing this to me?

186
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,506
I kept it

187
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,634
because he said this could bring
Heo Seong-tae down.

188
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,803
I couldn't find anything though.

189
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:52,099
Since Director Yong
ordered her to kill me,

190
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,643
there must be something.

191
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,229
Get off me! You stink!

192
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,772
What's wrong with you?

193
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,151
Do I smell?

194
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,374
Please turn the light on.

195
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,257
A seagull flies by
at 4 minutes and 2 seconds

196
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,967
and the wind blows
at 5 minutes and 35 seconds.

197
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,052
So?

198
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,220
I'm just saying.

199
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,271
Wait. What are you doing?

200
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,981
Are you deleting something?

201
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,233
Could you get this idiot away from me?

202
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,736
Surveillance videos
are recorded in such a way

203
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,780
that the new data overwrites the old data.

204
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:51,241
What remains of the old data
remains in the form of image noise.

205
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,580
They couldn't erase it.

206
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,624
Who are these people?

207
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,960
Lee Jun-hyeon.

208
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,504
People who were there that day.

209
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,464
Han Man-gu, Kim Seop-ryong, Lee Jun-hyeon…

210
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:09,093
There's one, two, three, four, five…

211
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,054
There's one more.

212
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,933
There was someone

213
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,310
who we left out?

214
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,313
Did you think you were perfect?

215
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,031
Tell K to contact me herself

216
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:36,036
if she wants to know
who it is that she missed.

217
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,253
Can I go home now?

218
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,437
Do I have to be locked up
in here for 15 years?

219
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,107
And eat live octopus when I leave?

220
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,697
I don't know what you mean,
but 15 years would be too much.

221
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:16,535
I'm giving you my food because
Appleboycat asked me for a favor.

222
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,122
Honestly you snore so much
and that really tires me out.

223
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,584
Well…

224
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,300
Is this

225
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,053
place safe?

226
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,096
Is someone coming to kill you?

227
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,643
I didn't mean to do that.

228
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,789

231

REAL TRUTH JOURNAL

232
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,441
Is this Amudda Quick?

233
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,154
We deliver without asking any questions.

234
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,782
You sound just like him.

235
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,076
Let's go.

236
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,914
AMUDDA QUICK

237
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:54,133
I told you she was up to something.

238
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,426
Where did she hide it?

239
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,138
I believe she sent it
to her former accomplice.

240
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,265
What is it that she stole?

241
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,351
I'm going to have to find out.

242
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,562
Mr. Kim, pull it together.

243
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,480
I'm not here to wait for you.

244
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,274
Don't report to me if you don't know!

245
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,651
If I find out…

246
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,736
-What?
-What should I do

247
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,780
after I find out what it is?

248
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,535
He pooped.

249
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,623
Do you really need to ask?
Kill them off quietly.

250
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,042
DRIVE SLOWLY

251
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,221
LET'S KEEP EXERCISING

252
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,640
There's only one way you can live.

253
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,766
Turn yourself in.

254
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,270
Director Yong won't be able to
kill someone in police custody.

255
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,403
Why did she have to say that?

256
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,573
She's messing with my head.

257
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,428
I'm here to collect my debt.

258
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,805
You are? Where are you?

259
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,183
"Don't make any excuses."

260
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,268
"I'm here to collect
the money you borrowed."

261
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,023
There was

262
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,651
one more person on the ship that day.

263
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,863
What? Did we miss someone?

264
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,660
Your teacher said to directly contact her
if you want to know who it was.

265
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,419
Is she alive?

266
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,799
I knew it.
Then we'll be able to find it quickly.

267
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,009
What will we be able to find?

268
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,637
The person you and I really want to kill.

269
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,889
Aren't you excited?

270
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,352
Say, "Please help me, Geon-uk."

271
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,311
Hey!

272
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,697
Can't I read a book?

273
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,542
Mister. Do you want to see something?

274
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,461
I can move my ear.

275
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,509
Do you see that? It's moving, right?

276
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,597
Did you see that?

277
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,393
Song Yi-kyung. Song--

278
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,360
Is Mr. An Geon-uk home?

279
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,160
I'd like to ask you a question.

280
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,122
Did she really report me?

281
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,424
Are you Mr. An Geon-uk?

282
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,926
-I'm from the penitentiary.
-Okay.

283
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,429
You received a delivery recently, correct?

284
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,181
A delivery?

285
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:32,142
The delivery service said

286
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,687
they sent you the wrong shipment,
but they couldn't get a hold of you.

287
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,397
No, I never got it.

288
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,607
Didn't you?

289
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,867
I didn't receive anything.

290
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,495
Yi-kyung must have sent you something.

291
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,413
What are you talking about?

292
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,502
-Where did you hide it?
-Who are you?

293
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,088
Where did you hide the thing
Yi-kyung sent you?

294
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:09,471
Why do you guys have to keep acting up?

295
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,433
It's because of you
that I have to run these lousy errands.

296
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,863
I didn't even have to ask you.

297
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,698
Damn it.

298
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,047
Young man! Are you okay?

299
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,298
The police?

300
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,424
A gun?

301
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,718
Blood!

302
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,346
-Ma'am.
-My god!

303
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,807
Wait. Ma'am!

304
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,350
It's not what you think!

305
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,561
Neighbors! Help!

306
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,051
This is heavier than I thought.

307
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,595
There you go.

308
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,639
I can hardly recognize you like this.

309
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,641
You as well.

310
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,188
No. It's better to leave it.

311
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,818
Ms. Na, you're like my mother at times.

312
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,240
I'm flattered.

313
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,493
Did you take it as a compliment?
That's good.

314
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,495
All right. Let's go.

315
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,663
-Okay.
-Yes.

316
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:00,665
Yes.

317
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,258
Let's load the briquettes.

318
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,928
It's hard to see you.

319
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,972
I'm sticking close to him
like Kyung-yi said.

320
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,891
Don't answer me. Just listen.

321
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,686
I'm passing on her words.

322
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,021
Right.

323
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,649
Is it Heo Seong-tae? How sure are you?

324
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,860
I'm a hundred percent doubtful.

325
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,445
I can't tell from the picture.

326
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,155
I told you not to talk.

327
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,117
But you asked her a question.

328
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:42,707
It doesn't clearly show if it's
Heo Seong-tae or Heo Hyeon-tae.

329
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,086
But because of this one blurry frame,

330
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,214
Director Yong is trying
to kill a journalist.

331
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,384
It's fishy.

332
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,971
Ko Dam wouldn't buy such poor insurance.

333
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,641
Didn't Ko Dam say anything before he died?

334
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,561
You can listen to it yourself.

335
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,939
I have my insurance.

336
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,276
Open the crisper drawer in the fridge.

337
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:22,163
I'm the only one who knows
and only I can access that information.

338
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,582
There's no way anyone would find out.

339
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,919
I'll take it to the grave with me.

340
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,045
Really?

341
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,756
Then I guess I'll let you.

342
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,718
This is very important.

343
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,803
You just left it lying around.

344
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,139
All important things
should be kept in the fridge.

345
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,725
It's safe from a fire or an explosion.

346
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,894
He could have sent it
to someone he can trust

347
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,896
or uploaded it to the cloud.

348
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,482
Would Ko Dam have done that?

349
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,319
No. He didn't trust anyone.

350
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,655
Because Mironet collects
all kinds of rumors,

351
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,491
he would have been nervous
about online backups.

352
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,744
Then the safest thing to do

353
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,121
would have been
to carry it around himself.

354
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,044
Like the ring Ko Dam always wore.

355
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,382
-I'll take it
-I'll take it

356
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,344
-to the grave.
-to the grave.

357
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,129
CERTIFICATE OF MERIT
CHUN DOO-HWAN

358
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,202
If she gets hurt,
Yong Suk will get really mad,

359
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,871
so we'll need a tranquilizer.
Do you have it?

360
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,790
Okay.

361
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,922
I just fell asleep. What's going on?

362
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,591
What did you send to An Geon-uk?

363
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,218
Stop pulling my hair!

364
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,511
I won't ask twice.

365
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:44,556
What did I do?
You aren't making any sense!

366
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,394
I think there's a misunderstanding.

367
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,188
I did what you told me to do.
Why are you doing this?

368
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,065
What did you snatch from the karaoke?

369
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,233
Was it the journalist?

370
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,445
Why would I do that?

371
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,906
I'm dying to kill people.
Why would I have spared him?

372
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,616
Let me go!

373
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,703
If you're so suspicious of me,
I'll show you.

374
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,588
If you need proof, I'll give it to you.

375
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,424
This is…

376
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,511
all I can give you.

377
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,596
Shoot her.

378
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,355
Put her in the basement and
teach her a lesson. Just don't kill her.

379
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,316
Mister.

380
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:42,697
You don't even know that Ms. Koo is alive.

381
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,160
If Ms. Yong finds out,

382
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,122
she'll be furious.

383
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,375
Where should I go?

384
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,522
What's wrong, Darong?

385
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,444
Who is it?

386
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:05,947
It's me.

387
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,743
What is it?

388
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,079
I'm sorry. I had nowhere else to go.

389
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,876
Just because you didn't have
anywhere to go…

390
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,216
Hey, what happened? Are you okay?

391
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,720
May I come in?

392
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,181
Yes. Come in.

393
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,157
Get out.

394
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,578
What did you say?

395
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,377
I said get out.

396
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:04,964
Okay.

397
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,186
I was on my way
because you said it was urgent.

398
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,562
When did you get here?

399
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,689
You knew, didn't you?

400
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,815
Pardon?

401
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,195
Where is Koo Kyung-yi?

402
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,990
"Hey!"

403
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,827
"You said you'd take care of her."

404
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,747
"Why can't you do
anything right, Mr. Kim?"

405
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,167
Director Yong would say that

406
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,753
if she found out Kyung-yi was alive.

407
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,965
You…

408
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,425
You knew already.

409
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,802
Of course.

410
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:54,722
She contacted me
because you couldn't get rid of her.

411
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,393
Why do you think

412
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:03,356
I didn't tell Director Yong right away?

413
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,488
Do you like me?

414
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:19,455
Should I call you witty or shameless?

415
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:30,425
Get rid of her for good this time.

416
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,385
178-38 SEOSAE-RI,
NAEJEONG-EUP, NAMYANGJU-SI

417
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:35,138
I'm giving you a chance.

418
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,267
You have to help me next time, all right?

419
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:40,893
Promise?

420
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,730
I promise.

421
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,653
Kyung-yi is digging up Ko Dam's grave.

422
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,947
The thing Director Yong
is looking for is there.

423
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:28,858
"I dreamed too early
of a world where you are president."

424
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,860
That's too much.

425
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,369
The only thing I want is a just society.

426
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,748
By treating same things the same
and different things different…

427
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,625
-What is this?
-…I will achieve peace with justice.

428
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,169
I will pursue only justice.

429
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,379
"Mr. Ko Dam, who had refused
empty formalities,

430
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:53,883
was cremated according to his wishes."

431
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:58,012
"His ashes were mixed
with plaster to make a bust in his image."

432
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,138
…create a just society.

433
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,349
That's too much.

434
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,935
That is too much.

435
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,730
That's my line.

436
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:12,485
"The relics of the deceased
were kept inside the bust."

437
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,615
Was this what he meant
by taking it to the grave?

438
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,118
What are you doing?

439
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,453
Wait. No, stop.

440
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:28,501
You don't have to break stuff every time.

441
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,170
If there's anything in here,

442
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,131
let's think about how to take it out.

443
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,468
Okay.

444
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,054
What's that? Hurry.

445
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,408
No!

446
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,327
KO DAM

447
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,585
His nose is gone.

448
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:15,089
I think it's in here.

449
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,888
Is it not the ring?

450
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,486
Is there anything else?

451
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,918
Give me the ring.

452
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,252
The ring.

453
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,047
I think I know.

454
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,094
When I prepared for a proposal,

455
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,597
I did a lot of research on rings.

456
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,604
I'll tell you about it over a drink.

457
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,148
Do it. Hurry up.

458
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,316
Okay.

459
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,946
I think I have to turn it.

460
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,574
Like this.

461
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,215
HELP

462
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:43,636
JUST KILL ME

463
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,483
Help me.

464
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,693
Is anyone out there?

465
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,029
Help me.

466
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,156
I'm scared.

467
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,138
I really wanted to come down here.

468
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,501
I'm coming to see you now.

469
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:12,219
KO DAM MEMORIAL ROOM

470
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:17,224
I DREAMED TOO EARLY
OF A WORLD WHERE YOU ARE PRESIDENT

471
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,149
The only thing I want is a just society.

472
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,943
What are you doing here?

473
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:31,572
-He must have stolen it. Frisk him.
-What?

474
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:37,995
I will look at, listen to,
and speak of justice.

475
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,997
You're under arrest for stealing.

476
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,208
Let us make…

477
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,889
I can't keep pretending to be dead.

478
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,975
It's better to reveal myself
at a time like this.

479
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,895
Tell Mr. Kim where we'll be.

480
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:06,649
We need someone
whose voice has never been heard.

481
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,485
Santa, can you do it?

482
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,743
He said this could
bring Heo Seong-tae down.

483
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:20,829
They say that he held a grudge
against them and cursed them,

484
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,998
which is why everyone on the boat died.

485
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,709
So let's catch the murderer together.

486
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,503
They all deserved to die.

487
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:31,799
You think they all deserved to die, right?

488
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,735
-Hey, are you recording?
-Yes.

489
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:52,987
Don't.

490
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,366
I was told to make a recording.

491
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,450
Yes, sir.

492
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,293
-Honey.
-Yes?

493
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,420
-Let's have fun tonight.
-Okay.

494
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,464
All right.

495
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,133
Here it is.

496
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,679
It's from Mexico.

497
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,390
It arrived in our cargo via Hong Kong.

498
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:24,518
They say this is on a different level.

499
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,229
What do they call it?

500
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,647
-Bencio?
-No.

501
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:33,152
-It's "bendición." It means blessing.
-Okay.

502
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,446
"Blessing"?

503
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:39,992
Hey.

504
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:43,495
Can't you do anything right? How dare you?

505
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,080
I'm sorry.

506
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,126
All right. I'm recording.

507
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,669
Okay.

508
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,506
-Sit up.
-Okay.

509
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,177
Start already.

510
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,430
-Focus.
-Ready.

511
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:03,849
Set. Go!

512
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,312
-Faster!
-I bet on you.

513
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,356
If you don't win,
I'll throw you overboard.

514
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,820
Good job.

515
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,989
Well done.

516
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:25,120
Hey, do you want to try it?

517
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,916
He loves it.

518
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:35,381
They're nuts.

519
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,802
Hey.

520
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,388
Hey. Do you like it?

521
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,641
I'm scared!

522
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,102
But I love it.

523
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,646
-He's so funny.
-I'm scared.

524
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,941
Hey. You said you liked this.

525
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,276
Yes!

526
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,320
I'll give this to you.

527
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,949
Okay! I love it!

528
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:03,867
Pick it up.

529
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,668
Help me!

530
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,336
-Help!
-Oh, no.

531
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,547
I can't swim.

532
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,382
Be quiet!

533
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:21,009
-Let me watch.
-Help!

534
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,230
A man is dying,

535
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:38,902
but I love how you're all frozen
because of what I said.

536
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,661
The video ends here.

537
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,997
I can't see his face.

538
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,958
Shouldn't they have killed him first?

539
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,084
We got him.

540
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,635
Good job.

541
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,471
Well done.

542
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,025
Where did he go?

543
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,277
What should we do?

544
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:24,490
The lifebuoy. Where is it?

545
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,241
-Life--
-It's okay. Leave it.

546
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,367
Pardon?

547
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,620
It's too dark. You can't see anything.

548
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,079
It was an accident.

549
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,790
Right. An accident.

550
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,417
Okay.

551
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,294
Let's do another round and leave.

552
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,253
One more.

553
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,047
Whose phone is that?

554
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:43,050
-Delete the stuff.
-Yes, sir.

555
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:47,221
I'll delete it.

556
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,932
MIRONET
NETWORK USAGE

557
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:54,853
It's too late.

558
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,498
It's too late.

559
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,436
Should we go somewhere
where no one knows us

560
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,606
and live there quietly

561
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,984
with Darong?

562
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,781
How can I trust you
when you come and go as you please?

563
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,951
I won't make you starve.

564
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,581
We can open up a gym
where no one knows us.

565
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,916
Or we can run a business.

566
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,545
Do you prefer the beach or the mountains?

567
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,881
I'd like to go to the beach.

568
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,969
Let's go. We can go.

569
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,224
You can't go like this.

570
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,393
Get some sleep first.

571
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,901
I'll wait for you
no matter how long it takes.

572
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,864
Let's go to the beach together.

573
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,331
Dae-ho, where are you going?

574
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:40,709
You need to eat breakfast.

575
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,699
Darong.

576
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,869
Why did you get so fat?

577
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:16,953
Darong.

578
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,666
Give me a kiss.

579
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,671
I guess your daddy's here.

580
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,257
Let's see what he got for breakfast.

581
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,779
Why…

582
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:16,430
Train 250,
scheduled to depart at 7:30 a.m.,

583
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,724
will depart in three minutes.

584
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:23,520
Passengers who are not on board yet
must board immediately.

585
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,982
Please alight from the train
if you are not traveling.

586
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,235
Once again,

587
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:35,365
the train 250,
scheduled to depart at 7:30 a.m…

588
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,534
You listened.

589
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:39,619
I didn't know what you'd do,

590
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,663
so I followed your orders.

591
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,957
I contacted you because you told me to.

592
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,043
Please alight from the train
if you are not traveling.

593
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,007
Everyone's in their places.

594
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,843
Let's get to the point.

595
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,599
This is…

596
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,770
We get each other.

597
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,732
We'd make great partners
if only you weren't after me.

598
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:15,947
Promise me you'll stop
bothering Je-hui, and I'll give you this.

599
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:20,368
The person
you should have killed is in here.

600
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,415
That's unexpected.

601
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:31,713
Like I said,
if I get off this train untouched,

602
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,673
I'll stop bothering her.

603
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:41,973
I'm curious.

604
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,393
Did you think he deserves to die too?

605
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:49,314
Got it.

606
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:53,610
By the way,
I became more suspicious because of you.

607
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,615
Do you see this tiny thing?

608
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:01,535
You need to eat first.

609
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,245
Good girl.

610
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:08,375
If anyone gets off
before the train leaves,

611
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,919
I'll push this.

612
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:22,472
Wait. Where is my phone?

613
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,725
Na Na, where is my phone?

614
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,019
Do you have to keep doing this?

615
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,146
My aunt is still angry.

616
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,319
Hi, Je-hui.

617
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,988
Take Na Na out of the house.

618
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,532
What? What's going on?

619
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:42,284
Now!

620
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,244
Okay.

621
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,717
Ms. Koo.

622
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,896
Do you think I don't recognize you?

623
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,946
Dad, did you leave the house? Did you?

624
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,074
What's going on?

625
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,756
Dear passengers,

626
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,592
this train is bound for…

627
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,929
It must be nice to have lots of friends.

628
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,024
Yes.

629
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,367
Do you want to play with this?

630
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,120
You can push the button if you want.

631
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,121
Okay.

632
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:30,225
It's too late! Wake up! It's too late!

633
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:33,478
It's too late! Wake up! It's too late!

634
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:36,147
It's too late! Wake up!

635
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,857
It's too late!

636
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,030
Are you okay?

637
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,993
It'll be over soon.

638
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,997
Relax until we get to the next station.

639
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,083
Are we getting off at Suwon station?

640
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,628
Shall we get some galbi while we're there?

641
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:06,511
You know what it means
to hand it over to K, right?

642
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:14,102
The criminals don't know
the great intentions of the great people.

643
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,563
When I go right,
they nag at me for going right.

644
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,690
When I go left,
they nag at me for going left.

645
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,942
When I sit down,
they ask me why I'm seated.

646
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,527
When I lie down, they tell me to get up.

647
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,782
What do people like us do?

648
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:31,786
We gather everyone's chaotic opinions

649
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,914
and lead them the way we want.

650
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:41,004
That is you and your son's job and fate.

651
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,927
Why was I born with
such an exhausting fate?

652
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,307
Step aside. Come on.

653
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,893
Let me go out for a minute.

654
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:58,396
Just for a minute.

655
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,445
Come on. Wait. Let me go out.

656
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,488
Just for a minute.

657
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:10,325
I'll be out just for a minute!

658
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:15,413
When I heard he got into trouble again,

659
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,083
honestly…

660
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:20,794
I wanted to give up on him.

661
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:25,465
If it was a family matter,
I would have let him go.

662
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:30,136
But you said this was for our country.

663
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,764
I said Heo Seong-tae's fate

664
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:35,767
and the flow of our country's fate

665
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,645
were in sync at the time.

666
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,607
So I plucked up my courage

667
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:47,529
and tried to talk to all the people
that were on the boat.

668
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:50,281
But one of them died.

669
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:53,118
I thought the timing was strange.

670
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:55,745
Then another person died in an accident.

671
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,957
I knew it then. "Someone is helping."

672
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,918
A wind blew.

673
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:06,798
Before that wind comes back as a storm,
we must find this person.

674
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,133
Who am I?

675
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,968
I found her right away.

676
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,054
By the way,

677
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,851
please take a good look at this.

678
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,729
SONG YI-KYUNG
OCTOBER 21, 1999

679
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:24,816
She was born in America.

680
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:29,529
So is her fortune on American time?

681
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,658
I have two sons,
so I always wanted to have a daughter.

682
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:35,034
I'm glad to have one.

683
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,121
If I handle her well,

684
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:42,667
I think she'll be of great help to me--

685
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,627
She's burning up.

686
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,297
When fire meets fire,

687
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,341
the wind will carry the flame
and burn everything.

688
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,177
Pardon?

689
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:57,182
Where is she now?

690
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:13,615
SUSPENSION BRIDGE

691
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,333
I'm not scared.

692
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,668
I can do it!

693
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:27,754
Heo Seong-tae.

694
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,508
You can do it.

695
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,350
Hold on.

696
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,105
You can do it.

697
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,526
You can do this.

698
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,453
Good.

699
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:04,666
Good.

700
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,960
Look straight ahead and go.

701
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,086
Good.

702
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,464
Heo Seong-tae, let's go. You can do it.

703
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,469
You can do it.

704
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,347
You're doing well.

705
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:26,646
Don't give up. It's okay.
You can do it, Heo Seong-tae.

706
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,815
Don't look down.

707
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,235
Just go.

708
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:40,910
Are you okay?

709
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,673
Where is Heo Hyeon-tae now?

710
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:41,512
If Heo Hyeon-tae shows himself,
she will put him through living hell.

711
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:44,557
Over here! Anybody there? Help me!

712
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,810
Is it right to let people like them live?

713
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,729
Shouldn't we thank her for killing them?

714
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,147
Don't let me die.

715
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,566
But I don't have the "power" to do that.

716
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,484
I'm sorry.

717
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:55,985
You murderers!

718
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:58,905
Everything turned out
the way you wanted for the first time.

719
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:00,907
Who else would be crazy enough
to do such a thing?

720
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,910
Stop suspecting me from now on
and do exactly as I say.

721
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:07,789
We'll go after the person…

722
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,207
K…

723
