1
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,968
HE DESERVES TO DIE, SO KILL HIM

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,262
I KILLED HIM LIKE YOU SAID
BECAUSE HE DESERVED IT

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,430
KILL HIM!

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,514
SAVE HIM?

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,350
OVERLY SUSPICIOUS
EVIDENCE, HIKIKOMORI

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,518
I DO AS I PLEASE?

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,522
MY GOSH!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:25,859
CURIOUS?

9
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:26,985
THEY ALL DIED!

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,197
A HUSBAND-KILLER?
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE

11
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,240
SOMETHING IS FISHY

12
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,702
MUST WE ALL LIVE?

13
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,619
WE MUST

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,164
A NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN INSPECTOR

15
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,257
Hansel, I don't feel good about this!

16
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,343
Gretel, stay calm.

17
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,681
Gretel, stay calm.

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,893
What is that glistening in the dark?

19
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,898
What is that glistening in the dark?

20
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,527
That cottage is made of tasty snacks.

21
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,655
That cottage

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,409
is made of tasty snacks.

23
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,912
Come here. Let's go inside.

24
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,538
EPISODE 2

25
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,082
Come here.

26
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,669
Damn it. Do I have to go in there?

27
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,879
Let's go inside.

28
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,971
Mr. Kim!

29
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,618
One…

30
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,537
two, three!

31
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,526
TONGYEONG SAVER

32
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,490
DO NOT CROSS

33
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:45,576
Je-hui, I'm afraid
you should come down here too.

34
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,745
This is bigger than I thought.

35
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,252
Hey…

36
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,046
A man in his thirties who disappeared
and was declared dead

37
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,340
was pronounced dead for the second time.

38
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:03,469
The police believe when he was caught
faking his death for an insurance payout,

39
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,973
he fled inside the sewers and died

40
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,434
after inhaling poisonous gas.

41
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,520
An insurance inspector,
who had come to assess the situation,

42
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,731
was the first to find his body.

43
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,567
The police are being criticized
for failing to carry out

44
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,112
a thorough investigation
during his initial disappearance.

45
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,656
Next up is the weather forecast.

46
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,826
Here is the weather forecast.
Due to the clear weather…

47
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,162
-I need water…
-My goodness.

48
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,622
The weather is cool,
and the fine dust level is low.

49
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,999
I didn't even know you came.

50
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,334
The wonderful weather…

51
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:38,296
I was watching something frightening
on the news and you scared me to death.

52
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,965
-Under the blue sky…
-Oh, dear.

53
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,259
Goodness. Look at you sweating.

54
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,802
My gosh.

55
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,638
Gosh, I shouldn't have told you to come.

56
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,266
-I shouldn't have.
-It's okay, ma'am.

57
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,893
I'm loving the fresh air.

58
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,978
Did you see that?

59
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,273
I remember you saying

60
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:01,694
that he was certainly dead
seeing how they couldn't find him.

61
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,945
Yes.

62
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,448
But he revealed himself and ended up dead.

63
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,367
You're right. It's baffling.

64
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,828
Did you look into her?

65
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,289
Yes. She's a former police officer.

66
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:16,876
She works as an investigator
for NT Life Insurance from time to time.

67
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,544
What time was she born?

68
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,962
Hold on…

69
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,507
Between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m.

70
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,092
That's great.

71
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,678
That's fire. I get along well
with people like her.

72
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:31,557
I think we should be cautious
so that there won't be any issues.

73
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,728
Mr. Kim, I can't even sleep at night
because I'm terrified.

74
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,980
Isn't this horrendous?

75
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,608
How is this happening?

76
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,693
I'll try to take care of it.

77
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,494
This is a letter to you.

78
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,623
There are kids in need.

79
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,209
Please protect them

80
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,545
and look after them.

81
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,298
They need your support.

82
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,633
Pureun Children's Foundation.

83
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,385
I'm Heo Hyeon-tae,
the honorary ambassador.

84
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,304
Goodness, look at that boy.

85
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:14,684
That boy, Hyeon-tae, is
my only joy in life.

86
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,897
He's one adorable boy.

87
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,652
Don't you agree?

88
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,862
Yes, ma'am.

89
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,657
It looks scrumptious.

90
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,372
Got you!

91
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,250
Where have you been?

92
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,920
Please respect your niece's privacy.

93
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,131
Why did you sleep here, not at your place?

94
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,425
As your aunt,
I can come here whenever I want.

95
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,596
But, tell me.

96
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,226
Where were you all night
with your phone off?

97
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,063
I'm not a kid.

98
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,399
I'm hungry. Did you have breakfast yet?

99
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,904
Did you have a nightmare again?

100
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,323
You should've called me right away.

101
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,201
I was drinking with my colleagues.

102
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,204
Then I got drunk,
so I stayed at a nearby cafe to sober up.

103
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,330
Happy?

104
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,290
I see.

105
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,589
No wonder you smell musty.

106
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,550
Is it bad?

107
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,635
Go take a shower. You reek.

108
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,720
Should we have sausage stew?

109
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,265
-With beans, butter, and rice?
-Sounds good!

110
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,391
Sounds good!

111
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,829
Right.

112
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,165
All right.

113
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:57,972
What's wrong?

114
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,726
Oh, it's nothing.

115
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,841
JOB SHADOW DAY

116
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:34,967
No way.

117
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,136
Unbelievable.

118
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,225
Had it truly been an accident,

119
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,686
the container wouldn't have been
set on fire.

120
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,815
Someone did it on purpose
for Yoon Jae-yeong.

121
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,780
Something's fishy.

122
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,121
Ma'am, what are you doing here?

123
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:13,422
They waited for a witness
to be Yoon Jae-yeong's alibi,

124
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,466
and even got rid of the evidence.

125
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,426
But who?

126
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,555
She wasn't seeing anyone
and didn't have other family members.

127
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,768
Over the past two years, workers
from the plant Min-gyu worked at…

128
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,145
They all died.

129
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,023
They fished out
a dead body from the breakwater.

130
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,693
It was someone who died while doing
chores for the people on the boat.

131
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,822
They say that he held a grudge
against them and cursed them,

132
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,990
which is why everyone on the boat died.

133
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,034
Let's see.

134
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:46,288
One of them died in a car accident.
One of them died of a heart attack.

135
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,290
Come on.

136
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,959
Instead of helping Yoon Jae-yeong,

137
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,795
what if the killer
just wanted to murder those people?

138
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,339
This is a police station, you know?

139
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,969
How much investigation
did you do on the Hyochang Bio people?

140
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,262
Why do you ask?

141
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,305
I'm too busy working on this case.

142
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,726
I heard those who died, including
Kim Min-gyu, had been at the party.

143
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,105
Everyone knows already.

144
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,567
Come on. Do you seriously believe
everything they gossip about?

145
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,404
Look at what happened.
Everyone who was there ended up dying.

146
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,656
-It's not true.
-Did you even look into it?

147
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:24,201
Look here. Tongyeong may seem
like a small town, but it's not.

148
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,828
Coincidences can happen.

149
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:29,331
Han Man-gu and his mistress
died in a car crash.

150
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,168
The other one struggled
to make ends meet and hanged herself.

151
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,254
And Kim Min-gyu was
just after the insurance payout.

152
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,215
He died after hiding in the sewers
and inhaling poisonous gas.

153
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,509
So what is there left to investigate?

154
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,387
Then what about that kid?

155
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,182
Lee Jun-hyeon.

156
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,352
So you do know.

157
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,731
That boy who died on the boat
during the company dinner.

158
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,399
-Poor thing. Gosh.
-What happened?

159
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,026
He died alone.

160
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,569
The security camera is broken?

161
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,280
Yes, sir. And no one saw anything.

162
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,496
You were in charge of that case, right?

163
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,165
You must've heard
some ridiculous rumors again.

164
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,209
He has nothing to do with this!

165
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,087
He was a troublemaker who was
in and out of youth reformatories.

166
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:21,008
But as you know, he'd often
roam around the quay drunk.

167
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:32,144
He must've lost his footing or something
by the quay and drowned.

168
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,317
Something's fishy.

169
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,905
Ma'am, we're not done here.

170
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,492
I'm just a witness.
I can leave whenever I want.

171
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,791
Ma'am, that's the wrong way.

172
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,047
Gosh, I can't think.

173
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,718
What should you do when you're stuck?

174
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,512
BAIGAN LIQUOR

175
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,402
This makes it taste like whiskey.

176
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,495
Want some?

177
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,331
Just one sip.

178
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:35,791
Come on.

179
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,309
He doesn't know what he's missing.

180
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,936
Have a glass and tell me

181
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,857
who did this to you.

182
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,909
THE LATE LEE JUN-HYEON

183
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,959
His landlord has kept his belongings,
but there's nothing special.

184
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:23,756
His rent had been overdue so they
kept asking me to pay them instead.

185
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,382
Here's his phone.

186
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,598
GYU-JIN, CAN YOU LEND ME 20,000 WON?

187
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:36,644
I'M SORRY, JIN-SEOK. PLEASE HELP ME OUT.

188
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,106
GALLERY

189
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,283
He didn't have friends or family,

190
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,078
which means no one would have
the motive to avenge his death.

191
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,454
He was like me.

192
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,039
Ms. Na.

193
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,749
What?

194
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,918
Someone lit a candle for him.

195
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,544
THE LATE LEE JUN-HYEON

196
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,551
PLEASE WRITE YOUR NAME DOWN
BEFORE LIGHTING A CANDLE

197
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,679
Here he is.

198
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,683
LEE JUN-HYEON

199
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,728
YOON JAE-YEONG

200
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,323
If I report this to the police,
you won't be able to receive the payout.

201
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,034
You need look after Seon-mi safe,
don't you?

202
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,509
Did you tell the police
that you knew nothing?

203
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,055
Seon-mi.

204
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,684
It's okay. Why don't you
play outside for a while?

205
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,478
Would you like to do that?

206
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,872
Is that why you're here?

207
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,250
When I just buried my husband?

208
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,797
He has a knack for things like that.

209
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,927
Unlike someone.

210
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,180
You got me totally fooled.

211
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:40,726
So tell me. When your husband made
a foolish suggestion that he should

212
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,605
sacrifice himself for Seon-mi's
hospital bills, were you moved?

213
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,731
No.

214
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,650
At first, I said it was ludicrous.

215
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,491
Don't be ludicrous.

216
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,750
-Sir.
-Oh, no.

217
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,168
Goodness.

218
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,003
-He passed away.
-Poor him.

219
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,755
I hadn't seen him for a while.

220
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,715
-Who knew?
-Oh, dear.

221
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,384
-Goodness.
-Poor him.

222
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,929
-Seriously.
-Oh, dear.

223
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,139
-What are we to do?
-My gosh.

224
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,808
He said if we held out for a year,

225
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:24,853
we'd be able to leave this place
and live happily ever after.

226
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,981
He had planned it all.

227
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,318
And you were so close to succeeding.

228
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,529
But he put his desires first

229
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,240
and ruined everything
by revealing himself.

230
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:40,577
You must've thought
he was better off dead, right?

231
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,997
That's understandable.

232
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,208
But only a meticulous person

233
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,502
could've filled up the shelter
with poisonous gas

234
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,838
and gotten rid of the evidence
by setting a fire.

235
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,674
And that's not you.

236
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,551
You're right.

237
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,554
I didn't do anything.

238
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,847
Then who was it?

239
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,265
What do you mean?

240
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,976
Someone helped you kill him.

241
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,310
Who was it?

242
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,818
They told you about Lee Jun-hyeon,
didn't they?

243
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,071
Did you contact them first,

244
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,992
saying your husband is a scumbag who put
his sexual desires before his daughter,

245
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:24,246
and also that he was
an accessory to murder?

246
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,248
Did you ask them to kill him?

247
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,292
I never asked them to kill him.

248
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,380
Seon-mi!

249
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,093
It's a dolphin.

250
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,056
I'll keep it a secret.

251
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,643
I'll keep your family safe.

252
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,273
Someone contacted me out of the blue.

253
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,818
Hello?

254
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,946
Your husband's cell phone was turned on
for a moment yesterday.

255
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,740
I called in case he called you.

256
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,117
His phone was turned on?

257
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,954
It could've just been stolen,
so don't get your hopes up.

258
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,089
MIRONET
NEW MESSAGE

259
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,304
I have to take it off first.

260
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,599
Let's do it.

261
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,757
I already read these.

262
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,009
Hey! Damn it!

263
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:03,929
Are you crazy?

264
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,473
Don't you think I know
what you did with your phone on?

265
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:10,018
What if you get caught?
What'll happen to our daughter?

266
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,186
Let go!

267
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,647
Damn it.

268
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,858
Damn it.

269
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:30,038
RESTRICTED NUMBER

270
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,332
Hello?

271
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,588
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

272
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,841
They refused to answer me.

273
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:42,801
But they asked me

274
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,096
if I knew a man named Lee Jun-hyeon

275
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,891
and what happened
during my husband's company dinner.

276
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,226
They told me

277
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,731
not to feel too guilty
even if my husband died.

278
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,400
I'll call you again soon.

279
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,445
And I expect you to help me out then.

280
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,620
That was it?

281
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,791
I had no idea this would happen.

282
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,545
He was still Seon-mi's dad.

283
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,133
And they prepared that shelter too?

284
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,764
So you just did as you were told.

285
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,562
If anyone spots you,

286
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,689
run away and follow this mark.

287
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,316
You'll find a shelter.

288
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,538
I had no idea this would happen.

289
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,040
Yes, you did.

290
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,834
Kill him.

291
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,672
He deserves it.

292
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:06,426
You wanted him dead,
and your wish was granted.

293
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,054
So why are you feigning sadness?

294
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,017
What do you know?

295
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,394
The person I trusted the most

296
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,231
turned out to be someone
completely different.

297
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,149
Do you know how it feels to realize

298
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,527
that your entire life was a lie?

299
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,571
I just don't know…

300
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,200
who you are anymore.

301
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,289
Why should I care?

302
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,030
Help me!

303
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,202
-Why did he fall in there?
-Do something, will you?

304
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,037
Hold on. Is there a ring buoy nearby?

305
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,373
-Help me!
-Do something.

306
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,542
-Gosh.
-Watch out.

307
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,589
Is he…

308
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,177
Die, all of you.

309
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,843
Who could've done this?

310
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,266
Don't go!

311
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:02,602
That's the witch's house!

312
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:08,233
The witch lives there!

313
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,791
-You were great.
-Eat up.

314
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,251
-We did well.
-Right?

315
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,502
Good work.

316
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:28,962
I wanted to help you myself.

317
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,550
-Eat up.
-Thank you for the meal.

318
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,343
-Enjoy.
-You too.

319
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,220
-Was it good?
-We didn't seem like rookies.

320
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,267
-It's tasty.
-It is.

321
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,936
It was a success.

322
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,354
-Really?
-You surprised me.

323
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,940
This is so delicious, right?

324
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,068
Hey. Good work, Yi-kyung.

325
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,323
How was my acting?
I rehearsed a lot for today.

326
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,658
Well…

327
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,410
Yi-kyung.

328
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:04,080
I hope you won't be offended
by what I'm about to say.

329
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,626
I'd like you to take care
of the lighting next time.

330
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,005
No way.

331
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,970
Has the next performance
already been scheduled?

332
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,682
I'm fine with anything.

333
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,809
But I do prefer acting.

334
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,228
-You see--
-Would you like more pizza?

335
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,650
This meal is on me,

336
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,320
so order anything you want!

337
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,797
Thief!

338
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,551
Who are you?

339
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,556
You're not allowed in here.

340
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,020
Are you drinking again?

341
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,774
One celebratory drink?

342
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,575
Did you have something tasty without me?

343
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,909
Take a guess.

344
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,374
Gosh, you…

345
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,671
No way. Incredible.

346
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,007
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

347
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,971
This water tastes good.

348
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,141
Was it on the news?

349
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,518
They concluded it was an accident.

350
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,817
It's all thanks to my support.

351
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,779
And yet, you always go out
and have tasty food without me.

352
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,655
How could you have pizza without me?

353
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:47,744
I can't believe this day has come.

354
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,206
There's no evidence.

355
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,084
There was a witness,

356
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,921
and that woman has a strong alibi.

357
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,760
All I did was set the tables

358
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:07,514
and enjoy the feast before me.

359
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,600
There were no problems, right?

360
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,069
Do you remember Jang Seong-u?

361
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,030
The teacher who was in charge
of our high school drama club.

362
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,032
-His wife was a police officer.
-Right.

363
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,034
He committed suicide, right?

364
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,871
Really? Mr. Jang killed himself?

365
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,457
I had left the neighborhood,
so I'm not too sure.

366
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,750
But I heard so. Why?

367
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,545
His wife is an insurance inspector now.

368
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,381
She's the witness.

369
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,216
If she digs too deep,

370
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,385
just kill her too.

371
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,514
Why?

372
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,975
-Did she do something wrong?
-No.

373
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:53,852
Just because.

374
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,646
I just don't like it that she was a cop.

375
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,483
That's no reason to be killing someone.

376
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,695
But that's what you used to do.

377
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,196
Me?

378
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,240
When did I do that?

379
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,951
Enough with your terrible acting.

380
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,911
Let's just clean up.

381
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,671
JUN-HYEON FROM THE REFORMATORY

382
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:24,507
IT'S ME, JUN-HYEON. I MISS YOU.

383
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,352
Isn't there anyone else?

384
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,479
DELETE CONTACT

385
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,648
What?

386
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,361
To kill, I mean.

387
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,464
Kill them all!

388
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,257
What are you doing?

389
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,597
Damn it. Can we at least win this game?

390
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,727
This is to cheer you up.

391
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,771
It's not over
just because we lost a match.

392
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:02,897
Let's go.

393
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:06,192
Gosh, I can't think properly.

394
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,367
Hold on.

395
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,078
Are you leaving? Don't go.

396
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,092
What is it?

397
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,011
What's wrong? Why are you on the floor?

398
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,685
Gosh.

399
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,946
I think I'm getting fired.

400
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,120
Kim Min-gyu's family
was given 600 million won.

401
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,414
It was cut down due to the false report,

402
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,958
but we still had to pay them that much.

403
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,377
And it will all be reflected
on my performance evaluation.

404
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,796
So what?

405
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,005
What do you mean?

406
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,675
Inspection Team B will be disbanded.
Do you know what that means?

407
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:15,196
I'll be sacked
because you failed to make it a suicide.

408
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,326
That means it's the end
for your computer, your beer,

409
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:24,163
and the team
that I've been leading. Everything.

410
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,060
You always yearn to be acknowledged.

411
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,479
But you know what?

412
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,148
That's not it. I only expect--

413
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,732
It's a homicide.

414
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,111
The landslide,
the source of the hydrogen sulfide,

415
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,529
the fire at the container,

416
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,282
and the tip-off given to Yoon Jae-yeong.

417
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,284
-Did you look into them?
-Kyung-yi.

418
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,035
Kyung-yi!

419
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,955
This isn't the National Police Agency,
and you're not a cop anymore.

420
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,457
Something's fishy.

421
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,294
The landslide happened naturally.

422
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,379
As for the hydrogen sulfide,

423
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,048
you do know that place
was connected to the sewers, right?

424
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,259
And the fire happened
due to a short circuit,

425
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,052
you dubious woman.

426
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,846
That's why it's more terrifying.

427
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,265
People died,

428
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,226
but wasn't even investigated because
it was made to look like an accident.

429
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,477
Let's say you're right.

430
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,606
Then how did they know
that Kim Min-gyu was alive?

431
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,691
They were killing them off one by one.

432
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,068
It was his turn,
but he was nowhere to be seen.

433
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,613
Not even his body.

434
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:43,492
Then they must've seen his wife
going in and out of the woods.

435
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:48,247
They had no idea when he'd reveal himself,
so how did they know when to poison him?

436
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,874
That's where I come in.

437
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:53,002
They did this after seeing me
approach him.

438
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,253
Let me get this straight.

439
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,714
They had it all planned out to kill him.

440
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,799
But they patiently waited

441
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,178
for someone like you
to appear before killing him?

442
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,179
Is that it?

443
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,267
Aren't they just incredible?

444
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,647
They planned it all out
so perfectly to kill him.

445
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,067
Your eyes are sparkling.

446
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,778
I haven't seen you like this
in five years.

447
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,322
Kyung-yi.

448
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,951
Do you remember telling me to stop you
whenever you started suspecting things?

449
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:45,263
I won't let you suspect everything
and waste your life again.

450
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,765
This is important.

451
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,603
I'm back.

452
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,146
I have no time to say hi.

453
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,357
I'm resurrecting now.

454
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,243
Did you say goodbye to your friends?

455
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:13,457
No. Why go through that hassle
when we won't see each other again?

456
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,462
And I don't want us
to say our farewells and bawl.

457
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,965
Are you worried about moving schools?

458
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,591
I wanted to go myself.

459
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,720
Right. You'll be fine.
You always put in your best effort.

460
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,723
But don't try too hard.

461
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,477
I don't think that's something
a teacher should be telling me.

462
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,107
It seems that you always try too hard.

463
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,944
I can see that when you're acting
or when you're with your friends.

464
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,991
I get the feeling
that this is about Yeong-ju,

465
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,159
but I'm fine.

466
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,869
I know you're frustrated.

467
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,830
You feel like no one can understand you.

468
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,249
I'm just asking you to give them a chance.

469
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,794
Then you'll find at least one person.

470
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,546
Someone who'll understand me?

471
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,631
No, not that.

472
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:06,510
But you'll find someone
who'll make you feel comfortable.

473
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,347
Is your wife like that to you?

474
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,098
It didn't seem like it.

475
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,310
Gosh, you have a keen eye.

476
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,480
Koo Kyung-yi and I…

477
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,858
are complete opposites.

478
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,151
Koo Kyung-yi?

479
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,862
That's her name?

480
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,740
Wait. You're Yi-kyung,

481
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,034
and my wife's name is the same,
except backwards.

482
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,788
Anyway, goodbye.

483
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,748
I hope to see you again.

484
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,423
And he killed himself?

485
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,179
Yeong-ju!

486
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,890
Yeong-ju, over here!

487
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,142
Hi!

488
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,606
You're already attending
teaching practice.

489
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,024
You're all grown up now.

490
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,735
I'm so proud of you, Yeong-ju.

491
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,242
We were so close back then, right?

492
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,577
You didn't even pick up.

493
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,206
-Did you change your number?
-Yes, I did.

494
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,171
So you want to know
what happened to Mr. Jang?

495
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,881
Yes. Tell me.

496
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,217
Do you remember Han-gyeol?

497
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,803
Of course. She played Ophelia.
She had very fair skin.

498
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:34,140
Did you know she drowned in a reservoir?

499
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,307
No way.

500
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:37,726
Was she murdered?

501
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:42,356
The police said she'd slipped
and fallen into the water,

502
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,400
but no one believed them.

503
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,985
On the day of her death,

504
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,946
someone saw her with Mr. Jang alone.

505
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:52,825
And there were rumors
that the two were secretly dating.

506
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,120
-But his wife was--
-A police officer, right?

507
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:59,290
Right. So rumor had it
that his wife helped him

508
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:02,042
disguise her death as an accident.

509
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,504
Mr. Jang was completely humiliated.

510
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:09,383
And then he committed suicide.

511
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:11,677
Did he leave a letter?

512
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,637
I don't think so.

513
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,514
Did he really kill her?

514
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:19,101
No one knows. Both of them are dead,
and there's no evidence.

515
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,896
Before his wife quit her job,

516
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,273
she was poking around everywhere.

517
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,442
She wanted to prove his innocence.

518
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,528
But she couldn't find any evidence.

519
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:34,408
But she might've wanted to find
the evidence that he was indeed guilty.

520
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,163
Jeez.

521
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,999
Maybe he did something gross to Han-gyeol.

522
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:47,713
Someone should've killed him
before he could take his own life.

523
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:49,924
Don't you think so?

524
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:53,052
Why should he get to live
when Han-gyeol's dead?

525
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,012
Why should he get to live
when those cats died?

526
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,725
Can I go now?

527
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,603
Come on. We just met.

528
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,022
Let's chat and go do karaoke.

529
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,732
Give me your number.

530
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,944
I don't think
we're close enough to exchange numbers.

531
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,197
What? Aren't we close friends?

532
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:22,206
Do you still think it was me?

533
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,833
Maybe Roy repaid your kindness.

534
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,215
-What is it?
-What's wrong?

535
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,600
Leave me alone. Please!

536
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,893
What's wrong?

537
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,228
I beg you.

538
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,480
Please. I'm sorry.

539
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,482
I'm so scared!

540
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,942
What's wrong?

541
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:56,949
I'm sorry for everything! I really am!

542
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,913
I should go now.

543
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:06,250
Good job, guys. It was a good game. Bye.

544
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:16,927
I'm done.

545
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,096
I should really die now.

546
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,764
Die?

547
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,267
You shouldn't say such a thing.

548
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,686
-What do you mean?
-You didn't log off?

549
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,231
Now that I've won and used up my items,

550
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,108
I can finally die.

551
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,654
I thought long and hard,
but I don't have any reason to live.

552
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,991
Well, how do I put it?

553
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,619
We all have our earliest memories.

554
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:48,000
My earliest memory was
when I was about four years old.

555
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,545
I remember my dad beating me with a bowl.

APPLEBOYCAT: OKAY

558
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:57,009
I cried and begged my mom
to take me with her,

559
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,344
but she didn't.

560
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:02,598
When I was 20, I won a million won from
sports betting and I gave it to my mom.

561
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,476
That's when I saw that
she was happy with me for the first time.

562
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,563
So I kept gambling,
but after I got into it deeper…

…over 300 million won in debt.

569
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,159
Due to the shock,
my sister had a miscarriage.

I FOUND MELONMUSK35 FOR SOME PRIZE DRAW

572
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:32,211
My poor sister begged me,

573
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,546
asking me if I could just disappear.

I'M GOING. BUY SOME TIME FOR ME.

580
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,784
Then it dawned on me.

581
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,162
Some people are cherished and doted on

582
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,373
from the moment they're born.

583
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:16,922
But I was a cheap
and useless human being from the start.

584
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:21,427
I was just doomed to keep losing
from the moment I was born.

585
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,096
MILL

586
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:28,475
Instead of wasting precious air
by staying alive,

587
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:33,439
I think it'd be better
that I just disappeared.

588
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,069
I shouldn't have been born.

589
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,740
My stupid parents just had to have me.

590
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,288
Hold on.

591
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,624
I'm not expecting anyone.

592
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,046
Who is it?

593
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:01,008
-Delivery.
-You got the wrong address.

594
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,428
That's strange. It's already paid for.

595
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,306
It's boiled pork and buckwheat noodles.

596
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:08,765
Are you sure it's not you?

597
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,607
What? Who are you?

598
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,654
You want to kill yourself?

599
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:23,572
What?

600
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:26,033
Because you were abused by your parents,
have a gambling addiction,

601
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,994
and a loan that you can't pay back
under your sister's name?

602
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,245
That's right.

603
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,664
Who are you?

604
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,546
Appleboycat?

605
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,259
I thought you were in your twenties.

606
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:49,097
-Sorry about that.
-How did you find me?

607
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,891
Don't leave your information online.

608
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,852
-Give that back.
-What?

609
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,354
Give it back.

610
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,856
You'd also want to die
if you were in my shoes.

611
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,692
Tell me one reason why I shouldn't die.

612
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:01,985
Why should I live?

613
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,821
-Because you're in charge of scouting.
-Other than that!

614
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,198
Other than that?

615
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,664
Let's see. What else? What should I say?

616
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,211
The fact that
you can't answer me right away

617
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,255
means I have no reason to live.

618
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,048
Why did you come?

619
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,842
Just let me die!

620
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,470
-Leave.
-No.

621
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,681
Just go! Let me die!

622
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:38,605
Gosh, my back.

623
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,153
Damn it.

624
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,284
What's your problem?

625
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,953
Come one step closer,
and I'll push you too.

626
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,247
I said, don't come!

627
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,708
-You're right.
-What do you mean?

628
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,546
I thought about it.

629
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,549
You're right.

630
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,552
We don't have a reason to live.

631
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:10,762
What?

632
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,141
Think about it. You're right.

633
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,769
What's the point of living?

634
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:22,733
You see, I used to be a police officer.

635
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,319
I suspected my own husband
and ended up killing him.

636
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,404
What's funnier is

637
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,574
that I'm still curious
whether he was the real culprit or not.

638
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,912
I wish he would have told me that
before he died.

639
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,668
I'm horrible, aren't I?

640
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:43,629
Yes.

641
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:45,756
Right?

642
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,218
I deserve to die, right?

643
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:55,265
Wait!

644
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,687
Hey, wait!

645
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,068
Hold on!

646
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,655
Wait! Hold on!

647
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,363
I'm sorry for everything! I really am!

648
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:11,174
Keep going.

649
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,302
Keep going.

650
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:18,974
Keep going.

651
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,031
Is that a person?

652
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:55,510
VACANT

653
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,017
Gosh, what is that?

654
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:40,639
Sir, I don't think
I told you my destination.

655
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,954
What's going on? Who are you people?

656
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,460
MAEUL PUBLIC BATH

657
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:29,187
MAEUL PUBLIC BATH

658
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:22,032
Goodness. You're here.

659
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,746
I finally get to meet you.

660
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:30,248
Do you not go out that often?
You're too pale.

661
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,499
Give me my towel.

662
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,050
My towel.

663
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,515
What did you
and Kim Min-gyu's wife talk about?

664
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,729
I just met her to console her.

665
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,065
I see. You consoled her.

666
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,232
Right.

667
00:53:56,316 --> 00:54:00,195
I'm sure you know how hard it is
to live without a husband.

668
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:05,742
Did she know about Lee Jun-hyeon?

669
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:11,539
You're asking me questions
you know the answers to.

670
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,125
I wouldn't be asking you
if I knew everything.

671
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,378
I'm asking because I don't know.

672
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:28,098
Who do you think killed Kim Min-gyu?

673
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,019
The case was closed as an accident,

674
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:35,772
but you're asking me
as if it's a homicide.

675
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,735
Yes, because I think
that's what you believe as well.

676
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:42,988
Stop playing games with me.

677
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,198
You can tell me.

678
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:47,659
There wasn't enough evidence
to make that conclusion.

679
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,160
It was as if someone had tried
to cover it up.

680
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,663
Then tell me.

681
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:55,959
Why do you think the cases are connected
when you've found no evidence?

682
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,711
There was a clear intent.

683
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:01,297
They could've just killed them
if they wanted to,

684
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,718
but all the cases were disguised
so that no one would be accused.

685
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,137
And?

686
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,391
They all deserved to die.

687
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,894
That's such a frightening thing to say.

688
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,689
Did they do something horrible?

689
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:20,567
I think I've told you more than enough.

690
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,694
Now it's your turn to explain

691
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:26,823
why you brought me here
to talk about these things.

692
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,534
I was a bit rude, wasn't I?

693
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:32,787
I'm just scared.
Something just doesn't feel right.

694
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,957
So let's catch that murderer together.

695
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,126
I wanted to tell you this.

696
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,139
Shouldn't we ask
the police for help first?

697
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,433
We can't trust them.

698
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:57,103
After all, they're the ones
who removed all the evidence.

699
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,104
Don't you agree?

700
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,523
Not because you don't want them to know?

701
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,108
Don't be ridiculous.

702
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,487
I just think you'd do
a better job than them.

703
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,822
I'm a good judge of character.

704
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:10,075
What makes you think
I'll accept this offer?

705
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:14,329
Do you think those people
were the only victims?

706
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:18,374
You see, I have a variety of resources.

707
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,376
I'll provide you with the information.

708
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:26,132
I knew you'd like that.
I could tell right away.

709
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:30,261
I'm running out of time.
So what's your answer?

710
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,555
I'll come up with my own team.

711
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,266
But it will be riskier for us
if more people are invovled.

712
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,104
-I'll provide you with only the best.
-I can't trust the others.

713
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:41,147
I want NT Life Insurance's
Inspection Team B.

714
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,857
We need a disguise.

715
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,526
What about the risks?

716
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,531
Was that lady the team leader?

717
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:50,490
Yes, ma'am.

718
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,325
Tell her to come up with a plan.

719
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:53,952
-I'm sure she can do that much.
-Yes, ma'am.

720
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,745
-Of course.
-Then it's done.

721
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:02,877
If word gets out,
K might kill you as well.

722
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,506
So let's all be careful, okay?

723
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:11,052
We call it "K."

724
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:14,055
Ma'am, we should go.

725
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,182
You should exfoliate while you're here.

726
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,852
They say it's bad for your skin,
but that's not true.

727
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,604
By the way, who are you?

728
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,151
I didn't expect you to ask that.

729
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,989
Pureun Children's Foundation.

730
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,243
God, it breaks my heart.

731
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,415
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

732
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:41,791
Bow.

733
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,128
Good. Be careful
climbing up the stairs. Don't fall.

734
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,588
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

735
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,506
-Hurry up!
-Who is that?

736
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,758
Hurry! Okay.

737
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,135
Sir, let's go.

738
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,388
-Do you have your seat belts on?
-Yes.

739
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:01,186
PUREUN SAESSAK KINDERGARTEN

740
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,816
Goodness. Who are you?

741
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,693
I live here.

742
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:10,069
Unit 305.

743
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:11,779
Or was it 306?

744
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,949
-It's Unit--
-You're finally here.

745
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:17,118
Hey!

746
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,244
She's here.

747
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:27,420
I thought you were a clean freak.

748
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,255
What happened?

749
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:45,063
I thought you were dead.

750
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,423
You see this? I'm alive.

751
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:17,637
That was seasy.

752
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:26,980
That was seasy.

753
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,108
That was easy.

754
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,322
You should take a shower.

755
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,575
You reek.

756
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,499
Aren't you coming?

757
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:55,383
You're wrong. People die easily.

758
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,218
So stop them whenever you can.

759
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,150
I should, right?

760
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,780
Instead of just suspecting, I should do it
because I can and I want to, right?

761
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,992
Are you ready?

762
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:35,173
Let me play one round and unwind.

763
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,455
Just as I expected.

764
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:10,124
Santa.

765
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,210
Which comes first? Shampoo or conditioner?

766
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:15,672
-They're getting kicked out.
-Unbelievable.

767
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,048
My heart breaks for them.

768
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,758
-It hurts.
-That's enough.

769
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,093
Stop teasing them.

770
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,513
-Gosh.
-Poor things.

771
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:25,556
-Look at them.
-Nice.

772
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,392
It's because they're incompetent.

773
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,143
-I'm a bit scared.
-What is this?

774
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,687
Excuse me.

775
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,523
What? Shouldn't you be working?

776
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,359
No, we're being disbanded.

777
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:37,860
Why?

778
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,071
Because of our poor performance.

779
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,449
This can't happen.

780
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,285
What do you mean?

781
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,871
This team can't be disbanded.

782
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,541
Then let's improve your performance.

783
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,419
Hey, bring them to me.

784
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:56,963
-Bring what?
-The documents.

785
01:01:58,631 --> 01:01:59,882
NT LIFE INSURANCE

786
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:01,843
You're serious, right?

787
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,765
Let's do this.

788
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:11,561
Client number one. He fell down the stairs

789
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:13,813
and damaged his disc.

790
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:17,608
He claims he can't bend
his back at all now.

791
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,114
This is at a bronze level.

792
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,662
First, hear him out.

793
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:31,789
Is this where you fell?

794
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:34,167
I must've rolled down the stairs.

795
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,879
When I opened my eyes, I saw stars.

796
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,046
Then demonstrate it.

797
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,089
Like this?

798
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,764
Yes. Like that.

799
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:51,017
I see. We'll have it taken care of
as soon as possible.

800
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:05,406
My gosh!

801
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:11,954
You can bend your back.

802
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,213
Next.

803
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:22,632
She became deaf due to an accident.

804
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:25,301
She runs a butcher's with her husband.

805
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:31,557
This requires team play.

806
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:33,810
Watch carefully.

807
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,026
My kids want pork cutlet.

808
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:45,279
Right.

809
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,157
You lost your hearing.

810
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,493
Here.

811
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:56,624
What?

812
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:58,584
A car accident?

813
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,712
Kids from Hando Elementary got injured?

814
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:04,715
A male third grader?

815
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:06,759
What?

816
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:09,053
You can't reach his parents?

817
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,641
Because his mom lost hearing?

818
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:17,144
Ma'am! We have a problem!
What's Min-jun's blood type?

819
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:18,271
Blood type A!

820
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:24,569
What's going on?

821
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,529
I'm from NT Life Insurance.

822
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:29,699
Damn it!

823
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:31,826
Next.

824
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,954
He has stage three thyroid cancer.

825
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:39,208
He said he'd never had cancer before,
but his doctor found surgery scars.

826
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:43,880
Let's see.

827
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:46,090
Call an insurance planner.

828
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:50,344
Now you're finally back to your old self.

829
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:04,483
Hey, Aunt.

830
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:10,656
Right. I'm supposed
to receive counseling today.

831
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:14,911
No, I don't have any nightmares.

832
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:17,622
I'm fine.

833
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,415
Any other issues?

834
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:27,006
Just that my aunt

835
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:30,801
coddles me way too much.

836
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,387
Come on. Don't be absurd.

837
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:39,018
I'm so sorry, but it's work-related.

838
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,603
Sure. Take it, please.

839
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:41,812
Okay.

840
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:43,940
Hello?

841
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:47,693
You should come to see my play.

842
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,195
What's your role this time?

843
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,404
It's Crown Prince Sado.

844
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,281
-I'm playing royal subordinate one.
-Right.

845
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:54,408
-Yes, I can right now.
-I look forward to it.

846
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,995
So I need to meet with

847
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:01,415
Inspector Koo Kyung-yi?

848
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:06,212
I see. Okay.

849
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:13,302
I'm afraid I can't go shopping today.

850
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:14,345
What?

851
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:17,932
I have to meet
with an insurance inspector for work.

852
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:23,354
And that inspector is notorious
for being reckless.

853
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:24,271
I see.

854
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:25,606
I'll drop you off.

855
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:28,317
You can't come to my workplace.

856
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,194
I can take the subway.

857
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:33,364
Please. I'll stay in the car
and wait for you.

858
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:35,616
We can go shopping afterwards. Okay?

859
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:39,203
Forming a bond is crucial, right?

860
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:42,415
A strong bond
brings emotional stability, right?

861
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:46,252
You should let her tag along.
I think this is enough for today.

862
01:06:46,877 --> 01:06:49,755
And she's doing better now,

863
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,341
so let's meet every six months.

864
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:56,429
Really? Thank you so much.

865
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:57,888
Don't mention it.

866
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,600
See? I told you I was fine.

867
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:02,601
Goodness.

868
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,771
-Thank you so much.
-Goodbye.

869
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,148
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

870
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:09,358
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

871
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:36,260
Goodness, Jin-mo. What's happened?

872
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:37,678
Did you injure yourself?

873
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:40,765
No, I'm just a little unwell.

874
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:42,600
Where?

875
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:45,936
Do you not know what he's suffering from?

876
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,229
You startled me.

877
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:51,192
It's been a while, Ms. Koo.

878
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:53,903
Are you familiar
with the duty of notification?

879
01:07:54,695 --> 01:07:56,739
When he took out the insurance,

880
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:59,992
did he tell you
he already had thyroid cancer?

881
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:04,705
It wasn't checked on the document,

882
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,582
but he insists that he told you.

883
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:11,295
Jeong-yeon, remember what you said?

884
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:13,714
You said not to check it

885
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:16,008
since they couldn't
check my record abroad.

886
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,427
You said I needed the insurance

887
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:20,554
to be able to afford the hospital bills.

888
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:25,643
If he's telling the truth,
this is insurance fraud.

889
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:30,856
My aunt wouldn't do such a thing.

890
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,485
You said you'd wait in the car.

891
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:39,865
The sole evidence you have
is her testimony, right?

892
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:43,327
Correct. Nothing's on paper.

893
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:50,876
Come on. I never said such a thing.

894
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:56,173
Given your age, I just thought
cancer insurance would be useful.

895
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:58,592
Hey. How could you…

896
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:01,679
Come on out.

897
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:06,684
The insurer has the right
to terminate an insurance plan

898
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:09,520
if the insured hasn't
provided all the necessary information.

899
01:09:10,437 --> 01:09:12,106
Was this the last one?

900
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:17,653
Wait…

901
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:25,202
Wait.

902
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:27,371
Excuse me.

903
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:32,293
To be frank, I lied
because I was afraid of getting fired.

904
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:33,961
I won't do this ever--

905
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:37,006
"You had him pay us for months,
and now we can terminate the plan.

906
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:39,592
This is a plus for us.
Please keep up your work."

907
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:41,552
This is what they'll probably tell you.

908
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:42,845
I'm sorry?

909
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:44,430
Worry about yourself.

910
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:46,724
If anything, the company
will fire you first.

911
01:09:57,067 --> 01:09:58,068
What was that?

912
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:02,323
You had a piece of raw meat in your hair.

913
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,242
Hey, let's go shopping. Come on.

914
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,954
Why are you pretending not to know me?

915
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:10,015
Call me if there's anything you need.

916
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:13,727
A serial murder
without any evidence or a suspect.

917
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:16,855
I doubt they'd even figure out
how I killed him.

918
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,691
We're looking for the killer.

919
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:22,278
Don't think about why they are dead.
Think about why they were killed.

920
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,154
So he's a bad man.

921
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:26,699
Since the murders were planned
over a long period of time…

922
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:30,577
Why was it them,
out of all the people in the world?

923
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,496
Mr. Jang must be in a better place, right?

924
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:38,711
To kill without getting caught.

925
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:40,796
I'd find people who would never betray me.

926
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:43,424
People who'd never betray you?

927
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:45,050
Why could I betray them?

928
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:49,591
