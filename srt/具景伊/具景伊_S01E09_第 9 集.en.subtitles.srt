1
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:44,377
NO OUTSIDE FOOD OR DRINK

2
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,628
Does this

3
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,006
look good on me?

4
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,801
Ms. Koo!

5
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,220
How does it look?

6
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:01,936
EPISODE 9

7
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,609
Is this any better?

8
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,779
What have you done with Je-hui?

9
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,864
I don't know what you mean.

10
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:14,866
Tell me.

11
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,077
A spoon?

12
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,120
Should I show you what I can do with this?

13
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,413
Who do you think I am?

14
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,291
I'm not here to see you.

15
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,960
I'm here to see Ms. Yong,
who's calling for help.

16
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,546
"Ms. Yong"?

17
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,675
What? Why did you want to see me?

18
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,141
I thought you two
had some unfinished business.

19
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,684
You're a powerful person.

20
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,522
And I, too, have powers.

21
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:49,818
So I thought maybe we could work together.

22
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,153
-That's why I'm here.
-What do you mean?

23
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,533
Do you want to work
for the Children's Foundation?

24
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,450
No.

25
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,329
There's something I want to do.

26
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:04,415
I need someone with a lot of power
to watch my back.

27
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,459
What do you want to do?

28
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,383
I want to kill people.

29
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,805
It's tiring looking for people to kill
and cleaning up afterward

30
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,598
when I do it alone.

31
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,891
I see.

32
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,979
You must know a lot of bad people.
Like Ko Dam for example.

33
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,859
You say the most frightening things
with that pretty face of yours.

34
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,445
But how can I trust you

35
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,198
when you're intimidating me like that?

36
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,658
I see.

37
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:44,330
First of all,
I'm not killing anyone right now.

38
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,876
I'm holding my composure like a lady.

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,297
Secondly, if you ask me
for a favor right now,

40
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,886
I can make it happen right away.

41
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,556
Don't you do anything stupid.

42
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,850
Should I?

43
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,061
Let's see…

44
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,817
Right. I heard someone say this yesterday.

45
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,527
"Je-hui."

46
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,113
"I don't know anymore

47
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,949
whether you deserve to die or not."

48
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,246
What do you think happened to her?

49
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,833
If you promise to clean--

50
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,463
-Did you kill her?
-No.

51
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,342
But can you believe me?

52
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,095
You won't believe it
unless you see for yourself.

53
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,600
-Stop them!
-No, stop!

54
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,895
I could have died twice
in the time it took you to get here.

55
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,190
She's working with me now,
so leave her alone.

56
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,193
Which one?

57
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,071
Kimchi stains are impossible to remove.

58
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,574
Don't you have to go check on your friend?

59
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,076
You'll die too if she's dead.

60
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,882
Isn't it too easy?

61
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:22,845
Killing someone who nobody would look for

62
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,597
wouldn't be any fun for you.

63
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,686
What are you doing? Get her.

64
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,021
I see. Hey, come with me.

65
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,903
Gosh, that was amazing.

66
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,073
I think we're going to get along famously.

67
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,911
I guess you could be useful.

68
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,168
Why couldn't we have met earlier?

69
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,672
I'm looking forward to working with you.

70
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,047
Let her go.

71
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,383
You can't run from us.

72
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,395
Just get in.

73
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,816
Why not just finish me off here?

74
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,113
She doesn't like things getting messy.

75
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,573
You know exactly why.

76
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,886
Just tell me if Je-hui's okay.

77
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,137
She's dead.

78
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,227
Why ask
when you're not going to believe me?

79
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,117
Yes?

80
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,580
Yes, that's right. I'm Flavor Hunter.

81
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,042
I'm a Power Blogger?

82
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,753
Okay. I'll do that.

83
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,630
Yes, thank you.

84
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,716
This is so cliché.

85
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,761
Knockout gas? Are you kidding me? Hey!

86
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,086
Ms. Koo.

87
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,686
I don't like doing this,
but Yong Suk's put me up to it.

88
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,688
Don't hate me for it.

89
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,567
You like to drink.
This isn't too bad, is it?

90
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,486
Right.

91
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,716
Thank you for your hard work.

92
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:55,034
WASTE DISPOSAL

93
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:08,631
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING INSPECTOR KOO

94
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:25,147
WASTE DISPOSAL

95
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,746
She's done this before.

96
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,748
She probably went for a walk.

97
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,001
Do we really need to do this?

98
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,214
It's because she never goes out
this early in the morning.

99
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,466
There she is.

100
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,885
She seems to be on her own.

101
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,725
She's not the type of person
to take long trips alone like this.

102
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,268
At six in the morning at that.

103
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,522
The number you have dialed--

104
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,232
Ms. Na.

105
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,401
Are you all right?

106
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,446
Ms. Koo disappeared all of a sudden.

107
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,990
Call me right away
when you get this message.

108
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,455
UNREAD MESSAGES
MS. KOO

109
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,874
What is it? Did she contact you?

110
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,876
"I'm going to go collect my thoughts."

111
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,419
"Don't look for me for a while."

112
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,173
See? She's fine.

113
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,176
She's not.

114
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,721
She never writes long messages like this.

115
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,681
SANTA?
WHERE?

116
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,892
Where did she go?

117
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,694
ELDERLY TRACKER

118
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,657
ELDERLY TRACKER, TRACKING LOCATION

119
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,783
MY LOCATION

120
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,554
Is anyone around?

121
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,642
Is there anyone there?

122
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,688
Anyone there?

123
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,784
I'll be fine

124
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,787
as long as I "wit" my "keeps" about me.

125
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,498
That's right.

126
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,084
Come on.

127
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,503
Let's see.

128
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,505
Wait.

129
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,799
Careful.

130
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,763
And now…

131
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,704
My gosh.

132
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,434
This isn't a place she'd go
to collect her thoughts.

133
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,019
Are you sure she's here?

134
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:35,231
TRACKING LOCATION
SHARE LOCATION

135
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,619
Watch out, Santa!

136
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,879
Does that belong to Ms. Koo?
How do you know?

137
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,569
Seriously?

138
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:27,074
No, not me. Go away.

139
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,620
Shoo. Get away. Don't come.

140
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,497
No…

141
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,546
Go away. Don't.

142
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,047
Get away.

143
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,473
Anyone out there?

144
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,227
Anyone?

145
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,523
Kyung-yi.

146
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,526
Je-hui?

147
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,445
Je-hui!

148
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,614
Are you all right?

149
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,283
I'm over here.

150
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,744
Where?

151
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,080
"Where"?

152
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,132
I'm in way over my head.

153
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,722
Why are you trying so hard?

154
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,811
I thought you didn't have
a reason to live anymore.

155
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,605
That's what you said
when your husband died.

156
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,732
I did.

157
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,818
Then why are you trying so hard to live?

158
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,539
Because I'm a suspicious person

159
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,376
and I have to see with my own eyes

160
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,587
whether you're okay or not.

161
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,150
Let's see. Calm down.

162
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,623
Hold still.

163
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,379
Here we go.

164
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,602
Let's go. I can do it.

165
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,818
Hurry.

166
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,696
This is good.

167
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,156
I'm almost there.

168
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,622
Slowly…

169
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,207
Hold on.

170
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,252
Wait.

171
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,845
I have to…

172
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,306
I have to make it in one go.

173
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,059
One.

174
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,062
Two.

175
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,524
Three!

176
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,680
SPAIN

177
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,015
KASSANDRA ALONSO
NATIONALITY: SPAIN

178
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,062
No way.

179
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,981
I came all the way here.

180
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,943
I can't go back after just a day.

181
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,674
Muy bien. Muchas gracias.

182
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,217
Спасибо, Danke!

183
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,680
That annoying brat.

184
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,484
She really must be powerful.

185
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,938
KING LEAR, HANSEL AND GRETEL, JOAN OF ARC…

186
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,333
This place is so hip.

187
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,720
What is this?

188
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,665
They've put in a lot of effort.

189
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,044
This is a prison.

190
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,725
I was just going for a walk.

191
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,067
What the hell was that?

192
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,615
What have I gotten myself into?

193
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:41,586
Is that the sun or the moon?

194
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,755
Is this oil?

195
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,558
Wait.

196
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,143
Over here!

197
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,812
Over here!

198
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,066
This is fun.

199
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,777
Over here!

200
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,655
I'm down here!

201
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:37,494
Hey!

202
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,414
Hey!

203
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,297
I understand that you don't trust anyone.

204
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,635
But I bet no one in this world
cares about you more than I do.

205
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,266
I won't be there when you regret this.

206
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,812
You were right.

207
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,827
Oil! Where did it go?

208
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,081
No, wait.

209
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,474
I'm sorry.

210
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,695
Ms. Koo!

211
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,781
Ms. Koo!

212
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:11,022
Mr. Dokkaebi. Please find Ms. Koo for me.

213
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,110
I was determined
not to lose her this time.

214
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,738
I don't know where she is.

215
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,492
Help me.

216
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:40,135
SEHM KIDS CHILDREN'S HOME

217
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,345
You're doing great.

218
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,098
Don't go easy with the salt.

219
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,017
You two get along so great.

220
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,395
Why didn't you get more reporters to come?

221
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,983
We're doing this so that
we can feed our children good kimchi.

222
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,693
It's nothing to boast about.

223
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,280
Would you like to taste it?

224
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,617
I'd prefer it if he gave me some instead.

225
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,373
Right. It'd taste better
since he's better looking than I am.

226
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:14,294
Let's see. Here comes the kimchi.

227
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,007
Please move aside.

228
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,009
Open wide.

229
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,764
How is it?

230
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,978
You're not only handsome
but a great cook too.

231
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,818
Looks like we're out of the marinade.

232
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,696
Right. I'll go get some more.

233
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,240
You should come too.

234
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,297
Would this be enough, Mom?

235
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,179
Do I have some on my face?

236
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,349
Did you get it undone?

237
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,352
What do you mean?

238
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:18,191
Mom. Gosh, how embarrassing.

239
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,776
Have you, or haven't you?

240
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,862
I didn't. It just came undone naturally.

241
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,490
And now to snip it again--

242
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,951
Which hospital was it
and who was the doctor?

243
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,497
Do you know what I went through
to have you snipped?

244
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:36,209
Who was it that dared to undo
the procedure without my permission?

245
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,461
Mom. Why are you doing this?

246
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,463
-Someone might--
-Heo Hyeon-tae!

247
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:45,969
Gosh, Mom. It's not what it looks like.

248
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,596
I didn't impregnate her

249
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,598
and she didn't give birth.

250
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,642
It was just a visit to the OBGYN.

251
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,435
And the person who's blackmailing us.

252
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,522
He's not even her brother. It's her pimp.

253
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,149
He's quite well-known for being a scumbag.

254
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,236
I'll make this go away quietly.

255
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,196
How much does he want?

256
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,539
I'll help you.

257
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,417
Mom…

258
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,087
We should go back.
Seong-tae will be waiting.

259
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,755
Right. Okay.

260
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,804
You mess with Seong-tae's campaign,

261
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,639
and I'm going to end your life.

262
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,855
Come in.

263
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,825
Hyeon-tae's left
because he had prior engagements.

264
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,577
It's too bad.

265
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,374
Right.

266
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,668
Did you find the thing Ko Dam had?

267
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,961
Yes, we're almost there.

268
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,797
"Almost"?

269
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:11,721
I wonder
what your kimchi tastes like, Mr. Kim.

270
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,183
-Hurry it up.
-Yes, ma'am.

271
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,030
I say this every time I visit,
but this place has great Feng Shui.

272
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,658
It's overflowing with positive energy.

273
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,495
What are you doing?

274
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,331
No, let me.

275
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,335
You're a guest here, after all.

276
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,587
You've made yourself at home.

277
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,842
I looked around
and found a lot of old tea.

278
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,428
They say tea gets better with age,

279
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,847
so I tried creating my own mix.

280
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,225
Try it.

281
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,852
Fine.

282
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,526
What about you?

283
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,371
All right.

284
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,148
What happened to Ms. Koo?

285
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,610
She won't bother you anymore.

286
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,903
Is she in a better place?

287
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,823
It's you who's in a better place.

288
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,493
I see.

289
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,248
Right. I sure am.

290
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,754
Aren't you spending too much time indoors?

291
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,381
You should go out for some fresh air.

292
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,050
Can I actually go out?

293
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,888
His name is Park Du-mok
and he lives in Ssangbong-gu.

294
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,264
Is this enough?

295
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,349
Enough for what?

296
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,351
Isn't this enough
for you to use your powers?

297
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,603
Should I get the car ready?

298
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,441
It's not that simple.

299
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,985
There's a lot to prepare for.

300
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,450
It seems we need more time
to get to know each other.

301
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:43,122
Mr. Kim will get you everything you need.
What do you need?

302
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,127
What does he do?

303
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,088
Is he so bad that he deserves to die?

304
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,849
He's the vilest man
to have walked the earth.

305
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:07,522
He sells girls like you
who have nowhere to go.

306
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:11,442
He's a very bad man.

307
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,196
That bastard.

308
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,493
I asked him for two million
and I haven't heard from him since.

309
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,038
I guess I'll have to go to the reporters.

310
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,456
Do you know any?

311
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,335
Give me their number.

312
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:34,841
I'm going to show the world
what a scumbag he is.

313
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,599
Come on. They don't call him
"Rabbit" for nothing.

314
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,728
Why would I split the money with her?

315
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,439
I'm the one putting in all the work.

316
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:54,152
All she did was lie on her back
and spread her legs for him.

317
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,154
Am I wrong? I'm hanging up.

318
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,702
Gosh, that startled me.

319
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,871
You should have taken the stairs.

320
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,122
I'm sorry.

321
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,501
But who's Rabbit?

322
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,003
What?

323
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,255
I'll let you live
if you tell me in ten seconds.

324
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,829
Mission accomplished.

325
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,302
It won't kill you to compliment me
every once in a while.

326
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,387
I'm coming.

327
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,614
What's this?

328
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,366
This is creepy.

329
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:35,586
Tell me one good reason
why I should get out of here.

330
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,300
There isn't any.

331
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,477
I don't drink anymore.

332
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,276
Did you think I played computer games
because I wanted to?

333
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,328
I do miss drinking though.

334
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,378
Is that all?

335
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,184
It's not like you'd be there
even if I get out.

336
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:38,524
I'd have a better chance of meeting you
if I just stayed here.

337
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:16,645
It's always you who end up saving me.

338
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,919
There's no way this would work in one go.

339
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,425
I'm off. Bye.

340
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,400
Just a little more.

341
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,861
Just a little… I'm almost there.

342
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,807
Ms. Koo!

343
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,144
Ms. Koo!

344
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:04,772
Ms. Koo!

345
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,026
In this world, Santa can talk.

346
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,280
Get a hold of yourself.

347
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:50,359
I could use a round of applause about now.

348
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:53,904
Kyung-yi!

349
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,075
-Are you real?
-Kyung-yi!

350
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,079
Hurry!

351
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,211
Careful.

352
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,758
Wait. Slow down.

353
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,094
My goodness.

354
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,680
Come on. Slow down.

355
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:20,931
My gosh.

356
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,143
-My goodness.
-Careful.

357
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:28,314
No, wait.

358
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,818
Are you all right?
What did you get yourself into?

359
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,203
Je-hui? Is that you?

360
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:50,002
I should have given you
something more unique.

361
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,253
My gosh.

362
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,592
Geez, seriously.

363
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,845
Thank god…

364
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,143
Don't worry.

365
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,770
Thank god…

366
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:12,358
I'm fine.

367
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,679
Is that what you did to Ms. Koo?

368
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,144
Can't you hear me?

369
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,665
"This is the flower of breath…

370
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:12,918
the flower of bone…

371
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,672
and the flower of flesh."

372
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:20,300
"Father. Mother. You are to
travel back to the realm of the living."

373
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,719
"Come back to me!"

374
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,097
And then it goes, "boom!"

375
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,891
The smoke rises and it rains flowers.

376
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,560
The two come back to life and…

377
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,360
You're back.

378
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,994
I've missed you.

379
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,126
I knew you'd be back.

380
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,817
You should go see a doctor.

381
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,279
Hurry it up, Santa.

382
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,578
What flavor is that one?

383
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:32,247
The yellow one and the white one.
I want them both.

384
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,709
Hurry it up. Geez.

385
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:40,130
They'll probably think I'm dead.

386
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:42,841
Let's have them think that
for the time being.

387
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:44,760
But still…

388
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:08,617
What?

389
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:12,079
Do you want to go rat on them
that I'm still alive?

390
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,791
I'm not that horrible.

391
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:19,545
She searched all over with us
after she found out you were gone.

392
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,965
If I knew they'd do this to you,
I wouldn't have joined them.

393
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,509
Really? Are you sure?

394
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,600
You're being too harsh.

395
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:38,397
So why did K let you live?

396
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,649
She was here.

397
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,359
What do you mean?

398
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:46,863
I thought very hard
how K might have found Director Yong.

399
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,825
I knew how the moment I saw you alive.

400
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,870
How can you tell from just that?

401
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,212
And Na Na told me
that a pretty girl visited the place.

402
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,312
This is a nice house.

403
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,522
It looks like you have it good.

404
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,823
I wasn't going to kill her,

405
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:31,533
but I don't think I can resist.

406
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,538
If I pull a little harder,

407
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,290
you'll be dead.

408
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,629
What?

409
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,257
How can you faint already?

410
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,262
Hello? Are you there?

411
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:56,767
My gosh. I came to talk to you!

412
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,728
Geez.

413
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,085
You're just too much.

414
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,383
I'll tell you.

415
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,634
Tell me what?

416
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,969
The person who's after you.

417
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,557
The person who ruined everything.

418
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,892
I thought it was you.

419
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,563
Tell me then.

420
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,440
It's Yong Suk.

421
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,568
She's Heo Seong-tae's mom,

422
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,698
and she's controlling everything
from the shadows.

423
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:55,867
She contacted us
saying she wants to catch you.

424
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,328
Ko Dam, your aunt… It was all her.

425
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,413
Hold on.

426
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,044
-But why?
-What?

427
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,921
Why does she want to catch me?

428
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,549
There must be a reason.

429
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,344
I don't know that.

430
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,309
You don't?

431
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,617
She must be able to
sleep through anything.

432
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,618
I'm not lying.

433
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,330
I'll look into why she wants to catch you.

434
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:43,749
So please…

435
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,710
You're overreacting.

436
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,802
Do you know why
I won't kill you right now?

437
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,849
You go to a better place when you die.

438
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,351
That's what Ms. Koo said.

439
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,562
I don't want you…

440
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:09,524
in a better place.

441
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:11,568
Instead…

442
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,405
I could make your life a living hell.

443
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,874
You better be quick.

444
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,586
Before I take Na Na

445
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:33,632
and give Mr. Na Jong-jun a visit
at Munmin Villa apartment 302.

446
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:41,097
Let's keep our encounter
a secret between us two, okay?

447
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,194
K knows that Na Na's seen her face.

448
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,075
But K won't do anything to her.

449
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:03,370
She has a rule that
she only kills those who deserve it.

450
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,748
You'll be fine, Ms. Na.

451
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:09,334
Nonsense. She's just another murderer.

452
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,753
She's just saying that
to justify her actions.

453
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,673
So you're telling me

454
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:18,718
that you managed to stay alive
by promising you'd do what she wants.

455
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:25,725
You're being too harsh on her.

456
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,228
Then what was I supposed to do?

457
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:32,649
The team was disbanded because of me,
but I still had to make a living.

458
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,987
And she came to find me at my place
and you went missing.

459
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:39,322
What else could I have done?

460
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,700
What would you have done?

461
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:46,288
I wouldn't have worked for someone like
Director Yong in the first place.

462
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,540
-Stop bullying my mom!
-My gosh.

463
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:03,555
I know that I shouldn't have done that.

464
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,518
You have a lot to protect,

465
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,395
but I don't have anything.

466
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:14,107
What's the use in making such comparisons?
Don't you think so?

467
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,575
Let's find what K wants.

468
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,999
If you don't agree, get out.

469
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:42,093
But this is my house.

470
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:50,644
Why did Director Yong
want to catch K in the first place?

471
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:54,272
She contacted us all of a sudden
after the incident in Tongyeong.

472
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,483
Hold on.

473
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:59,945
That incident with Kim Min-gyu…

474
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:03,365
I had forgotten about it
since you went missing.

475
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,992
I found something shocking.

476
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,580
Well, it's…

477
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,460
-It's…
-Hurry and tell us.

478
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:16,753
The tattoo.

479
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,714
K's right-hand man from Ko Dam's showcase.

480
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,093
We don't know for sure
if that was her right-hand--

481
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,931
The tattoo that was on the right arm
of the right-hand man.

482
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,517
I found out what it is.

483
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,435
What is it?

484
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:36,398
It was the same tattoo
that Lee Jun-hyeon had.

485
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,484
Who's Lee Jun-hyeon?

486
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:43,530
That boy who died on the boat
during the Hyochang Bio party.

487
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:48,785
LATE LEE JUN-HYEON

488
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,121
These are from Lee Jun-hyeon's
place of residence.

489
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:52,622
There isn't much here.

490
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,212
K's right-hand man

491
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:01,631
is Lee Jun-hyeon's acquaintance?

492
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,758
It's more than that.

493
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:08,013
It's a tattoo that juvenile offenders
get to mimic the mob.

494
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:11,474
It means they won't forget each other
even after their release.

495
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:15,603
So this means
that K's right-hand man served time

496
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:18,940
in a juvenile reformatory
at the same time as Lee Jun-hyeon.

497
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:22,068
-Gyeong-su.
-What is it?

498
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,739
They say the "primer" near the school

499
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,991
sings the "sparrow."

500
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,743
That's quite a discovery.

501
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:32,662
You did well.

502
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,833
I got all the information

503
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:39,836
of the people who were in
Lee Jun-hyeon's contact list.

504
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,547
Let's have a look.

505
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:45,592
PERSONAL INFO
FROM LEE JUN-HYEON'S CONTACT LIST

506
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,845
AN GEON-UK, 25
WORKS AT MEK SECURITY

507
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:57,020
What? He just quit without a word.

508
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:01,733
Do you know if he was at work on this day?

509
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:04,736
But why would the insurance company
want to know this?

510
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,696
It's just that the days he worked

511
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,282
can affect
the maximum age he can work until.

512
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:11,785
I see. Hey, Dae-ho.

513
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:12,911
Yes, sir?

514
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:17,457
Take a look at this.

515
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,460
Was Geon-uk at work on this day?

516
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,254
-Do you remember?
-What's this for?

517
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,423
He's from an insurance company.

518
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:28,051
He's not close to Geon-uk,
so he wouldn't know either.

519
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:29,928
I've got to get back to work.

520
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:35,225
I'm Oh Gyeong-su from NT Life Insurance.

521
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,977
Did something happen to Geon-uk?

522
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:41,731
No. It's just that we need this
for some paperwork.

523
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,484
He wasn't at work that day.

524
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,279
He's quite frail.
He has problems breathing.

525
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,615
Then was he at work on this day?

526
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,326
He had the morning shift that day.

527
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,578
And…

528
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,963
We're done, right?

529
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,092
Wait.

530
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:13,972
Do you by any chance know

531
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:16,516
if Geon-uk had a tattoo like this one?

532
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:23,356
I don't know what he did,
but I don't want anything to do with him.

533
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,691
So stop bothering me.

534
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,711
I wonder if there's anything useful.

535
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,717
Don't touch them! They're mine!

536
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,429
Gosh, fine.
I thought you were throwing them out.

537
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:55,805
My goodness.

538
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,792
Will you hold my hand?

539
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:35,094
Be with me forever

540
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,349
Are you kidding me?

541
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:45,813
LET'S KEEP EXERCISING

542
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:03,164
Nice to see you again, you bastard.

543
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:13,341
We're here to read the gas meter.

544
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:20,056
How can anyone live like this?

545
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,485
Who the hell are you?

546
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,905
Go on. Back to sleep.

547
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,365
There, there.

548
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:43,413
When I was left to fend for myself

549
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:45,873
because nobody helped me
as I was a single mom…

550
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:49,085
What is she saying?
She must think she raised you on her own.

551
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:53,381
…it was candidate Heo Seong-tae,
who reached out to me.

552
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:55,049
It was like a miracle.

553
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,551
Na Na. It's your turn.

554
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,638
Gosh, it's my child.

555
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,890
He's good to moms

556
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:05,059
-He's good to the children
-He's good to the children

557
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:09,063
-We love Mr. Heo Seong-tae
-We love Mr. Heo Seong-tae

558
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:11,024
He's good to moms

559
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,984
He's good to the children

560
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:17,238
We love Mr. Heo Seong-tae

561
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,198
With Heo Seong-tae

562
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,242
-Let's go, Na Na.
-You're no longer lonely

563
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:26,080
He's kind and he gives you hope

564
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,917
Candidate number seven, Heo Seong-tae

565
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:30,877
I'm the best!

566
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,420
-Heo Seong-tae!
-Heo Seong-tae!

567
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,422
-Sir.
-Go, Heo Seong-tae!

568
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:37,216
-How about you join them?
-What?

569
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,552
It would look better that way.

570
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:42,055
-What is it?
-Well…

571
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:46,100
He's good to moms
He's good to the children

572
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:50,063
We love Mr. Heo Seong-tae

573
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:54,192
With Heo Seong-tae
You're no longer lonely

574
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:58,321
He's kind and he gives you hope

575
01:00:58,404 --> 01:00:59,447
How adorable.

576
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:03,034
Candidate number seven, Heo Seong-tae

577
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,411
-Heo Seong-tae!
-Heo Seong-tae!

578
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:07,622
Good job.

579
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:08,831
Good job.

580
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,419
What are we doing here?

581
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,963
-Let's go grab some snacks.
-Okay.

582
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,424
Well done.

583
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:20,468
You've done great.

584
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,179
Your idea was great, Ms. Na.

585
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,599
You look great on film too.
They'd think we hired a model.

586
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,476
Thank you, sir.

587
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,562
This is why we need young blood.

588
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,439
Time passes by quickly.

589
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,441
It's all thanks to you.

590
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:39,112
It would have been great
if your second son was here too.

591
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,447
I think Mr. Heo Hyeon-tae
might be better suited

592
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,949
to bring in the mothers' votes.

593
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,033
Why do you say that?

594
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,038
I guess I'm not good-looking enough.

595
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:51,165
That's not what I meant.

596
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,712
Your brother must be very busy.
I haven't seen him lately--

597
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,131
-I should get to my next schedule.
-Sure.

598
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:00,591
You're still taking
that ginseng regularly, right?

599
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:01,759
Go ahead.

600
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,392
Are you looking for a husband?

601
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:11,144
So…

602
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,980
do you want me to look for one?

603
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:15,481
No. That won't be necessary.

604
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,860
When did you last contact Ms. Koo?

605
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:22,989
It's been a while.
Do you need her for something?

606
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:26,033
No. It's just that
I haven't seen her in a while.

607
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,494
I was curious.

608
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:35,251
I'm rather relieved since she's so quiet.

609
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:38,963
The same goes for K.

610
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:42,759
It feels at peace
since they're not around.

611
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:45,970
I'm sure they're alive.

612
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:50,057
You still have that.

613
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,437
That scar, I mean.

614
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:58,483
Tell me if anything's bothering you.
Don't keep it to yourself.

615
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:39,649
If you keep eating everything we feed you,

616
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:41,651
it'd be way too easy for us to kill you.

617
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:55,039
I have no reason to kill you.

618
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,833
I meant Yi-kyung.

619
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:03,714
We've met before, right?

620
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:05,383
We met a few days ago

621
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:08,094
and we also met
a long time ago in Bongbaek.

622
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,806
LET'S KEEP EXERCISING

623
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:13,641
You shouldn't touch that.

624
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,352
I was wondering
if Yi-kyung did something to it

625
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,354
since you were passed out after eating it.

626
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:21,816
Why would she try to kill me?

627
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:24,360
Because you know too much.

628
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:27,905
Lady. You don't seem to know anything.

629
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:30,491
Then that would mean that you know a lot.

630
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:32,618
You're making me curious.

631
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:40,751
I'm going to ask you some questions.

632
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:46,007
I'll let you go if you give me
the answers I'm looking for.

633
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,806
Do I look that naive?

634
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:58,352
Do you think we enjoy
holding you captive here?

635
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,938
And you smell bad too.

636
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:06,319
Even if we don't, Yi-kyung will…

637
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:10,239
Or Yi-kyung's new friend
will come to take care of you.

638
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:14,911
She's made a powerful friend, you see.

639
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,041
She must have not told you.

640
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:23,794
There are others who are helping Yi-kyung?

641
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:27,548
I know that you two killed everyone

642
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:30,176
who was related to Lee Jun-hyeon.

643
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,219
But something kept bothering me.

644
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:34,597
You must still have what you dug up then.

645
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:39,101
Don't you know
that we leave no traces behind?

646
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:40,227
You're right.

647
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,188
Then how did you know

648
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:45,566
that the people you killed
had something to do with Lee Jun-hyeon?

649
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:49,445
Gosh, my legs feel cramped.

650
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,539
The security footage from the ship
and the port were wiped clean,

651
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,249
so we had a hard time finding them.

652
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:05,544
But people talked and rumors spread.

653
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:08,506
They said all sorts of crazy things
go down on that boat,

654
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:11,258
and that it's no big deal
even if someone ends up dead.

655
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:14,845
So we went after the people
at Hyochang Bio

656
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:16,889
who didn't go home that day.

657
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:19,141
You worked so hard.

658
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:28,734
Too bad it was for something stupid.

659
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,778
What? "Stupid"?

660
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:34,907
There's definitely something bigger
behind what happened to Lee Jun-hyeon.

661
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,786
What are the chances of there
being a backup of the footage?

662
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:41,539
There's no way it exists
since I couldn't find it.

663
01:06:41,622 --> 01:06:43,833
Gosh, Mr. Know-it-all.

664
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:47,128
You didn't know that the protein you ate
was laced with sleeping pills.

665
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,296
You're lying.

666
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:53,884
If you want to live,

667
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:56,762
you better start suspecting everything.

668
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,224
Mind your own business.

669
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:02,977
Who knows?

670
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,438
Someone might
set fire to your house while you sleep.

671
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:08,315
Or maybe they'll send you a bomb.

672
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:11,986
You can go now.

673
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,760
Gosh, don't come near me.

674
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:37,762
I said, get away from me!

675
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:40,306
Get away from me! Don't!

676
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,762
Is it someone's birthday?

677
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,935
Can you wait just a second?

678
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:28,646
I have something to show you.

679
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:36,737
I'm testing the method for my next kill.

680
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:38,948
You're going to kill someone with that?

681
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:42,118
Why? Don't you think it will work?

682
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:56,215
That was close.

683
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:00,845
The bomb worked just fine.

684
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:16,610
Don't touch my stuff!

685
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:18,946
Yes, there's nothing but trash here.

686
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:21,240
Something's been delivered.

687
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,284
What are you doing here?

688
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:26,620
-I ought to…
-This is fishy.

689
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:28,664
Is it a bomb?

690
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,300
How will you survive in this world
when you get scared so easily?

691
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,305
What if it's really a bomb?

692
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:10,748
I'M ALL YOURS

693
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:59,588
-Shouldn't they have killed him first?
-We got him.

694
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:02,967
You made all that fuss
just to kill one person.

695
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,427
What does it feel like
when you're on the job?

696
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:08,055
It feels as if I'm doing
what needs to be done.

697
01:11:08,138 --> 01:11:10,224
Ms. Na, you're like my mother at times.

698
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:13,435
-You knew already.
-Of course.

699
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:18,357
Why do you think
I didn't tell Director Yong right away?

700
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,526
If she gets hurt,
Yong Suk will get really mad…

701
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:23,529
-There was someone who we left out?
-Is she alive?

702
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:27,032
Tell K to contact me herself if she
wants to know who it is that she missed.

703
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:31,453
-Then we'll be able to find it quickly.
-Did you think you were perfect?

704
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:33,747
The person you and I really want to kill.

705
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:36,166
Do you have to keep doing this?

706
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,210
My aunt is still angry.

707
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,129
It's too late.

708
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:47,279
