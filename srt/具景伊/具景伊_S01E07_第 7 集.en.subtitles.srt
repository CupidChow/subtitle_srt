1
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,968
HE DESERVES TO DIE, SO KILL HIM

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,262
I KILLED HIM LIKE YOU SAID
BECAUSE HE DESERVED IT

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,430
KILL HIM!

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,098
SAVE HIM?

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,350
OVERLY SUSPICIOUS
EVIDENCE, HIKIKOMORI

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,518
I DO AS I PLEASE?

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,522
MY GOSH!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,359
CURIOUS?

9
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,277
THEY ALL DIED!

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,197
A HUSBAND-KILLER?
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE

11
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,240
SOMETHING IS FISHY

12
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,493
MUST WE ALL LIVE?

13
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,411
WE MUST

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,164
A NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN INSPECTOR

15
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,795
Maybe you'll talk to me

16
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,631
When will it be?

17
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:52,218
When will it be?

18
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,681
You will turn around to look

19
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,852
With a startled expression

20
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,825
Time keeps passing by

21
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,788
You should be almost home

22
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:24,250
Why won't you turn around?

23
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:28,004
Must you make me worry so?

24
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,257
I wish I could talk to you

25
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,762
I wish I could hold your hand

26
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,432
Just a little more

27
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,643
Just a little more

28
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,563
I wish you'd walk a little slower for once

29
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,578
KO DAM, A HUMBLE MAN FROM HEAD TO TOE

30
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,153
What the…

31
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,783
This is delicious.

32
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,919
EPISODE 7

33
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,258
Yes, hello.

34
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,304
-Hello, sir.
-You're doing a great job.

35
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,930
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

36
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,489
Let's get going.

37
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,662
The security is laxer than we expected.

38
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,541
What if a huge truck crashed into him now?

39
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,719
What?

40
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,835
No way.

41
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,396
He's untouchable.

42
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,994
Hello, sir!

43
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,413
Hello.

44
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,708
I'm sorry about the noise when
you've kindly let us use the road here.

45
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,669
Don't mention it. It's for a good cause.

46
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,463
Those dogs can bark as much as they want.

47
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,840
Have fun on your walk, guys!

48
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,304
How are you going to kill him?

49
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:22,739
It won't matter how long we watch him.
It looks like he's tightly guarded.

50
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,533
Give it here.

51
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,373
How will she kill him
when he stays hidden like that?

52
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,709
Take a look.

53
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,046
Maybe he'll come out
when a war breaks out.

54
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,465
Kim Su-yong will be back in a week.

55
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,675
Will a war break out during that time?

56
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,432
Will you be drafted too, Santa?

57
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,615
CREATING THE FUTURE WITH KD PEACE LAB

58
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,286
That's it.

59
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,539
Joan of Arc will march out to war.

60
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,047
SEPTEMBER 14, 2 P.M.
KD PEACE LAB CONVENTION CENTER

61
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,298
-My gosh!
-That's amazing!

62
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,133
-It's cool, right?
-It's amazing!

63
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,259
Don't you think so?

64
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,265
All right. There it goes!

65
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,393
There it goes!

66
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,065
My goodness. Look at it go!

67
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,113
There!

68
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,242
Ko Dam…

69
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,287
There seems to be no reason
for her to kill him though.

70
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,289
Things are not always as they seem.

71
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,626
There will be a showcase demonstrating
a robot made by Ko Dam's company.

72
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,837
He'll announce
his candidacy for mayor there.

73
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,630
Is that so?

74
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,969
He's heavily guarded everywhere he goes.

75
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,097
This will be one of the few times
that he'll be out in the open.

76
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,224
This will be when K strikes.

77
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,308
What do we do then?

78
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,978
We could just have him
cancel the showcase.

79
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:21,107
Will that make K give up killing him?

80
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,026
No. She'll wait for the next chance.

81
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,445
She won't give up.

82
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,280
You know her so well
as if you two are friends.

83
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,826
The same goes for Ko Dam. I doubt
he'll agree to cancel the showcase.

84
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,996
The showcase will proceed as planned,

85
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,124
and K will try to kill him somehow.

86
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,876
What do we do then?

87
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,044
We can't just let him die.

88
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,964
We'll have to stop her.

89
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,342
How?

90
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,054
I'll set the stage for her.

91
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,445
Whoever is on stage
could be considered vulnerable.

92
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,574
There's no telling who could attack
and from where.

93
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,788
That's what K is like.

94
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,541
We can't expect
when and where she'll strike.

95
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,503
Since we won't be able to
stop her from attacking,

96
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,714
we'll predict her next move
and prepare ourselves accordingly.

97
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,010
Will that be enough?

98
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:32,803
It won't be.

99
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,684
Just cut to the chase, will you?

100
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:47,026
The person on stage
has the upper hand in one thing.

101
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,822
Knowing that their attacker
is watching them.

102
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,004
My snacks!

103
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,215
They're mine!

104
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,010
Give me back my snacks!

105
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,888
Give them back, they're mine!

106
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,766
They're mine!

107
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,226
Let's take a look.

108
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,896
-They're mine!
-Bad Kyung-yi!

109
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,189
Let's go.

110
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,858
-I hate you, auntie!
-She's horrible, isn't she?

111
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,819
-Let's go over there.
-They're mine!

112
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,446
Yes. She ate them all, didn't she?

113
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,156
So you want us to use a hostage.

114
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,284
It's just an idea.

115
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,537
Then what do you need from me?

116
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,855
Be careful.
It will blow up at the slightest shock.

117
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,900
Is this what you're up to these days?

118
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,196
Since when did you start
speaking casually to me?

119
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,347
-What is it?
-Move it.

120
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,432
FACTORY 1

121
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,684
-It's really there.
-What's that box?

122
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,228
What is that? A parcel delivery?

123
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,149
Call the police. Now!

124
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,651
Hurry and call the police!

125
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,700
I told you to tighten up the security
since we have a showcase coming up.

126
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,995
I'm glad someone tipped us off.
Don't you think so?

127
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,872
Who gave us the tip-off?

128
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,833
I'm sorry, sir.

129
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,587
It's fine. You look like
you want to tell me something.

130
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:16,634
I think you should either cancel
or postpone the showcase, sir.

131
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:20,846
There have been numerous
irregularities. We--

132
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,224
Gosh.

133
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,477
Those damned beasts
keep barking away day and night.

134
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,813
Is that all you had to tell me?

135
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,408
Cancel the contract we have
with the 25 Hour Guardians

136
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,368
and file a claim for breach of contract
and compensation.

137
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,663
And tell the reporters
that their captain is a problematic--

138
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,501
I'm sorry, sir.
Please give me another chance.

139
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,880
You know what?

140
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,925
This isn't just about money.

141
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,845
This is about the trust between us two.

142
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,179
I'm sorry, sir.

143
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,475
You're sorry?

144
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,311
How do I know if you mean it?

145
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,357
If you're truly sorry,
you should show me how sincere you are.

146
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,694
Only then will we be able to
rebuild the trust we had.

147
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,946
Please tell me how.

148
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,741
Let's see.

149
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,744
How about some volunteer work?

150
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,459
Don't worry. I've got this sorted.

151
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,129
That's right. He did.

152
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,674
Then he told me
to go feed the dogs at the shelter.

153
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,303
Mr. Ko may be a little eccentric

154
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,929
but he's a good man.

155
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,475
Yes. He'll give us a second chance.

156
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,477
Hold on.

157
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,774
REQUESTING COMPENSATION
FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT WITH KD PEACE LAB

158
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,698
CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES

159
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,700
This can't be.

160
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,425
Children and dogs are better when quiet.

161
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,636
-Don't you agree?
-Sir.

162
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,430
What's going on?

163
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,767
You won't be away for too long
with animal abuse charges.

164
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,144
So just keep quiet and do your time.

165
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,023
Your wife will be devastated
if she has another miscarriage.

166
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:40,945
BEWARE OF DOGS

167
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,989
How could you?

168
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,450
How could you do such a thing?

169
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,577
Tell me it isn't true!

170
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,706
How could you do this to the poor things?

171
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,792
How could you?

172
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,258
DELICIOUS ANCHOVY NOODLES

173
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,386
SAVING

174
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,679
FLAVOR HUNTER

175
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,730
Hello? This is Top Bodyguard.

176
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,068
Yes.

177
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,321
"KD Peace Lab"?

178
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,458
They hired new security.

179
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,303
WHEN WILL YOU COME?
GRANDMA MISSES YOU

180
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,851
SOMETIME THIS WEEK.
WAIT A LITTLE.

181
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,936
You'll get caught if you keep using that.

182
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,732
-Are you surveilling my phone as well?
-We need to make this perfect.

183
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:11,160
Could I have
the most popular drink you have?

184
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,453
Hold on.

185
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,124
Enjoy.

186
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,250
Thank you.

187
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,046
POSTAL SERVICE

188
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,258
CONFERENCE HALL, EXIT ONLY

189
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,110
These are the people
who will be allowed in that day.

190
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,697
VIPs, reporters, and caterers.

191
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,533
Ko Dam is quite meticulous.

192
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,702
He hasn't invited anyone
who isn't trustworthy.

193
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,330
I had to do three interviews.

194
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,957
I failed my first interview.

195
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,710
So he doesn't use anyone
who he finds suspicious.

196
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,254
Yes, it seems that way.

197
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,006
Hey, you.

198
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,175
You've grown quite mature.

199
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,261
Since we're in charge of security,
you can join the security team.

200
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,014
Santa will be inside
and you will be outside.

201
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,182
Let's see.

202
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,936
He'll give an introduction
and introduce some of the guests.

203
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,231
Then he'll get on the robot himself
for the showcase.

204
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,693
He'll have some people on stage
to give him flowers after that.

205
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,277
Then he'll pose
for some photos as a finale.

206
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,488
The press conference was canceled
due to security reasons.

207
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,240
He'll just announce his candidacy.

208
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,328
But why did you say that earlier?

209
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,750
What do you mean?

210
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,420
You said he'd be a pain in the neck
if he ran for mayor

211
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,380
when we were at his office.

212
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,257
Who's neck will he end up hurting?

213
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,509
Director Yong's first son
is running for mayor.

214
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,720
Everyone knows.
You do too, right? Gyeong-su?

215
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,847
Of course, I do.

216
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,434
Well, you only care about games

217
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,853
and have no interest in the real world.

218
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,564
I was saying it'd be a pain in the neck
for Director Yong.

219
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,607
We work together. I can say that, can't I?

220
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,614
The pitch of your voice
still gets higher when you're anxious.

221
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,493
I told you to get that fixed
since it won't help with police work.

222
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:20,748
Stop accusing me.

223
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:27,546
There aren't any other entrances
apart from the ones we see here, right?

224
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,339
No. That's the final blueprint.

225
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,966
What about Jung Jeong-yeon?

226
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,301
She's on her way back.

227
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:41,560
How will K know what's going on in there
when all the cameras have been cut off?

228
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,522
She'll have her people out there.

229
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,649
That will be the chink in her armor.

230
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,830
So this is your big plan.

231
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,333
Will it work?

232
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,210
She can't help but take the bait.

233
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,464
It's the only thing K has to protect.

234
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,309
The view here sure is great.

235
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,521
Could it be time for dinner?

236
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,272
I can't even tell what time it is.

237
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,278
I wonder if there's a place
that sells budaejjigae nearby.

238
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,364
If I knew where I was,

239
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,324
I could recommend you a great restaurant.

240
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,494
-Ms. Jung Jeong-yeon.
-Bathroom.

241
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,996
I need to use the bathroom.

242
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,042
What is it?

243
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,128
Are you going to
follow me to the bathroom?

244
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,712
Take her with you.

245
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,799
I don't feel like it anymore.

246
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,134
Then sit down.

247
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,097
We've failed to track her phone.

248
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,271
Is she in Korea or is she abroad?

249
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,858
Is she in Seoul or somewhere else?

250
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,317
You're driving me nuts.

251
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,988
I told you already, didn't I?
I don't know where Yi-kyung is.

252
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,660
Just give me back my phone.
I'll ask her myself.

253
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,495
No, I'll just go find her for you.

254
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,664
I'll bring her and we can talk this out.

255
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,916
You can't keep me here like this.

256
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,001
Ms. Jung Jeong-yeon.

257
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,461
You're free to leave whenever.

258
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,925
Just say you'll cooperate with us
and we'll let you go.

259
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,177
You know that.

260
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,281
Are you one of them?

261
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,575
Long time no see.

262
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,535
You are behind this, aren't you?

263
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,663
You're the one who framed Yi-kyung, right?

264
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,624
Tell me.

265
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:13,295
I'd love to tell you.

266
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,465
How about we talk outside?

267
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,846
Let me talk to her for a second.

268
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,483
It's so bright.

269
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,866
What the hell are we doing here?

270
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,912
A plate of raw flounder
and a bottle of soju.

271
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:50,916
Then a couple of hours playing games
on the computer. That'd be perfect.

272
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,297
You knew all along, didn't you?

273
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,591
Know what?

274
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,844
That Yi-kyung is different
from the other kids.

275
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,057
You don't have a child, do you?

276
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,019
Every child is special to their mothers.

277
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,604
Of course she's different.

278
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,734
Yi-kyung is a good kid.

279
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,322
She's not even your daughter.

280
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,285
The message you got,
saying your mother was sick.

281
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,620
You know that was Yi-kyung, don't you?

282
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,623
No good kid in the world
would tell such a lie

283
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,709
to have their aunt travel to the States.

284
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,470
There's no evidence
to prove that it was her.

285
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,056
It's a baseless accusation.

286
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,229
You flew back based on what we told you
when there isn't any evidence.

287
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,315
That itself is enough evidence.

288
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:00,027
You were worried about it
deep in your heart.

289
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,904
You believed that

290
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,616
the suspicion you've had
may have been true all along.

291
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,163
I'm only here
because I'm worried about her.

292
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,875
You're not worried about
what will happen to her.

293
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,210
You're worried about what she'll do.

294
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,758
Stop saying that!

295
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,179
That's right.

296
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,515
Yi-kyung killed people.

297
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:34,186
What do you know about Yi-kyung?

298
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,397
Who are you to say such things about her?

299
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,358
What the hell do you know about Yi-kyung?

300
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,759
Are you done?

301
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:12,474
We want the same thing, Ms. Jung.

302
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,769
We both don't want anyone to die
or get hurt at the showcase tomorrow.

303
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,274
No one will die or get hurt.

304
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,487
Because Yi-kyung isn't a murderer.

305
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,492
I'm going to meet Yi-kyung tomorrow
and set things straight.

306
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,328
Then you'll have to…

307
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,583
apologize for saying
such horrible things about her.

308
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,711
When you see her,

309
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,132
ask her about your suspicions.

310
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,136
You're the only person
she can be honest with in the world.

311
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,920
How do you even
know about restaurants like this?

312
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,424
I mean, the fish just
melts away in my mouth.

313
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,052
You can come here regularly now.
I'll give you more money.

314
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,140
Did you get a promotion?

315
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,769
That could happen
if I tried a little harder.

316
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,855
Then I guess

317
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,482
you'll be even busier.

318
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:51,198
So please take good care of Na Na for me.

319
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,268
Nice!

320
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,728
Here we go!

321
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,480
Let's go. One more.

322
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:25,941
We'll go again.

323
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,151
Hit a home run like Lee Seung-yuop!

324
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,737
One, two, three!

325
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,545
My turn.

326
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:00,934
Hey.

327
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,692
-Where should I--
-Quiet!

328
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,198
What are they doing?

329
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,498
The computer hasn't frozen, has it?

330
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,375
It's working fine.

331
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,267
They changed the signal again.

332
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,854
They closed off all connections
and reset the system.

333
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,899
This isn't going to be
easy to get through.

334
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,276
Does she think this is enough to stop me?

335
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,405
How cute.

336
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,084
I did what you asked.

337
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,551
Why were you crouched like that?

338
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,888
Can we talk now?

339
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,348
You can.

340
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:07,477
But talk as if K is listening in on us.

341
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:12,148
Wasn't Joan of Arc burned at the stake?

342
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,858
We checked all the flammable items.

343
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,905
I thought I had to whisper.

344
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,784
Sometimes I envy how simple you are.

345
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,413
Here you go.

346
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,331
JOAN OF ARC

347
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:32,252
This book contains
so many ways to kill people.

348
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,797
I told them to report to me
if they find anything suspicious.

349
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,675
What's that?

350
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,676
What?

351
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,054
Over there.

352
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,645
My eyes have gone bad.

353
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,357
Let's see.

354
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:59,696
Diameter of 1mm. Black.
There's a lot of them.

355
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,658
I've heard Israel has developed
tiny bombs like these.

356
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,371
Aren't they rat feces?

357
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,261
They must have come through here.

358
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,429
What did?

359
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:26,765
Rats.

360
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,483
-Do I really have to--
-We can't have any gaps left.

361
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,650
Stay focused.

362
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,539
They're quite good at this.

363
00:29:56,252 --> 00:30:00,256
I think you enjoy playing with Ms. Koo
more than taking care of Ko Dam.

364
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,726
It's fun seeing her struggle.

365
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,523
Dealing with Ko Dam…

366
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,862
is too easy.

367
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,326
They say you'll miss the big picture
if you're hunched too low.

368
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,538
When are we going to eat?

369
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,504
Go and hide yourself.

370
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,215
Hurry.

371
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,261
-Who is it?
-It's me.

372
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,018
-Did you take your medicine?
-Yes.

373
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,274
The fever's gone.

374
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,026
I told you you didn't have to.

375
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,403
You haven't eaten, right?

376
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,030
I brought a lot of food
so we can eat together.

377
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,910
Hello.

378
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,080
What? Hi.

379
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,961
I'm Geon-uk's cousin.

380
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,422
I came to visit him while I was in Seoul.

381
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,757
I see.

382
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,219
Hi, I'm… Well…

383
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,846
I know him from work.

384
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,182
Jeez, you two must be very close.

385
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,435
You brought him porridge
when you just know him from work.

386
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,646
Can I join you?

387
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:43,026
-Sure. She can do that, right?
-Yes, why not.

388
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,571
Let's go take a walk after we eat.

389
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,994
It looks delicious.

390
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:03,922
That's mine.

391
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,092
-What?
-That's mine.

392
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,053
Geon-uk doesn't drink.

393
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,305
Right.

394
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,892
You shouldn't touch
someone else's property like that.

395
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,978
Well, he's not "someone else."

396
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,397
But you just know him from work.

397
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,733
-Are you going to be here long?
-Why do you ask?

398
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,111
This stuff isn't good for Geon-uk.

399
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,905
I want you to throw them out.

400
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,742
My gosh!

401
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:35,244
What's gotten into him?
Some colleague you have.

402
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,246
-Is he your wife or something?
-Yi-kyung!

403
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,291
What are you doing? Just eat the porridge.

404
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,001
Didn't you say you were busy?

405
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,425
All right. I'll get on it right away.

406
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,221
It tastes so good, Dae-ho.

407
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,349
-Slow down, will you?
-Okay.

408
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:06,484
K isn't looking for ways
to murder people in the playscript.

409
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,403
She's reading them for inspiration.

410
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,997
At first, angels appeared from the sky…

411
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:34,053
and the stones from the enemy catapults
fell on Joan of Arc's head.

412
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,828
I think the cables here are damaged.

413
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,164
I think it may be these.

414
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:11,382
In the second battle,
the angels bring rain

415
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,426
to keep the British army at bay.

416
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,212
SPRINKLER MAIN PUMP

417
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,598
Joan of Arc is shot in the leg
by the French army.

418
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,602
She is abandoned
in the middle of the battlefield.

419
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:45,101
You sure are reckless for
someone who's suspicious of everything.

420
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:46,853
Are you all right?

421
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,437
Thanks.

422
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,735
Let's put the cover back on.

423
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,206
How many more do we have to go through?

424
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:14,463
One more. And it's the most suspicious.

425
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,353
It looks pretty sloppy from the back.

426
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:36,986
MR. KIM

427
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,582
Can I take it for a ride?

428
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,342
You can't operate it right now.

429
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,057
You're scared to get in, aren't you?

430
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,560
How long will this thing be operated?

431
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,770
Let's see.

432
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:15,316
In the rehearsals,
it averaged 13 minutes 40 seconds.

433
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,527
How long does it take
for this to open and close?

434
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:22,490
It takes 13 seconds to open.
from a completely closed state.

435
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,601
What are you doing?

436
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,030
Anyone have a knife?

437
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,959
Move over.

438
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,551
It wasn't the robot, but the stairs.

439
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,262
It's made of ferrocerium,
so it's like flint.

440
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,222
When it comes into contact with metal…

441
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:36,022
It would be dangerous
to enter the robot using this.

442
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,608
If there's anything flammable
inside the robot,

443
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,485
a fire will start.

444
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,907
But Ko Dam won't be
scratching the stairs on his way up.

445
00:38:56,625 --> 00:39:00,046
His ring. He never takes it off.

446
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,674
And to operate the robot…

447
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,053
Shoe polish.

448
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,889
It's perfect to start a fire with.

449
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,266
And the insides have been
wiped clean with alcohol

450
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,435
just in case he could be poisoned.

451
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,021
And they'll clean it again
before the showcase tomorrow.

452
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,232
"Raise the cross!"

453
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,653
"Yelled Joan of Arc as she was
engulfed by the flames."

454
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,349
Here's our man of the day.

455
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,936
KD Peace Lab's CEO, Ko Dam!

456
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,526
With Peacehero 2, our future will be

457
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,070
full of peace and only peace.

458
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,243
Everything seems fine so far.

459
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,744
Maybe K gave up.

460
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,122
This will only be the beginning for her.

461
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:02,001
Did you check
who placed the stairs there today?

462
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,753
We'll trace their whereabouts
after the showcase is over.

463
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,506
It'd be better if we caught her
before we did that though.

464
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,766
Is it really moving? I want to see it too.

465
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,977
We're not here to have fun.
Stay in position.

466
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,791
You should stay focused too.

467
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,765
I'm just checking if it's been poisoned.

468
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:04,813
What is it?

469
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,607
It's so good.

470
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,842
This guy may be smarter than you are.

471
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,976
It's just as I expected.

472
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,186
How many are there to go?

473
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,938
There aren't that many left.

474
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,524
I see.

475
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,734
I'll put them away. Here.

476
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,486
Thanks.

477
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,613
What's with your voice?
Why are you being so kind?

478
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,407
You should talk to me like that too.

479
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,285
Whatever. How many are there left?

480
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,912
The fireworks were just the appetizer.

481
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,958
This will be the main course.

482
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,335
When?

483
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,213
Now.

484
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,683
That one.

485
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,643
No, the one before.

486
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,647
Bingo.

487
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,741
Jeez, this thing is heavy.

488
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,577
But you've been
exercising with your lover.

489
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,078
Where did your strength go?

490
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,131
Hey, you.

491
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,425
Yes?

492
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,552
Come here for a second.

493
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,397
Do you have any drinks?

494
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,068
I'll get you some right away.

495
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:17,154
-Please bring us some drinks.
-Sure thing. Bye.

496
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,836
Thank you.

497
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,798
I need to get
the security team some drinks.

498
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,424
Please.

499
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,764
Why not flirt some more?
Isn't he your type?

500
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:47,351
Next up, we have a guest speaker

501
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:50,104
from the Sexual Assault
Victims' Support Center.

502
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,064
Je-hui. Are you ready?

503
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,482
Yes. She's on her way.

504
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:57,111
A guest of honor,
invited by Ko Dam himself.

505
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:07,454
In the hopes of creating a just society,

506
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:11,542
Peacehero 2, operated by Ko Dam,

507
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:16,130
will present
our female guests with flowers.

508
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,143
It's about time
the chink in the armor showed.

509
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,145
We, at the center,

510
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,898
support Ko Dam's candidacy
to become the next mayor of Seoul.

511
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,234
I was going to pretend I didn't hear that,

512
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,528
but the mic is just too loud and clear.

513
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,625
With a heavy heart,
I will accept your support.

514
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,252
He's putting on quite a show.

515
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:59,798
Helping the victims one by one
on my own is nowhere enough.

516
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:02,426
I understand very well

517
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:06,805
that society as a whole must change
for there to be no more victims.

518
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:12,478
I, Ko Dam,
will become the next mayor of Seoul

519
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,147
and create a brand new Seoul

520
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:19,818
where you will be able to go about
your day without worrying about crime.

521
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,242
-I'm out.
-Hold on.

522
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,871
-What now?
-Get me a view of the robot again.

523
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,748
What is it?

524
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,626
-Ko Dam!
-Ko Dam!

525
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:38,921
-Ko Dam!
-Ko Dam!

526
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,298
-Ko Dam!
-Ko Dam!

527
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,508
Aunt?

528
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,052
What's she doing there?

529
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:48,096
I think something's gone wrong.

530
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,726
Get my aunt out of there!

531
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:56,021
The robots. What happened to the robots?

532
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,649
They're already out.

533
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:06,323
-Ko Dam!
-Ko Dam!

534
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:14,373
-Ko Dam!
-Ko Dam!

535
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:17,626
What's that? Robots? They're adorable.

536
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,795
-My goodness.
-They're so cute.

537
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,152
Is this a part of our plan?

538
00:47:56,957 --> 00:48:00,127
Those robots are adorable, aren't they?

539
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,795
They're dancing in unison

540
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:05,465
as if to show that they were made
in the birthplace of K-Pop.

541
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:16,935
AUNTIE

542
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,146
-The number you have dialed…
-Damn it.

543
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,441
Get her out of there now.

544
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,406
Was this on our list or not?

545
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,283
It wasn't.

546
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:48,508
-Evacuate the hall.
-What about you?

547
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,180
Where are you?

548
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,806
Ma'am. You have to come with me.

549
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:58,644
Who are you?

550
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,937
Yi-kyung wants you out of here.

551
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:01,938
Where is she?

552
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:05,108
Does Yi-kyung have
something to do with Ko Dam?

553
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,985
Hurry and get out of there!

554
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,528
Hurry!

555
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:10,906
Is Yi-kyung

556
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,075
trying to kill Ko Dam?

557
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,546
Everyone, get out!

558
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:43,105
Stop him!

559
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,361
Go keep Jung Jeong-yeon safe!

560
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,245
Where is Ko Dam?

561
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,957
Damn it.

562
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:26,231
This can't be.
Yi-kyung wouldn't do something like this.

563
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,506
Santa!

564
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,221
SEOUL MAPO
NA 0545

565
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:46,561
I saw the number.

566
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:53,026
Did you secure Ko Dam, Je-hui?

567
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:54,903
Je-hui!

568
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,742
Those useless bums.

569
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,954
How dare they do something like this
during my showcase?

570
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,249
How embarrassing.

571
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,883
911 FIRE DEPARTMENT

572
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,098
Where is my aunt?

573
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,141
Where is she?

574
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,519
He's so useless.

575
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,084
I'm glad I secured an escape route.

576
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,087
I bet you didn't know about this.

577
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,922
How dare they try to kill me.

578
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:27,996
Did you secure Ko Dam?

579
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,081
Je-hui. Je-hui!

580
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,045
MR. KIM

581
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,799
I've secured Ko Dam.

582
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,968
I'll send someone over.

583
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,942
-What's going on?
-Ms. Jung.

584
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:00,946
This isn't what you think it is.

585
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:02,864
Is this why

586
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:08,787
you told me that Yi-kyung
was going to kill that man?

587
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,873
Because you wanted to kill him
and frame her for it.

588
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,709
You're wrong.
You saw what happened back there.

589
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:17,253
It was Yi-kyung who did that.

590
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,130
How am I supposed to believe that?

591
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,260
This was so that you could kill that man.

592
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,389
No, he's not dead yet.

593
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:30,934
He's still alive. Take a look.

594
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:39,150
I was only trying to get him to safety.

595
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,700
Cut the crap.

596
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,707
Where's Yi-kyung?

597
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,878
Tell me where Yi-kyung is!

598
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,768
Where is she? Why did she even come here?

599
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,946
Where is Yi-kyung?

600
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,133
Hello?

601
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:48,219
Why are you answering the phone?
Where are you right now?

602
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:49,512
Is this Yi-kyung?

603
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,723
How did you…

604
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,726
Are you hurt?

605
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,227
Is that Yi-kyung?

606
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,522
Where are you right now?
Why are you with Ko Dam?

607
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,858
You're not hurt, are you?

608
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:05,028
Yes. He's not dead yet.

609
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,239
Where are you right now?

610
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,492
Don't move an inch from where you are.

611
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,338
Yi-kyung. Are you all right?

612
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,423
Yi-kyung!

613
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,392
Ms. Jung!

614
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,686
Are you nuts? Move it!

615
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:42,000
No.

616
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,587
This can't be…

617
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,331
We should go.

618
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,541
We need to get out of here!

619
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:35,595
-I did as you told me.
-Okay. Great job.

620
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:49,025
I just wanted to ask you something.

621
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:51,194
And say my goodbyes before you go.

622
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:55,907
You must really love your sons.

623
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,118
I'll do anything you want.

624
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,828
Let's stop now.

625
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,623
You sure have taught me a lesson.

626
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,668
I've learned a lot.

627
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:09,337
It would be great if I could believe you

628
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,005
but I'm quite skeptical.

629
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:15,468
I'm the only one who knows
and only I can access that information.

630
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,054
There's no way anyone would find out.

631
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:21,099
I'll take it to the grave with me.

632
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:22,225
Really?

633
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,435
Then I guess I'll let you.

634
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:30,858
What?

635
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,112
What are you doing?

636
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,324
No…

637
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,485
You'll burn your hair.

638
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:31,229
Ko Dam of KD Peace Lab,
a charitable human rights lawyer,

639
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:35,191
has died from the unintended
acceleration of his vehicle.

640
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,653
The police have reported
that the accident may have occurred

641
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:40,321
due to a faulty safety check.

642
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:43,825
Meanwhile, the fire that broke out
during the showcasing of Peacehero 2

643
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:47,662
caused a stampede at the conference hall
due to mass evacuation,

644
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:50,498
killing one and injuring twelve people.

645
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:54,335
While the cause of the death
is unclear at the moment,

646
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,671
it was reported that…

647
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,467
I just don't get how both Ko Dam
and Jung Jeong-yeon could have died.

648
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:27,970
It's because of me.
An innocent woman died because of me.

649
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,972
We won't be seeing each other anymore.

650
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,767
-So is this how you'll end it?
-Team B has officially disbanded.

651
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,477
What about K? Who will catch her then?

652
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,479
You don't look excited.

653
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:39,440
You look like a cow
being taken to the slaughterhouse.

654
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:42,985
After what happened to your aunt,
you're not the same as you used to be.

655
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:46,405
I should have realized that when you were
after me even though you're not a cop.

656
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,950
You must think we're running
some big operation just to catch you,

657
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:50,535
but you're not that important.

658
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:54,121
How could you be so laid-back
when I could be coming for you any minute?

659
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,748
You find that suspicious too, right?

660
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,708
She was a horrible person.

661
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,336
It wasn't because he was a bad man
that they killed him.

662
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:04,131
I don't know
whether she's right or not anymore.

663
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:02,833
