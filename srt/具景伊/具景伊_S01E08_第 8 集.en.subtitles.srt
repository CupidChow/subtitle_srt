1
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,968
HE DESERVES TO DIE, SO KILL HIM

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,262
I KILLED HIM LIKE YOU SAID
BECAUSE HE DESERVED IT

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,430
KILL HIM!

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,098
SAVE HIM?

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,350
OVERLY SUSPICIOUS
EVIDENCE, HIKIKOMORI

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,518
I DO AS I PLEASE?

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,522
MY GOSH!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,359
CURIOUS?

9
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,277
THEY ALL DIED!

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,197
A HUSBAND-KILLER?
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE

11
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,240
SOMETHING IS FISHY

12
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,493
MUST WE ALL LIVE?

13
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,411
WE MUST

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,164
A NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN INSPECTOR

15
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,558
Please…

16
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,061
Please help me.

17
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,106
Yi-kyung!

18
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:15,617
I was just trying to talk to your mother.

19
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,327
Does that make you so jealous?

20
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,371
What's the use?
It's not like she's listening.

21
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,207
She's dead, so how can she?

22
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:28,880
Yi-kyung.

23
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,177
Your mom is listening.

24
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:45,814
You know your mom used to study
all the time when she was young, right?

25
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,148
And I liked to gossip.

26
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,861
I used to talk to her for hours
while she was studying

27
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,656
then went to sleep upset
because she wouldn't listen.

28
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,868
But one day she gave me a hairpin.

29
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,412
I might have told her I wanted one.

30
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,874
I couldn't remember
if I ever told her that though.

31
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,893
Your mother

32
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:29,607
is the greatest listener
of all the people I know.

33
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,860
I'm jealous.

34
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,196
You have someone
who listens to everything you say.

35
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,489
Nonsense.

36
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,367
You have me, don't you?

37
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,328
If there's anything you can't tell me…

38
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,790
Here. You can talk to your mom about it.

39
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,293
I won't ever get jealous.

40
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,295
Excuse me.

41
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,714
I can't hear anything.

42
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,343
EPISODE 8

43
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,568
Keep looking.

44
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,509
The number plate wasn't in the registry

45
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,552
and she wasn't at the crematorium either.

46
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,723
I don't think there's
anything more we can do.

47
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,477
Are you listening?

48
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,240
Santa.

49
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,953
It's raining.

50
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,040
We have to…

51
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,462
close the windows.

52
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,169
Santa.

53
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,839
This isn't it.

54
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:42,842
Santa.

55
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,429
Wake up.

56
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,668
I usually have caramel,

57
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,546
but I also feel like having mango
since it's so hot right now.

58
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,009
But I've got to have rice
and chocolate too.

59
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,181
Aunt. You like pistachio, right?

60
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,808
What should I do?

61
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,103
-Have you picked a flavor?
-No, not yet.

62
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,775
I want you to pick for me, Aunt.

63
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,360
What should I do?

64
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,238
I'll just…

65
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,326
have all of them.

66
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:17,413
Everything from here to here.

67
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,216
Yes?

68
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,843
I saw them cremate her body.

69
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,011
Okay.

70
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,640
-There were a few people there.
-Really?

71
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,850
You should visit too.

72
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,606
-What for?
-What?

73
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,818
-What are you up to right now?
-Eating ice cream.

74
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,320
It's melting. Bye.

75
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,612
Today…

76
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:36,742
we lost an invaluable member of society.

77
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,870
To prevent something like this
from ever happening again…

78
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,585
I will fight to enact a law that makes

79
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,878
safety inspections mandatory.

80
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,464
As a politician…

81
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,799
YOU FOUGHT FOR JUSTICE
WE LOVE YOU, MR. KO

82
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,260
…I was devastated to hear
that Mr. Ko had passed away

83
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,013
before the public had the chance
to hear of his future plans.

84
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,308
Poor thing. He was so young.

85
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,103
It's unfortunate, isn't it?

86
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,441
He wasn't a good man though.

87
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,865
Don't you think so?

88
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,785
You should watch what you say
when there are others around.

89
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,953
People are watching.

90
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,374
And you're acting out of line
by sitting at my table.

91
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,258
Gosh, this is too salty.

92
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:42,516
Mr. Kim. Things must be hard for you.

93
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,269
It should be good now.

94
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,562
Right.

95
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,983
It may seem like I push people around,

96
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,444
but it always turns out
I was right all along.

97
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,574
Wasn't your daughter having a hard time
because her house was too small?

98
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,994
Don't worry about that, Director.
I'll take care of my own children.

99
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,539
But you've done so much for me.

100
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,626
It's only right that
I should do that much.

101
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,753
It crossed my mind lately.

102
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:15,466
I don't think I can ever work with people
who don't do as I say.

103
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:21,972
Has Ms. Na taken care of her people?

104
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,183
Yes.

105
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:29,105
She won't be able to leave her room,
let alone her house, in her current state.

106
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,689
What about the other one?

107
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,274
Of course we should catch her.

108
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,985
If it wasn't for her,
things wouldn't have gone our way.

109
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:41,617
I have a gut feeling
we'll get along just fine.

110
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,870
When do you think I can see her?

111
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,956
We'll get on it as soon as we can.

112
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,794
-Don't forget to grab your meals.
-Thank you.

113
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,754
-Go grab something to eat.
-Thank you.

114
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,964
Let's go eat.

115
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,057
We still have a long way to go.

116
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,523
-Dig in.
-Thank you.

117
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:22,700
RAG

118
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,877
Looks like the fever's gone.

119
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,671
Eat.

120
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,602
You were the one who pushed the trolley.

121
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,231
How can I be sure

122
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,108
that you're not working with K?

123
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,363
All I could find out about you

124
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,533
was your name and your age.

125
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,621
And since your name was legally changed,
I can't dig any deeper into your past.

126
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,834
All you have saved on your phone

127
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,962
are the phone numbers
of the people in our team.

128
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,381
Not a single family or a friend.

129
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,096
And?

130
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,935
You being here is suspicious too.

131
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,354
It's over now, so why are you still here?

132
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,939
You have a home.

133
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,029
Come with me.

134
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,079
I'll show you everything.

135
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,179
MS. KOO KYUNG-YI

136
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,472
GYEONG-SU

137
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,016
MS. NA

138
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,559
OH GYEONG-SU
NA JE-HUI

139
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,894
What's all this?

140
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,189
I brought them whenever
you guys made me feel warm inside.

141
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,486
Didn't I have this all for myself?

142
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,157
You poured me a glass.

143
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,342
What about this then?

144
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,635
Why do you have this?

145
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,973
I wanted to try and understand

146
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,517
why K had made something like this.

147
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,603
So do you get it now?

148
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,481
It calmed me down.

149
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,567
Instead of feeling
the urge to kill someone,

150
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,445
I felt as if a map
was being drawn in my head.

151
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,407
I think all the dolls
were joined together at one point.

152
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,954
"Joined together"?

153
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,086
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

154
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,589
Because you like things that are certain.

155
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,931
Even here, there's nothing
that tells me about who you are.

156
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,100
That's why you brought me here.

157
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,688
There's nothing here that tells me
what kind of a life you lead.

158
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,611
MEMORIES AND RECOLLECTIONS

159
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:40,207
There's only stuff about us here.

160
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,335
It's as if nothing else
matters to you except us.

161
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,632
That's what I find so suspicious.

162
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:59,059
You would have been suspicious
no matter what this house looked like.

163
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,980
Whether it was regular or strange.

164
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,790
You're right.

165
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,627
I can't shake off this suspicion.

166
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,094
We won't be seeing each other anymore.

167
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,407
What's going on?

168
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:57,993
OH GYEONG-SU

169
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,663
What's going on, Ms. Na?

170
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,277
You've done well, Gyeong-su.

171
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,987
Team B has officially disbanded.

172
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,573
What about K? Who will catch her then?

173
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,368
Anyone but us, since we failed.

174
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:44,081
I just don't get how both Ko Dam
and Jung Jeong-yeon could have died.

175
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,251
-I've thought about it so many times and--
-Gyeong-su.

176
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,838
Being able to admit
that you failed is also a virtue.

177
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,926
We were given a task and we failed.

178
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,179
I will take full responsibility
as the team leader.

179
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,181
But we can't just give up--

180
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:05,811
How could you stand
being in this dump for months?

181
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,941
Isn't anyone going to say hi?

182
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,152
I was told to take you into my team.

183
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,445
Take good care of him for me.

184
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,282
We're like brothers.

185
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,867
Anyway, Ms. Na--

186
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,493
Gosh. My bad.

187
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,538
How should I address you now?

188
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,583
I don't know what to call you
because I outrank you now.

189
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:32,546
It will be awkward calling you "Ms. Na"
if you joined my team, wouldn't it?

190
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,590
You don't need to worry about that.

191
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,133
Gosh. Were you let go?

192
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,261
My gosh. It's difficult
finding a job these days.

193
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,387
Hold on.

194
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,432
A friend of mine is looking
for an accountant. Should I--

195
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,018
Thank you for your concern,

196
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,811
-but I'm already hired.
-You're hired?

197
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,272
"Campaign Adviser, Na Je-hui…"

198
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,065
What?

199
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,901
Ms. Na.

200
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,987
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

201
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:06,163
Today will be cloudy throughout
the country with a little rain in Seoul.

202
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,956
Due to smog from China,

203
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,835
there will be a little fine dust
the mid-western area.

204
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,712
It will be 18 degrees Celcius in Seoul,

205
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,380
and 21 degrees Celcius
in Gwangju and Busan.

206
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,549
The day will be slightly warmer
than yesterday.

207
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,762
I am a Campaign Adviser
for candidate Heo Seong-tae.

208
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,013
My name is Na Je-hui.

209
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:29,228
To uphold Candidate Heo's wishes
to create a city that's for women,

210
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,813
our camp has formed
a Women's Advisory Board

211
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,066
made up of Women's Rights activists,
housewives, and young women

212
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,443
-in their twenties and thirties
-Hey.

213
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,154
-Stop fidgeting if you're not eating.
-The Women's Advisory Board

214
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,407
will hire more female staff,
and work to increase

215
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,785
the involvement of women in politics.

216
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:48,956
-Also, including benefits tailored…
-Get lost if you're not going to eat.

217
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,873
Screw you.

218
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,459
-…reflected in our proposed policies.
-What did you say?

219
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,587
-What did you just say to me?
-We will fight so that both women

220
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,923
and other disadvantaged groups
will be given…

221
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,299
Hey.

222
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,469
You little brat!

223
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,847
Gosh, there are customers here!

224
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,975
Get out. Leave.

225
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,227
-Get out of here.
-I have money.

226
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,397
I'm going to finish my food,
so don't touch me.

227
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,690
I don't need your money.

228
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,650
-Get out!
-Don't touch me.

229
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,610
-I have money.
-My gosh.

230
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,741
Gosh, I'm terribly sorry.
She's always like that when she drinks.

231
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,493
Oh, my. What should I do?

232
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,161
Should I get you a new bowl?

233
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,413
It's fine. I'm done.

234
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,518
So, what do you think?

235
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,272
To me, it seems you don't deserve to live.

236
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,295
What?

237
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,299
Okay.

238
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,846
I'll kill them all
just like you said, Aunt.

239
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,611
What happened?

240
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,237
Who is that?

241
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,614
Did someone push her?

242
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,705
Come on. It's this way.

243
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,918
Gosh, the light…

244
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:04,591
You joined us
just as we ran out of tables.

245
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,218
It's cozy, isn't it?

246
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,305
Since you're alone,
you'll be free to do whatever you want.

247
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,473
It'll be great.

248
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,644
Take these. These are the documents
you have to process by the end of the day.

249
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,896
-Good luck.
-Sure.

250
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,441
This is great.

251
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,412
Damn it.

252
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,753
Get it together, Gyeong-su. You can do it.

253
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,713
I can do this.

254
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,063
Is that a rat hole?

255
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:05,235
Ms. Koo said I shouldn't leave any…

256
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,864
Stop him!

257
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,733
Ms. Koo.

258
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,614
I brought you whiskey.

259
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:51,948
Good.

260
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,784
Do you want this? You do, right?

261
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,995
Come on. Die. Die, already.

262
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,079
I'm sorry?

263
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,373
I think we're almost there.

264
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,043
Good. This is good. Shoot him down.

265
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:06,963
Kill it! Finish him!

266
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,721
What are you doing here?

267
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,891
Where is Santa?

268
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,352
He has no reason to be here anymore.

269
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,853
The same goes for you.

270
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,650
Why don't we have some of this first?

271
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,082
I failed to keep

272
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,876
Ms. Jung Jeong-yeon safe.

273
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,962
I came to apologize for that.

274
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,693
This isn't a knock-off.
It's pretty good whiskey.

275
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,069
I quit drinking.

276
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,779
What?

277
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,618
Alcohol kills brain cells.

278
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,495
Are you not feeling well?

279
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,372
You're not terminally ill, are you?

280
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,707
Be quiet.

281
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,001
Go home if you're done here.

282
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,669
I don't like having people over.

283
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,255
-But you were okay with Santa.
-I'm not.

284
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,673
Get out.

285
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,384
I've brought decisive evidence.

286
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,219
The man who is K's accomplice…

287
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,392
He had a tattoo on his arm.

288
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,337
You're very good. He's handsome.

289
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,512
That's him.

290
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,229
Here.

291
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,775
We'll be able to see where they went
if we check the cameras along this path.

292
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,737
Do you think there is a way?

293
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,198
I'll look into it.

294
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,369
It's not that I can trust you, Gyeong-su,

295
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,746
but you're all I've got.

296
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,214
But there's one thing I don't get.

297
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:57,133
I don't get why Ko Dam

298
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,636
was found dead in his car
from an accident.

299
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,346
And…

300
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,515
Why Ms. Jung, who was evacuated,

301
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,142
was also found dead.

302
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,271
You find that suspicious too, right?

303
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,148
It's because of me.

304
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,819
It's because I was involved.

305
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,948
An innocent woman died because of me.

306
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,502
So is this how you'll end it?

307
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,257
I've checked the main entrance
of the conference hall.

308
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,427
But the two of them
were nowhere to be seen.

309
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,682
There must have been an escape route
that only he knew about.

310
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,476
Do you really think
K would let her aunt die?

311
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,146
It probably wasn't intentional.

312
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,358
There are so many suspicious things.

313
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,277
I'm not usually this suspicious--

314
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,987
I should have been more suspicious.

315
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,740
I'm sorry?

316
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:22,051
So you checked to see
who came out of the main entrance?

317
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,052
Yes.

318
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,346
Did you see Je-hui?

319
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:31,770
Ms. Na should have been
in the control room, so…

320
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:38,526
The security footage has been erased,
so we only have our memories to go by.

321
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,821
Only Ko Dam and Jung Jeon-yeon

322
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:46,075
were the ones we couldn't find
in the footage, and they both died.

323
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,411
Think about it.

324
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,708
Who else did you not see
coming out of the main entrance?

325
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,266
What are you doing?

326
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,019
They say handstands
help you remember things.

327
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,938
It circulates the blood to the brain.

328
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:26,407
CONFERENCE HALL
EXIT, ENTRY

329
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,742
I remembered.

330
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,495
She wasn't there.

331
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,581
Ms. Na…

332
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,376
didn't leave through the main entrance.

333
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,964
That must actually work.

334
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,634
Time for me to use my brain.

335
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,794
What's gotten into you?
You won't last ten minutes like that.

336
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,297
Stop me if I go too fast.

337
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,715
Try to keep pace with me.

338
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,685
You sure run fast.

339
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,728
Hi.

340
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,479
What do you want?

341
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:42,191
Geon-uk was too busy hanging out with you,
so I came here alone.

342
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:45,737
What a coincidence
that we bump into each other.

343
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,072
Are you hurt? Isn't that blood?

344
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:50,867
Hey!

345
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,203
My gosh. You startled me.

346
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,372
Well…

347
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,958
I had a nosebleed earlier.

348
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,461
Get off.

349
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:05,715
I told you these things
are dangerous, didn't I?

350
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,091
Geon-uk.

351
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,427
-This thing is the least of my worries.
-Yi-kyung.

352
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,638
There's more blood down there.

353
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,265
Come on, you're going home.

354
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,059
Stop making such a fuss.

355
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,019
I won't ride it, okay?

356
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,229
How about we grab something to eat?

357
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,942
I've had a bit of a workout just now.

358
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,860
It's made me hungry.

359
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:30,531
Why don't you go ahead
to where we're supposed to have lunch.

360
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,326
I'll meet you there after I get her home.

361
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,078
-Sure thing.
-See you.

362
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,245
What are you having--

363
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:40,416
Leave me alone! I want to go too!

364
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,210
Let me go!

365
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,962
I want to join you!

366
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,713
Let go of me!

367
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,841
Should we go on a trip to the beach?

368
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,428
Are you okay?

369
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,473
I'm still new to wheelchairs.

370
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,729
You can't be out
in broad daylight like that.

371
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:05,692
It makes no difference where I am.
They'll find me if they want to.

372
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,860
Is that why you're here?

373
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,362
Don't you have any plans?

374
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,532
Plans? I can't be bothered anymore.

375
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,076
You cleaned up afterward, right?

376
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,705
I don't remember.

377
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,251
-Did I or did I not?
-Why you…

378
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,008
Wait. Maybe it's here.

379
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,344
SAFETY FIRST

380
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,819
Do you kill people randomly now?

381
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,280
She was a horrible person.

382
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,159
Who says?

383
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,203
My aunt. She told me she was a bad person.

384
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,496
Damn it.

385
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,883
Do you think we can
make it look like a suicide?

386
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,220
What reason does she have
to come all the way here to hang herself?

387
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,848
Was she suffering
from any heart conditions?

388
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,560
I've found something.

389
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,771
Will this be enough?

390
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,942
You idiot. That's for athlete's foot.

391
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,361
What do we do then?

392
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:35,239
I don't know. This is your job.

393
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,367
I kill people who deserve it,
and you clean up afterward.

394
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,411
Geon-uk. Are you here?

395
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,252
Give me that rope.

396
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,463
Stay put.

397
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,716
I'll send him away, so just stay here.

398
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,843
I'll give you one minute.

399
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,430
If he shows his face again--

400
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,182
Stop joking around.

401
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,810
Sixty, fifty-nine,

402
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,687
fifty-eight, fifty-seven!

403
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,816
Dae-ho. I told you to wait for me there.

404
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,860
Is she in there too?

405
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,029
What is it between you two?

406
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,656
It's nothing. Just go.

407
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,866
-I'll explain later.
-Geon-uk.

408
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,285
Just tell me now.

409
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:25,081
I'm ready for
whatever you're going to tell me.

410
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,707
Forty-one!

411
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,085
Forty!

412
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,546
Thirty-nine!

413
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,756
-Thirty-eight!
-Hey.

414
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,842
She's not your cousin, is she?

415
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:40,096
Hey. I told you to get lost, didn't I?

416
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,348
Don't make me repeat myself.

417
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:46,102
Thirty-four! Thirty-three!

418
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,396
-Whatever it is, just tell me.
-Thirty-two!

419
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,982
-It's fine as long as you're honest.
-"Honest"?

420
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:55,153
I've just pretended to like you,
and you fell for it like an idiot.

421
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,780
Can't you see that
I'm just toying with you?

422
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,576
Five! Four!

423
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,745
-Three! Two!
-I don't like you. I never did!

424
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,456
-One!
-So just go. You're pissing me off.

425
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,333
Time's up!

426
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,129
Get lost.

427
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,013
I did it, see? I've made him go away.

428
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,223
This will be enough to keep him away.

429
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,644
My goodness, I'm almost in tears.

430
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,449
I won't just sit back if you touch him.

431
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,117
Then what?

432
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,744
I'll kill myself.

433
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,247
Then you'll really have no one left.

434
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,458
I know that much.

435
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:32,959
If you're going to keep doing this,
let's go back to how we used to do it.

436
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,169
Cover our tracks perfectly.

437
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,424
You don't look excited.

438
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,846
You look like a cow
being taken to the slaughterhouse.

439
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,849
What about you?
After what happened to your aunt,

440
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,478
you're not the same as you used to be.

441
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,523
But it's more fun to kill randomly.

442
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,692
I don't have to
worry about the consequences.

443
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,528
Yi-kyung. I'll help you.

444
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,281
Kill the people you really want to kill.

445
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,157
And who's that?

446
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,202
The people who did that to your aunt.

447
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:15,793
That includes us too.

448
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,546
How will you help with that?

449
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,259
You're useless.

450
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,807
I don't need you anymore.

451
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,073
There's something I wanted to ask you.

452
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:47,867
What is it?

453
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,244
What were you going to have for lunch?

454
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,246
Spicy noodles.

455
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,165
Sounds delicious.

456
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,834
Should we get some together?

457
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,044
No.

458
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,880
I'm going to go alone.

459
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:21,108
The latest polls show that
your approval rating is 34 percent.

460
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,194
Candidate No Hye-ji has 21 percent.

461
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,696
We're winning by a landslide.
Congratulations.

462
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,114
HEO SEONG-TAE
LET'S BUILD A HOPEFUL FUTURE

463
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:31,535
I think this is due to the push
for mandatory safety inspections.

464
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,454
It's all thanks to your hard work.

465
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,290
I'll make sure to repay you
for your hard work.

466
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,502
But only if I'm elected as mayor.

467
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,548
You should turn on the news.

468
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,347
I am here today to expose

469
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,434
candidate No Hye-ji's wrongdoing.

470
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,729
I was candidate No Hye-ji's…

471
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,816
slave.

472
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,360
That's so unexpected of her.

473
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,528
I had met Ms. No…

474
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:09,073
You can never tell with people.

475
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,367
You're here.

476
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,205
Please. There's no need for that.

477
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:19,792
I came by to cheer you on
since you've been working so hard.

478
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,129
Right.

479
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,924
What do you think about that?

480
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,512
She's been popular
with the younger demographic lately

481
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,097
since Ko Dam passed away.

482
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,642
It may be too early to say,
but it's beneficial for us.

483
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:40,563
For us to benefit from this incident,
we need to make her voters ours.

484
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,189
Is that so?

485
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:47,445
Then what should we do
to make that happen?

486
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:52,324
Ms. No was popular among
women in their twenties and thirties.

487
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:56,370
We should reinforce the policies we have
that benefit them and announce them.

488
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,831
Policies, you say?

489
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,210
When people bring up things like policies,

490
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,463
I find the conversation hard to follow.

491
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,672
Let's be honest.

492
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:11,302
Has anyone ever increased
their approval rating with policies?

493
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:16,140
Am I being silly right now?

494
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,437
How about we put forward a spokesperson
who is an independent woman,

495
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,690
and sponsor her to give
speeches in support of Mr. Heo.

496
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:28,027
-That would be great for the polls.
-You're right.

497
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,280
There's no need to sponsor someone.
We have one right here.

498
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,575
-I'm sorry?
-We have one in our campaign office.

499
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,827
A single mother

500
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,830
who has a sickly daughter

501
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,916
and is confident and cool.

502
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:47,296
Our new Campaign Adviser
seems perfect for the role.

503
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,091
Is that true, Ms. Na?

504
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,802
You should have told me sooner.

505
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,180
You've really saved me the hassle.

506
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,599
-Well, I…
-You can bring your daughter.

507
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,434
That would be perfect.

508
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:06,023
Ms. Na.
You don't have a boyfriend, do you?

509
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,192
She can't end up like Ms. No Hye-ji.

510
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:13,572
It would be great to have
you two sing the campaign song together.

511
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,324
-Right?
-I agree.

512
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,576
This could be your big break.

513
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,578
You know what to do, right?

514
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,497
Candidate number seven Heo Seong-tae

515
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,957
I should smile.

516
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:39,723
Young lady.

517
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,227
You'll get sauce all over your hoodie.
Do you want an apron?

518
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,187
No, thank you.

519
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,773
I was going to throw it away.

520
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:51,694
Kids these days don't know
how good they have it.

521
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,620
When something gets old,
it should be thrown out.

522
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,668
New heart, new beginning.

523
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,892
Do they look alike?

524
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,773
SANTA HAS REQUESTED VOICE CHAT
ACCEPT, REFUSE

525
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,447
The area is littered with cameras.

526
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,491
Yet he avoided all of them
as if he knew where they were.

527
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,205
I'm busy right now.

528
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,291
SANTA HAS REQUESTED VOICE CHAT
ACCEPT, REFUSE

529
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,169
SANTA HAS REQUESTED VOICE CHAT
ACCEPT, REFUSE

530
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:53,714
VOICE CHAT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED

531
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,598
When I said we won't be seeing each other,
I meant in the game too.

532
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,434
How could you be so laid-back…

533
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,855
when I could be coming for you any minute?

534
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:14,443
You can't do that.
You might want some answers from me.

535
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:15,569
I do too.

536
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:23,202
What would I want to ask you?

537
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,621
I just have one question.

538
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,999
Your aunt dying wasn't a part of our plan.

539
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,960
But you did plan to have her hostage.

540
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,381
I thought I could stop you that way.

541
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,301
SANTA: I'LL DROP BY FOR A SEC

542
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,636
I don't buy it.

543
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,098
I'd believe you
if we were talking face-to-face

544
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,183
but I can't because I don't see you.

545
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:47,893
I'll show you my face.

546
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:51,355
But you need to tell me what you know.

547
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,607
I'll tell you what I know in return.

548
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:58,404
Don't you find it suspicious
how your aunt died?

549
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,655
SANTA HAS LEFT THE CHAT

550
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,493
GYEONG-SU

551
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,386
Why are you here?

552
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,272
I thought you'd be starving yourself
playing games.

553
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,940
I'll just leave these here.

554
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:43,031
UNKNOWN SENDER
THE CHICKEN LOOKS DELICIOUS

555
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,297
You don't look like you're hurt
That's good.

556
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,965
Now go.

557
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,719
HIGHLIGHT HOTEL. 7 O'CLOCK.

558
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,202
Are you Ms. Koo Kyung-yi, by any chance?

559
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,287
Yes. What is it?

560
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,665
The person you were supposed to meet
is running a little late.

561
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,417
I'll show you to your table.

562
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,420
This is yours, right?

563
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,422
I was told to give it to you.

564
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,550
Okay.

565
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,138
This way, please.

566
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,250
You can eat them. You won't die.

567
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,878
Maybe this will make you more suspicious.

568
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,171
Where are you?

569
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,799
Somewhere I have
a clear view of your face.

570
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,303
It's my turn to ask.

571
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,306
Why was my aunt there that day?

572
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,767
Because she found out you were lying.

573
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,769
She was there to talk you out of it.

574
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,605
She thought she could meet you there.

575
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,358
Did she believe that I was a murderer?

576
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,820
She wanted to prove to us
that you're not a murderer.

577
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,321
Who was it

578
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,824
that brought her to Korea?

579
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,158
Me.

580
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,968
They're not poisoned.

581
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:12,389
If you keep starving yourself
because of your suspicions,

582
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,141
I won't have to kill you myself.

583
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,771
It's my turn now.

584
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,149
I want to ask you the same thing.

585
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,943
Why was your aunt there that day?

586
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,863
She wasn't spotted
at the main entrance of the building

587
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:30,407
but found in an empty lot
250m away from the conference hall.

588
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:36,204
Do you find it that hard not to drink?

589
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,582
What if I poisoned it?

590
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,710
Just answer the question, will you?

591
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,755
Ko Dam didn't trust anyone.

592
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:49,384
People like that always
have a secret escape route.

593
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,386
In their home, office,

594
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,723
and even the conference hall
which he built himself.

595
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,892
Of course he had an escape route.

596
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:01,146
So he had a secret escape route.

597
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:03,607
And you knew all along.

598
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,524
BEER PARTY
EVENT HALL

599
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,277
But only Ko Dam was supposed to be there.

600
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:10,906
And your aunt came out
on the other end of that escape route.

601
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:14,076
Then Ko Dam didn't fall for your trap.

602
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:16,411
I guess you don't know

603
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,622
who it was that killed Ko Dam.

604
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:24,336
I wondered why there were so many people
looking for me at the airport.

605
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,047
At first, I thought they were the police.

606
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:31,635
But I saw on the news they covered up
Ko Dam's death as an accident.

607
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:36,139
I should have realized that when you were
after me even though you're not a cop.

608
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,647
I knew someone was behind it.

609
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,400
I would have never suspected it
if they just stayed put.

610
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,778
You had to make a scene
to get that big break you wanted.

611
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:52,948
You must think we're running
some big operation just to catch you,

612
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,908
but you're not that important.

613
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:56,618
You're just delusional.

614
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,955
Not as much as you are.

615
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,749
I need some bread. They want more bread.

616
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,751
-We've run out.
-Go get some more bread.

617
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,341
Na Je-hui, was it?

618
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,677
She looked great on TV.

619
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,680
Why was she the only one
who benefited from this?

620
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,849
Everyone was offered something.

621
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,809
I just couldn't be bothered to accept it.

622
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,103
What about him?
Couldn't he be bothered either?

623
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:29,359
Do you really believe that we're
solely to blame for your aunt's death?

624
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,238
Move an inch

625
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,532
and I'll put a hole in your artery.

626
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:49,337
I can't hear her.

627
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,519
You should thank my aunt.

628
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,238
She's an acquaintance of mine. Go ahead.

629
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:19,493
She seems dangerous. Be careful.

630
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,704
Thank you. I'll call you back later.

631
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,214
I didn't expect to see you out and about.

632
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,800
Are you stalking me?

633
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,636
I'm not, but K is.

634
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,847
There was a reason
she called me here at this hour.

635
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,225
It was so that we'd meet.

636
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,627
You don't need this, do you?

637
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,470
I'm leaving if you've got nothing to say.

638
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,891
You must be busy.

639
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,272
How are you doing in Team A?

640
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,608
How's Won-sik treating you?
You two were close.

641
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,485
We're not.

642
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,113
I hate Mr. Jung.

643
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,701
She didn't kill Ko Dam.

644
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,955
It wasn't K who killed Ko Dam.

645
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,792
Three people were nowhere to be seen

646
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,627
when everyone was evacuating the hall.

647
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,754
Ko Dam, Jung Jeong-yeon…

648
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,049
and you, Ms. Na.

649
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,468
What are you trying to say?

650
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,138
Nothing. I wanted to hear you out.

651
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,433
It looks like you've
already made up your mind.

652
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,185
Do you really need me to tell you?

653
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,147
All I did was bring him to them.

654
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:15,609
I didn't know

655
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,777
they would really kill him.

656
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,614
Was it really you, Ms. Na?

657
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,660
Ko Dam was a horrible person.

658
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,581
Come on, be honest with me.

659
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:33,209
You all think people like him
don't deserve to live, don't you?

660
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,754
I think the world is a much better place

661
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:38,798
now that he's no longer here
doing the horrible things he does.

662
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:44,888
-Ms. Jung Jeong-yeon died.
-Do you think I wanted that?

663
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:49,434
If I knew Ms. Jung would die,
I wouldn't have done what I did.

664
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:54,064
I didn't know that K would know
about the escape route

665
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,857
and that she set up a trap there.

666
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,151
It was K who killed Ms. Jung.

667
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:08,411
I was always curious
to know what you liked.

668
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,209
They look great on you.

669
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:21,049
It wasn't because he was a bad man
that they killed him.

670
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,760
There must be another reason
why they killed Ko Dam.

671
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,222
You either don't know

672
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,433
or won't tell us even if you knew.

673
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,727
Why did you ask?

674
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,104
To see if it was true.

675
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,648
Your attitude just now gave it away.

676
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,446
It's because of Ms. Jung.

677
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:49,786
K told us that she didn't kill us
because of her aunt.

678
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,788
She said we should thank Ms. Jung.

679
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:57,419
I guess Ms. Jung
didn't think we deserved to die.

680
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,629
I don't know…

681
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,675
whether she's right or wrong anymore.

682
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:26,531
Na Na.

683
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:33,788
She just fell asleep.

684
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,166
Right.

685
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,709
I'll get going then.

686
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,753
-Good work today.
-Thank you.

687
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:47,844
-Bye.
-See you.

688
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:49,846
Thank you.

689
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,895
You don't have to be here when she's here.

690
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:59,898
I can't leave Na Na alone with a stranger.

691
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,484
Don't give me that. I've had a hard day.

692
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:14,204
Na Na drew this in kindergarten.

693
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,624
Her teacher called me
to tell me about this.

694
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:27,675
I did some thinking.

695
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:32,222
You should quit
what you're doing right now.

696
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:36,059
Then how will we make a living?

697
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,445
I'm getting very close.

698
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,494
Jeez, Dad.

699
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:59,082
What you need to do is be with Na Na.

700
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:04,003
You shouldn't be looking after
a former work colleague.

701
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:07,382
Neither should you be kissing up
to some important people.

702
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,342
Is that what you think I'm doing?

703
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:13,054
Don't you remember what you said
when you had Na Na?

704
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:17,475
You said you'll take good care of her
and told me not to ask any questions.

705
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:21,855
You asked me to trust you,
and that you'll be fine without a father.

706
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,148
And now what?

707
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:29,028
It's my fault too
that she turned out like this.

708
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,781
Do you mean she turned out incomplete
because she doesn't have a father?

709
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:34,826
-I never said that.
-That's what you're practically saying.

710
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:38,413
You mean she's incomplete
because she's raised by a single mother.

711
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,458
How could you say that
about your granddaughter?

712
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:46,254
What are you going to tell her
if she asks you later on?

713
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,927
I'll tell her that she's my daughter
and that's all that matters.

714
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,681
And that I was busy
because I was doing my best

715
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:59,017
to prove that I could
raise her alone just fine.

716
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,521
Be honest with me, Dad.

717
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,316
You say you're worried about Na Na,

718
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:09,152
but you're just using that
to criticize me.

719
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,446
Fine.

720
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,699
Good for you for being so smart.

721
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,002
You can't just leave like that.

722
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:30,381
You always need things to go your way.

723
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:32,133
Didn't I get it from you?

724
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:35,678
Whatever it is you're doing,
you didn't get it from me.

725
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:02,163
Go back to sleep.

726
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,831
Are you going to work?

727
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:09,128
Not now. It's time for sleep.

728
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,089
Don't go to work, Mom.

729
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:13,091
Play with Na Na.

730
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:21,224
Thank you. I love you.

731
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:40,034
Na Na.

732
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,288
Do you want to be on TV with Mom?

733
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,290
TV? What for?

734
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:49,252
We'll go on TV together

735
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:54,507
and show the whole world
what a smart and wonderful girl you are.

736
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,550
Okay.

737
00:59:57,218 --> 01:00:00,680
You should go back to sleep now.
You need sleep to be pretty.

738
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,225
You need to get
a good night's sleep to be on TV.

739
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,146
Stop it.

740
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:10,398
Let's go to sleep.

741
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:12,317
What's going on with your nostrils?

742
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:16,070
Your nostrils are moving.

743
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:29,167
You must really love your sons.

744
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:33,504
I'll do anything you want. Let's stop now.

745
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:36,966
You sure have taught me a lesson.

746
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,636
You've taught me a lot.

747
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,430
It would be great if I could believe you

748
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,265
but I'm quite skeptical.

749
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:46,476
I'm the only one who knows

750
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,728
and only I can access that information.

751
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:56,819
Who is it?

752
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,697
I live next door.

753
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,575
My mom and dad aren't home,

754
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,744
so I'm scared.

755
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,155
Anyone there?

756
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,789
Peek-a-boo.

757
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,866
Gosh, this is tiring.

758
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:26,993
My back…

759
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,419
My goodness.

760
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,969
Could I get a glass of cold water?

761
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:49,098
You sure are overdressed
for someone who's hiking.

762
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,558
Hold on.

763
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,314
Water…

764
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:00,693
Water…

765
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,576
I didn't expect you out of your house.
Are you here to make me laugh?

766
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:10,912
My life is full of laughs as it is.

767
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,748
My head.

768
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:20,338
But I do admit it's funny.
You're entertaining to watch.

769
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:23,674
Excuse me.
Can we get another bowl of barley rice?

770
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:29,138
-Why did you kill Ko Dam?
-I don't know what you mean.

771
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:33,017
My legs hurt,
so let's not beat around the bush.

772
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:36,062
It was K who killed him
because you couldn't stop her.

773
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,273
Why are you asking me?

774
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,860
He may have been your son's rival,

775
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,737
but people usually don't go that far.

776
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:47,782
You could have involved him
in some scandal

777
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:49,826
like you did to No Hye-ji.

778
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:53,663
I don't think I follow what you're saying.

779
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:57,875
There must be another reason
for you to have killed Ko Dam.

780
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,377
Why did you do it?

781
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,588
Exactly. What reason do I have

782
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:05,049
to kill some CEO of a company?

783
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,469
Gosh, you must have
a lot of time on your hands,

784
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,429
or maybe you have an active imagination.

785
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:16,686
Get your facts straight.

786
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:19,230
It was you who boasted
that you'd be able to catch her

787
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:22,441
and I gave you
my full support because of that.

788
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:26,279
But you've failed and put me at risk,

789
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:29,866
and now you've followed me here
and are accusing me of such nonsense.

790
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:31,534
Right.

791
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:35,204
You're one of those people, aren't you?

792
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:38,958
The kind who get hung up on their mistakes
and never grow past them.

793
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:42,712
Fine.

794
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,882
I shouldn't have come here.

795
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:48,968
I should have known
that asking you directly

796
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:53,139
wouldn't have gotten me any answers.

797
01:04:56,309 --> 01:05:00,855
That's why you should exercise regularly
and get some sunlight now and then.

798
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,441
Enjoy your meal.

799
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,278
You should have kept her hidden better.

800
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:08,779
Hide what?

801
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,032
You left Je-hui out in the open.

802
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:14,243
K will soon find out
who was behind all this.

803
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:22,543
You really do seem to be living
in a world of your own.

804
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,671
Too bad.

805
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:29,592
K is going to come and kill you.

806
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:31,969
You better watch your back.

807
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:41,520
Not that I think
this would be enough to scare you.

808
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:43,731
Who's killing who now?

809
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:52,031
Does this

810
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:54,367
look good on me?

811
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:44,667
What have you done with Je-hui?

812
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,253
-I don't know what you mean.
-You'll die too if she's dead.

813
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,255
Ms. Koo has disappeared too.

814
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:52,591
-I'm worried if something's happened.
-What happened to Ms. Koo?

815
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,510
Anyone there?

816
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:56,929
Is she in a better place?
I don't want you in a better place.

817
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,765
I could make you live in hell instead.

818
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,809
I won't be there when you regret this.

819
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:04,311
You were right. I'm sorry.

820
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:05,396
I was just going for a walk.

821
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:07,231
They've put in a lot of effort.

822
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:08,524
Don't you think it will work?

823
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:11,944
She has a rule that she only kills
those who deserve it.

824
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,655
I wasn't going to kill her,
but I don't think I can resist.

825
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:18,034
Tell me one good reason
why I should get out of here.

826
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,410
I've missed you.

827
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:21,704
This is creepy.

828
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:23,581
I knew you'd be back.

829
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:26,917
There's definitely something bigger
hidden behind it.

830
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:33,526
