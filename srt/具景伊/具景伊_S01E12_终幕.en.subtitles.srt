1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,501
You sure took your time.

2
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:50,717
You can't do this!

3
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,149
K is still young and is alone.

4
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,949
She's still young and alone.

5
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,543
FINALE

6
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:33,551
This is the only way
we can catch Director Yong and K at once.

7
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,763
What? Are you saying
we should let K kill Heo Hyeon-tae?

8
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,944
Ms. Koo, are you all right?

9
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,492
Ms. Koo isn't blinking.

10
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,536
Don't touch her.

11
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,039
She must be thinking up
some kind of a master plan.

12
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,553
I'm so annoyed. I'm so damn annoyed!

13
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,016
It was even before I knew
Heo Hyeon-tae was a prick,

14
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,518
so how is this a big picture?

15
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,146
Did you think I'd give you that video

16
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,148
without a backup plan?

17
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,946
Come on.

18
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,828
Darn it.

19
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,832
You want me to get in there?

20
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,959
"Ma'am," you brat.

21
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,711
Get in.

22
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,180
What the hell am I doing?

23
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,023
Was it you who hid him?

24
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:11,649
Why?

25
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,777
Didn't you want me to kill him
when you gave me the video?

26
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,031
It was a way for me to show Director Yong
what I was capable of.

27
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,491
I was one step ahead of you and saved him.

28
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,286
-And what good would that--
-Enough.

29
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,998
Watch your head. Seriously.

30
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,840
It wasn't me who released the video.

31
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,009
Then who did?

32
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:43,097
She must have thought he'd be safer
if more eyes were on him.

33
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,184
Who else would be crazy enough
to do such a thing?

34
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,774
That would be me.

35
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,402
But that wasn't why I did that.

36
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,613
I'm right.

37
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,991
You thought Heo Hyeon-tae
would be my next target

38
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,661
so you released the video
to open up other potential targets.

39
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,747
That way, you'd be able to
stop me from killing him.

40
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,582
That's…

41
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,709
only half right.

42
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:21,135
It was to make
Director Yong ask me for help.

43
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,602
So…

44
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,028
you're saying you've thought of all this

45
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:43,491
when you gave me the video
and hid him away?

46
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:52,125
Despite appearances, I've always
been smart ever since I was a child.

47
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,301
It was you
who attacked Ms. Yong, wasn't it?

48
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,971
He's not able
to return to Korea at the moment

49
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,640
due to business matters involving
national interests.

50
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,686
So please be understanding.

51
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,690
You murderers!

52
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,027
-Ms. Yong!
-Ms. Yong!

53
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,194
Oh, no! Ms. Yong!

54
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:37,045
They said it would take three days
to make me look like Director Yong.

55
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,301
Hyeon-tae wants to see me
before the press conference.

56
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,802
Just as I said, right?

57
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,347
Stay hidden so that no one notices.

58
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:06,699
I think I've fallen for you

59
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,535
I haven't told you

60
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,790
But you look handsome

61
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:19,295
I'm scared

62
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,923
Please…

63
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,141
I didn't plan anything
for the press conference

64
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,936
since the people who were there
would have taken care of it.

65
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,022
Your target has always been Director Yong.

66
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,150
It wasn't someone who you wanted to kill.

67
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,070
It was someone
who you wanted to see suffer the most.

68
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,824
I feel weird.

69
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,829
You predicted everything I'd do

70
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,998
and played me for a fool,
so I should be pissed off,

71
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,792
but instead, I feel like you get me.

72
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,215
How do you know me so well?

73
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,177
Drop the act.

74
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,388
MS. YONG

75
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,435
If you stay there,
you'll be covered in her organs.

76
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,814
Give me that.

77
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,817
You want to hear
how dumb you were all night long?

78
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,655
Guys. You might end up
pressing the button by mistake.

79
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,619
Just go and make sure
Ms. Koo didn't bring anyone.

80
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,746
I bet she brought all her minions.

81
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,418
We need to wrap things up
and get out of here.

82
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,295
That's what I wanted to ask her.

83
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,924
I'm done with this.

84
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:55,391
If you knew how I felt that well,
why didn't you help me?

85
00:07:56,434 --> 00:08:00,354
You saw how evil they are.

86
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,108
I'm asking you

87
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,778
with the hope that you'll give me
an honest and serious answer.

88
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,156
Be honest.

89
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,200
Okay?

90
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,535
Honestly speaking,

91
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,998
they deserve to die, right?

92
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,254
Not yet.

93
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,428
Everyone get out of there!

94
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,056
Get out. You'll die if you stay here.

95
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,349
Who the hell is he?

96
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,017
Why would I trust you?

97
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,101
But…

98
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,770
Maybe he sent the message!

99
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,940
Whatever. I'm getting out of here.

100
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,566
He's suspicious.

101
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,944
You'll die if you suspect me!

102
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,029
-Get out. Hurry.
-But…

103
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:53,407
-You're the one who got us here.
-Get out! Now. Hurry!

104
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,748
Not yet. Hold on.

105
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,251
Let me…

106
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,711
Let me press it.

107
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,942
Why the sudden change of heart?

108
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,112
I thought about what they did,

109
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:34,323
and I'm starting to wonder
why I should try to save them.

110
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,327
It's not like you didn't know.

111
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,913
Why did you let them off then?

112
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,042
There was no button I could press then.

113
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,588
A button that can get rid
of all these pieces of trash.

114
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,882
People are so strange.

115
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,052
People refuse to hurt those
who are in front of them

116
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,597
but they become so bold when
someone else offers to do it for them.

117
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,515
Ms. Yong too.

118
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,063
I've set it all up,
so all you have to do is press it.

119
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,898
It'll feel so cathartic afterward.

120
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,900
The world will seem…

121
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,447
cleaner, so to speak.

122
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,365
Was that how you felt

123
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,201
after killing Kim Min-gyu and Park Gyu-il?

124
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,288
Kim Min-gyu? Park Gyu-il?

125
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:31,255
Kim Seop-ryong, Han Man-gu,
Ho Song-mi, Kim Mi-jin,

126
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:36,469
Seo Hyeong-won, Song So-yeon,
Park Eun-ju, Lee Seong-ji,

127
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,346
Seol Won-ho, Park Du-mok.

128
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,973
That was how I felt
after killing all those people.

129
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,267
Now I'll get to experience it too.

130
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,947
Can you please

131
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,202
let me have some dignity? Please?

132
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,169
Hurry and press it.

133
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,838
If not…

134
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,012
you may die
before you experience how it feels.

135
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,267
Are you done?

136
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,020
REST AREA
CONVENIENCE STORE

137
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,650
Where's the video?

138
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,238
Aren't you Minister Kim?

139
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,413
Gyeong-su!

140
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,623
Is that everyone?

141
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,919
-Are you working with them?
-Let go of me.

142
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,004
All 20 of them are here.

143
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,593
We have all 20 of them. We're good.

144
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,803
Ms. Koo.

145
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,514
Are you messing with me?

146
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,266
I'll press it.

147
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,438
Wait. That man isn't out yet.

148
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,939
Who?

149
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,232
Heo Seong-tae.

150
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,151
He's still inside.

151
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,656
Aren't you going to press it?

152
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,325
20 PEOPLE

153
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,338
20 PEOPLE

154
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,800
Wait.

155
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,886
Did you really press it?

156
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,399
-It's a bomb!
-Run!

157
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,734
Gyeong-su!

158
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,987
Gyeong-su!

159
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,031
Awesome.

160
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,241
Look at this.

161
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,705
How does it feel?

162
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,251
Overwhelmed.

163
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,504
Gyeong-su!

164
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,839
Help.

165
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,051
-Gyeong-su!
-Help.

166
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,887
-Gyeong-su!
-Help.

167
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,598
Help.

168
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,849
Gyeong-su!

169
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,399
Help.

170
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,152
The fridge is so cold.

171
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,909
You said fridges were the safest.

172
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,833
You punk. Come out.

173
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,426
Stop that.

174
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,554
Come on out.

175
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,558
That's heavy. Hurry.

176
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,190
Come on out.

177
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,151
Now!

178
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,450
You know what?

179
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,289
This is the first time
someone's killed for me.

180
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,668
So this is how it feels.

181
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,675
I'm so touched.

182
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,639
I wonder if everyone I helped
felt this way.

183
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,035
We're on the same side now, right?

184
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,624
Sure, let's go together.

185
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,695
What are you doing?
Do you like me that much?

186
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,074
You smell nice.

187
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,786
Let's go all the way
to the police station together.

188
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,120
What?

189
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:06,215
I outgrew the fantasy of killing
the bad guys myself years ago, you brat.

190
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,844
Plus, you're alone.

191
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,890
And I'm not.

192
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,062
CURRENT LOCATION
EMERGENCY RESCUE REQUEST

193
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,472
I guess that means they didn't die.

194
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,808
Not a single one?

195
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:01,520
Gyeong-su may be dense,
but he can't kill people.

196
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,856
Did you really believe he was helping you?

197
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,654
Is it okay to hand this over?

198
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,198
What if K kills them?

199
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,452
You have to stop her.

200
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,829
You know how it's done.

201
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,957
You know that, right?

202
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,631
Look more upset.

203
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,842
You're doing great.

204
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,020
Since you trust me so much…

205
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,774
I had to live up to your trust.

206
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,360
Right?

207
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,366
You got me good several times today.

208
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,953
But there's one thing I don't get.

209
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,165
Even if you knew I was targeting them,

210
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,335
you couldn't have known the details.

211
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,590
Because, other than Geon-uk and I,
no one knew--

212
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:15,636
Your accomplices who you thought
would never betray you…

213
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,937
She contacted me

214
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,773
asking for help.

215
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,784
Please stop her…

216
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,538
from killing any more people.

217
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,084
It's absolutely miserable
living with the desire…

218
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,963
to kill someone.

219
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,219
I hope the girl who helped me

220
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,639
will live a better life.

221
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:06,562
She seemed truly worried about you.

222
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,356
I didn't expect that.

223
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,650
She's still pathetic…

224
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,404
and stupid.

225
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,248
The first shot is a blank.

226
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,292
Aren't you done yet?

227
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:35,048
That means they're live rounds now, right?

228
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,593
Santa.

229
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,637
Ms. Koo.
I don't think I'm alone after all.

230
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,306
Let go, will you?

231
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,810
Why are you so strong?

232
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,652
What now?

233
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,322
You shouldn't touch other people's things!

234
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,491
You're all gathered here

235
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,786
to make our jobs easier.

236
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:12,794
Mr. Kim.

237
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,173
How will you clean up afterward
if you do that here?

238
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,885
You'll catch hell
from Director Yong again.

239
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,136
Seriously.

240
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,224
Catch hell from who?

241
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:27,976
From me?

242
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,066
Not unless he messes up.

243
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,903
If he does a good job

244
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,197
and burns everything…

245
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,326
why would I scold him?

246
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,953
The cops aren't coming.

247
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,830
My God!

248
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,795
Hey!

249
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,049
You…

250
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,469
This feels different
from shooting wild boars.

251
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,681
Be careful with that!
Mr. Chun gave that to me!

252
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,481
Damn, that hurts.

253
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,569
Give it.

254
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,280
First…

255
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,865
I'll shoot the easy ones.

256
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,265
Now I've seen everything.

257
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,017
Whatever it takes to survive.

258
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:56,940
Geon-uk!

259
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,826
Try anything funny, and Ms. Koo gets hurt.

260
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:13,081
I thought you didn't care to live anymore.

261
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,132
MS. YONG, HEO HYEON-TAE

262
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,385
Where are you?

263
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,100
I see you.

264
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,395
Do you think this is a show?

265
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,610
I see you.

266
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,723
Where am I?

267
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,188
Don't let anyone in.

268
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,355
Over there too.

269
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,694
They say they were filming inside
and there was a prop malfunction.

270
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:48,820
That hurts.

271
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,532
Hey! Let's get to the hospital!
I'm in pain!

272
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:57,412
Excuse me. Wasn't there
a woman with pale skin and long hair?

273
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,206
There was no woman.

274
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,041
I'll go check inside.

275
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,295
Damn it.

276
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,552
CULTURE STATION SEOUL 284

277
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,772
Where's Kyung-yi?

278
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,198
Do you think I give a damn?

279
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,158
What about K?

280
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,661
She's not there?

281
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,582
Maybe they died together.

282
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:49,881
I just saved both of your sons.

283
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,801
Do you know why I saved them?

284
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,012
Because you want something

285
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,058
and I can give that to you.

286
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,065
I know a doctor in Bukchang.

287
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,900
Go there and--

288
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:17,075
Because I don't want you
to have an easy life.

289
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,372
Over here! Help!

290
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,374
What are you doing?

291
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,836
Pureun Children's Foundation's
Director Yong Suk is here!

292
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,672
Oh, no! She's hurt badly!

293
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:35,093
Mayoral candidate Heo Seong-tae
and Rabbit Heo Hyeon-tae!

294
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,219
Stop it!

295
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,724
Their mother is here! Help!

296
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,777
Let's go.

297
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,409
Look at her face.

298
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,244
-She's hurt.
-My goodness.

299
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,787
-My gosh.
-Take a picture.

300
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,135
Where on earth is she?

301
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,702
Help.

302
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,125
I'm scared.

303
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,212
I'm scared.

304
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,152
Geon-uk.

305
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,280
Geon-uk!

306
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,157
Geon-uk.

307
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,159
Dae-ho.

308
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,204
Wake up. You can't fall asleep here.

309
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,374
Help!

310
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,753
Help me.

311
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,267
It's your turn.

312
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,228
If you don't help me,

313
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,567
K may do something to Santa.

314
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,122
Would a gunshot kill you instantly?

315
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,420
Probably not instantly,

316
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,255
right?

317
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:05,637
Why does Ms. Koo like you so much?
She doesn't know who you really are.

318
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,891
Is it because you don't talk?

319
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,062
I'm so annoyed.

320
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,317
How long do I have to be with you?

321
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,071
You're showing your true colors.

322
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,242
Until I'm completely safe.

323
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,800
Get in.

324
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,647
Get in.

325
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,071
It's not like I want to drag you around.

326
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,742
Close it.

327
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,004
You won't have to come with me
if I kill you now.

328
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,171
Should I kill you?

329
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,761
You're not going anywhere.

330
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,896
You said we'd be together.

331
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,525
Seriously. You're a bona fide stalker.

332
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,193
How did you follow us here?

333
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,741
Gosh.

334
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,622
I was going to go home and play games,

335
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,582
but Geon-uk told me.

336
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,961
That damn coward.

337
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:20,939
Take it easy.

338
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,192
Will cops be waiting at the next station

339
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,902
to take me away?

340
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:29,489
That's right. It's a very predictable plan

341
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:32,367
no one can escape.

342
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:36,120
So don't waste your energy trying to run,

343
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,664
and let Santa go.

344
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,835
I'm too hungry to run anyway.

345
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,139
You forgot to let him go.

346
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,602
It would have been easier
if I had this from the get-go.

347
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:04,691
There's only one bullet left.
It seems like such a waste

348
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,193
not to use it.

349
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,989
If you want
to fire the last bullet that badly,

350
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,490
shoot it into the sky.

351
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,743
-That's no fun.
-Do you have to shoot a person?

352
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,205
Of course. That's what bullets are for.

353
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,295
Then shoot me.

354
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,507
Cut the act.

355
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,348
But why do you have to do that?

356
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,684
Are you asking why I kill people?

357
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:41,811
Ms. Koo.

358
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,856
I thought I made myself clear.

359
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:49,318
Who'd get rid of those bastards
if I don't kill them?

360
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:51,904
But you're smart.

361
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,364
That goes without saying.

362
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,744
It would have been nice
if you had used that brain

363
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,663
to save good people
rather than to kill bad ones.

364
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,875
Then you wouldn't be here all alone.

365
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,544
You're smart too,
albeit not as smart as I am.

366
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,296
And what did you do with it?

367
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,966
You did that to your husband.

368
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,262
That really hurt.

369
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,222
What is a good person?

370
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,559
Him?

371
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,729
Do you think he's a good person?

372
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,985
Do you?

373
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,613
You really don't know.

374
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,075
You don't know, do you?

375
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,788
Haven't you ever wondered
why he was especially nice to you?

376
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:45,083
He's stuck to you like glue
ever since he met you.

377
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,585
He's fed you, clothed you,
and cleaned for you.

378
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,047
Why would he
when you're not even paying him?

379
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,423
Think about it.

380
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:59,222
I thought long and hard about that.

381
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,646
That's just how Santa is.

382
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,571
You know that everyone in this world
has an agenda.

383
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,157
And his was…

384
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,036
to lessen his guilt.

385
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,915
Because it was his fault

386
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,876
that Mr. Jang Seong-u died.

387
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,088
What?

388
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:35,216
If he had spoken up back then…

389
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,137
Mr. Jang wouldn't have died.

390
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,681
What do you mean?

391
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,058
Han-gyeol from
Bongbaek Girls' High School.

392
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,102
The girl who drowned.

393
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,105
Someone was with her supposedly.

394
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,066
A rumor spread that it was Mr. Jang.

395
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,777
But do you really think it was Mr. Jang?

396
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,703
Our innocent and kind Santa.

397
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,040
Han Gwang-uk of Bongbaek High School.

398
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,878
You were Han-gyeol's secret boyfriend.

399
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,135
Give it a rest.

400
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:25,057
Do you think I'll fall for your lies?

401
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,020
You seem to be doubting him already.

402
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,359
Didn't you notice anything odd?

403
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,117
MEMORIES AND RECOLLECTIONS

404
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:51,292
There's only stuff about us here.

405
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,964
If he had just said
that he was with Han-gyeol that day,

406
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,550
Mr. Jang wouldn't have died.

407
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,386
And you'd still be happy being a cop.

408
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:07,225
But what could he do?
He died and you became a recluse.

409
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:13,147
That's why he's been good to you
ever since he got close to you.

410
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,532
Wait!

411
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,515
Santa, what are you doing?

412
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:56,107
It's nice and crunchy.

413
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,610
Hurry, Santa.

414
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,948
He's been trying to pay the price
for what he did.

415
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,908
So that he could feel better.

416
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,743
Ms. Koo.

417
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:11,163
Think about how difficult
the past five years have been.

418
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,166
You blamed yourself
for your husband's death.

419
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,711
You probably wondered

420
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,423
what would have happened
if you had acted differently

421
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,134
over and over again.

422
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,311
"What would he have said to me

423
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,689
if he were alive and by my side?"

424
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,404
Things like that.

425
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,785
It's not true, right?

426
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,081
Stop blaming yourself.

427
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,959
It wasn't your fault.

428
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:58,919
It was all…

429
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,299
Han Gwang-uk's fault.

430
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:06,719
No!

431
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,096
Say it isn't true.

432
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,932
Say you didn't kill Seong-u!

433
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,435
I didn't.

434
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,857
I didn't do it.

435
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,321
You won't believe him anyway.

436
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:31,369
I just want to
hear your side of the story.

437
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,039
You can be honest with me, can't you?

438
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:46,050
Do you still want me to use this bullet
on you instead of him?

439
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:53,015
Just say the word and I'll kill him.

440
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,519
I'll kill him for you
since you won't be able to.

441
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,314
No. You can't do that either, can you?

442
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,483
Because you have to keep
pretending to be nice.

443
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,236
Just stay still.

444
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,447
If you stay still until I count to three,

445
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,449
I'll shoot him.

446
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,746
Who will it be?

447
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,834
You or Santa?

448
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,048
One.

449
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,218
Two.

450
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,389
Three!

451
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:53,988
Hey.

452
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:56,782
Hey.

453
00:42:58,951 --> 00:42:59,952
Roy.

454
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,580
Which way should I go?

455
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,382
Why would I ask a cat?

456
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,501
Damn it!

457
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,221
Get them all.

458
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,436
This isn't right.

459
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,484
Get them.

460
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,110
Get them all.

461
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:19,406
Kill them all.

462
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,868
Hurry. Get them.

463
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,331
Get them all.

464
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,210
Get them all.

465
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:34,546
Get them. Get them all.

466
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,731
Back in my day,

467
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,609
this would all fall right away.

468
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:59,947
I had no time to sleep all year round.

469
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,035
-There she is. Isn't that her?
-Ms. Koo.

470
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,537
-Ms. Koo!
-Kyung-yi!

471
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,704
Kyung-yi!

472
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,127
There she is. Kyung-yi!

473
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,628
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

474
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:15,712
Are you okay?

475
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,423
-Are you?
-Why did you come?

476
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,924
-Your face.
-Are your legs okay?

477
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:20,926
Let me check your pulse.

478
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,136
-How's your leg?
-But…

479
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,929
-Lift it.
-Let me check your pulse.

480
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:27,433
-Hey, get the door.
-Stay still.

481
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,019
-I know how to read pulses
-Are you okay?

482
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,773
Wait a minute. Please slow down.

483
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,150
We can talk at the station.

484
00:45:56,462 --> 00:46:03,051
BUNCHEON SANTA VILLAGE

485
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,031
All right.

486
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,454
The doctor said no.

487
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:58,458
He told you 300 times not to drink,

488
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:02,629
and the nurses said not to let you drink
at least 30,000 times.

489
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,881
Damn it.

490
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,926
This is fishy.

491
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:09,886
Do you trust them?

492
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,722
Yes, I do.

493
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:17,019
I don't need to use my brain anymore,
so let me drink.

494
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,397
Come on. Tell him.

495
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,858
Let's relax a little.

496
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:38,081
I was so worried,
but I'm relieved to see you like that.

497
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,335
Don't go anywhere until I get back.

498
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:44,671
Don't do anything stupid.
Stay here as you've done.

499
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,182
Why won't they leave me alone?

500
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,149
Stand tall.

501
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:07,235
There's no need to lower your head.

502
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:13,450
I'm not sure
if the video is admissible evidence,

503
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:17,120
but it must be if I testify in court.

504
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:21,667
You realize you're confessing
to committing a crime too, don't you?

505
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,337
Everyone should be punished
if they do something bad.

506
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:29,883
It's only right for me to pay
for what I've done, but…

507
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:35,931
I know there's no such thing
as a plea bargain in Korea,

508
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,308
but I have a lot more.

509
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,644
Aren't you curious?

510
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,230
Why don't we…

511
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,608
speak in private?

512
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:01,248
Hey.

513
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,626
Where was that place
with the good steamed monkfish again?

514
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,753
-What? Steamed monkfish?
-Yes.

515
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:11,466
Steamed monkfish.
The place in Hyochang-dong is amazing.

516
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,094
They're not as good now.

517
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,055
What?

518
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:21,435
Their dish doesn't taste as good anymore
since the chef left.

519
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:25,188
People who know nothing
about good food seem to like it, though.

520
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:29,401
Hey. Your mouth was sealed
during the questioning.

521
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,362
Gongdeok. There's a good restaurant
in Gongdeok.

522
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,949
The best place is in Iksan.

523
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:40,078
The fish needs to be fresh.

524
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,958
Let's go to Hyochang
for some steamed monkfish.

525
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,879
Now I want some.

526
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,842
I wonder when I can have some again.

527
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:57,929
PUREUN CHILDREN'S FOUNDATION

528
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,848
How much did you embezzle?

529
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,516
Do you admit all the charges?

530
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,102
What do you think
about your sons' charges?

531
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,104
Do you admit to
conspiring to commit murder?

532
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:27,000
Pureun Children's Foundation's director,

533
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:29,961
the mother of
former assemblyman Heo Seong-tae,

534
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,797
Director Yong Suk, was arrested.

535
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,966
She's being investigated for 17 crimes
including conspiracy to commit murder,

536
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,761
attempted murder,
and improper solicitation.

537
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:42,224
Heo Hyun-tae, who was injured
by fans who rioted at his press conference

538
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,726
intended to explain
the accessory to murder charge,

539
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,561
is also being investigated

540
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:49,356
for accessory to murder, fraud,
and several other crimes.

541
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,399
Former assemblyman Heo Seong-tae

542
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,819
apologized for the distress
his family caused

543
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,987
and withdrew from the mayoral race.

544
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,865
He announced
that he would be retiring from politics.

545
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,075
CANDIDATE HEO RESIGNS

546
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,831
-He didn't wake up yet, did he?
-No.

547
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,128
He's still here?

548
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,714
Yes. He says he'll wait until he wakes up.

549
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,974
What are they doing?

550
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,351
What? Let's see.

551
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:31,106
Look. Is the shark trying to
eat the little fish?

552
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,108
Grandpa.

553
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,070
No. He won't eat him.

554
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:38,238
Let's see.

555
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,950
That big fish is the mommy fish.

556
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,828
She's taking a stroll
with her two baby fish.

557
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,997
Where are they going?

558
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,792
To get something yummy to eat for dinner.

559
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,504
What are we going to eat?

560
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,757
What do you feel like?

561
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,385
It's been a while
since the family got together,

562
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:03,221
so I thought we'd go get something nice.

563
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:09,144
That sushi place
that we went to last time was pretty good.

564
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,981
How could you mention sushi
at an aquarium?

565
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,400
You liked it the most.

566
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:22,282
Where are you guys from?

567
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,701
From the sea.

568
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,663
Please answer Na Na. She wants to know.

569
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,749
Where are you from?

570
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:34,669
Get them.

571
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,131
Get at least one.

572
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:13,291
KOO GYEONG-SU DETECTIVE AGENCY

573
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:16,252
There.

574
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:25,053
OH GYEONG-SU

575
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,597
That looks nice, doesn't it, Ms. Koo?

576
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,934
I mean, Detective Koo?

577
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,186
Die. Just die.

578
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,604
Why won't you die?

579
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,528
Nothing gets cleaned here without me.

580
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:49,869
So, I checked every graduate
of Bongbaek High School

581
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:53,748
as well as people who transferred
before graduating,

582
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,585
and there was no Han Gwang-uk.

583
00:54:58,461 --> 00:54:59,504
Awesome.

584
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:02,173
That was truly awesome.

585
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,633
You find it suspicious, right?

586
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,887
K may have confused the name.

587
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,305
Or it could be

588
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,350
that he may have changed his name
like you said.

589
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:16,855
So I checked every yearbook,
student record,

590
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:19,357
photos from class trips, field days,

591
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:22,110
and every school function.

592
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,031
But I found no one who looks like Santa.

593
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,576
You know I have a good eye.

594
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:37,125
It's not like I found out
who Santa really is, though.

595
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,630
We may not know what Santa was like,

596
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,717
but we know what he's like now.

597
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,219
I trust what I see and feel.

598
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,057
Santa is a good person.

599
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,392
Yes!

600
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,022
We won!

601
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,449
When did you get here?

602
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,076
Three days ago.

603
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,419
Are we really doing that?

604
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,922
Everything's ready.

605
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,512
It's ready?

606
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:37,560
You can never do anything in one go.

607
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:41,272
Do I always have to get up
and help you like this?

608
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,371
Do you need something?

609
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:58,873
Gosh.

610
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,309
NA JE-HUI, OH GYEONG-SU, MS. KOO

611
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,733
Goodness.

612
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:30,738
Is the computer broken?

613
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,537
You weren't logging in, so…

614
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:39,873
My legs hurt. Scoot over.

615
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,042
Oh, my legs.

616
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:51,259
I don't care at all
what kind of person you were in the past.

617
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,637
What matters is,

618
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:58,516
we need you in order to win in the game.

619
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:00,894
Ms. Koo.

620
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:05,940
Gyeong-su made something.

621
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,025
Where is it?

622
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:11,571
Let's see. That's not it.

623
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,783
Where did I put it?

624
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,536
Here.

625
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,413
KOO GYEONG-SU DETECTIVE AGENCY
SANTA, TEAM LEADER

626
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:28,796
Let's go.

627
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,429
Yes.

628
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,723
Do what you think is best.

629
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:43,770
Still, you need to tell us what you want
for us to prepare accordingly.

630
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,356
What do I want?

631
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:51,611
What time is it?

632
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,865
You have plenty of time.

633
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,825
You can extend lawyer's visits--

634
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:58,993
I'm done here.

635
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,371
It's time.

I have to get out!

640
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:12,817
That jerk really deserves to die!

641
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:16,529
He's an evil bastard!

642
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,197
I have to get out!

643
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:20,158
I have to kill him!

644
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:23,661
-Wait. What's this?
-He's evil!

645
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,413
-Wait.
-I need to get out!

646
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:27,874
-I have to kill him!
-Kill?

647
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,292
I have to kill him!

648
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,753
-Damn it.
-I'll kill him!

649
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,463
Damn it.

650
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,507
-I can't see.
-I have to kill him!

651
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,468
I have to kill him.

652
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:43,389
I have to kill him.

653
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,599
Damn it.

CONGRATULATIONS
KOO GYEONG-SU DETECTIVE AGENCY

655
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:18,925
She hasn't changed it yet.

656
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,850
It's Ms. Na. Hello.

657
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,185
What's with that reaction?

658
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:33,022
-Well, then…
-No. Give it to me.

659
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,569
You've changed, Je-hui.

660
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,446
I came to congratulate you.

661
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,658
How come we haven't had any clients?

662
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:46,202
I suspected as much.
Which is why I brought one.

663
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:48,996
-She should be here soon.
-Really?

664
01:01:56,879 --> 01:02:01,175
Is this Koo Gyeong-su Detective Agency?
