=Dangerous Love=

2
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,430
Third Young Master.

3
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,430
Where's Menghuan?

4
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,960
She wanted a bath

5
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,030
and asked for water.

6
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,350
Third Young Master,

7
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,310
no need to rush.

8
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,960
Xu Beisheng?

9
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,360
Are you insane?

10
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,910
I'm your brother's wife,

11
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,390
the Third Young Mistress.

12
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,320
Let go.

13
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,960
Weren't you the one

14
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,030
who came to me first?

15
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,000
Now you act all virtuous.

16
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,460
Come with me.

17
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,310
In your dreams.

18
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,030
(Shameless pair.)

19
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,190
(You two really had affairs.)

20
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,030
(When I finish my masterpiece,)

21
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,670
(I'll send you two)

22
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,880
(to your deaths.)

23
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,180
=Episode 1=

24
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,520
Cigarettes for sale.

25
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,550
(Three months earlier)

26
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,360
(Paris Night)
Cigarettes of all brands.

27
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,000
Wait.

28
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,630
Cigarettes for sale.

29
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,740
(Xu Beisheng, eldest son
of the Governor in Ning City)

30
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,580
(Xu Tianci, third son
of the Governor in Ning City)

31
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,750
You dare touch my woman?

32
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,080
Break his leg!

33
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,030
Got it.

34
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,400
Xu Beisheng,

35
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,440
kill Jiang Xu for me.

36
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,480
Send him back.

37
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,000
Jiang Lin,

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,990
(Xu Qingshan, Governor of Ning City)
how dare you!

39
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,040
Governor,

40
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll send a few men

41
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,610
to teach Jiang Xu a lesson.

42
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,550
The Jiang family

43
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,600
have the powerful backing them.

44
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,620
Can't mess with them just yet.

45
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,110
But if we do nothing,

46
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,880
they'll get even more arrogant.

47
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,600
Well, well,

48
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,670
that won't last long.

49
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,210
After Tianci and Miss Zhou's marriage,

50
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,240
we'll open Luban Box and claim the treasure.

51
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,920
Then we'll deal with the Jiangs.

52
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,850
Tianci's leg is injured.

53
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,200
So you'll have to go to Capital

54
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,220
to pick up Miss Zhou.

55
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,870
I want to let all the big shots in Ning City

56
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,230
know the arranged marriage

57
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,790
between Xu and Zhou families.

58
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,790
The train station.

59
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,660
Yes.

60
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,480
(Looks like this Miss Zhou)

61
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,280
(is the key to opening the Box.)

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,840
Dad.

63
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,910
Dad.

64
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,670
Dad!

65
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,280
I'm not going.

66
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,240
Do you know

67
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,920
(Zhou Menghuan, Capital)
forced marriage

68
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,760
is against the law?

69
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,950
You're out of line!

70
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,180
Marriage is a big deal

71
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
for parents to decide.

72
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,830
Calm down, my lady.

73
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,280
Enough.

74
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,860
(Master Zhou from Zhou family in Capital)

75
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,720
Menghuan,

76
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,760
someday,

77
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,670
you'll understand I meant well.

78
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,550
I don't see it that way.

79
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,790
If my mother were alive,

80
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,160
she'd never treat me like this.

81
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,550
Alright, my lady.

82
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,740
Cheer up,

83
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,600
okay?

84
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,600
(Clearly a brute.)

85
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,350
(Xing City Station)
Miss Zhou Menghuan?

86
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,910
Who are you?

87
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,950
Looking for...

88
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,350
Why are you looking for her?

89
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,800
My lady,

90
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,760
he wants to see you.

91
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,860
(Xiaotao, maid of the Zhou family)

92
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,720
And you are?

93
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,950
From the Xu family?

94
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,990
That's right.

95
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,950
I'm Xu Beisheng.

96
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,390
My brother, Xu Tianci,

97
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,230
is feeling unwell.

98
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,070
I'll escort Miss Zhou to Ning City.

99
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,630
Get on, please.

100
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,000
Let's go.

101
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,350
My lady.

102
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,550
Why stare at me?

103
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,110
Do you expect Miss Zhou

104
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,070
to carry her luggage?

105
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,070
Go help our young lady with her bags.

106
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,040
Commander.

107
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,910
Wait here for me.

108
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,950
I'll be right back.

109
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,180
(Yuan Rong, Xu Beisheng's adjutant)
Jiang Xu

110
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,040
blocked the exits

111
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
for snatching Miss Zhou.

112
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,830
Get someone to pose as her

113
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,950
at the front gate.

114
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,720
I'll take them out the back.

115
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,950
Yes.

116
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,390
Oh no, Miss Zhou's gone.

117
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,280
Everyone, stay focus.

118
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,000
Don't let her get away.

119
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,070
Move, move, move.

120
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,670
She looks familiar.

121
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,670
Let go.

122
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,750
Who are you?

123
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,180
(Jiang Xu, son of Chamber Chairman)

124
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,200
Well, that was easier than I thought.

125
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,550
My dad says if we get you,

126
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,110
we can get the Zhou family treasure.

127
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,350
Getting you is no big deal.

128
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,230
Help! Someone!

129
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,920
What are you doing?

130
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,600
- Let go.
- Stop!

131
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,400
Oh, it's you.

132
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,470
Even you dare meddle in my business?

133
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,720
Miss Zhou.

134
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,870
I don't feel well.

135
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,990
Miss Zhou.

136
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,910
Wail till it wears off.

137
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,720
I feel unwell.

138
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,310
Miss Zhou.

139
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,160
Try to stay calm.

140
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,470
(What does have to do)

141
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,520
(with the Luban Box?)

142
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,320
Where is this place?

143
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,950
I feel unwell.

144
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,400
This is so embarrassing.

145
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,430
Miss, you're awake.

146
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,350
Feeling any better now?

147
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,720
Much better.

148
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,760
You know I'm Zhou Menghuan?

149
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:14,950
Hungry, aren't you?

150
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,310
Have some noodles.

151
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,590
You're pretty...

152
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,920
good at cooking.

153
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,320
Let me be straight with you.

154
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,110
There's no way I'm going with you.

155
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,950
And there's no way

156
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,890
I'd marry your brother.

157
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,030
You'd better send me...

158
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,200
(I'll never let you marry my brother.)

159
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,590
I'm not going back to Capital with you.

160
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,700
No, no.

161
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,550
Get me back to Capital now.

162
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,870
Don't move.

163
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,720
It's nothing serious.

164
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,840
Go get things ready.

165
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,470
Governor's waiting.

166
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,710
You saved me, but I still won't go.

167
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,550
I'm not going.

168
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,110
That's not your choice.

169
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,820
(Paris Night)

170
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,280
Where's the money coming from lately, Mr. Xu?

171
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,630
Dad.

172
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,160
Madam.

173
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,190
Miaoyin,

174
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,840
well done.

175
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,580
(Xu Miaoyin, second daughter of Governor)
Thanks to Madam.

176
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,020
(Li Manzhen, wife of Governor)

177
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,200
I... my stomach hurts so bad.

178
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,200
Was that bowl of noodles from you not clean?

179
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,440
I need the restroom.

180
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,510
Miss Zhou.

181
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,420
You're trying to run away.

182
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,870
And using this excuse

183
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,760
is way too clumsy.

184
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,470
Who's running away?

185
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,010
You're the clumsy one.

186
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,920
Governor,

187
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,990
you really went all out

188
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,000
- this time.
- This way.

189
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,600
But...

190
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,780
You've made it this grand.

191
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,550
(Jiang Lin, Chairman of Chamber of Commerce)

192
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,290
