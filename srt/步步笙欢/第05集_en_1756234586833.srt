=Episode 5=

3
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,680
Such a shameless woman!

4
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,400
Flirting before you're even married.

5
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,330
Zhou Menghuan.

6
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,220
How dare you go after my brother?

7
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,680
Do you have no shame at all?

8
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,950
You dare to steal my woman.

9
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,120
Go to hell!

10
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,310
How dare you fight back?

11
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,160
Let go.

12
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,550
I said let go.

13
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,310
Tianci! Xu Beisheng,

14
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,270
you troublemaker.

15
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,230
Are you rebelling now?

16
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,000
Someone! Take away

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,080
these two shameless cheats.

18
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,310
Throw them into backyard well.

19
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,920
Stop!

20
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,590
Dad, look at her.

21
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,000
Master.

22
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,800
Xu Beisheng is an absolute disgrace.

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,160
He dared to target
his own sister-in-law.

24
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,510
You have to stand up for Tianci.

25
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,280
What's going on?

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,590
What do you mean?

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,870
They're a shameless pair!

28
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,910
In public,

29
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,870
you behave indecently!

30
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,110
Really no sense of shame!

31
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,080
Shut your mouth!

32
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,280
You speak.

33
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,310
Governor,

34
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,520
when I arrived,

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,520
I saw this man

36
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,750
tried to harass Miss Zhou.

37
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,630
Miss Zhou used a brick

38
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,720
to hurt him.

39
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,160
But unfortunately,

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,880
Miss Zhou was choked unconscious.

41
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,190
I just wanted to get her a doctor.

42
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,600
And that led you under a coat?

43
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,800
What are you doing?

44
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,400
Take a guess.

45
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,550
It's just a misunderstanding.

46
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,800
Miss Zhou was probably overly startled.

47
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,670
She mistook me for her maid.

48
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,390
Who would believe that?

49
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,310
Governor,

50
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,520
I never lie.

51
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,550
Nothing happened between me and her.

52
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,280
Mr. Xu.

53
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,880
Actuallyâ€¦

54
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,520
When I came to the Xu familyâ€¦

55
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,910
The one I wanted to marry
wasn't Xu Tianci.

56
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,830
It was Xu Beisheng.

57
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,630
Who I marry doesn't matter.

58
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,880
It won't affect two families' tie.

59
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,000
Wouldn't you agree?

60
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,870
Dad,

61
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,520
Zhou Menghuan is my fiancee.

62
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,800
If she marries, it'll be to me.

63
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,720
Yes, father.

64
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,670
Zhou Menghuan, stop chasing illusions.

65
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,240
My big brother would never marry you.

66
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,030
Miss Zhou isn't in her right mind now.

67
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,750
Don't take her words seriously.

68
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,270
I think you may have misunderstood.

69
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,470
I've always seen you as my sister-in-law.

70
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,240
Never had any other feelings.

71
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,030
Impossible.

72
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,360
Governor.

73
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,800
I've got business.

74
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,080
I'll take my leave.

75
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,470
Xu Beisheng.

76
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,230
Xu Beisheng.

77
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,910
Xu Beisheng, wait.

78
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,270
About what just happened,

79
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,670
sorry, I shouldn't have decided for you.

80
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,520
But I thought
you felt the same about me.

81
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,390
Guess I was overthinking it.

82
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,880
Glad you understand, Miss Zhou.

83
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,480
But in all of Ning City,

84
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,230
you're the only one I can trust.

85
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,200
With what Zhou Menghuan did,

86
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,790
Xu Qingshan will probably

87
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,200
be even more suspicious of me.

88
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,720
I need a more thorough plan.

89
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,190
Master,

90
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,950
you're not seriously letting

91
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,920
that outsider marry Miss Zhou, right?

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,950
Why panic?

93
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,320
Marriage is a big deal,

94
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,270
not something a young girl can mess up.

95
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,000
Relax.

96
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,600
Tianci is the rightful heir

97
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,760
of the Xu family.

98
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,510
Exactly.

99
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,320
Then...

100
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,920
what about that outsider?

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,160
Beisheng...

102
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,070
Is he truly on my side or not?

103
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,040
Not sure yet.

104
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,070
Alright, get back to work.

105
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,790
Xu Beisheng, you stray.

106
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,440
You dare take my things!

107
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,500
- Go to hell.
- Useless!

108
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,560
Dad.

109
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,280
Get out!

110
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,630
Idiot.

111
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,480
You can't even win over one woman.

112
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,090
Standing here all cranky...

113
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,010
What's the point?

114
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,440
I've done my best.

115
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,320
Who knew Xu Beisheng

116
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,350
would use such low tricks

117
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,390
to win over Menghuan.

118
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,880
If he can play tricks,

119
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,390
why can't you?

120
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,320
Look at you now.

121
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,070
How to take over my position?

122
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,920
You want to see me.

123
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,910
Miss Menghuan.

124
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,000
I've given it some serious thought.

125
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,510
Feelings can't be forced.

126
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,880
So I've decided
to call off the engagement

127
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,160
for you and my brother.

128
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,560
Really?

129
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,880
That's so thoughtful of you.

130
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,640
But my agreement isn't enough.

131
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,320
We need my parents' approval too.

132
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,480
How about this then.

133
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,200
Tonight, let's eat at Paris Night.

134
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,550
Then we can talk over

135
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,550
how to convince them.

136
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,720
Can't we just talk here?

137
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,880
Sure, we can.

138
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,390
It's just that...

139
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,950
There are too many eyes here.

140
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,350
If someone overhears us,

141
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,670
the plan will be ruined.

142
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,110
But Mr. Xu said,

143
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,000
without his permission,

144
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,200
I can't go anywhere.

145
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,790
It's fine.

146
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,350
With me around,

147
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,640
you can go anywhere.

148
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,380
Alright.

149
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,240
Then pack your things.

150
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,210
I'll pick you up later.

151
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,390
Take care, my lord.

152
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,790
Xiaotao,

153
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,320
I'm heading to Paris Night later.

154
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,230
If before ten tonight,

155
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,320
I still haven't come back,

156
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,550
remember to come find me.

157
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,920
Got it.

158
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,200
Promise me.

159
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,760
Okay.

160
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,180
(Paris Night)

161
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,640
What do you mean?

162
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,420
Have you figured out how to make Mr. Xu

163
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,560
call off the engagement?

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,200
I've got some plans.

165
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,790
But it's a long story.

166
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,390
How about a drink first?

167
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,790
I'll tell you slowly.

168
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,470
So, what's your plan?

169
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,940
You really don't want to marry me?

170
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,760
Marriage should be by choice.

171
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,760
But we hardly get to go out together.

172
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,760
I made all your favorite dishes today.

173
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,550
I'm not here for the food today.

174
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's just get to the point, okay?

175
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,640
At least tell me

176
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,280
what's roughly on your mind.

177
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,400
So, you think

178
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,200
what's the right move?

179
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,190
Iâ€¦

180
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,280
What's wrong?

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,840
Are you okay?

182
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,640
Forget it, I'll go ahead.

183
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,320
Do you want to rest for a bit first?

184
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,110
The perfect canvas.

185
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,470
Finally, it's mine.

186
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,230
My creation.

187
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,230
My art.

188
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,380
What did you do?

189
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,620
My art.

190
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,180
You'll like it.

191
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,850
Crazy!

192
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,700
My art!

193
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,300
My art!

194
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,580
Xu Beisheng.

195
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,500
Xu Beisheng, please help me.

196
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,180
Xu Tianci is a pervert.

197
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
I can't stay.

198
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,700
I can't stay here anymore.

199
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,300
- Let's leave here.
- Please help me.

200
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,900
Hang in there.

201
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,140
Xu Tianci is nothing short of a devil.

202
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,300
He's an absolute brute.

203
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,900
Stay here for now.

204
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,780
As for Xu Tianci,

205
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,460
I'll make sure he pays the price.

206
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,060
You...

207
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,860
About the arranged marriage,

208
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,450
the groom can only be Xu Tianci.

209
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,260
You underestimate how cunning he is.

210
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,420
And you act purely on impulse,

211
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
with no clear plan.

212
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,180
Far too impatient.

213
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,300
But I can't wait another day.

214
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,620
The wedding date is getting closer.

215
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,740
If this keeps up,

216
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,060
I'll end up in his grasp.

217
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,740
I have no choice.

218
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,580
Xu Beisheng,

219
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,300
I'm really scared.

220
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,340
Do you truly...

221
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,260
not like me at all?

222
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,800
â™ªWhen I looked backâ™ª

223
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,860
â™ªYesterday's blossomsâ™ª

224
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,520
â™ªBathed in the morning lightâ™ª

225
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,400
â™ªBuds just about to openâ™ª

226
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,780
â™ªI still remember the sunsetâ™ª

227
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,590
â™ªShining on your faceâ™ª

228
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,720
â™ªHalf-open doorsâ™ª

229
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,860
â™ªWe gaze from afarâ™ª

230
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,910
â™ªYou're all I think aboutâ™ª

231
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,000
â™ªI miss you day and nightâ™ª

232
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:25,050
â™ªYour song lingers in the airâ™ª

233
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,760
â™ªI lost in your dreamy eyesâ™ª

234
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,080
â™ªYour smile lit up the roomâ™ª

235
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:37,030
â™ªYour glance made my heart raceâ™ª

236
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,630
â™ªI waitâ™ª

237
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,180
â™ªHoping to see youâ™ª

238
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,500
â™ªRight by your sideâ™ª

239
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,340
â™ªThat's where heaven is for meâ™ª

240
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,610
â™ªI once thought time moved slowâ™ª

241
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,800
â™ªThe days ahead were longâ™ª

242
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,560
â™ªAnd our love as deep as alwaysâ™ª

243
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,450
â™ªYet life is full of changeâ™ª

244
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,270
â™ªShifting like the windâ™ª

245
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,330
â™ªA sudden heavy blowâ™ª

246
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,120
â™ªCaught us off guardâ™ª

247
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,570
â™ªWe were once like a pair in loveâ™ª

248
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,820
â™ªSweet and bound by longingâ™ª

249
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,630
â™ªHand in hand,
growing old by candlelightâ™ª

250
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,800
â™ªTill the end of timeâ™ª

251
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,100
Beisheng.

252
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,940
Xu Beisheng.

253
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,480
â™ªHopelessâ™ª

254
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,560
â™ªAutumn grass meets frostâ™ª

255
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,580
Go back to Capital now.

256
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,180
Don't ever come back here.

257
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,820
And don't look for me.

258
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,460
â™ªThose vows of foreverâ™ª

259
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,210
â™ªHave faded into the pastâ™ª

260
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,080
â™ªLooking aheadâ™ª

261
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,440
â™ªYou are no longer by my sideâ™ª

262
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,640
â™ªYou're all I think aboutâ™ª

263
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,870
â™ªWill my calls reach you?â™ª

264
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,250
â™ªMy heart is brokenâ™ª

265
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,480
â™ªMy heart's riddled with scarsâ™ª

266
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,470
â™ªI'm battered all overâ™ª

267
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,620
â™ªYet still pretending I'm fineâ™ª

268
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,910
â™ªWhite hair flows long with sorrowâ™ª

269
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,460
Where's my jade?

270
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,660
Where's my jade?

271
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,620
The shape of your jade pendant

272
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,900
is quite unique.

273
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,280
â™ªAlone to Xiangyangâ™ª

274
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,500
â™ªWhile I remain in Zhouzhuangâ™ª

275
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,420
â™ªFrom then on, worlds apartâ™ª

276
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,440
â™ªNo place to speak my sorrowâ™ª

277
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,770
â™ªMy hair turns grayâ™ª

278
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,150
â™ªI weep day after dayâ™ª

279
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,060
â™ªNow I've locked my dream awayâ™ª

280
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,940
â™ªA butterfly flies into the biting windâ™ª

281
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:35,100
â™ªCrashing into the pure white of winterâ™ª

282
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,380
â™ªI want to fill your life
with rose vinesâ™ª

283
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,580
â™ªStriving to bloomâ™ª

284
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,860
â™ªIn the empty, deserted cityâ™ª

285
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,780
â™ªA stranded shipâ™ª

286
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,940
â™ªIn silent accord with storm and wavesâ™ª

287
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,140
â™ªThough we knew and chose to forgetâ™ª

288
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,300
â™ªThat our courses were never the sameâ™ª

289
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,580
â™ªWe rode the tides born of the moonâ™ª

290
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,420
â™ªFor just a fleeting embraceâ™ª

291
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,300
â™ªAfter sunrise, no one will know youâ™ª

292
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,300
â™ªYet you're so heavy in my heartâ™ª

293
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,980
â™ªIf the mistake was meeting by chance
that windy dayâ™ª

294
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,500
â™ªI only wish for a gentle endingâ™ª

295
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,620
â™ªEven if the sunset swayed that dayâ™ª

296
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,700
â™ªEven if our embrace was not sincereâ™ª

297
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,340
â™ªWe loved deeply,
falling like startled swansâ™ª

298
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,020
â™ªTears rushed forth as once they surgedâ™ª

299
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,940
â™ªShe wove a crown of solitude
with her lifeâ™ª

300
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,180
â™ªSilently stepping into
the crowded worldâ™ª
