=Dangerous Love=

2
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,180
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,750
Look at this.

4
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,950
The curves.

5
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,510
The figure.

6
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,280
The skin.

7
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
Isn't it flawless?

8
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,430
Menghuan,

9
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,630
be my model,

10
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,920
alright?

11
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,680
Every inch of you

12
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,520
is a work of art.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,120
Take your stuff

14
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,200
and get out.

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,520
See you.

16
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,960
Take it away!

17
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,490
My lady,

18
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:56,780
are you alright?

19
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,590
(This Tianci is such a creep.)

20
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,190
(If I can't stop the arranged marriage,)

21
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,810
(the groom)

22
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,400
(must not be Xu Tianci.)

23
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,110
Today is Menghuan's 20th birthday.

24
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,080
Worth celebrating.

25
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,360
Everyone here,

26
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,590
raise your glass.

27
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,240
Wish her a happy birthday.

28
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,840
Happy birthday, Menghuan.

29
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,470
Happy birthday.

30
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,640
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

31
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
And thanks to all of you.

32
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,590
Xu Beisheng,

33
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,750
you're back.

34
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,950
Miss Zhou.

35
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,920
I...

36
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,120
Miss Zhou.

37
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,080
Are you okay?

38
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,670
Beisheng,

39
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,520
Zhou Menghuan is Tianci's fiancee.

40
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,740
It's not appropriate

41
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,590
for you to hold her.

42
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,800
Tianci's leg is injured.

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,550
If he had caught Miss Zhou,

44
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,080
it would've made it worse.

45
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,470
That's pointless talk.

46
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,310
Go get the doctor.

47
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,800
Yes.

48
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,190
I'll take her back to her room.

49
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,390
(That sly fox.)

50
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,360
She was poisoned

51
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,390
from eating pufferfish.

52
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,270
Who told you to give her that?

53
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,150
You can't even handle a simple task.

54
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,270
What's the use of you here?

55
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,270
Might as well marry you off early.

56
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,670
Dad, it really wasn't me.

57
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,820
If not you, then who else?

58
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,000
Miaoyin,

59
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,800
when you make a mistake, own up to it.

60
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,550
You can't always try to

61
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
shift the blame.

62
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,720
- Sorry, Dad.
- Get to the ancestral hall

63
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,990
and kneel til the sunrise.

64
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,200
Move.

65
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,390
Go!

66
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,220
Stop right there.

67
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,820
Dad.

68
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,380
You're still up this late?

69
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,700
Are you planning to

70
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,220
see Lady Miaoyin in the ancestral hall?

71
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,780
I... I...

72
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,100
Siyuan,

73
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,020
how many times have I told you

74
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,140
that Xu Miaoyin

75
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,780
is not as harmless as she looks.

76
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,300
She's got a scheming mind.

77
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,900
We need to stay far away from her.

78
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,220
Dad.

79
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,900
I know what I'm doing.

80
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,700
You don't have to worry.

81
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,340
You... you...

82
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,420
Lady Miaoyin.

83
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,780
You must be hungry.

84
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,780
I brought your favorite snacks.

85
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,260
Take them away.

86
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,940
I'm not in the mood.

87
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,900
You weren't punished.

88
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,940
Why are you kneeling?

89
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,490
If you did nothing wrong,

90
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,380
why not explain to Master?

91
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,140
Would that even help?

92
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,780
I'm already used to

93
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,700
getting punished,

94
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,220
taking the blame,

95
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,380
getting criticized.

96
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,900
I'm just someone unnecessary.

97
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,660
I shouldn't have been born.

98
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,780
It's all your fault, all your fault.

99
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,700
All your fault.

100
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,500
I got hurt from giving birth ot you.

101
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,540
Can't have another child.

102
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,820
That's why Li Manzhen

103
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,740
dare to bully me.

104
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,100
I've known since I was little,

105
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,900
no one in this family can be trusted.

106
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,020
The only person I can rely on

107
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,260
is myself.

108
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,100
No.

109
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,340
You can rely on me too.

110
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,060
For you,

111
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,740
I'd do anything.

112
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,660
Lu Siyuan,

113
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,660
you're so good to me.

114
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,440
Is it because you like me?

115
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,780
I knew it,

116
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,340
you don't like me.

117
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,460
You just pity me.

118
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,300
Go.

119
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,420
I don't need pity.

120
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,180
I like you.

121
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,100
This is the ancestral hall.

122
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,060
People could walk in anytime.

123
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,180
You should go first.

124
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,980
Alright.

125
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,980
Lady Miaoyin.

126
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,580
What a cute little bunny.

127
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,260
Why are you here?

128
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,900
I brought it here.

129
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,180
Thank you, I really like it.

130
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,340
This is for you.

131
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,020
Just think of it

132
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,460
as my thanks for the bunny.

133
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,980
(Sheng)

134
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,140
If you don't like it,

135
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,180
you can give it back.

136
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,540
The poison in you isn't gone yet.

137
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,700
Take your medicine.

138
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,140
I've got things to do.

139
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,380
I'll go ahead.

140
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,780
My head feels so dizzy.

141
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,540
I'm out of strength.

142
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,380
You okay?

143
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,180
My head's spinning badly.

144
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,140
I feel awful.

145
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,980
Here.

146
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,860
Let me feed you.

147
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,260
(He does care about me).

148
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,860
(He'll probably help me)

149
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,220
(call off my wedding with Tianci.)

150
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,380
Xu Beisheng.

151
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,060
I…

152
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,980
I like you.

153
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,700
Don't talk nonsense.

154
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,100
You're Tianci's fiance.

155
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,780
I…

156
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,540
The shape of your jade pendant

157
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,500
is quite unique.

158
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,540
This isn't a jade pendant.

159
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,620
It's a key

160
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,620
a Luban Box from ancient times.

161
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,780
My father

162
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,060
got it at an auction

163
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,260
and gave it to my mother.

164
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,980
Later, she passed it to me.

165
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,380
Take your hand off her.

166
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,180
Tianci.

167
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,020
I'm here to bring her medicine.

168
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,180
Since you're here,

169
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,480
I'll leave her to you.

170
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,340
No need to trouble you.

171
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,220
I'm tired, I want to rest.

172
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,540
You don't want to see me?

173
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,820
We are husband and wife,

174
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,220
or about to be wed.

175
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,460
We can't stay this distant.

176
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,460
"About to be wed" means unmarried.

177
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,700
We should keep distance.

178
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,620
Please leave.

179
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,460
You do know about keeping distance?

180
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,980
What were you doing?

181
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,660
Zhou Menghuan.

182
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,180
You belong to me, Xu Tianci.

183
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,340
If I can't have you,

184
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,820
then no one else will.

185
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,620
Drink the medicine.

186
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,780
You know what to do.

187
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,700
My lady, don't worry.

188
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,060
Who are you?

189
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,020
What are you doing?

190
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,350
Stay away from me.

191
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,390
- Oh...
- Stay back!

192
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,860
You woke up this fast, huh?

193
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,700
Don't come any closer!

194
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,460
Mom, mom!

195
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,900
Something's wrong!

196
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,330
Look at you, all flustered.

197
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,740
Where's the grace of a young lady?

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,100
I...

199
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,550
Mom.

200
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,410
Wait for me!

201
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,500
Come here, you.

202
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,180
What are you doing?

203
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,450
Stay back, don't come closer!

204
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,340
Darn it.

205
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,330
If I don't teach you a lesson,

206
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,670
you'll never know
who you're dealing with.

207
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,380
