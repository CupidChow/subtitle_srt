1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,000


2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,800
 Episode 15 

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,310
  Of course. I remember it. 

4
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,160
 If everything gets solved, let's go again go dip our feet. 

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,340
They have been putting up a show the whole time?

6
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,350
You came, Soo In.

7
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,900
This...

8
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,720
Isn't yours.

9
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,220
Oppa.

10
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,910
That's not it.

11
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,180
It seems you're misunderstanding something.

12
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,530
It's not me.

13
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,810
Misunderstanding?

14
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,930
What misunderstanding?

15
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,380
That you destroyed Chun Hee's stage outfit?

16
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,960
That you caused an accident intending that Chun Hee get hurt?

17
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,210
That you lied that you are my fiancee and tried to disguise the accident?

18
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,210
At the time,

19
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,290
I looked at your eyes.

20
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,310
Is that a misunderstanding, too?

21
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,580
Why?

22
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,200
Did you think that I'm still deceived by you?

23
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,740
Oppa...

24
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,100
How did you become like this?

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,960
You were not this kind of person before.

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,620
Oppa... I really didn't try to harm you.

27
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,830
Then is it Choi Chun Hee?

28
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,450
Why are you like that to Chun Hee?

29
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,140
Is it because of the new president?

30
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,500
Is it because the person that the president likes is Choi Chun Hee, not you?

31
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,240
No! That's not it.

32
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,530
Fine. I hated Choi Chun Hee.

33
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,800
What is she?

34
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,730
What is she, that she's taking away everything that's mine?

35
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,550
Why is she enjoying the things that I should be enjoying?

36
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,810
Soo In.

37
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,000
Since a long time ago, you know that I liked you a lot, right?

38
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:50,870
You never slacked off during that long period when you were a trainee.

39
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,740
I liked you, who only practiced.

40
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,780
So that's why you are the current Park Soo In.

41
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:05,360
You were not a kid who would take a shortcut.

42
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,500
I will tell you lastly.

43
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,370
Turn yourself in, Soo In.

44
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,650
I can't do that, Oppa.

45
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,540
Like you said,

46
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,140
It was very hard to get to where I am now.

47
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,730
I've never breathed easily 
since I was fourteen years old.

48
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:45,400
Whenever I would go up on stage, I was so nervous that I always dug my toes in.

49
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,530
My nails would dig into my skin, causing me to bleed.

50
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,210
But I still sang.

51
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,640
Oppa,

52
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,580
I can't leave the stage on my own two feet.

53
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,960
You are the one

54
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,120
who made the choice.

55
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,300
Oppa.

56
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,550
Oppa!

57
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,520
Oppa! Oppa!

58
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,170
Oppa, where are you going right now?

59
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,680
You're not going to report me, right?

60
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,230
Wait a moment. Wait!

61
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,310
Oppa, you told me to turn myself in, right?

62
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,150
Okay, I will.

63
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,790
But give me some time.

64
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,340
Time to organize everything.

65
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,310
You can do that at least, right?

66
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,120
Oppa, please.

67
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,050
There is something you must know.

68
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,050
What you said on stage is all in here.

69
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,800
What?

70
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,040
I will give you three days.

71
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,660
First of all, apologize to Choi Chun Hee sincerely.

72
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,080
Chun Hee!

73
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,620
Sunbae, why are you here?

74
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,770
Joon Hyeon called you so that we could meet.

75
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,200
Sit down, Chun Hee.

76
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,520
Why would Jang Joon Hyeon want us to meet?

77
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,680
I will apologize.

78
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,580
Everything is my fault.

79
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:54,030
Truthfully, the accident that was on stage,

80
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,190
was my doing.

81
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,070
You?

82
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,740
I was blinded by jealousy.

83
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,250
At that time, I just hated you so much

84
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,540
and only thought that I wish you would've disappeared.

85
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,530
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:16,070
So, it was your doing towards me because you hated me,

87
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,630
but Jang Joon Hyeon got hurt instead of me, is that what you're saying right now?

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,300
Chun Hee, I'm sorry.

89
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,770
I don't know why I did that back then.

90
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,030
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,610
I

92
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,670
can never forgive you.

93
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,810
Because of you, Jang Joon Hyeon almost died. You know, right?

94
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,980
I am going to turn myself in.

95
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,110
I am going to, but give me a little time.

96
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,040
You said that you sang because of your father, right?

97
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,590
Like how you have a valuable father, I have a mother.

98
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,810
And my mother only lives to look at me.

99
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:03,340
But if I go to the police station like this, my mother might collapse.

100
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,610
Please, Chun Hee.

101
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,710
Just give me time to organize.

102
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:11,250
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,410
Okay,

104
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,870
I need time.

105
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,890
To organize...

106
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,600
Why didn't you tell me?

107
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,860
Why did you hold it in by yourself?

108
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,800
If I told you,

109
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,290
would you have stayed still with your temper?

110
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,340
You would have chased her and created a scene.

111
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,640
Then we don't know what the other side would have done.

112
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,730
You might have been framed instead.

113
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:19,550
We didn't have any evidence except for my testimony.

114
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,950
Look at me.

115
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,350
Good job.

116
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:39,450
You kept the secret to yourself, and got the proof.

117
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,400
Good job.

118
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,130
You did a better job.

119
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,760
You believed and waited for me the whole time.

120
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,790
Good job.

121
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,550
I'll be leaving.

122
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,690
Are you going somewhere?

123
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,390
Yes. I'm going to sing at the homeless center.

124
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,440
Aren't you tired?

125
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,310
Dad,

126
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:26,540
everything just went along so well for me.

127
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,300
People began to know me in a short amount of time,

128
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:36,010
and if you see it as a marathon, I didn't even run 1 kilometer.

129
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:40,160
Even if I become successful again, 
I'm still going to do voluntary work.

130
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,610
I feel satisfied when the homeless people listen to my song and like it.

131
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,770
And I like doing it.

132
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:53,040
I think that I'm learning more than those people.

133
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,170
Oh, you have to eat your meal.

134
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,290
Of course.

135
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,110
- I'll leave now! 
- Okay.

136
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,330
Hello?

137
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,110
Chun Hee isn't that type of girl.

138
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,120
I believe my daughter, Ju Hee.

139
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,270
Oppa, I saw everything on the CCTV.

140
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,100
Perhaps you don't believe me?

141
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,370
It's not that I don't believe, but I believe my daughter.

142
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,770
And the video you saw...

143
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,920
Something was probably wrong.

144
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,740
I heard that these days you can edit those things.

145
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,180
After hearing what you said last time, I investigated on my own a bit.

146
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,210
The concert stage CCTV that disappeared,

147
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,600
I believe Director Yang took it.

148
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,910
I thought you were useless, but it seems you do some work.

149
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,790
I have a useful father.

150
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,940
Also, those pictures of you and Choi Chun Hee 
living together.

151
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,740
It was also Director Yang who incited that.

152
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,630
Can I meet that paparazzi reporter?

153
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,920
All these are so pretty.

154
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,310
Mother.

155
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,810
How is this one?

156
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,340
Ah, it's so high end and pretty!

157
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,670
Let's go with this one.

158
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,530
Really? Aiyoo.

159
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,210
Thank you.

160
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:03,150
By the way, that wretch didn't hit on alone, but

161
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,590
our Joon Hyeon played along too?

162
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,840
Mother, please help me.

163
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,820
The evidence of them cheating is in Oppa's room.

164
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,240
Our Joon Hyeon wouldn't do that.

165
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,660
Anyway, this time I'll help you.

166
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,670
You have to make sure this doesn't happen again  in the future.

167
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,600
Yes, Mother.

168
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,430
Father, but those two people.

169
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,930
How far are they planning to go?

170
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,870
As I've been doing business up to this day,

171
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,430
there is one principle that I've kept completely.

172
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,150
That's a person. Person.

173
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,280
Even though his thoughts are bad,

174
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,400
and his actions are wrong,

175
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,680
accept that person after seeing what his effort and talent is.

176
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,540
If you or I

177
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,310
accepted the effort and talents of such people,

178
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,440
the problem probably

179
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,670
wouldn't have come this far.

180
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,280
This is hard.

181
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,970
Ah! I hate complicated things.

182
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,450
Ah! This job really doesn't fit me!

183
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,840
Ah! Aigoo, you're far.

184
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,740
You're still very far! Aigoo, so frustrating.

185
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,180
Father, have some watermelon.

186
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,580
You have it all till your stomach explodes!

187
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,720
Hello, Sunbaenim!

188
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,470
- Hello!! 
 - Hello.

189
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,810
Oh... okay.

190
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,910
That red pants (the girl wearing it) 
 is really annoying.

191
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,240
So refreshing! Wow!

192
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,640
Chun Hee has a broadcast today?

193
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,050
Probably not. Maybe she's catching some air, before the broadcast.

194
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,640
- Catching air? Getting the audience's attention? 
- Yes, yes, yes.

195
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,230
Aigoo... but still.

196
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:02,070
Why do they make her stand in the hall in this hot weather, without air conditioning?

197
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,860
Instead of standing there where it's hot, tell her to come in.

198
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,340
- Only Chun Hee? 
- Yeah.

199
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,240
Eh, you can't! They're so many people, they'll look.

200
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,970
Really?

201
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,140
Ahh... tell them all to come in!! All!

202
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,780
- All of them? 
 - Ah, go go go!

203
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,720
Red pants too?

204
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,220
Ah, I don't like her though.

205
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,580
Excuse me.

206
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,200
Joon Hyeon said all...

207
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,180
To come in. To come in and rest, since it's cool inside and there's a lot to eat.

208
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,140
So come in and rest.

209
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,150
Yes... I 'll be there right away.

210
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,800
But you can't..

211
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,200
We need Chun Hee though!

212
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,180
Unnie, you said you were on a diet!

213
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,560
I told you not to eat that! You have to lose weight!

214
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,460
Just put a lot... a lot.

215
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,850
Aishhh... so loud!

216
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,180
Be patient. Didn't I tell you it was a no to red pants?

217
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,680
What does she have that she came in as a trainee?

218
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,790
She must be good at singing.

219
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,200
She must be REALLY good.

220
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,160
Is it yummy?

221
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,480
Hey! Will you put that down!?

222
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,900
PUT THAT DOWN RIGHT NOW!

223
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,480
I knew red pants would cause trouble.

224
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,600
GET OUT ALL OF YOU!

225
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,970
Even though he's a star.

226
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,450
Why did he tell us to come in? 
Was he joking with us?

227
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,330
Aish! Seriously!

228
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,040
I mean, they touched my bellflower tea!

229
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,520
This is something that you brought for me to drink.

230
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,480
I know how you feel.

231
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,000
But it hurts me when people say bad things about you.

232
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,710
Can you be friendlier to others for me?

233
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,180
You can do that, right?

234
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,900
- Yes, Mother. 
 - Soo In.

235
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,060
A while ago, the thing that looked like a pencil,

236
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,070
I sent it through quick delivery.

237
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,750
Yes, I just received it.

238
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,110
Thank you.

239
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,350
 Who was the person that asked you to stalk Chun Hee and take photos secretly?   

240
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,420
 Shine Star Director Yang. 

241
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,060
 - Has this happened before?
- Yes, there were a couple of times. 

242
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,670
  I took pictures of Choi Chun Hee sleeping in her house.    

243
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,670
 You know every man has his faults. 

244
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,990
 It depends on how you make it look like. 

245
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,950
I restored the CCTV data.

246
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,190
The recorder that you're looking for is here.

247
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,850
Oppa!

248
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,470
Let's stop this now.

249
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,230
O-Oppa you didn't send this, right?

250
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,130
It's all over Soo In.

251
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,570
Before it's on tv, turn yourself in.

252
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,850
That's the last chance I can give you.

253
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:32,060


254
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,310
Are you crazy? Hey!

255
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,410
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING? 
- Let go! It's all over now.

256
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,900
- Park Soo In! 
 - Let go!!

257
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,120
What do you want me to do now?!

258
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,420
- LET GO!!!
- Park Soo In!

259
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,160
Come to your senses.

260
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:15,120
♬   Like a piece of gum,  ♬

261
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,950
♬   she keeps on following me around.  ♬

262
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,080
♬  Old-fashioned   ♬

263
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,500
♬  and strong-willed.   ♬

264
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,170
♬  You came fully into my heart   ♬

265
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,240
Will I be able to sing again?

266
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,040
♬   Please remember me  ♬

267
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,960
♬  I am always behind you. Please remember me.   ♬

268
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,030
Let's go.

269
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:53,770
♬  Even if it is you, who are a fool who doesn't know how to give up  ♬

270
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,300
♬  Even if it's you,   ♬

271
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:02,610
♬  You, who I can look at like this,   ♬

272
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,710
Why did you come here?

273
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,470
Why isn't he accepting the invitation? This man... 
 ♬  I love you  ♬

274
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,370
- President. 
- Wait a moment, let me ( go a ) level up.

275
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,230
Customer...

276
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,950
Go!

277
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,940
Yes, I broke it.

278
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,840
Level up.

279
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,690
Let's go.

280
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,070
Everybody, clap!

281
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,540
Let's clap together!

282
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,380
Scream!

283
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah!

284
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,890
♬  Be strong, it's only one time.   ♬

285
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:04,040
♬  It's just once in your life. It will never come back once it passes.   ♬

286
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:11,320
♬  Even if you don't tell me that you love me,  ♬

287
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:18,870
♬  My love for you  ♬

288
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,280
♬  will never change, like a tree.  ♬

289
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,970
♬  Without regrets,   ♬

290
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:30,860
♬  I can give you all of me.  ♬

291
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,760
How was it?

292
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,580
This was my first time seeing them in person. I just heard about them before.

293
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,700
It was nice.

294
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,570
Was there a time when you were that happy when you sang?

295
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,220
It seems like you lost that.

296
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,140
If you lost it, you should find it.

297
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:31,060
Don't be so touched.

298
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,540
I said it as Shine Star's President.

299
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,150
Honestly, Park Soo In,

300
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,780
I really don't like you these days.

301
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,760
I liked it when you were successful and earned a lot of money, like before.

302
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,100
President!

303
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,690
Go back to your original place.

304
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,300
So that I can earn money!

305
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,470
I will wait for you.

306
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:08,990


307
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,220
Here...

308
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,660
What is this?

309
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,600
It's your first love

310
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,320
that you have been looking for.

311
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,870
When did you?

312
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:34,140
I don't know if this person is your first love,

313
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,440
but to me, you are

314
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,170
my last...

315
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,440
love.

316
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,840
Ji Sook,

317
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,040
please be happy.

318
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,120
Hey!

319
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,690
Eat this!

320
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,600
They gave me so much chocolate after filming a commercial.

321
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,480
Eat it.

322
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,710
Sunbae! My nephew

323
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:34,570
is your fan and asked me 
if I can get your autograph.

324
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,990
You probably  won't, right?

325
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,880
What do you mean? Just give it to me!

326
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,000
Really?

327
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,190
Should we take a picture?

328
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,920
Really?

329
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,910
- Choi Chun Hee!
- Yes?

330
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,580
Take the picture.

331
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,430
Me?

332
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,710
Then, I'll take it now.

333
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,330
1. . . 2. . . 3

334
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,180
Be more closer!

335
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,980
We have to take the picture closer.

336
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,800
1. . . 2. . . 3

337
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,540
Here you go.

338
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,900
Thank you!

339
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,430
Here you go.

340
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,250
Why are you like that?

341
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,310
What's wrong with you?

342
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,740
I'm doing well, right?

343
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,340
Pat me.

344
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,290
Pat?

345
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,850
What is this?

346
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,770
Is it that hard to do it "enough"?

347
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,570
You told me to do well.

348
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,890
Stop fooling around.

349
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,840
You want me to add Choi Chun Hee to another program?

350
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,740
In this atmosphere, it might be hard to ask them.

351
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,430
Well, if you say that you will do the daily DJ,

352
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,960
I will ask PD Kim.

353
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,610
I looked for her wherever she might have been ...

354
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:15,790
- But? 
- She wasn't there.

355
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,510
Should I report to the police station, saying that she's missing?

356
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,190
You are her manager!

357
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,980
Perhaps,

358
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,570
did something happen recently between Soo In and  Jang Joon Hyeon?

359
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:32,350
Soo In isn't a girl who talks about things like that.

360
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:36,440
I got it. Leave.

361
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,150
Yes?

362
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,040
Jang Joon Hyeon!

363
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,160
Congratulate me.

364
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,940
I got onto the radio!

365
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,290
Really?

366
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,760
I'm a guest, and they told me to sing a song.

367
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,600
- Are you going up? 
- Am I?

368
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,800
Go back in.

369
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,410
Later, I will go to cheer you on. So I can do this.

370
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,000
Go in.

371
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:40,570
 Mom, don't look for me for the time being. 

372
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,230
Fighting!

373
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,430
I want to do well.

374
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,950
Oh, Hyung!

375
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,960
You are the DJ?

376
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,740
Today, the DJ had to go somewhere all of the sudden, so I agreed to fill in his spot.

377
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,410
All of the sudden, like a natural disaster ...

378
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,610
All of  a sudden...

379
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,370
Hello.

380
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,110
Can you get me some water?

381
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,190
Of course.

382
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,780
- Let's do well.
 - Yes.

383
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,790
Definitely.

384
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,940
Now it's time for "Choose my Heart", the audience's story corner.

385
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,800
The guests for today, Sin Hyo Yeol and Choi Chun Hee will have to act as the characters for the story

386
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,750
and read it with feeling.

387
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,440
Yes.

388
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,650
Hello. I'm now

389
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:59,750
a girl in my twenties who is stuck between two very different men.

390
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:03,810
One person is an oppa from the neighborhood whom I've known since I was little.

391
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:09,040
He has a rough personality, so I never have seen him as a man.

392
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,120
But the president of the cafe, where I worked part-time,

393
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,710
showed an interest in me.

394
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,570
"Sun Joo, what are you doing after your work today?"

395
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,370
"I want to take you in by my car and eat with you."

396
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,950
"I'm good at cooking."

397
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:29,120
Hyo Yeol, you have to use the mic in front of you for us to hear accurately.

398
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,560
Please do so.

399
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,950
Alright.

400
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,550
Please continue.

401
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:41,340
"He is a skilled and awesome man that everyone is jealous of."

402
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,030
"I still can't believe that a man like him likes me."

403
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,720
It's a happy concern 
between a neighborhood oppa and her boss.

404
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,380
Don't add your useless opinions.

405
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,850
Please do it correctly.

406
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,180
Yes. Correctly.

407
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:03,380
"And I also liked the friendly and rich president."

408
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,760
"But one day, the president drove me home"

409
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,310
"and suddenly kissed me in front of my house."

410
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,540
"Sun Joo, you know how I feel, right?"

411
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,080
"Yes I know."

412
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,240
STOP!

413
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,790
The neighborhood oppa screamed, "Stop."

414
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:31,050
"And our relationship ended, STOP."

415
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,490
Choi Chun Hee, you really read that story well.

416
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:37,680
You too, Sunbaenim, are awesome.

417
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,550
Hyung... Hyung!

418
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,360
Do you have a death wish?

419
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,010
No. I... I'm sorry.

420
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:58,080
I don't know why I did that at that time. 
It was when I didn't visit even my parents either.

421
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,170
So I don't even have friends.

422
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,650
You,

423
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:04,260
if I didn't yell stop, you were going to really kiss her weren't you?

424
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,880
 No 

425
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,450
You really stepped over the line.

426
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:13,060
If you pull that kind of stunt again, I'm going to ban you from broadcasting!

427
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:18,350
B-b-b-ban? Why is our hyungnim so mad?

428
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,950
Does he have high blood pressure?

429
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,860
Hyung- no, Hyungnim.

430
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,880
Hyungnim, really I'm sorry for everything. Sorry for everything.

431
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,430
I'm sorry.

432
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:33,460
So please call me again for the next broadcast.

433
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,540
If it's you, then you can say it well to PD Kim.

434
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,780
I'm putting my entire life on this broadcast.

435
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,460
You know how Choi Chun Hee look. 
Despite her (ugly) face, I put a lot of effort.

436
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,640
This... she... this...I couldn't go into 
the character (of the story).

437
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,710
Kneel.

438
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:54,230
So if Hyungnim can just tell PD Kim ... Aaagh!

439
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,690
What?

440
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,370
Couldn't go into the character?

441
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,170
What about Choi Chun Hee?

442
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,380
What about my Chun Hee?!

443
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,530
You know as well. We all know. Being so pitiful... why would I?

444
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:13,510
You, I'll talk to Kim PD for you, but

445
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:17,290
you better watch your lips.

446
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,860
Thank you for today.

447
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,860
For what? For going to encourage you?

448
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,570
Do you think I'm stupid?

449
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,710
You're the one who gave me that spot.

450
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,900
No I didn't.

451
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,020
After like a thousand years, 
I was finally invited as a guest.

452
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:41,580
But that program's host is Jang Joon Hyeon. Do you think I'll believe in that kind of coincidence?

453
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,500
How did you know?

454
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,660
Next time don't do that.

455
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,980
I want to come back on my own steam.

456
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,470
I'll ask of you.

457
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,570
But I'm very grateful for your thought.

458
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,790
Really?

459
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,400
Then pat me.

460
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,600
Pat you?

461
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,160
Bye.

462
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:28,950


463
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,570
Father.

464
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:42,590
Father, don't you need to receive surgery soon?

465
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,390
The rest of the time I have left,

466
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:50,580
I don't want to spend it in the hospital away from my kids.

467
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,130
Keep it a secret to the end

468
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,950
from Chun Hee and Byeol, you know.

469
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,250
All right.

470
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,250
And,

471
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,350
can I ask for one more favor?

472
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:15,310
It might be too much but,

473
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,120
can you

474
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,190
stay with Chun Hee?

475
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,290
Of course. Of course, I will.

476
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,970
Not like that.

477
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,540
Before I go,

478
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,180
it will put my mind at ease if I see

479
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,140
the image of you two living together.

480
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,110
What do you mean before you go?

481
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,650
Why are you speaking like that?

482
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,860
I beg of you.

483
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,940
Tae Song.

484
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,350
What's going on?

485
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,100
It's that,

486
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:22,700
Tae Song went out on Voice of Trot.

487
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,080
If he just passed this level, 
he could have gone up to the monthly final.

488
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,970
It's such a waste.

489
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,960
Oh, there are things like that?

490
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,340
But then, even current singers also participate.

491
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,620
It's a given that I get eliminated.

492
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:43,350
Don't speak like that Tae Song. You are the trot god.

493
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:47,320
Tae Song, remember that I'm your number one fan.

494
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,270
You can never give up.

495
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,930
Cheer up, huh?

496
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,920
Hey Jang Joon Hyeon.

497
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,180
Tell me truthfully. You're the god of music.

498
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,780
If you tell me I don't have a chance then I won't do it.

499
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,850
I have...

500
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,040
no chance, right?

501
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,570
Then,  honestly, do you think you

502
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,810
have a chance? You have a chance.

503
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,450
What?

504
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:32,660
- I have a chance?
- Why don't you try picking out a concept and whatever the image is, we'll shoot it.

505
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,350
Wow. You can do it!

506
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:39,940
Right? Right? Joon Hyeon can do it for you huh?

507
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,130
Really?

508
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,380
I was going to give up.

509
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,010
But I'm going to do it again because of you.

510
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,930
Do I greet right now?

511
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,940
Wait a minute.

512
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,630
Cue.

513
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,500
Hello.

514
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,690
I, who does push-and-pull with trot...

515
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:04,440
Trot push-and-pull man and woman.

516
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:16,850
♫   You are my companion.  ♫

517
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,930
♫   My forever companion.  ♫

518
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:26,120
Tae Song.
 ♫  My life's best present,  ♫

519
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,660
♫   was meeting you.  ♫

520
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:34,350

523

524
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,570
  Voice of Trot, the 11th contestant,  

525
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:04,140
 We will hear MJ's "What? What? " 

526
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:10,910
♫ What, what, what, what, what? ♫

527
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:14,650
♫ What, what, what are you? ♫

♫   What, what, what, what, what are you?   ♫

531

  ♫ It seems I'll die.  ♫  

532
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:42,970
  ♫ Please don't ever leave me alone.  ♫  

533
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:46,250
 Yes but what is the reason for you, MJ, to 

534
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:50,500
 attempt the program's most popular corner, "Voice of Trot"? 

535
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,820
 To be honest, I became a singer with no trouble. 

536
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,130
 Thinking about it, I became a singer too easily. 

537
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,930
 So I wanted to go back, 

538
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:03,270
 and start over so I attempted this corner.  

539
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,800
Choi Chun Hee...

540
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,920
Hello MJ.

541
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,900
President? Yes?

542
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,600
MJ!

543
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,790
You are MJ.

544
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,670
After listening to the radio, anyone could tell you're MJ.

545
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,930
Did you listen to the radio program too?

546
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:31,830
Of course.

547
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:36,600
If I just pass this blind audition, I can go to the final round,

548
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,070
Until then,  keep it a secret. 

549
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:41,700
Ah well, it depends on how you behave.

550
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,660
I'll definitely keep it a secret.

551
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,600
Thank you.

552
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,840
What secret?

553
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,830
No comment.

554
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:24,290
Ah, Jang Joon Hyeon, what brings you here?

555
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:30,250
Aigoo, your tie is pretty good today.

556
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,910
And your hairstyle is ok.

557
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,310
It's been this hairstyle for six years.

558
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,940
Thanks to me, the Shine Star stocks went up a lot recently.

559
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,750
Just a little bit.

560
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,900
So what do you want to say to me?

561
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,390
In that case,

562
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:55,520
what was that about earlier, the secret with Choi Chun Hee?

563
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:59,510
Didn't Choi Chun Hee tell you?

564
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,910
Seriously, you really don't know!

565
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:05,870
Ah, I'm truly embarrassed.

566
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,800
Are you sure you're dating Choi Chun Hee?

567
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,120
You are really annoying. You're not even going to tell me, you cheapo!

568
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:17,620
Jang Joon Hyeon?

569
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,280
Jang Joon Hyeon.

570
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:36,320
I'll tell you if you win a game.

571
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,460
What?

572
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:42,350
Rock, paper, scrissors, paper paper yeah...

573
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:44,820
Hold on.

574
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,820
Ah, yes.

575
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,420
I'm starting.

576
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:54,030
Cham, cham, cham!

577
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:59,990
Come here Jang Joon Hyeon.

578
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:03,480
Cham, cham, cham!

579
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,180
Alright.

580
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,880
This is cheating, who plays like that?

581
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,470
Come here, it's my turn.

582
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,640
Cham, cham, cham..

583
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:23,750
Ah, seriously! Someone who's called a president.

584
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:26,200
There's a hole!

585
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:34,500
What, so you mean the culprit 
of Jang Joon Hyeon's accident is,

586
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,460
Choi Chun Hee?

587
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,700
Yes.

588
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,570
It is Choi Chun Hee.

589
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:45,570
So you're saying it was an intentional accident caused by a love triangle.

590
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:48,340
If this goes on air, it will have a huge impact.

591
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:51,700
I can't just listen to your words and air it.

592
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,620
You have to have evidence.

593
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,780
With this,

594
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:02,540
it will at least be enough evidence to prove those two are having an affair.

595
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:25,870
I really want them to pay the price for deceiving Soo In.

596
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:34,430
Dad.

597
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:40,750
Earlier, the things Director Yang said on TV. 
You know it's not true, right?

598
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,740
I know my daughter better than anyone.

599
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,500
You would never do that.

600
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,690
Director Yang doesn't seem to know that I have a voice recording.

601
00:44:55,690 --> 00:45:02,390
Father, I'll take care of this, so don't worry.

602
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:04,880
Yah, Jang Joon Hyeon.

603
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,300
What are you going to do?

604
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:16,160
 Oppa. I really didn't try to harm you. 

605
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,680
 Then was it Choi Chun Hee? 

606
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,580
 Why did you do that to Choi Chun Hee? 

607
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,320
 Is it because of the new President? 

608
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,320
 Because the person the President likes is Choi Chun Hee and not you? 

609
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,560
 No, it's not like that. 

610
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,530
 I'll admit, I hated Choi Chun Hee. 

611
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,890
 What is she? 

612
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:32,740
 What makes her so special 
that she steals everything I had? 

613
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:37,600
 All the things I should have, why does she have them? 

614
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:41,720
Was that Park Soo In's voice?

615
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,260
That's correct.

616
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,860
So the culprit is not Choi Chun Hee.

617
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:52,070
Mr. Jang Joon Hyeon. What's the reason you decided on a press interview only now?

618
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:57,060
I lost my memory because of the accident.

619
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:02,310
That's why I couldn't even remember the woman I love.

620
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:12,590
The woman I love is, not Park Soo In, 
but Choi Chun Hee.

621
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:21,190
 Jang Joon Hyeon's Press Interview 

622
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:31,100
I no longer want the woman I love to become hurt because of me.

623
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,110
It's Yang Ju Hee!

624
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:37,360
You were interviewed and said that Choi Chun Hee was the person who caused Jang Joon Hyeon's accident.

625
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,950
Did you give a false testimony to protect your daughter?

626
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:42,320
Please tell us the truth Ms Yang Ju Hee.

627
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,120
- Get out of my way.
- Please make a comment.

628
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,380
Jang Joon Hyeon, Jang Joon Hyeon!

629
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,120
Why are you calling out my precious son's name?

630
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,480
What brings you here?

631
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:59,880
I thought you were smart, I guess not.

632
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,630
How could you raise your daughter in that way?

633
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:07,240
Because of Soo In, 
my Joon Hyeon could have been in big trouble.

634
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,920
Because of a man, 
she committed a murder attempt? Tsk.

635
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,850
Shouldn't you be sending your daughter 
to a psychiatric hospital for some treatment?

636
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:22,050
You, nothing good will come out of annoying me.

637
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:27,160
Since you are not all that clean either.

638
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,020
What?

639
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,150
What are you on about?

640
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,510
Start.

641
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:40,550
We will now start the Voice of Trot blind audition.

642
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:43,220
Especially for today, we have the legends in trot.

643
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:48,250
We have with us, Hwang Geum Ja and Byeon Hee Bong, as the judges.

644
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:51,720
Participants, please come in.

645
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,410
The two judges will listen to the song with their eyes covered.

646
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:58,280
And they will select the participant number of the person who

647
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,470
sang the best.

648
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,470
Then we'll begin.

649
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:27,950
♪ With my face buried in your chest ♪

650
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:33,300
♪ I want to cry today ♪

651
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:38,570

652
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:46,240

Wow, everyone is so great.

658
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:19,940
We'll briefly take a commercial break, and we'll be back.

659
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,840
Could all the participants please set outside?

660
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:40,420
Judges, you may now take off your blindfold.

661
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:55,320
Then we'll listen to a short comment on your responses.

662
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,710
Being a singer until this age,

663
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:02,790
I can tell a person just by their voice

664
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:06,760
Participant number three's voice has an echo

665
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:11,920
because there is sincerity. She was born with a gifted voice, too.

666
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,240
The winner is number three.

667
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:17,260
Yes. Congratulations.

668
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:20,950
Participant number 3, MJ.  
Please come in.

669
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,720
Oh, you...

670
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,270
Hello, Ma'am.

671
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,000
See if I judge for such a thing again.

672
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,360
Ma'am, thank you for today.

673
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:50,080
Number three, you. Just because I said a few words for you, don't show off.

674
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,680
This is the beginning.

675
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,460
Yes, I will keep that in mind.

676
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:58,010
Thank you, Ma'am, I'll work harder.

677
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,830
 - Best three things you should do when you get a lover. 
- What?

678
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:10,890
You made such a fuss because of this?

679
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:14,410
Of course. To lovers, what's more important than going on dates?

680
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:17,490
Today, I'm going to take you on a date.

681
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:19,940
- Let's go!
- Oppa...

682
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,280
 One: Hold hands and 

683
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,570
- walk on a busy street.
 - When did you prepare a couple t-shirt?

684
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:28,390
Of course, who am I?

685
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:31,700
♬  Pounding, pounding, my pounding heart  ♬

686
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,020
♬  Fluttering, fluttering, fluttering, fluttering  ♬

687
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:37,710
♬  My lips that are whispering   ♬

688
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:40,890
Two: Eat tasty street food.

689
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,000
Aunt, give me a dish of this.

690
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:46,600
- You wanted to eat spicy rice cake?
- Yeah, fish cake, too.

691
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,630
- Is it tasty?
- Yeah.

692
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,810
Indeed, my Chun Hee sure knows how to eat.

693
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,620
What?

694
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:04,050
- Chun Hee.
- Huh?
- You seem to have gained weight recently.

695
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:08,640
♬  My love is shake shake shaking  ♬

696
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,610
♬  My lips are eloquent with sorry sorry   ♬

697
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:14,810
Three: Watch a movie together.
♬ My heart is shaking worry worry  ♬

698
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:23,320
I really wanted to try something like this.
♬ You are my love Mister oh!  ♬

699
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,980
Oh, is that so? Me too.

700
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:30,260
♬  You are my Mr. Lee Lee  ♬

701
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:33,600
♬  You are my Mr. Kang Kang  ♬

702
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,770
One for you, 
and one for me.

703
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:39,160
♬  My love is shake shake shaking  ♬

704
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:43,030
- I think I'm thirsty.
- Here. Sip for you.

705
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:45,710
Sip for me.

706
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:49,220
Actually, the movie isn't important when you come here.

707
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:51,550
- Then what's important?
- Physical contact.

708
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:53,810
Whatever.

709
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:01,080
- Ta da!
-Ah, you scared me!

710
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,870
What is it that you bought this much?

711
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:04,920
I'll eat it.

712
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,940
Have this.

713
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:13,120
For the first time in a long time,
do you want to play badminton with me?

714
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,310
I went easy on you last time.

715
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:18,240
Grandpa, you're not very good at it,
 so it's difficult for me.

716
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,080
- I went easy on you last time too.
- What was that?

717
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,660
Now I'm going to play with Dad.

718
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:25,100
He's really good at playing badminton.

719
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,330
What?

720
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:29,890
Um, is your dad home?

721
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:31,460
Yes.

722
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,400
Cheers.

723
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:52,980
Ah, but this is a date after all. 
It's breaking the mood.

724
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,510
There's no mood with chicken, you dummy. Here.

725
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,890
Aigoo, you're eating so well.

726
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:01,480
I have to make the mood again!

727
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,250
There's no mood with chicken!

728
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:06,780
- There is, you idiot! 
- There isn't, you idiot!

740
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,020
Of course. Who did God of Music Jang Joon Hyeon think of while making this song?

741
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,700
Thank you.

742
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,970
If something goes, something has to come.

743
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:31,780
You grant a wish of mine too.

744
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:36,040
I feel good. Tell me anything, I'll grant it all.

745
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,930
Let's get married.

746
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,500
What?

747
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:48,930
I thought about it, but I don't think 
it can be anyone else but you.

750
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:09,110
The necklace finally found its owner.

751
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:10,930
It looks good on you.

752
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,670
Don't lose it and take care of it well.

753
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:21,530
You lost the whole thing though.

754
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:25,960
♬  love like a snowflake,  ♬

758
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:50,460
  If you just keep your mouth shut, 
there won't be any problems. 

759
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:08,350
I don't know.  It's all water under the bridge now.

760
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,740
What? You want to get married to Choi Chun Hee?

761
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,600
Are you crazy?

762
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,310
There's already a lot of things giving me a headache.

763
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:29,010
When you were getting married to David, 
did you do it after getting my permission?

764
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,280
What?

765
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:36,190
Not long ago,

766
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:39,960
I saw the person who caused your mom's accident.

767
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,280
- That hit-and-run culprit?
- Yeah.

768
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:47,930
Who is that person? Do you know who it is?

769
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:53,430
It was a co-worker who used to sing with your mom back in the days.

770
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,880
I definitely have to find that person.

771
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,010
I have to find her and solve this myself.

772
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:05,400
That's the first thing I have to do.

773
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,710
And the second thing is... to marry you off.

774
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,290
Dad...

775
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:19,490
I wish

776
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,180
that you would get into a good relationship with Joon Hyeon.

777
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:32,350
Being a singer is a job with a lot of ups and downs.

778
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:38,030
If Joon Hyeon is beside you at those times, I would feel

779
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:41,200
more at ease, that's why.

780
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,090
Dad, are you going somewhere?

781
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:48,950
Why do you talk like someone who's leaving? 
It's making me feel uneasy.

782
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:50,970
Hey.

783
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,260
I'm saying I have to see you live well

784
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:01,700
so that my heart would feel at ease.

785
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,940
I'm told it's reserved under Choi Chun Hee.

786
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:33,050
Just a moment.

787
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,580
Please follow me this way.

788
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:41,580
What are you going to bring as a wedding gift?

789
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:44,440
For the house, it would be nice if it had big windows.

790
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:47,510
A house?

791
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:53,030
If you want to take a husband like Joon Hyeon,
 you should definitely prepare a house.

792
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:58,790
- Soo In said that she was going to provide it.
- Mom, please!

793
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:03,380
"Mom, mom, mom" don't say that,
 I'm going to die.

794
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:07,340
But, where is the restroom?

795
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,350
Don't worry.

796
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:29,470
I can't find any part of her I like.

797
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:37,170
It's this way.

798
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,310
Myeong Sik Oppa...

799
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,640
Hwa Soon.

800
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:57,500
You're Hwa Soon, right?

801
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,140
Oppa.

802
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,170
Perhaps...

803
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:09,550
Jang Joon Hyeon was your son?

804
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:15,180
Maybe Dad can't find the place.

805
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:19,100
Just a moment...

806
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:23,460
Are you even a person?

807
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,150
How could you hit Seong Ju and do a hit-and-run?

808
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:30,930
- After making Seong Ju like that, were you able to sleep well?
- Oppa!

809
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:34,780
After causing the accident, you thought I wouldn't be able to find you if you ran away to the U.S.?

810
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:37,840
All my life I waited for today to come. Before I die,

811
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:42,040
I wanted to find you and ask you. Why did you do it?

812
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,180
Why did you do that to Seong Ju? WHY?

813
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:48,970
I'm sorry, Oppa. It's true that it was my car...

814
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:51,620
But my car was stolen then. It's the truth!

815
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:54,450
You did nothing wrong, but you ran away to the U.S.?
 Does that make sense?

816
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:59,330
That car was the car Congressman Park bought me so I was worried about getting into a scandal...

817
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:02,290
Are you going to lie until the end?

818
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:06,210
Seong Ju was someone who didn't know 
anything but singing!

819
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:09,870
After she became like that, do you know
 how much pain she had to live with?

820
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:13,460
It's because of you. It's because of you!

821
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,100
How?

822
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:18,680
How can you leave Seong Ju on that cold floor

823
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:21,270
and just run away like that?

824
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:24,520
No, no, no, it wasn't me, Oppa! 
I didn't do that!

825
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:28,840
If Seong Ju was taken to the hospital a bit earlier, 
she wouldn't have lost her voice!

826
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:32,500
Oppa, oppa, believe me, I didn't know.

827
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,580
- I didn't know.
- Let's go!

828
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:37,530
Let's go to the police station 
so you can pay for your crime.

829
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:40,230
- Follow me!
- Oppa, oppa! Oppa! Oppa!

830
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:43,040
Please listen to me, Oppa.

831
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:47,680
Oppa. Please think of my Joon Hyeon and just please...

832
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,330
My Joon Hyeon is a singer.

833
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:54,780
If his mom goes in and out of a police station,
 it's truly  the end for my son Joon Hyeon.

834
01:02:54,790 --> 01:03:01,320
Oppa, please! Please! Please!

835
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:08,040
Please! Please...

836
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:16,850
♬  One step each day , love like a snowflake,  ♬

837
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:22,280
♬  On your name, flowers bloom   ♬

838
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:32,059
♬  Before I knew it, as much as my feelings,
I'm growing to resemble you,  ♬
