 Episode 11 

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,380
Excuse me? Can't I go with you?

4
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,140
I'll go with you! Please wait! Jang Joon Hyeon!

5
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,300
Excuse me!

6
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,500
Jang Joon Hyeon... what should I do?

7
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,820
What should I do?

8
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,820
Guardian, please wait here.

9
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,390
It's not my fault. I didn't do it.

10
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,790
I just wanted Choi Chun Hee to get hurt but why did Oppa Joon Hyeon-

11
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,350
Did Oppa Joon Hyeon see?

12
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,700
Did he see me?

13
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,790
No, he saw me.

14
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,380
We locked eyes ...

15
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,570
What should I do?

16
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,260
Mom, what do I do?

17
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,260
  Current Surgery Status Guide 
 Jang Joon Hyeon in surgery  

18
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,550
Jang Joon Hyeon.

19
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,980
Do you hear my voice?

20
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,630
I'll be here so

21
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,830
don't be scared and get the surgery done well.

22
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,880
Okay?

23
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,260
They say that there was an accident on stage.

24
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,740
Because of that accident, Jang Joon Hyeon got hurt and is in surgery.

25
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,350
Thankfully, Soo In did first-aid well so it seems like he's past the critical point.

26
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,740
What? Soo In did?

27
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,460
Why did she go there? She's not hurt anywhere?

28
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,420
Yes, Soo In is okay.

29
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,680
But more importantly,

30
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,550
there's something you need to see.

31
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,190
It's the concert venue's CCTV.

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,040
Can't you please let me go in?

33
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,650
I need to check and see if he's okay.

34
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,420
He needs to rest right now. No one can go in.

35
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,700
Please, I'll ask you for this favor.

36
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,070
You can't.

37
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,740
Jang Joon Hyeon. You're okay, right? Jang Joon Hyeon.

38
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,190
Jang Joon Hyeon, I'm here. Choi Chun Hee.

39
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,840
- Stop and leave. 
 - Jang Joon Hyeon!

40
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,700
I said leave.

41
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,750
The surgery was safely done.

42
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,020
If something went wrong, it would have been big trouble. But it seems like you gave him first aid really well at the scene.

43
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,030
Ah, yes.

44
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,690
Then... will he wake up soon?

45
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,560
Yes. Thanks to you, he'll recover quickly.

46
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,740
That's a relief.

47
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,890
Then (bye).

48
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,110
The person who has been well known for being a part of the flower-snake incident is not only Shin Hyo Yeol

49
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,510
 but also singer Jang Joon Hyeon as a sacrifi-  

50
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,830
  On the other hand, Jang Joon Hyeon, in order to save Park Soo In,  

51
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,300
 threw his body under the lights falling onto the stage.  

52
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,860
  Jang Joon Hyeon, who sustained a significant head injury,  was immediately admitted into the hospital.  

53
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,340
Hello.

54
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,480
Jang Joon Hyeon's fans sent these.

55
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,550
You can just leave it there.

56
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,740
Keep in there.

57
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,420
Jang Joon Hyeon will definitely wake up for you.

58
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,800
Thank you.

59
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,940
Please let Jang Joon Hyeon wake up.

60
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,460
Then I will do anything.

61
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,550
Please let him wake up.

62
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,880
Oppa.

63
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,280
Where did he go?

64
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,550
Oppa, when did you wake up?

65
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,860
Why did you do it?

66
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,900
Oppa...

67
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,540
I asked why did you do it?!

68
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,300
I'm sorry, Oppa. I just hated Choi Chun Hee but

69
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,060
I didn't think you would get hurt like this. Oppa, I was wrong.

70
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,320
So keep it a secret.

71
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,450
I'm begging you.

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,560
Please, Oppa.

73
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,140
If people know about this, my career is over as a singer.

74
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,370
I'll make sure this doesn't happen again. So

75
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,840
Oppa, please. Just this once, save me.

76
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,830
I was wrong. I was wrong.

77
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,820
Oppa, save me!

78
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,080
Mom.

79
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,540
I have to go up right away.

80
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,430
Oppa can't wake up when I'm not there.

81
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,400
Because he might reveal that it was your doing?

82
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,890
Mom, how did you know that..?

83
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,680
Executive Director Wang brought the CCTV video and I watched it.

84
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,090
Even if you hate Choi Chun Hee,

85
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,220
how could you do that?

86
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,610
I must have been crazy, Mom.

87
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,500
What do I do now?

88
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,170
If Oppa Joon Hyeon wakes up, my career as a singer and whatnot will be over.

89
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,050
What do I do now? Should I turn myself in?

90
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,230
Park Soo In,

91
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,890
the water has already been spilled.

92
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,330
Thankfully,

93
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,210
the situation isn't just bad for you.

94
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,600
Executive Director Wang took care of the CCTV.

95
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,830
We made it so that the media would think Jang Joon Hyeon got hurt to save Park Soo In, the one he loved, so

96
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:10,240
you just need to watch your mouth.

97
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,460
What if Oppa Joon Hyeon wakes up? Then it's the end.

98
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,620
It doesn't matter if he wakes up.

99
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,440
What do you mean?

100
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,380
If we say that we'll release a dating scandal and include Choi Chun Hee,

101
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,480
he won't be able to reveal the truth.

102
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,710
He's the guy that became like this trying to save Choi Chun Hee.

103
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:34,490
You just need to push forward saying you're Jang Joon Hyeon's lover like the media has presented it.

104
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,620
The rest I'll take care of.

105
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,810
Mom.

106
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,600
I hired a bodyguard so you don't need to worry about Choi Chun Hee either.

107
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,000
It's okay, Soo In.

108
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,510
You have me.

109
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,100
- We're not strangers and we're one family so... 
 - I understand, Hyungnim.

110
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,130
Aigoo, hello.

111
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,060
You're working hard even though it's hot.

112
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,450
Are you doing this after having  a meal?

113
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,450
We are all the same family. Yes.

114
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,380
- You can't come in. 
 - Yoo Sik.

115
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,770
Since you're working hard, have a refreshing drink.

116
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,200
You guys are so strict.

117
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,810
Oh! Isn't this the White Bodyguard Company?

118
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,440
Duk Bae?

119
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,290
Oh then Duk Bae must be the president.

120
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,280
Is Duk Bae doing well?

121
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,770
Aiyoo, I'm meeting Duk Bae's employees here.

122
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,900
Listen to me. When Duk Bae and I were young, we were good friends.

123
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,330
Jang Joon Hyeon.

124
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,490
I came.

125
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,200
I'm a little late, right?

126
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,800
I'm sorry.

127
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,750
Get up now.

128
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,630
Let's go home.

129
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,130
I even patted your head.

130
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,110
You said you'll make me laugh once a day.

131
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,100
You promised me.

132
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,180
So let's go.

133
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,530
♬  It's not as if her eyes are pretty, or her nose  ♬

134
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:04,360
♬  is pretty as well.  ♬

135
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:10,400
♬  Why did I come to love you?  ♬

136
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,460
♬  My heart raced at your smiling face  ♬ 
-Wake up quickly  Jang Joon Hyeon.

137
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,670
Let's go home together.

138
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,250
I'm sorry.

139
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,130
I will just stay at the hospital, Mom.

140
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,150
All right. That's better for others to see.

141
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,190
Make sure you eat regularly.

142
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,910
If you do this one more time, we will prohibit you from entering his room.

143
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,980
Just a moment.

144
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,390
Oppa, I'm sorry.

145
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,200
It's all because of Choi Chun Hee.

146
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,870
Oppa, are you conscious now?

147
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,690
Yup.

148
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:29,710
- Oppa
- My head hurts.

149
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,490
Oppa, I'm sorry
 You must be misunderstanding something.

150
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,230
Actually, I didn't do it to you.

151
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,080
- Soo In
- That day

152
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,630
The reporters...

153
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,450
Where did the reporters go?

154
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,800
Reporters?

155
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,480
Medal troublemaker ...

156
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,870
Where is that woman now?

157
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,160
Medal troublemaker?

158
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,990
Because of that woman I got hit in the head.
So annoying.

159
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,530
- What happened to my scandal?
- Huh?

160
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:06,080
Did the pictures get leaked by any chance?

161
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,800
Soo In, hand me the newspaper.
 Okay.

162
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,110
July 28 2014.

163
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,280
July 28?

164
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,340
It's today right?

165
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,010
Today is July 28?

166
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,220
He has dissociative amnesia?

167
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,220
Yes. It's a kind of an aftereffects from the accident.

168
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,950
He can't remember only a certain time period.

169
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,730
Then can his memory come back later?

170
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,480
This is better.

171
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,980
But you can't do anything that triggers his memory back.

172
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,020
Okay?

173
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,100
There's no use.

174
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,020
If he checks the internet, he'll know what's going on anyway.

175
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,790
I told them to take  down all articles regarding Jang Joon Hyeon.

176
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,320
For now, he won't  be able to catch on.

177
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,720
That Seol Tae Song manager guy,

178
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,700
you block his mouth first.

179
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,630
But, Choi Chun Hee won't stay still.

180
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,730
What else could she possibly do 
other than staying  still?

181
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,920
It's already talked about with the reporters.

182
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,500
The Assemblyman scandal will be released.

183
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,560
If that happens, no one will believe Choi Chun Hee's words.

184
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,640
Jang Joon Hyeon woke up, I heard.

185
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,600
Can't I go in for a while?  
 Only little moment will be fine.

186
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,590
If you keep on doing this, we'll call the police. 
Go back

187
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,330
Please I ask of you.

188
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,130
Just a moment.

189
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,510
Choi Chun Hee, for now just go back.

190
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,730
Oppa needs to take his rest right now.

191
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,310
Sunbaenim, I beg you.
 I will leave after I see his face.

192
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,820
I told you that you can't! Don't be like this Choi Chun Hee!

193
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,400
You can't take pictures. You can't take pictures.

194
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,790
Jang Joon Hyeon!
 Soo In!

195
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,950
Hey, Medal Troublemaker, what are you doing now?

196
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,920
Soo In, are you okay?
 Get up and let's go.

197
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,230
I'm okay.

198
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,460
Hey! After everything that's happened, you chased me to here?

199
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,870
Why? After doing that ugly doing you're still up to more?! Huh?

200
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,110
Jang Joon Hyeon, what's wrong?

201
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,020
It's me Choi Chun Hee...

202
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,010
I don't want to know your name.

203
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,720
Get lost right now.
 I don't want to see you.

204
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,610
Jang Joon Hyeon!

205
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,000
You don't remember what kind of relationship we have?

206
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,200
We like each other.

207
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,960
Hey, are you crazy?

208
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,530
The one I like is Soo In.

209
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:07,780
You're a Medal Troublemaker, so can you get out of my sight?!

210
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,230
- Can't you hear? Drag this woman out!
- Yes.

211
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,040
Jang Joon Hyeon! Jang Joon Hyeon!

212
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,520
Jang Joon Hyeon!

213
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,930
Let's go.

214
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,220
It's weird.

215
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,610
Jang Joon Hyeon is acting weird.

216
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,260
He acted like someone else.

217
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,740
It's just because of the accident.

218
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,710
So understand him.

219
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,000
But no matter how much it is.

220
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,230
How can he act like he doesn't know me?

221
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:28,470


222
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,640
  Never-ending Crash is Love Disrupter for Trot's Rookie, Choi Chun Hee! 

223
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,280
Really, are you okay?

224
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,770
Yes, I'm okay.

225
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,860
But, Oppa you must have been shocked.

226
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,730
That woman must be crazy.

227
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,260
She said that you guys like each other, impossible.

228
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,250
When I think of that medal troublemaker,

229
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,410
my heart still beats so fast.

230
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,900
- Can I have an autograph
 - Oh, yes

231
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,590
I'm Jang Joon Hyeon's fan!

232
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,650
I really love Jang Joon Hyeon's song Remember Me.

233
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,530
Remember Me?

234
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,250
Joon Hyeon!

235
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,930
Hyung!

236
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,690
Are you ok? It must have hurt.

237
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,690
You came with empty hands?

238
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,700
I'm sorry.

239
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,880
Where did you go?

240
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,310
Your phone is off and you're driving me crazy!

241
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,440
I'm sorry, but are you okay?

242
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,730
My head just keeps on hurting.

243
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:44,460
- Oh, Hyung, what is the song Remember Me?
 - Huh? Oh...

244
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,680
I'm sorry that I didn't ask you if I could upload it on the internet

245
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,880
but the responses are really good these days.  I think it will make you popular again.

246
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,050
Popular again?

247
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,430
Did I ever fall down before?

248
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,070
You must have gone  crazy.

249
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,500
- What do you mean crazy? 
- Tae Song Oppa.

250
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,690
I'm sorry but can you get a sheet?

251
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,200
Ok, I got it.

252
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,820
They said they'll change the sheet.

253
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,740
Just a moment.

254
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,350
Oppa Joon Hyeon has dissociative amnesia.

255
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,130
What? Then he can't remember a thing?

256
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:35,020
I think he only remembers up to the scandal about him at the hotel with the woman.

257
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,760
So,

258
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,110
so you're going to keep the secret that Oppa fell because of the other scandal. Right?

259
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,230
Why?

260
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,400
Remember someone betrayed him?

261
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,640
Wasn't it you? Tae Song Oppa?

262
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,250
If we  make him remember all those memories,

263
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,100
I think it's  such a cruel thing for you to do, Oppa.

264
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,310
You're right on that...

265
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,200
And, the fact that Chun Hee and Joon Hyeon dated,

266
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,240
don't tell him.

267
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,310
Why do I have to?

268
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,340
Chun Hee is caught up in a bad rumor right now.

269
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,270
But if Oppa Joon Hyeon knows all the facts,

270
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,990
he will run to  Chun Hee.

271
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:21,110
Then Joon Hyeon oppa will fall again 
because of Choi Chun Hee,

272
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,830
and will never be able to make his comeback.

273
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,200
But, that is a bit...

274
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,330
Tae Song Oppa.  Are you going to put Oppa Joon Hyeon  in a  difficult situation again?

275
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,030
Thank you, Reporter Park.

276
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:49,110
Then for the recent accident with Jang Joon Hyeon, you will focus on saying that it was a stage problem, right?

277
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,190
Yes, I understand.

278
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,990
Ju Hee!

279
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,360
M...m...

280
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,530
Oppa Myeong Sik?

281
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,880
Choi Chun Hee is your daughter?

282
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,410
The world is really small. How could this happen?

283
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,560
You really... you should have contacted me earlier.

284
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,530
I didn't know Chun Hee was working with you either.

285
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:27,090
Oh, President Jo Hee Mun is doing well, right?

286
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:32,490
Of course. Well nowadays he's giving his work to his son and is on a brief break.

287
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,110
I heard about Seong Joo.

288
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,890
I heard she passed away from a disease.

289
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,360
Yeah.

290
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:49,060
The person who was a singer couldn't sing,
 so how hard it must have been for her.

291
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,110
Because of that accident, I...

292
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:59,560
You still haven't found out who the accident's hit and run criminal is?

293
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,460
I'm too busy trying to eat and live so not yet.

294
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:10,030
But I will definitely find that person before I die.

295
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,930
I'm going to find them and I won't leave them alone.

296
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,990
Um...

297
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:24,860
It seems Chun Hee is worn out  lately 
because she's been wrapped up in some weird scandal.

298
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,000
Is it really serious?

299
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,670
Oh, that's why you came and found me.

300
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,490
It's all just fake rumors.

301
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:38,420
You know about this field. 
If you get attention, everyone envies you.

302
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,370
It'll pass by shortly.

303
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,520
Right?

304
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,250
I was worried.

305
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,280
But since you're the director, 
take care of her well. You can do that, right?

306
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,830
Of course! She's your daughter.

307
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,970
If Oppa Myeong Sik finds President Jo Hee Mun

308
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,850
and makes things bigger, what do I do?

309
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,570
Choi Chun Hee!

310
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,390
Choi Chun Hee's concert has been completely cancelled.

311
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,560
Because of the scandal, it seems like it will be hard for Choi Chun Hee now.

312
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,780
It can't be for now.

313
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:24,200
When you destroy something, you have to destroy it so that it can never stand up again.

314
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,840
Then...?

315
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:30,370
Release the Assemblyman Pyo's scandal.

316
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:44,220
On the day of the accident, what happened?

317
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,750
I'm still the President,
 so I should know.

318
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:57,130
I planned to meet Oppa Joon Hyeon on stage, 
but the set fell.

319
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,710
Is that all of it?

320
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:09,110
I saw it on the internet news. 
Jang Joon Hyeon got hurt while trying to save you

321
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,450
and it said that the two of you were dating. 
What are they talking about?

322
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,870
- When did the two of you have that type of relationship? 
 - We're not. It's not like that.

323
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,260
So...

324
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,350
Anyway, I understand.

325
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,480
It was an opportunity for me.

326
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,960
I want to continue singing.

327
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,600
If I wanted to escape the drinking and driving incident,

328
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,630
there wasn't anything else but to use the situation.

329
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:56,030
You probably won't be able to understand me.

330
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,850
What are you looking at with such interest? 
Have articles about me appeared?

331
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:12,990
What is this? Singer Choi Chun Hee is in that type of relationship with Mr. P?

332
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,630
Who's Choi Chun Hee?

333
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,740
That girl. The one that said you two liked each other.

334
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,140
What? She became a singer?

335
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,510
That medal pain in the ass girl?

336
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,130
Trot singer.

337
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,460
She's going really far.

338
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,890
Aiyoo, pain in the ass.

339
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,660
Where did you go? Did they say they'll let me be discharged?

340
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,630
They said you can be discharged within this week.

341
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,160
What about your head? Is it okay?

342
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,050
It was okay but because of that medal pain in the ass girl it seems like my head hurts even more.

343
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:50,280
Hyung, make sure that girl can't come near me, okay?

344
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,380
Yeah. I understand. Don't worry.

345
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,850
Tae Song.

346
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,070
- Oh.  Chun Hee.

347
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,780
Does Jang Joon Hyeon recognize you?

348
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,300
Ah... well... you see..

349
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,950
Does he recognize you?

350
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:25,490
If he recognizes sunbae Soo In and you,
 why can he not recognize only me?

351
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,630
Something's gone wrong.

352
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,690
Choi Chun Hee, there's nothing that's gone wrong.

353
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,210
Let's talk for a moment.

354
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,640
What are you saying?

355
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,570
What do you mean don't show up in front of Jang Joon Hyeon?

356
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:49,050
Nowadays, you know that oppa's music is really popular, right?

357
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,960
It's noisy because of your dating scandal and

358
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,940
it's because I think you'll hold on to Oppa who has barely succeeded.

359
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,450
That scandal is not true.

360
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,640
Whether it's true or not, you're inflicting problems on oppa.

361
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,050
Sunbae-nim. Why are you like this to me?

362
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:10,730
Recently, you showed  me a picture saying you hope that Oppa and I hit it off well. But why are you now...

363
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,070
I was briefly wavering at that time.

364
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:18,480
So I left Oppa but after he collapsed, I realized

365
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,890
how precious a person he is to me.

366
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,670
Sunbae-nim.

367
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,290
The spot that I left, you just shortly held it.

368
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:37,260
Whether it's the accident or dating, 
just forget it all and go back to your place.

369
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,610
What's the reason for not telling the truth?

370
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:51,020
The day of the accident, the person Jang Joon Hyeon tried to save wasn't you but me. You know that.

371
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,860
Sunbae-nim.

372
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,540
That's probably how you want to believe it, Choi Chun Hee.

373
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,870
My ukelele...

374
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,720
You should have been careful. The strings came off!

375
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,840
But you won that by lying anyway.

376
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,740
During the family cooking competition, you brought someone that isn't a part of your family and you lied!

377
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,030
He is a part of our family!

378
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:34,490
My mom said not to play with you because you're a liar.

379
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:37,660
She said your sister is a liar and a bad person.

380
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,570
- She (my mom) said that because she does bad things she's always on the news.

381
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,320
My sister isn't a liar.

382
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,170
Kids! Wasn't what I said correct?

383
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:48,520
You're a liar. So her sister is also a liar, right?

384
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,300
Of course!

385
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,410
You really... do you want to get hit?

386
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,750
Yes, Coach.

387
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:06,790
Chun Hee, there's big trouble! 
 Byeol is gone!

388
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,180
Pardon? Byeol is?

389
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:14,040
Byeol. Byeol!

390
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,450
Suk, have you seen our Byeol by any chance?

391
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,650
Byeol? Well about that...

392
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,160
a little earlier with some kids...

393
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,780
Byeol...

394
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,290
Byeol. Byeol.

395
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,870
Byeol. Byeol! Byeol!

396
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:38,410
Byeol! Byeol!

397
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,630
Byeol! Byeol! Byeol!

398
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,810
Seriously. Where are you? Byeol...

399
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:54,830
Where have you gone, Byeol?

400
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,300
Don't worry.

401
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,860
Byeol...

402
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:04,970
- Byeol!
- Byeol.

403
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,330
- Byeol! 
- I'm here, Unni.

404
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,250
Byeol! Hey.

405
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,060
Where did you go? Do you know how worried I was?

406
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,270
I'm sorry.

407
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:22,550
Byeol, why is your face like that? Did someone hit you? So did you get hit and come here?

408
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,060
What do you mean get hit?

409
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:30,000
If I'm like this, what do you think happened to the kids?

410
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,730
The kids kept bad mouthing you.

411
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,800
So I smashed them.

412
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,720
Her mom...

413
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,540
might come to find you.

414
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,430
I'm sorry, Unni.

415
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,830
It's ok.

416
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,720
No, it's okay, Byeol.

417
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,920
But...

418
00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:00,050
you should have punished them lightly.
 Did you trash them?

419
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,220
But it's still ok.

420
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,990
Aigoo...

421
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,680
Ugh, look at that...

422
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,750
But Unni,

423
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,690
do people hate you now?

424
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,450
They don't listen to your music anymore?

425
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,130
No.

426
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:31,140
It'll be over quickly.

427
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,070
Ah Byeol, I got good news.

428
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,180
I paid all of dad's debts!

429
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,770
Really?!

430
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,590
So Dad can come back now?

431
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,500
Of course! Dad will come back soon.

432
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,260
Wow!

433
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,700
So, you don't have to worry about anything.

434
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,780
Alright, Unni!

435
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,380
Cheers!

436
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,530
One shot!

437
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,730
How does it feel to be back home?

438
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:30,150
I'm back at my own house. What do you mean how do I feel?

439
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:33,860
Oh right, here. It's the same, as it was.

440
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,620
It's the phone you lost during the accident.

441
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,360
Alright.

442
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,470
But where's my guitar?

443
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,930
Guitar? I don't know.

444
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:44,400
You know I can't do anything without my guitar.

445
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,340
Where did I put it?

446
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,250
Come in.

447
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:18,940
Look at the wallpaper colour.

448
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,820
It's the same.

449
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:37,390
What happened last time at the hotel's parking lot, 
we took care of it.

450
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,270
You just need to sing.

451
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,530
Ah, and one more thing.

452
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:48,000
You losing your memory of some months,
 this is a secret.

453
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,010
Since you are doing well, 
no need for people to know.

454
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,060
Oppa, you didn't get to meet the new president did you?

455
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,450
Do I have to?

456
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,190
Oh!

457
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,280
Hey, what are you doing? 
 Why are you here?

458
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,400
You chased me all the way here?

459
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,360
Oppa, Choi Chun Hee is in our company.

460
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,150
What!?

461
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:26,330
Soo In, why didn't you tell me?

462
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,130
Ugh. After looking at her,
 my head is starting to hurt again.

463
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,550
What's with the stare?

464
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,050
Can't you turn your head away?

465
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,960
She's a nuisance.

466
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,190
Shine Star is at it's end too.

467
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,250
Let's go, Oppa.

468
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:01,890
 A Nose Dive  For Trot Singer Choi Chun Hee 
Because Of A Scandal With An Assemblyman. 

469
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,740
Yes?

470
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,710
Ah yes, Jang Joon Hyun. Have a seat.

471
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,560
First time meeting you.

472
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,050
First?

473
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,100
Why are you staring like that?

474
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,090
It's interesting.

475
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:33,670
Ah... Right, you said it hasn't been long
 since you've started to work here.

476
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:38,190
Yeah, well when everyone looked at me, the god of music,
 for the first time, they were amazed.

477
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:44,130
They say my face is as small as a fist, 
that I wasn't like a human.

478
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,620
Why are you laughing?

479
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,800
Nothing.

480
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,960
I heard you were President Jo Hee Mun's son.

481
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,420
So, where's President Jo?

482
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,720
He's on vacation.

483
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,050
So I'm here for an year.

484
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:09,050
Ah, so since you didn't know anything, 
you signed up that kind of person.

485
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,930
What do you mean, "that kind of person?"

486
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:16,180
That Choi Chun Hee or whatever,
 the one that sings trot.

487
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:21,340
She's the worst of the worst fan ever.

488
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,930
She chased me everywhere.

489
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,230
She came in Shine Star because of me.

490
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:31,330
If you leave her like that, she might do something. 
So kick her out now.

491
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,680
If I hadn't been in the hospital, I could have...

492
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,460
Jang Joon Hyun, you should mind your own business.

493
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,120
I'll handle Choi Chun Hee.

494
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,710
Eh?

495
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,860
What a strange rascal.

496
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,330
What is he?

497
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,370
I'm going to go crazy because of that psychopath.

498
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,000
Here have some gum.

499
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,040
Why? Does it taste bad?

500
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,500
It's your favourite brand.

501
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,370
Hundred percent organic, with reduced sodium.

502
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:28,030
That's why it's bland.

503
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:36,650
The weather is real nice.

504
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:39,960
If you dry laundry in this weather,
 it'll dry really fast.

505
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,790
 But, we can try this, right? 

506
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,900
 It really tastes like lettuce. 

507
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,960
Unni, what are you doing?

508
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,610
Byeol, today isn't it.

509
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:22,100
Shall we pick the lettuce at another time?

510
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,050
Sure.

511
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,440
Unni,

512
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,600
we can only see Ahjussi on TV now?

00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:12,770
♬  smiling at me and comes together with me is you.  ♬

519
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,830
You should've just given it to the cleaners.

520
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,790
You just have to push a button, why would you do that?

521
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:20,600
And buy me a fan, I like the breeze of the fan.

522
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,500
♬  Living only a day I will love like that and  ♬

526
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,890
♬  I must be in love with you   ♬

527
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,750
I did something I should be praised for!

528
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:19,130
This is the only thing I can do for you.

529
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:23,880
Now I'll brew tea for you everyday.

530
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:32,990


531
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,110
 Don't fight with the piano, 

532
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,990
 and use less power in your fingers ok? 

533
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:01,460
 What could be, what could be 

534
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,340
 the same? 

535
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:12,590
 Joon Hyeon and Chun Hee are the same. 

536
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,600
 You saw, right? 

537
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:33,200
Soo In, when did you put this here?

538
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,310
Huh? I didn't put it there.

539
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,840
You didn't?

540
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,130
It's still pretty warm.

541
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,800
Wait.

542
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,340
Don't drink this, Oppa.

543
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:54,340
You don't even know who gave this to you.
 It could be poisoned.

544
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,710
Could it be?

545
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,300
How's Byeol?

546
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,550
She fell asleep while doing homework in her room.

547
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,590
Thank you.

548
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,880
Did you eat these days?

549
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,500
What's wrong with your face? It's gotten too rough.

550
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:22,250
Oppa, that singer.

551
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,450
What singer?

552
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:28,400
The one who got in between Park Soo In and Jang Joon Hyeon.

553
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,510
The one who got into a scandal with the Assemblyman.

554
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,400
Scandal?

555
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:38,450
No it's not. With that face?

556
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,790
- Excuse me...
- Hey!

557
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:45,330
Did you see it? Did you see it?

558
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:48,150
You're probably saying anything because you have lips but,

559
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:51,600
do you want me to say anything with my lips as well?!

560
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,270
Just eat your food.

561
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:57,340
What is this? What kind of place is this?

562
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,740
Oppa, let's go.

563
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,640
Let's go.

564
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:10,800
I'm sorry Unni. I just got really mad.

565
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,070
No it's ok. You did well. Our food is a waste to that kind of people.

566
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,010
Aihoo.

567
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:38,220
Drink this for now. Drink this and cheer up.

568
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,550
Yes.

569
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,000
Your fate or my fate...

570
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,800
- Why are you laughing?
- I get to do what I want.

571
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,900
Huh? You're cool.

572
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:12,130
♬  I got tired while missing you  ♬

573
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:17,390
♬  I got tired while crying  ♬

574
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:26,070
♬  Like a red flower petal  ♬

575
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:34,300
♬  My heart has a bruise  ♬

576
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,090
Encore! Encore!

577
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:40,210
Hello.

578
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:43,000
Aigoo.

579
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,920
It's hard these days, right?

580
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:56,860
You know, back then I worked in the music field.

581
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,250
Really?

582
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:04,180
I probably told you that there was a singer I liked back then.

583
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:08,110
It was a singer, I treasured very much.

584
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:13,090
But when danger came, I just left her to give up.

585
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:15,460
That's ...

586
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:21,600
That's what I regret to this day.

587
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,920
You must have really treasured that person.

588
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:36,700
You're not by any chance thinking of giving up singing 
because of this, are you?

589
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:44,180
Do you think that person regretted giving up singing as well?

590
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:52,300
I think she probably did.

591
00:45:53,300 --> 00:46:01,460
Well, my mother missed singing very much as well.

592
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,840
It feels nice seeing your face from the morning.

593
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,590
I want to work.

594
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:20,200
No matter how small the stage is, 
 as long as I can sing, it's fine.

595
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,580
If you can get an engagement  for me, 
I  will do my best.

596
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:35,300
" Trot singer, Choi Chun Hee's performance "

597
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:42,680
♬  Whether it's a thousand years or a hundred years  ♬

598
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,450
Get out! Come down!

599
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:52,720
How dare you shamelessly show your face in front of us and sing?

600
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,090
Come down! Huh?!

601
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,130
I'm getting mad.

602
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:07,400
♬  It's spicier than a pepper  ♬

603
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:18,090
President! Why are you here?

604
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:20,880
I came to see you.

605
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,460
Did you see everything by any chance?

606
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,130
Yes, unintentionally, I did see it.

607
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,550
But what should I do? I have to go to my next stage right now.

608
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,570
Ah, about that..

609
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:40,240
it got canceled. There was a call to the company.

610
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,840
Ah. Ok.

611
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:48,000
- Let's go. For one day, play with me.
- Excuse me?

612
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,300
I know you have a lot of time.

613
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,000
Let's go. Go.

614
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,850
You should help out.

615
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:12,810
When you're having troubles mentally, 
using your body is the best.

616
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:16,440
You said you were a marathon runner. 
You'll probably know better.

617
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,420
If you were not good at teasing, 
at least you would be less hateful.

618
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,080
- Step on it!
- No more.

619
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,590
Wow, it's really sweet.

620
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:32,670
Since you used all that strength, 
you should replenish the sugar (in your system).

621
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:35,600
I purposely asked for extra caramel syrup.

622
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,900
But it's going to take time before the performance starts. 
What should we do while waiting?

623
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,250
Should we play a game?

624
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:47,850
Ah, the "Dagger" game.That was fun.

625
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:50,170
Right here?

626
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:52,800
Who cares? As long as it's fun for us.

627
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,460
Let's do it.

628
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,090
Here. I'll go first.

629
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:12,300
You laughed, you laughed.

630
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,750
You laughed.

631
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,210
I'm not going easy on you.

632
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,450
Last time you hit me way too hard Choi Chun Hee.

633
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:20,840
Come here.

634
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,000
Move your hand.

635
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:30,420
I'm sorry for crying.

636
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,300
My heart hurts too much.

637
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:41,080
It  hurts but,

638
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,990
it hurts.

639
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:50,830
I'm sorry.

640
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:30,020


641
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:53,260
There's someone here tonight that I'd like to make laugh.

642
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:56,120
I dedicate this song to her.

643
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,220
And music!

644
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:20,270
♫ You seem more sad today, so I feel down as well. ♫

645
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:28,240
♫ My worries directed towards you don't seem to stop,
what shall I do with my heart? ♫

646
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:35,980
♫ That wind that grazed you,  approaches me as well. ♫

647
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:43,770
♫ Heady and deeply your fragrance makes my heart full. ♫

648
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:51,630
♫ My heart is boiling hot hot, burns away all your sadness. ♫

649
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:59,330
♫ Oh please take my heart in, I want to see you smile. ♫

650
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:06,220
♫ Oh please take my heart in, I like the look of you when you smile. ♫

651
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:11,190
That Medal Troublemaker Girl, she had been poking around everywhere and finally found one (a guy).

652
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:15,570
President that bugger sure has a strong stomach.

653
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,370
Oppa, let's get out of here.

654
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:31,980
♫ Tonight you look so beautiful.  When you appear sad, ♫

655
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,550
♫ if I pretend to be cool sweeping my hair to the side, ♫

656
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,390
Thank you so much for many things today.

657
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:48,680
Especially your song was...

658
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:51,110
Ah, well, you know...

659
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:54,190
I want to hold on to you longer but am letting you go in early.

660
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:55,540
Bye.

661
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,490
Drive home safely.

662
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:59,430
Hey, Choi Chun Hee.

663
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:01,760
It's boiling hot hot.

664
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,470
Go on then.  Be safe.

665
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,620
What brings you here at this hour?

666
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,600
Pass me a glass, please.

667
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:43,870
Here you go.

668
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,180
I blame you, President.

669
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:01,160
If it weren't for you,

670
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:04,930
no, if you would have liked me just a little,

671
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,490
things wouldn't have progressed this far.

672
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:18,000
How I came to be here, and to where I need to head,
... I just can't tell.

673
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:30,610
This is NOT why I did it.

674
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,850
I don't know how to resolve this...

675
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:37,160
There's no way out of this!

676
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,230
In the end, what I caused has become the shackle (ball &amp; chain)

677
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:48,520
that wouldn't allow me to approach you either.

678
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:56,850
In a word, I'm being punished.

679
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:10,010
Aig...

680
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:12,510
Gah... you surprised me.

681
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,750
Seriously!

682
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:23,750
What happened?

683
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:24,420
About what?

684
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,200
I mean regarding Choi Chun Hee.

685
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,750
There seems to be some rumors surrounding her.

686
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:30,480
The Choi Chun Hee I know isn't a person like that.

687
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:33,080
Perhaps.

688
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:37,720
That's my sentiment as well, but...

689
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:43,410
By the way, why is Jang Joon Hyeon staying mum?

690
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,760
I think he lost his memory

691
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,070
as aftereffects to his accident.

692
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:48,880
Um... What?!

693
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:59,190
Okay, then what about you?

694
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:03,360
It's not bad for me.

695
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:06,760
You raised me as a businessman.

696
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:10,500
Whether it be work... or love.

697
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,990
What are you doing?

698
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:36,250
Is it you again?

699
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:45,110
Has it been you all this while?

700
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:58,160
Did you... put laxatives in this?

701
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,130
Or potassium cyanide?

702
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:03,460
What?

703
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:18,750
There.  Are you satisfied?

704
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,300
Have you been enticing men with stuff like this all along?

705
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:29,010
Seriously lame.

706
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:33,630
Hey, maybe Assemblyman Pyo and the president may
be enticed by something like this,

707
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:36,720
it will never work on me, you see?

708
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,020
What's this?

709
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,270
Are you trying to cry?

710
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,940
What's that about?

711
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,480
Geesh, It feels kind of crappy...

712
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,100
Hello.

713
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,130
Welcome.

714
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:30,800
Ah, Jang Joon Hyeon.

715
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,190
I called you in regards to the medallion necklace.

716
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,360
Ah, yes.

717
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,670
You said you'd be proposing on stage then wouldn't
pick it up, so...

718
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,260
I wondered whether something was going on with you.

719
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,730
Propose?

720
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,500
It's because of your accident, isn't it?

721
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,890
You were fortunate that the   caused you no further harm.

722
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:02,390
M.J?

723
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:06,580
I guess M.J. is Park Soo In's real name?

724
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:14,720
♫  Please remember me. ♫

725
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:21,590
♫  I'll always be behind you.  Please remember me.   ♫

726
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:25,450
♫  Like a fool that doesn't even know how to give up.  ♫

727
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:31,960
♫  You, even if it's you,that kind of you.   ♫

728
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,400
♫  I love you whom I can watch over like this.   ♫
