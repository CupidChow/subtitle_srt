1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,910
 Episode 13 

2
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,770
Seriously, it's falling off again.

3
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,300
It became loose because you threw  it away.

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,620
Seriously...

5
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,650
Give it to me.

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,630
Tilt your head.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,020
Is it done?

8
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,740
But, about the mermaid princess yesterday...

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,450
Did it really end like that?

10
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:03,600
From what I know, the mermaid doesn't turn into bubbles and then leave.

11
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,820
What can she do since the prince doesn't remember?

12
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,580
Then how would you like it to end?

13
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,710
Me?

14
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,050
Hey, the boat arrived, so come quickly!

15
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,470
People are waiting. Let's go.

16
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,660
About the mermaid princess...

17
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,810
I remember how it ended.

18
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,740
How did it end?

19
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,890
At the moment the mermaid princess 
was about to become  bubbles,

20
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,160
the prince's memory

21
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,220
came back.

22
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,990
Isn't this how the fairy tale is supposed to end? 
Happy ending.

23
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,010
Don't people know how to end a story?

24
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,610
Soo In, when did you get here?

25
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,670
- Just now.
- Let's go.

26
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,600
Are you okay?

27
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,910
Yes. I'm sorry for making you worried.

28
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,220
- No, let's go.
- Yes.

29
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,150
That's right. It's not the end yet.

30
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,690
Park Soo In, get a hold of yourself.

31
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,410
- Be careful.
- Yes.

32
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,590
President!

33
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,070
Let's have a dinner together.

34
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,460
And I have something to say too.

35
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:26,600


36
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,560
Let's eat.

37
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,760
Did you find what you lost?

38
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,730
Yes.

39
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,820
What is it that you hurried back?

40
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,280
It's all because of the hairpin you bought her.

41
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,610
If you're going to give a girl a gift, make it more expensive,

42
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,160
how cheap of you.

43
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,020
Okay, eat.

44
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:12,240
What? Is it your first time seeing a person eating lettuce?

45
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,670
Perilla leaves are also good.

46
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:18,080
President, I said I had something to say, right?

47
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,390
Joon Hyeon and I are getting engaged.

48
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,700
I think the president should know.

49
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,500
We're not going to reveal it to the media, 
and we'll try to do it quietly.

50
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,560
Yes, well... That's something to be congratulated on.

51
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Congratulations.

52
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,280
Did I make a mistake by talking about our engagement?

53
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,560
Sorry for not telling you about it, and doing it my way.

54
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,700
No, it's okay. Let's go.

55
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,640
♬  With a half squeezed tube of toothpaste,  ♬

56
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:16,680
♬  and atop of messy blankets. I see you smiling.  ♬

57
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,750
You're going home, right?

58
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,170
No, I'll go to the practice room.

59
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,630
I think it would be best if you rest at home.

60
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,460
I'm okay. Don't mind me.
 ♬  Please remember me  ♬

61
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,790
You don't need to be like this in front of me.

62
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,550
Do what you want. Don't hold it in.

63
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:47,210
♬  Even though you're a fool who doesn't know how to give up.  ♬

64
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,760
♬  Even if that's you.  ♬

65
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,560
♬  I  love you,  ♬

66
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,110
 Joon Hyeon and I are engaged.  
  ♬  whom I can watch over like this  ♬

67
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:07,930
♬  When I stop walking and tears suddenly fall.  ♬

68
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,300
♬  Even though things were that hard.  ♬

69
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:21,200
♬  Like the day you first stepped towards me.  ♬

70
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,060
♬  Please remember me.  ♬

71
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,680
♬  I'll always be behind you.  ♬

72
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,930
 Joon Hyeon and I are engaged.  
 ♬  Please remember me.   ♬

73
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,460
♬  Even though you're a fool,  ♬

74
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,700
 I found it!  
 ♬  who doesn't know how to give up.  ♬

75
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,140
♬  Even if that's you.  ♬

76
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:48,300
♬  I can still look at you.  ♬

77
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,740
This was found in the accident site, isn't that yours?

78
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,550
- Oh, Hyung.
- Where are you now?

79
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,770
I'm going to take my phone 
to the repair shop, but...

80
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,070
No, I will go there myself.

81
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,670
I think it will take some time 
to recover the video files.

82
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,590
When it's all repaired, we'll contact you.

83
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,140
He's not here.

84
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,930
 Dear customer, hopefully you found our service satisfying. 

85
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,770
 We will contact you when the cell phone has been repaired. 

86
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,420
  Thank you. 

87
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,350
He's getting his phone repaired?

88
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,400
This is his cell phone...

89
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,440
No way...

90
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,030
- You came?
- You were here.

91
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,020
Pick out our engagement place.

92
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,430
This is a popular place, but it's a bit too common.

93
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,890
What? He took it already?

94
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,210
Jang Joon Hyeon already came to pick up the phone.

95
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,600
Are you alright?

96
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,510
Why haven't I thought of the cell phone?

97
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,740
If Oppa checks the cell phone, it will be the end.

98
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,610
In it, it probably has photos of the two together, and everything!

99
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,330
- What do we do? What do we do now? 
- Calm down.

100
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,740
The engagement is right in front of us.

101
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,150
I will take care of the cell phone.

102
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,900
You trust me right?

103
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,600
 Lee Hwa Soon 
LA address: 6407 Orange St. Los Angeles, CA
 Phone number: 1-325-936-5133 

104
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,770
Hello?

105
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,170
Is it Hwa Soon? It's me,  Yang Ju Hee.

106
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,100
Yeah, it's been a while.

107
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,650
Did you hear?

108
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,790
Joon Hyeon and  Soo In are getting engaged.

109
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,470
Oh my, you didn't know?

110
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,480
These are the albums that Shine Star produced.

111
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,490
A sort of the Hall of Fame?

112
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,760
Wow.

113
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,100
Pick something.

114
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:49,230
See if there are any albums that can become role models for you.

115
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,410
How about if you make a ballad album?

116
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,360
Yes?

117
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,500
You don't have to just sing trot.

118
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,910
Just think about it. There are many opportunities.

119
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,390
Oppa!

120
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,950
Oh, Soo In.

121
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,620
The invitations for our engagement party came out.

122
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,200
Who are the people that you are going to invite who are at Shine Star?

123
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,220
I'm going to ask Mom first.

124
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,300
Chun Hee.

125
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,950
Our engagement party is this Monday.

126
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,990
You can come, right?

127
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,950
No...

128
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,720
How about if you sing at our engagement party?

129
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,470
This way, we can smooth over the rumors about us three.

130
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,750
- Soo In. 
- I have an event to go to that day.

131
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,140
I'm sorry.

132
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,440
- About what? 
- For asking you if you could sing at our engagement party.

133
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,430
Are you happy?

134
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:46,620
There isn't a reason why I shouldn't be happy.

135
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,130
Then, that's enough.

136
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,400
Invitations are mostly sent and the dress shop will call me one day before trying on...

137
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,750
Soo In.

138
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,370
Yeah?

139
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,740
Don't misunderstand my words and listen.

140
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,930
Before the engagement, 
there is something I have to check.

141
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:25,110
So can we delay the engagement?

142
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,100
- Oppa! 
- Well,

143
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,880
- there isn't another reason. 
- Did you get a new woman?

144
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,330
What?

145
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,930
Tell me honestly.

146
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,550
That's not it.

147
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,040
Then it's fine.

148
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,280
Oppa,

149
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,630
You suddenly got into an accident, and you lost your memory.

150
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,930
You must be confused nowadays.

151
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,490
Let's just try harder a little more.

152
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,480
And,

153
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,620
Thank you.

154
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,850
You saved me on the performance stage. 
I'll never forget that.

155
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,080
I wanted to tell you that for a long time.

156
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,920
What is all this?

157
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,930
Son!

158
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:34,660
Son! Son, my son! Have you been well?

159
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,740
Mom, how did you come?

160
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,460
What do you mean?

161
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,190
How can I  not come when you are getting engaged? Yang Ju-

162
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,470
No, Soo In's mother called me.

163
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,330
My cool son.

164
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,460
Aigoo, my awesome son!

165
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,770
How long has it been, Hwa Soon? You are still the same.

166
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,680
I'm always the same.

167
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,040
But you aged a little.

168
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,970
We are pretty old now.

169
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,370
We?

170
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:09,350
There are people who think that I'm in my 20s in America.

171
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,850
Mother, it's been a while.

172
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,000
Do you remember me?

173
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,480
Soo In.

174
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,790
We only met when you were much younger.

175
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,680
You grew well and became very pretty.

176
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,860
Thank you.

177
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,150
But which side is going to buy the house?

178
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,800
- House? 
- The house that these kids will live in after marrying.

179
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,240
If you want a son-in-law like Joon Hyeon, shouldn't you at least be come ready with a house?

180
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,680
 Soo In 

181
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,400
 Are you happy? 

182
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,220
Today, Jang Joon Hyeon and Park Soo In are going to have their engagement today.

183
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,510
What?

184
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,370
Jang Joon Hyeon and Park Soo In?

185
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:28,090
As you asked, I also checked 
what Director Yang is involved in.

186
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,740
Yes.

187
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,280
You have to go to your owner now.

188
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,470
Yes.

189
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,070
At least you have to stay near Jang Joon Hyeon.

190
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,790
I will miss you.

191
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,410
Aigoo, it was here.

192
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:46,290
  I promise that I will find your guitar later
-Chun Hee- 

193
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,580
Oh, CEO Jo?

194
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,090
How are you here?

195
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:09,720
Choi Chun Hee and the Assemblyman's scandal was your doing?

196
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,990
What?

197
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,400
Choi Chun Hee is a singer that I raised.

198
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,570
But how can you be stabbing her in the back like this?

199
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,580
What is the reason?

200
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,070
I don't know what you are trying to say.

201
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,050
I don't know what you heard from somewhere else,

202
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:31,480
Is it because you found out that Choi Chun Hee is  Seong Ju's daughter?

203
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,750
I am indebted to Oh Seong Ju.

204
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,070
Until Choi Myeong Sik comes back, I am going to take care of Choi Chun Hee.

205
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,600
I warn you.

206
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,820
If you touch Choi Chun Hee one more time like this,

207
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:49,510
Then I'm not going to leave you alone.

208
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,840
Yes, Director Wang.

209
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,390
CEO Jo just came by.

210
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,050
Saying that he knows about Choi Chun Hee.

211
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,260
It's fine.

212
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:15,090
If this turns out wrong, we can take care of Choi Chun Hee completely.

213
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,980
Yes,

214
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,090
Mr. Jang Joon Hyeon?

215
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,290
Someone wants to give this to you.

216
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,360
This... who gave this to you?

217
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,870
Some girl came here and told me to deliver it to you.

218
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,520
- Girl?
- Yes.

219
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:05,300
♬  After turning and turning around a while    ♬

220
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:11,910
♬  At the moment we were facing each other  ♬

221
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:16,440
♬  I hesitated to say what you were looking forward to  ♬

222
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,830
♬  and I just smiled  ♬

223
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,620
Choi Chun Hee?

224
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,180
Choi Chun Hee! 
♬  Like a passing shower  ♬

225
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:36,720
♬  You are the person who entered into and shook my heart,  ♬

226
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,870
♬  One step each day , love like a snowflake,  ♬

227
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,710
Choi Chun Hee!
♬  On your name, flowers bloom   ♬

228
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,070
Choi Chun Hee
♬  Before I knew it  ♬

229
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:56,250
♬  As much as my feelings  ♬

230
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,830
Chun Hee!
♬  I'm growing to resemble you, ♬ 

231
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,450
♬  I guess this is love.  ♬

232
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,960
Choi Chun Hee!

233
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,050
Choi Chun Hee!

234
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,240
Choi Chun Hee!

235
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,100
Have you come to your senses?

236
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,580
Choi Chun Hee...

237
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,810
Where is Choi Chun Hee?

238
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,240
She is asleep. She will wake up soon.

239
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,170
Once she's stabilized, she'll be fine.

240
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,410
Both of you guys don't have to worry.

241
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,140
 ♫ I want to say I love you ♫ 

242
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:37,220
 ♫ Fret myself like this. ♫ 

243
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,770
 ♫ What if  ♫ 

244
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,960
 Choi Chun Hee,
♫ you were to leave? ♫ 

245
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:51,250
 I'm sorry. 
♫  We who are only worrying always like fools.  ♫

246
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,860
Are you ok?

247
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,170
I am a little late, right?

248
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,530
This is yours, Choi Chun Hee.

249
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:51,440
Joon Hyeon. Oh my gosh, Joon Hyeon, Joon Hyeon!
 Joon Hyeon!

250
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,860
Oh my, oh my. Son, son.

251
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,770
Son, they said you were in an accident.

252
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,660
Don't worry. I 'm okay.

253
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,000
Oppa are you really okay?

254
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,750
Yes.

255
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,460
But how do you know I'm here?

256
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,830
I called earlier, and the nurse answered.

257
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,290
But Oppa who do you have to meet 
so that you hurried to go outside?

258
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,300
Oh?

259
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,860
A friend who came from far away was just going to leave,

260
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,200
so I went looking for that friend.

261
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,630
But because of me the engagement got ruined. What do we do?

262
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,320
Is that the problem right now?

263
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,690
We can set another date for the engagement. 
 Right now, we need to get you treated, Son-In-Law.

264
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,660
Ah, anyway that's a relief.

265
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,000
Some people were not aware that you were in an accident, and when you didn't show up...

266
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,390
they made a huge fuss.

267
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:39,940
It's a relief, relief. Ah, My son.

268
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,590
Anyhow, It's never good to be involved with Yang Ju Hee.

269
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,510
The last accident on the stage is like that 
and this accident is like that too.

270
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,300
What's wrong?

271
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,630
Well, long time ago that accident Seong Joo had was also...

272
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,650
What kind of accident was there in the past?

273
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:04,500
No, son. Nothing.

274
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:17,340


275
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,290
 Now that my Son-In-Law is feeling better, 
we should proceed with the engagement. 

276
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:29,040
 You saved me at the concert hall. 

277
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,980
 I'll never forget it. 

278
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,560
 If things don't go as planned, 

279
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,010
 let's use this opportunity to get rid of Choi Chun Hee for good. 

280
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,620
Do you just wake up now?

281
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,530
You're looking for the person who was brought in with you, right?  The singer, Jang Joon Hyeon.

282
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,600
Was he badly hurt? Is he ok?

283
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,810
He went home earlier.

284
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:36,030
Since both of you are okay, it's really lucky.

285
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,480
Ah, yes.

286
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:46,980
You disloyal guy, how could you just leave first?

287
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:53,310
So what? He's okay so that's a relief.

288
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,490
  Missed Call
Pretty Man 

289
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,280
It seems like you're going to give it to your girlfriend.

290
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,860
Who is it?

291
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,000
It's the president!

292
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,820
Here, a present for you.

293
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,360
It's sweets. It must be delicious.

294
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,200
Oh, why? You don't like it?

295
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,300
That's not it.

296
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,140
But this is a bribe.

297
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,610
I'm a very fair person.

298
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:57,850
I'm going to stay neutral between you and Ahjussi.

299
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,900
I will never do anything that goes against my principles.

300
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,720
Oh, you had that kind of problem.

301
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,310
Oh, I see.  Than what about this?

302
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:12,420
You eat this candy now... and later when that ahjussi gives you candy, you eat that too!

303
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:16,670
Then that's fair.  Not accepting anything is fair,

304
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:20,100
but so is accepting both, right?

305
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,750
Oh, yeah!

306
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,020
Here, take it.

307
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,780
What?

308
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,620
Seriously, adults... you shouldn't kid around with food.

309
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,310
I thought it was really sweets.

310
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:42,870
The real sweets are here.

311
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,640
- Is it delicious?
- Yes

312
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,450
This is for Chun Hee, chocolate.

313
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,530
Wow! Chocolate, I really like chocolate.

314
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,370
No, you can't eat this, Byeol.

315
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:04,870
This has bitter alcohol in it, 
it's only for adults to eat.

316
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,980
Alcohol?

317
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,400
Chun Hee must be tired.

318
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:15,680
Give this to her so that she can eat this deliciously, then have a  sweet and deep sleep.

319
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,960
I understand what you're saying.

320
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,950
Why?

321
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:35,800
It feels like my opponent voluntarily walked out in the middle of the game.

322
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,620
Jang Joon Hyeon engagement didn't even start.

323
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,690
- What?
- They're going to set a new date.

324
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:45,080
Anyway, you...

325
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,890
need to pull a little harder.

326
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,410
That's why I am saying this.

327
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:53,520
I'm going to give you a chance to act like my father properly this time.

328
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,680
What?

329
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,670
 Noonim, I'm sorry. 

330
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:12,050
 Because of a moment of passion, I'm not able to face you. 

331
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,550
 From now on, I'll just be watching you from afar. 

332
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,900
- Tae Song!
- Welcome, Pil Nyeo.

333
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,090
Unni, have you been well?

334
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:27,170
Since you went on the trip, your face looks better.

335
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:31,970
It must be obvious, my skin and mood are so good.

336
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,030
So, you even went on vacation together...

337
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,050
you're officially a couple now!

338
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:41,070
We are officially a couple!

339
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,080
Noonim!

340
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,780
- I- it tastes good.
- Okay.

341
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,520
Let's eat together.  Why are you eating alone?

342
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,050
Order one more here.

343
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,160
- I'm done, I'm done.
- But there's still a lot left.

344
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,220
But it's not.

345
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,110
- Goodbye.
- Unni, I'll be going!

346
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,690
Where are you going?

347
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,360
He's bashful.

348
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,260
Hello.

349
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,060
I'm your number one fan.

350
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,150
Hello.

351
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:22,520
You look much prettier when you smile,

352
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,700
but why does your face look like you're carrying all the sadness in the world?

353
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,080
To get your energy up, should we have a fan meeting?

354
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,880
- Fan meeting?
- Yes.

355
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,600
Hi!

356
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,840
What, are you worried because it looks like an expensive place?  Do you think I'm going to ask you to pay?

357
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,340
Oh, no, no, that's not it!

358
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,980
I was just kidding.

359
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,910
Over here.

360
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,550
President, what are you doing here?

361
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,560
I planned it with my father.

362
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,160
Fath... this person

363
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,540
is your father... President Jo Hee Mun?

364
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,170
Father.

365
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,550
Oh my goodness!

366
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,720
There are so many things I'm curious about!

367
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,550
I heard that the one who asked Jang Joon Hyeon to raise me as a singer... was you.

368
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,510
How did you know about me?

369
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,760
The one who first raised your mother as a singer was me.

370
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,000
That... happened when I first started Shine Star.

371
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:40,360
Oh, then... when you told me about the person who quit singing, that was about my mother?

372
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,190
Yes, you're right.

373
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:47,010
Your mother was... a really great singer.

374
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,540
Then did you know about this as well?

375
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:56,100
What?  No, I just found out now.

376
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:01,240
Father, Choi Chun Hee must sing so well 
because she takes after her mother.

377
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,680
That's right.  Whenever I see Choi Chun Hee,

378
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,280
I suddenly see her mother's image.

379
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,720
The dream that your mother couldn't accomplish, why don't you accomplish it instead, Choi Chun Hee?

380
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:28,250
 Mom, I want to become a fabulous singer like you. 

381
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,750
 You're going to help me concentrate on singing only, right? 

382
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,440
 I miss you. 

383
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:57,880
 Timing and .

384
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:13,930
  Byeol? 

385
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:19,250
 Is this where Choi Chun Hee- 

386
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,430
 Why would you come to my house? 

387
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,650
 Hey, Choi Chun Hee. 

388
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,960
 If something like that happens again, don't step in. 

389
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,120
 If you need to step in, then call me. 

390
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,430
  - You! I'm just going to!
--Good riddance! 

391
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,790
 Don't you think about the person who cooked the meal, and is waiting for you at home? 

392
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,130
 Hey, I'm sorry! 

393
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,720
 - Let's go.
- Okay. 

394
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,460
What is it?

395
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,120
You left my guitar, didn't you?  Why did you do that?

396
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,740
That's something you left when you were my manager.

397
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:58,380
You're saying I left it with you?  I definitely left it with the new president-

398
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,410
What?

399
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:05,960
What I'm saying is... it's not inexpensive, so there'd be no way that I'd leave it with you.

400
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,660
I don't know your situation.

401
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,250
Anyway... what happened to the engagement?

402
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,030
We're going to pick a new date.

403
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,840
That's good.

404
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:22,910
You, how could a girl just jump in like that?  What if you caused a bigger incident?

405
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:27,900
That face that isn't even pretty would be something to look at if it gets scarred also.

406
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,060
Did you come here to say that?

407
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,790
It's not that...

408
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,870
Ah, it's hot!

409
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,340
What is this?  Why won't it rotate?

410
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,130
The rotating part is broken.

411
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,860
In the middle of summer?  Really.

412
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,220
You have all sorts of problems.

413
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,890
Really...what a trouble maker.

414
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,860
 For the big one use six sheets! For the little one use four sheets! 

415
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,030
I'm leaving.

416
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,680
You called me last night, didn't you?

417
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,680
- Yes.
- How did you know my number?

418
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,500
I asked Tae Song.

419
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,660
Why did you call me?

420
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,680
Well, that...

421
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,080
was to say thank you.

422
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:46,630
For yesterday... thank you.

423
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,730
I'm leaving.

424
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,700
 Thank you, Choi Chun Hee. 

425
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,400
 For saving me... and for getting my guitar back. 

426
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,370
What is this?

427
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:21,530
Our singer can't be used like recycling!
Why do they want you to take the job Park Soo In threw out?

428
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,790
And all of a sudden, for a homeless shelter?

429
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,340
Isn't that right, Hyungnim?

430
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:29,740
People like that, they don't know how to be grateful.

431
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:34,690
The people without conscience, "plant" them all!

432
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:41,220
Chun Hee, what do you think?

433
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:45,160
I want to do it.

434
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:51,560
I'm thinking of my dad...  because if they listen to my song 
and are happy, then it'll give me strength.

435
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,040
Okay, good.

436
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,340
Hyungnim, then this time again, we'll be... dancers?

437
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:01,410
Of course.  How could we not dance?

438
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,000
Isn't that right, Ji Sook?

439
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,770
Now that I think about it, you are really amazing, Cheol Man.

440
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:09,900
You're Chun Hee's manager, and even her backup dancer...

441
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,630
Isn't this what you call a "multiplayer"?

442
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:15,530
Ahhh...  Multiplayer...?

443
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,210
Hey, Chun Hee, don't worry about the chorus.

444
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:23,030
Tae Song, this time we should practice for sure.

445
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:27,680
We need to match lips, like this and that, we need to match lips.

446
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,090
Oh, you're all like endorphins to me.

447
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,790
I thank all of you.

448
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,960
Tae Song.
- Yes.

449
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,990
Pil Nyeo.

450
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:50,360
P-P-Pil Nyeo.

451
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,670
P-Pil Nyeo!  Pil Nyeo!

452
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,580
You did well, right now!  Your vocalization came from the back of you head.

453
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,360
Now the vocalization is done,

454
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,750
For trot, the feel is important.

455
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,350
I'm Na "Feel" Nyeo, so listen to me.

456
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,230
♫ Since the beginning ♫

457
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,240

Give them a variety of foods.

469
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,450
Please take good care of me today!  Big Uncle, please say a word!

470
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,780
We're really, really going, okay?

471
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,320
Let's do our best, seriously, for real.

472
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,280
Start!

473
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,980
Choi Chun Hee, Choi Chun Hee, fighting!

474
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:11,350
- Fighting!
- I'm really nervous!

475
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,960
Hello, I'm the singer, Choi Chun Hee.

476
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,240
To commemorate this event, I will sing "My Way".

477
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,060
Be quiet!

478
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,170
It's hard enough to make a living,

479
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:30,260
- can't we just eat in peace?
- That's right, let's just eat!

480
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:34,960
Father, you're having a hard time, aren't you?

481
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,600
Making a living was really hard for me also,

482
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:43,130
but songs really give you strength.

483
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,770
If you give me just three minutes of your time,

484
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:50,950
I would like to be a small strength to all of you who have had a hard time today.

485
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,310
Would it be okay if I sing just one song?

486
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,310
Thank you.

487
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:58,220
Then, I will sing "My Way".

488
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:18,780
♫ I thought I came from too far away ♫

489
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:23,480
♫ but I have nowhere to look back ♫

490
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,710
♫ I felt I went up so high ♫

491
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:33,150
♫ but I have nowhere to look down. ♫

492
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:38,160
♫ At first, I didn't have any fear ♫

493
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,730
♫ Before I knew it, I became a coward. ♫

494
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:47,590
♫ Anyone can fall down once ♫

495
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:53,100
♫ I just can't sit on the ground and stay here. ♫

496
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:57,670
♫ The way I have to go. Until I'm tired out ♫

497
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:02,840
♫ Stand up and strike once again.  ♫

498
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:07,320
🎵♫  Anyone can fall down once  ♫

499
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:12,650
♫ 🎵 but you can't just stay down.  ♫

500
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:16,970
♫  On this road I need to go down, until the day I fall  ♫

501
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:21,920
♫ Stand up and strike once again. ♫

502
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,990
♫🎵My way! ♫

503
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:40,310
Choi Chun Hee!

504
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:43,230
Choi Chun Hee!

505
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:49,010
 Dongboo Hospital 

506
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,880
 Is this Mr. Choi Myeong Sik? 

507
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,870
Yes,

508
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:56,910
that's right.

509
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,320
You pushed back the date of your surgery last time, right?

510
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,780
When do you want to set your surgery date?

511
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,110
Ahh,

512
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,430
I don't think I'll be able to have surgery.

513
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,100
I'm sorry.

514
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,760
This time you can't be missing the surgery.

515
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,740
Choi Myeong Sik... Choi Myeong Sik

516
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:30,000
Joon Hyeon, I brought your guitar 
from the ceremony hall.

517
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,120
Wow.

518
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:36,140
Oh! Jang Joon Hyeon.

519
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,130
Did your memory come back?!

520
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:40,900
Woo hoo, that's great!

521
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,190
Aah, Joon Hyeon. It's too bright. Wow, it's great!

522
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:46,310
How can you smile? Kneel.

523
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:56,800
I'm sorry.  I really committed an unforgivable sin.

524
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,050
An unforgivable sin?

525
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,170
What?

526
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:05,450
Handing me over to Kim Wu Gap, or

527
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:10,710
not telling me about Chun Hee when I had forgotten everything.  What do you think is the biggest sin?

528
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:15,080
Th-The second one?

529
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,640
Forget it.

530
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,470
You need to do something for me, Hyung.

531
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:20,600
W- what?

532
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:26,110
About me getting my memory back, keep it a secret for now.

533
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:28,940
If Director Yang finds out, I don't know what she'll do to Chun Hee.

534
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:33,050
You can keep my secret, right?

535
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:33,990
Okay.

536
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:37,530
If you betray me this time, you're dead.

537
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:42,570
I just... was told it would be better for you if I did that.

538
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,600
Oppa.

539
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,660
You haven't been out of the hospital for long. 
Is it okay to work this much?

540
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,830
Soo In.

541
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,220
Just  a moment.

542
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:11,070
There is something I want to ask you.

543
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,820
W- What is it?

544
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:20,390
That day, the day of the accident.

545
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:23,370
Why were you on the stage?

546
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:28,250
That wasn't your stage, it was Choi Chun Hee's.

547
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,220
Ah, about that...

548
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:35,690
I went to cheer on Choi Chun Hee , she's my hoobae (junior).

549
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:39,480
Since no one was taking care of her, I thought I would do it.

550
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,470
That's how it was.

551
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:47,190
But, I keep getting strange thoughts.

552
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:55,030
That someone else was the target that day, but I got hit instead.

553
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:57,230
By chance...

554
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:00,860
Maybe Choi Chun Hee was the target.

555
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:06,070
O-Oppa, I... really don't want to remember what happened that day.

556
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,790
When you got hurt, I was so scared, Oppa.

557
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:11,900
Scared if something terrible might happen to you...

558
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:16,370
To me, it's important that you're safe, Oppa.

559
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:21,560
If someone was targeting Choi Chun Hee, at least it's a relief.

560
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,680
The person I love.

561
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:32,070
If they were targeting you, I won't let it go.

562
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,490
I will pursue them until the end.

563
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:45,790
Come in.

564
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,700
Welcome, what's going on?

565
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,810
I came to see you.

566
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,150
Really?

567
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:05,600
Then, should I also call Soo In?

568
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,970
And eat together later.

569
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:11,430
More than that, I have something to tell you.

570
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,770
Tell me.

571
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:16,240
There's something that's bothering me.

572
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,790
The accident last time.

573
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:23,440
I was a bit doubtful so I went to the theatre's office.

574
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,940
But their security camera footage from that day was stolen.

575
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:31,880
My cellphone that was sent to be repaired...

576
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:34,910
went missing as well.

577
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,850
And?

578
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:42,340
I guess I have to find out.

579
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:49,400
Your body isn't that great, are you sure you're not overdoing it?

580
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,140
I'll look into that matter from now on.

581
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:57,550
No... I have a temperament that can't hold  my curiosity back.

582
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:01,500
So I'm going to pursue it until the end.

583
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:09,210
But, about that.

584
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,900
What you're talking about.

585
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:17,830
Why are you telling me?

586
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,030
What do you mean why?

587
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:25,890
We're about to become family, and family members share everything.

588
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:28,800
Are my words wrong?

589
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,930
Of course, you didn't say anything wrong.

590
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,910
Mom, oppa is acting weird.

591
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:40,300
You're right.

592
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,110
He keeps digging around that day's events.

593
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:44,020
Oppa went to you as well?

594
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,570
Perhaps his memory returned, but he's pretending that it hasn't?

595
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:48,960
Just stay still for a moment.

596
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,180
Let's figure out the order of things... what the first priority is.

597
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:03,770
My Byeol, when will she... she's here.

598
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:14,770
Hey!

599
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,890
So you're the one that hit my little sister?

600
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:26,560
You coward, how could you call your sister?

601
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,890
This girl, I would just...

602
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:29,210
Has no shame.

603
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,960
Do you want to get a beating from me?

604
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,700
A girl that has no shame,

605
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,920
do you wanna get beaten by me?

606
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,720
Ajusshi!

607
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,220
Who are you?

608
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,510
Are you not going to let go?

609
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,430
Let go!

610
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:43,400
You let her go first.

611
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:51,390
Ahjussi, don't interfere and

612
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:52,830
get going.

613
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:54,410
How annoying.

614
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:57,520
You, the one who just spit out the chewing gum, pick it up now.

615
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,020
What's he on about?

616
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:01,280
This man, seriously!

617
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:03,880
I don't know what you are doing right now.

618
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:08,870
Hey, who are you?

619
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:11,440
Just who are you?  

620
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,730
I'm...

621
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:20,140
I am the music god, Jang Joon Hyeon.

622
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:24,230
Oh my, Oppa, are you, are you really Jang Joon Hyeon?

623
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,470
Daebak daebak, hit me, hit me.

624
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:32,040
Oh my, this is not a dream! What to do?

625
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,850
Kids?

626
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:36,810
Me and Byeol are family but,

627
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:39,550
it seems you bear a grudge against her.

628
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:42,390
No, no, no, Oppa, what grudge?

629
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,550
It's my first time seeing such a cute kid.

630
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:50,230
My little sister and Byeol are really close.

631
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:51,150
Right?

632
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:55,080
In that case, you'll continue being close in the future too?

633
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:59,450
- Hurry up and answer!
- Yes...

634
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,900
I can't believe it!

635
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,550
Would you like to have my autograph?

636
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:10,010
Yes yes YES!

637
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:11,120
Would like to take a picture?

638
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,210
YES!

639
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:14,900
Is it tasty?

640
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,440
Yes, it is.

641
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:22,250
- Byeol, about today...
- Shhhh.

642
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,860
I know that too. Keep it a secret from Unni?

643
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:27,430
Secret.

644
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:29,840
- Ok.
- Ok, ok.

645
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:32,350
- Bang. 
- Bang!

646
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,490
- Bang bang!
- Bang bang bang!

647
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,140
Choi Myeong Sik?

648
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,950
It's been a long time since I saw him.

649
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:45,040
Is anybody in there?

650
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:00,960
Father.

651
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:04,430
Father, are you alright?

652
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,480
Aigoo.

653
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,470
It's okay. It's hot, hot, hot, be careful.

654
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:26,610
Thank you!

655
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,270
You haven't eaten yet?

656
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,560
That's what I am saying.

657
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,240
I told him we should just eat anything, seriously, Hyung.

658
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,120
I, now, with our Ji Sook,

659
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,990
If it's not that beef bone broth that you've cooked all night

660
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:40,520
to make blood sausage soup,

661
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:44,120
no matter what I eat now, it doesn't really feel like I've eaten.

662
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:46,580
Check please.

663
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,320
- Yes. 
- Stay seated.

664
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,510
Yes, I am coming.

665
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:55,090
You two had the meal together?

666
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:57,500
11,400 won, please.

667
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,160
Goodbye.

668
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:17,060
Father, are you awake now?

669
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,710
To solve my debt issue,

670
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,360
I searched for those swindlers 
and went as far as the East coast.

671
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:44,080
But after getting beaten to almost death 
by those guys,

672
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:49,080
when I woke up, I was in the hospital.

673
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:53,550
They said I was diagnosed with colon cancer.

674
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:57,980
And the days I have left to live...

675
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:01,660
Are only six months...

676
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,290
I couldn't go back home empty handed.

677
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,100
Before I die,

678
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,630
I wanted to leave my kids money even if it's a tiny amount.

679
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,180
so I started a cleaning job.

680
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,130
But my wretched life,

681
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:27,100
I'm still alive.

682
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:40,790
When I was in elementary school,

683
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:45,020
after I came back from school...

684
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,870
my father had passed away.

685
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:56,070
"I shouldn't have gone to school."

686
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:01,030
"Even if it was just for one hour,

687
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,410
I should've stuck to my father's side."

688
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:10,680
I don't know

689
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,290
how long I have regretted that.

690
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,770
Father.

691
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:26,870
Chun Hee had a hard time recently because of absurd scandals.

692
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:30,720
I will go back to Chun Hee soon.

693
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:36,100
Before that, can't you protect Chun Hee?

694
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,580
Even if it's just one hour more.

695
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,040
Yes.

696
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,610
President.

697
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,540
Hello.

698
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:03,420
I heard you performed at the homeless shelter?

699
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,700
Yes.

700
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,700
I went there as a volunteer activity, but

701
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,000
everybody was so good to me.

702
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,810
The shelter responded well.

703
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:13,080
Our company decided to support it from now on.

704
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,190
Really?

705
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,080
That turned out great.

706
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:20,520
Oh, and this time when I went there to perform,

707
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:23,470
I realized a really important fact again.

708
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:27,250
Congratulating happy people,

709
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:29,560
comforting sad people,

710
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,900
the music which makes people happy regardless of ages or gender

711
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,050
is trot.

712
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:39,280
Well, I think trot suits me after all!

713
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:43,710
I'm most happy when I can sing trot.

714
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:47,020
That's why,

715
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,330
that ballad album we talked about...

716
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:50,860
Understood.

717
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:52,550
Let's not do it.

718
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,410
As expected.

719
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,340
Thank you.

720
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,030
Choi Chun Hee.

721
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:16,200
The patient that came with Jang Joon Hyeon that day was Choi Chun Hee.

722
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,000
Did his memory came back?

723
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,870
Or did he fall in love with Choi Chun Hee again?

724
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:32,090
How can we figure that out?

725
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:34,690
Just do what I ask you to do.

726
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,770
Go get changed, 
and I'll fix you something really quick.

727
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:42,260
Yes.

728
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,860
Unni.

729
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,760
My ukulele's string is now fixed.

730
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,850
Did you fix it, Unni?

731
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,800
No.

732
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,440
The fan is rotating!

733
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:07,210
Oppa. I really like this.

734
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:10,910
This is for me, right? Since there is "MJ" right here.

735
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,520
Or not?

736
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,480
Oppa, what's wrong with your face?

737
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:24,040
I am disappointed in you.

738
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,670
Huh?

739
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:35,420
I wanted to give it to you in a proper way.

740
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:38,500
I wanted to see your surprised face.

741
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,770
Is that why you are mad?

742
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,550
Sorry Oppa, what should I do?

743
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:49,320
Just kidding.

744
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:52,180
Ah, what a great taste I have!

745
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:54,750
It fits perfectly for our Soo In.

746
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:57,230
Ah, seriously.

747
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:23,020
  You are here just in time! 

748
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:25,170
 Please fix the broken string on my ukulele! 

749
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:26,970
 It's broken. 

750
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:28,450
 In this one summer. 

751
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:30,460
 Hey, it's dangerous! 

752
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,530
I'll drink it well, you piece of gum.

753
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:27,970


754
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:52,940
♬  After turning and turning around a while   ♬

755
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:58,680
♬  At the moment we were facing each other  ♬

756
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:06,630
♬  I hesitated to say what you were looking forward to  ♬

757
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:10,340
♬  and I just smiled.  ♬

758
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:19,600
I am back.
♬  Like a passing shower  ♬

759
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:23,780
♬  The person who entered into and shook my heart,  ♬

760
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:31,870
♬ One step each day, love like a snowflake. ♬

761
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:37,210
♬  On your name, flowers bloom.  ♬

762
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:42,860
♬  Before I knew it, as much as my feelings  ♬

763
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:47,280
♬  I'm growing to resemble you,  ♫

764
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,464
♬  This must be love.  ♬
