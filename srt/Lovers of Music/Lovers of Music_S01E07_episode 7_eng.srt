 Episode 7 

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,580
Did I have a phone with me?

3
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,760
 Your father is with us right now. Understand that if you don't come right now, 

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,870
  you might never see your father's face again!
715-3 Daegeumri, Pyeongcheongmyeon Gapyeongoon, Gyeonggi Province 

5
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,540
 On Air 

6
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,160
-Please be careful not to make any broadcasting accidents. 
- Got it.

7
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,950
Hey, Choi Chun Hee!

8
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,420
Hey!

9
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,260
Hey! Choi Chun Hee!

10
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,840
Taxi!

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,680
- Taxi! 
- Are you crazy?

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,240
- You're about to go on live in 5 minutes, where are you going?
- My dad is in danger.

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,090
What are you saying?

14
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,420
I need to go to my father!

15
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,170
Taxi!

16
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,410
Let's go quickly after the show. If you don't go in for the live show, it's the end.

17
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,410
If I don't go right now, I might never be able to see my father.

18
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,380
Oh, taxi!

19
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,870
Hey, Choi Chun Hee!

20
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,300
Dad!

21
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,510
- Dad!
- Ahjussi!

22
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,110
I'm here. Father!

23
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,780
Dad!

24
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,380
Dad!

25
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,280
 Choi Chun Hee
  

26
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,130
You said that you talked about your dad on television, right?

27
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,810
Yes.

28
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,210
I think someone was just messing with you with text pranks.

29
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,550
Text pranks?

30
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:17,480
There are always people who play pranks on people on TV in pitiful situations.

31
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,140
Then, we'll be going back.

32
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,050
But still, you should try to look for him. 
How could you just leave?

33
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,170
We'll contact you once we track down the origin of the text.

34
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,430
Ahjussi!

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,010
They said they would contact you.

36
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,130
How do you know if it's really a prank message?
 What if my dad really was taken?

37
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,460
What do I do if my dad is really captured by them?

38
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,210
That won't happen.

39
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,080
Hello?

40
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,600
Oh, Chun Hee. It's Dad.

41
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,130
Dad?

42
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,300
I saw your album.

43
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,370
I also saw you on TV.

44
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,190
I was very surprised.

45
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,300
That you've become a singer like your mom.

46
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,390
Dad...

47
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,040
Where are you now? I'll go there.

48
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,960
Later. I'll call you again later.

49
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,710
Instead, Dad is always...

50
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,440
watching over you and Byeol.

51
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,980
Don't forget that I'm watching over you guys.

52
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,720
Okay?

53
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,230
I'll call you again.

54
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,380
Dad? Dad?!

55
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,410
Was it really your father?

56
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,150
You can catch your breath now.

57
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,810
That's right.

58
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,210
It's a relief.

59
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,780
How dare she not show up for the broadcast?

60
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,210
Do you think this broadcast was a joke? Besides, it was a live show!

61
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,400
What would have happened if Park Soo In didn't fill in?

62
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,520
This is absolutely an indefinite broadcast ban.

63
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,010
I asked you to put her in this program,

64
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,160
I have nothing to say for myself since things turned out this way, Chief.

65
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,440
Either indefinite broadcast ban or something else, we will leave it to you.

66
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,650
Did you perhaps pick Choi Chun Hee for broadcast on purpose?

67
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,460
Then were you the one who tricked her too...?

68
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,720
Just pretend that you don't know anything and stay still.

69
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,130
An indefinite broadcast ban?

70
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,120
Yes.

71
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,510
I was so embarrassed because the Chief was so angry.

72
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,170
Well, we can't blame him 
as Choi Chun Hee didn't show up for the live show.

73
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,950
Please let me explain what really happened, PD.

74
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,760
A rookie has something to say after not showing up on a  program?

75
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,180
I'm sorry, PD.

76
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,080
How come these trot scraps are so arrogant.

77
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,660
Hey. What did you just say? 
 (in informal speech) 

78
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,820
Trot singer what?

79
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,350
Don't you sing trot songs when you go to a noraebang?

80
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,210
- What did you say, you bastard?
- I'm not a bastard, but you are!

81
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,170
Hey, stop. I'm sorry, PD.

82
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,280
Hey, listen carefully.

83
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,780
There is no one in this broadcasting station 
who will accept you guys, got it?

84
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,460
Hey, don't do it.

85
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,540
 A rookie has something to say after not showing up on a program? 

86
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,480
 There is no one in this broadcasting station 
who will accept you guys, got it? 

87
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,320
I mean, it was definitely on sale yesterday.

88
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,440
But when I went today it was double the price, double the price.

89
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,770
Such swindlers.  If I knew, I would have bought them earlier.

90
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,750
I lost the opportunity.

91
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,670
I know, that's what I'm saying! I could have bought it for half price if I bought it yesterday.

92
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,320
It's such a pity about the money.

93
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,740
It doesn't come easily.

94
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,960
What did I do?

95
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,420
I think I was really crazy.

96
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,530
Isn't there something you want to eat?

97
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,650
What happened yesterday was not a pro-like way to handle a situation.

98
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,000
I mean, who would not run out after receiving a text like that?

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,270
In any case, isn't that being unqualified as a singer?

100
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,110
What?  Qualification?

101
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,960
Hey...

102
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,100
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,550
I will try to block your removal from the company.

104
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,740
You said that trot singers have to stand on stages instead of tv programs.

105
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,520
Since broadcasts will be difficult for now, you should do some live events.

106
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,170
Yes.

107
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,960
What did the new President say to Choi Chun Hee?

108
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,090
He is planning to send her to perform on stages at events.

109
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,720
Stages at events?

110
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,410
I can't stand on the same stage as her.

111
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,270
Isn't she the one who didn't come to the program?

112
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,600
Ah, yes, about that...

113
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,820
Kids nowadays have no standards.

114
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,770
I can't stand things like that.

115
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,050
So, get out immediately.

116
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,860
Oh, Ma'am, can't you let it go for once?

117
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,230
- I will work really hard. 
- Ma'am,

118
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:12,380
there was a reason for not being able to make it to the show at KBC.

119
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,700
Are you going to make me repeat my words?

120
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,730
- What are you doing, Manager? Take them out immediately.
- Yes.

121
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,220
- Please go out.
- Ma'am ... 
- Ma'am, can't you just let it go once?

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,550


123
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:54,120
What happened to you two? 
Your faces look tired.

124
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,030
We were kicked out today even before standing on the stage.

125
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,960
Choi Chun Hee, in the past, did you qualify after every national tournament?

126
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,130
There are times when you fail, too.  
Not a big deal.

127
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,990
You two should eat? Let's eat and regain strength.

128
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,660
Tae Song!  Please bring some soup rice here.

129
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,590
- Oh, what should I do?
- What?

130
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,520
Tae Song?

131
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,300
What should I do? Aish.

132
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,930
Why are you here?

133
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,900
Are you saying you want me to eat the soup rice served by your dirty hands now?

134
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,300
Hey! Joon Hyeon, I did wrong.

135
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,000
Here, hit me until you feel better.

136
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,940
W- Wait!

137
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,340
It's ready.

138
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,310
I'm right handed.

139
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,180
President Kim Wu Gap of Midas said 
that he would make me a singer.

140
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,460
But, but, (for that, I had to hurt) you...

141
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,830
Back then, I might have been crazy.

142
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,300
Kim Wu Gap, that jerk!

143
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,800
I'm the stupid one to fall for his trick.

144
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,630
Joon Hyeon, I am really sorry.  Can't you forgive me this once?

145
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,250
I want to go back to you.

146
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,410
I'm good at being a manager. I just heard that you were forced to leave the stage.

147
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,680
I can find a stage at an event for tomorrow.

148
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,130
- Unni, are these things  what you received after singing? 
 Yup.

149
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,350
She should get money after singing. 
What is this?  Driving me nuts...

150
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,190
Of course this is a place that Tae Song suggested.

151
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,980
Why, I like it!

152
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,650
You would like it.

153
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,280
Aigoo, I needed a new pair of slippers anyway!

154
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,320
Does it fit?

155
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,140
He can't be a nobleman. 
 (Korean expression for "speaking of the devil") 

156
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,480
What?

157
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,950
 You know, as for Miss Chun Hee, 
do you want her to participate in a TV program? 

158
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,560
Don't you know that we are banned from performing in a program?

159
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,630
 It's not a main channel, but a cable channel. 
What do you think? 

160
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,240
Cable? What program is it?

161
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,540
 I don't know exactly, but they were in a hurry. 
They are filming it tomorrow. 

162
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,770
What? Tomorrow?

163
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,750
Wow, Unni is going to Gangwon-do to film a TV show.

164
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,590
Ai, it's just a broadcast in Yuson.

165
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,080
Don't say that! It's still a broadcast, right?

166
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,900
No matter what you do, just try your best.

167
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,020
Do well!

168
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,220
Money is spent by someone else (Chun Hee's father), 
but I'm even letting you use my car.

169
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:17,110
Hey, we will get our money back when she becomes successful.

170
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,040
- That's right, Hyungnim. 
 - Let's go Yoo Sik.

171
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,010
Fighting!

172
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,890
Here, Jang Joon Hyeon!

173
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:26,590
You better fill up the gas when you come back.

174
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,530
Aren't you going to drive?

175
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,670
I don't know how to drive.

176
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,370
You were driving when I first saw you.

177
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,610
I never drove out of the parking lot.

178
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,300
Let's go!

179
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,010
Shall we?

180
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,940
Soo In, let's eat.

181
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,720
Oh!

182
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,800
What's that?

183
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,200
Did you go to an amusement park?

184
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,500
No, let's eat.

185
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,160
So Soo In...

186
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,110
President,

187
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:58,780
this Sunday, I'm planning to have a party as my thirtieth anniversary of my singing career.

188
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,370
You will come right?

189
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,520
Yes, I understand.

190
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,080
Mom, a while ago, I...

191
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,790
Why do you have that?

192
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,870
You, you like the new President, right?

193
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,470
- No, it's not like that.
-  You can fool a ghost.

194
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:24,290
Then what is this hair band and the picture that you took at the amusement park?

195
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,720
Mom, you even looked into my cell phone?

196
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,150
Yes, the new President is not a bad choice as your partner.

197
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:38,270
The tiger cub should be on your side.

198
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,140
Isn't that right?

199
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,400
How many times did we go around this neighborhood?

200
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,650
Did I get on the wrong road?

201
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,440
It is around here.

202
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,440
 You arrived at the destination. The navigation system is ending. 

203
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,880
Is that trying to fool me?

204
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,600
Why?

205
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,520
Welcome.

206
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,860
You came to find a pension, right?

207
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,040
Yes.

208
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,890
Even if you're hungry, please wait a bit.

209
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,570
I should lead the guests first.

210
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:36,560
How can you be so impatient, alive or dead?

211
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,330
Just go in, it's that room.

212
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,230
But, Grandmother, we made a reservation for two rooms.

213
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,980
The other room that I have is drying bean paste, 
so you can't use it.

214
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,220
What are you going to do? Are you going to leave or stay?

215
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,860
We'll stay.

216
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,340
It's bigger than I thought.

217
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,460
Hey but isn't that grandmother a little bit weird?

218
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,260
No one is here but she talks to herself.

219
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,850
Why did you make a reservation at a place like this?

220
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,580
This place was the cheapest out of all the places that I called. It seems fun.

221
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,170
Fun? What is?

222
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,170
Why?

223
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,030
Are you scared?

224
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,810
Scared, scared of what?

225
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,160
There's no electric fan in places like these.

226
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,120
Hey, I need to clean myself up because I feel dirty.

227
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,650
Let's go together.

228
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:35,320
Then I, who am a singer, will clean up first.

229
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,630
It seems like someone is outside the window!

230
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,380
The window?

231
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,460
Hey!

232
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,470
Hey, Jang Joon Hyeon, you're watching well right?

233
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,800
What are you doing? The door is opened!

234
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,130
Close the door.

235
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,010
Just do it quickly and get out.

236
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,720
Don't look! If you look you're dead.

237
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,760
Dream on! Even if you ask me to look, I won't.

238
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,670
What do you take me for? 
You've got nothing for me to look anyway.

239
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,870
I have many things to look at.

240
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,100
Liar!

241
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,850
Hey, finish your bath quickly and come out!

242
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,310
Just wait a little more.

243
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,110
If you don't come out in 3 minutes, I'm leaving.

244
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,830
I don't know, I don't know.

245
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,060
Hey, don't look at me!

246
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,730
Are you crazy? Aish!

247
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:10,520
By the way, what about food? This is the memorial day food my husband ate, do you want some?

248
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,980
Memorial day food?

249
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:18,330
- But Grandmother, is today Grandfather's death anniversary?
 - Yes.

250
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,880
You must miss him a lot.

251
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,060
Why would I miss him?

252
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,850
That rotten old fool, 
I feel relieved that I can't see him.

253
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:32,560
You must have loved each other a lot.

254
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:38,780
In all that long time, I never remember him saying something nice to me.

255
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,090
He probably wasn't like that on the inside.

256
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:45,210
All men are like that. My dad is like that too.

257
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,930
Still,

258
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:54,230
I used to like his singing.

259
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,710
Grandmother, I know how to sing too.

260
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,370
Should I sing a song?

261
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,010
- Do it. 
- I will do it.

262
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:14,200
♬   Even if anyone lives with a smile in this world,  ♬

263
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,710
♬  Even if they live with a hidden story,  ♬

264
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:28,130
♬  I also have sad stories  ♬

265
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:35,190
♬  I just stand in front of you blankly.  ♬

266
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:42,330
♬  When will I open my heart and loudly,  ♬

267
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:49,680
♬  And cry about it loudly?   ♬

268
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:56,650
♬  Something that was buried because of that fact that I am a man,  ♬

269
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:06,610
♬   That life was too long.   ♬

270
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,550
Are you sleeping?

271
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,280
Are you really sleeping?

272
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,920
Because of you, I... seriously...

273
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,530
What kind of woman are you...?

274
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,540
Byeol, sleep well.

275
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,180
That girl, really.

276
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,810
Argh, how many times did I get bitten?

277
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:31,040
You should've slept in the room. 
Why did you sleep outside?

278
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,990
Hey, with a man in the same room, 
how could you fall asleep?

279
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,530
When did I say you're a man?

280
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,640
Then am I a woman?

281
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,990
See,

282
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,740
you get nervous.

283
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,920
I'm a man, right?

284
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,880
I'll go and freshen up.

285
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,790
Welcome, President.

286
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,060
Congratulations on the 30th anniversary 
of your debut as a singer.

287
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,550
Thank you, President.

288
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:39,570
This is just to have a meal within a circle of friends, so help yourself.

289
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,270
Yes.

290
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,690
President,  drink some wine please.

291
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,920
I will do that.

292
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,620
Wow!

293
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,610
Now that I look at it, your daughter and President Jo Geun Wu are looking pretty good together.

294
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:54,720
If you take this opportunity to have him 
as your son-in-law, that would be great!

295
00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:00,760
If so, that would be great for me because I have 
a good relationship with President Jo Hee Mun.

296
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,750
I don't know how our new President would feel, though.

297
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,670
Director Yang!

298
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,750
Omo! Teacher, why are you here?

299
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,860
As for the last time, thank you. 
I was going to call you.

300
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,150
I know you're busy.

301
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,100
No matter what, Choi Chun Hee, that girl,

302
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,990
will find difficulty to get other stages too.

303
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:35,560
Just like you requested, I  talked to everyone I know.

304
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,850
I really thank you, Teacher.

305
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,590
I'm sorry, for asking you like this.

306
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,310
President!

307
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,160
President!

308
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,850
Where is Choi Chun Hee? Find out for me.

309
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,200
Thank you.

310
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,720
President, please listen to what I have to say.

311
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,730
President!

312
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,120
Excuse me, do you happen to know 
where the shooting team is?

313
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,090
Ah, are you the team for the new singer Choi Chun Hee?

314
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,120
Yes.

315
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,550
The one that called you yesterday, 
I'm PD Kim.

316
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,340
- Ah, yes. 
- Hello.

317
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,220
But,

318
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,460
you don't have to be prepared like this.

319
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,920
No, why?

320
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,370
To give our best even on small stages is our concept.

321
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:42,000
Where is the stage at? And the audience?

322
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,860
Yes, anyway let's go. Follow me.

323
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,900
Surely, the audience is...

324
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,740
You know that our program is called "Strange Lab"?

325
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,260
We do fascinating experiments in every episode.

326
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,320
We want to let the black goats listen to a song,

327
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,510
to test how much it smoothens their bowel movements.

328
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,820
That means I will sing for the goats?

329
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,650
Right!

330
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,740
Excuse me.

331
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,550
I think something's wrong.

332
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,560
I can't do it.

333
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,840
How could they make stuff like this 
for broadcasting?!

334
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,060
Tae Song, that jerk, I'll -

335
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,740
Hey!

336
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,660
We already came here.

337
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,840
Then, you're going to do that?

338
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,370
You're going to sing for the goats?

339
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:32,160
You know it as well, I came this far because I left right before the broadcast.

340
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,430
And now I should do the same thing again?

341
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,590
Let's go.

342
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,860
This bastard!

343
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,280
♬ Climbing hill after hill, ♬

344
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,690
♬ There's another one. ♬

345
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,860
Cut! Cut! Cut!

346
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,170
Miss Chun Hee, good. A little bit more sad! More sad!

347
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,800
Ok! Let's do it one more time.

348
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,520
- Yes. 
 - Ok, ready!

349
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,460
Action!

350
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,160
♬ Climbing hill after hill, ♬

351
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:12,850
♬ There's another one. ♬

352
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,410
♬ What they are trying to say ♬

353
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,010
Cut! Cut!

354
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,730
Camera, zoom in on the goat no.100! 
No.100! No.100!

355
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:26,830
♬ If I'm with you, whom I love, ♬

356
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,580
♬ A hundred years, ♬

357
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,760
Cut!

358
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,220
The baby goat is not acting well, not good.

359
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,220
Miss Chun Hee, one more time.

360
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,310
Ready! Action!

361
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:41,810
♬ Climbing hill after hill, ♬

362
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,830
Cut! Cut!

363
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,040
- We are almost done! 
- Wait a moment!

364
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,210
You called a singer here, what are you doing right now?

365
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,580
Shh! The black goats are sensitive to screaming, be quiet.

366
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,580
Are those goats more important now?

367
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,780
A singer is standing here,
 singing in the blazing sun for so many hours!

368
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,920
I'm sorry.

369
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,990
Why are you like this?

370
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,680
Hey, Assistant PD!

371
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,620
I told you to just turn on the radio?

372
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,280
The atmosphere got dirty after spending our money. 
What is this right now?

373
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,050
What? Dirty?

374
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,900
Watch your mouth!

375
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,470
Really...

376
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:14,010
Hey, go rest for 10 minutes, come!

377
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,470
I'm sorry.

378
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,010
Do you want to sing in this situation?

379
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,400
I'm alright.

380
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,290
What is there to be all right about?

381
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,730
In any case, it's a stage that the singer Choi Chun Hee was called to.

382
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,350
I won't make the same mistake twice.

383
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,320
I'm thirsty.

384
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,520
Go and bring some water.

385
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,450
Quickly.

386
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,480
I will work hard.

387
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,890
- Ok, let's do it again.
-Yes.

388
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,040
Get ready.

389
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,770
Camera, ok!

390
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,840
Start!

391
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,780
Choi Chun Hee, are you ok?

392
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,410
Yes, I'm ok.

393
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,990
Ah, suddenly...

394
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,960
- You were shocked, right? 
- No, I'm alright.

395
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,780
Why did that guy come here?

396
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,900
♬ Living in this world, ♬

397
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:42,160
♬ Living my life, ♬

398
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:48,620
♬ is hotter than red pepper. ♬

399
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,920
Cut! Oh!

400
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,590
Miss Chun Hee, you suffered a lot today.

401
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,380
Ah Mr. PD, you've worked hard too.

402
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,620
Yes. You've worked hard.

403
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,580
You've work hard.

404
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,360
- Clear up.
- You've worked hard.

405
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,110
Oh!?

406
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,720
President.

407
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,120
Hello.

408
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,760
I'll be there.

409
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,100
Oh!

410
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:16,630
Is this what you meant by getting your guitar back?

411
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,370
- What?
- Why is Choi Chun Hee singing at a place like this?

412
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,720
I'm about to go crazy also because it's so absurd.

413
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,860
However, do you have the right to say these things to me?

414
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,410
What have you done for her as the President?

415
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:36,650
- What is it that you've done?
- Hey!  Why are you being like this to the President?

416
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,530
I apologize.

417
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,950
That's why I said we should just forget about it and leave.

418
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,350
Are you happy since you didn't listen to me and stubbornly did what you wanted?

419
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,680
Do you like singing in front of baby goats?

420
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,150
If you're going to do whatever you want in the future,

421
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,020
I won't be your manager or producer.

422
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,810
No, I can't do it.

423
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,410
Where is he going now? Hey. HEY!

424
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,750
What happened?

425
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:04,120
I fell slightly before.  It's fine.

426
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,480
I'm not fine.

427
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:27,750
Ahjussi, you know Choi Chun Hee's schedule today, right?

428
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,250
Rain? It's raining.

429
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,040
Oh, Choi Chun Hee.

430
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:52,030
Mr. PD!  Mr. PD!

431
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,460
Where is Choi Chun Hee?

432
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,890
Choi Chun Hee?

433
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:58,050
It looked like she went to a hospital earlier in town with that man.

434
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,900
The hospital?

435
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,120
Why did she go to the hospital?

436
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,250
Oppa!

437
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,350
Where is the President?

438
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,570
The President didn't come?

439
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:21,350
This won't do.  I went outside to look and the tires are completely stuck.

440
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,910
My cellphone has no reception either.

441
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,670
When the rain ends we should have reception.

442
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,450
Yes.

443
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,970
Where could he have gone?

444
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,830
  The person you called isn't answering... 

445
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,390
Uh, excuse me.

446
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,440
I'm sorry for getting angry before at the shooting location.

447
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,720
Seeing you singing there like that...

448
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,410
it made me feel bad.

449
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,310
Ah, it's fine.

450
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:05,470
Anyhow, what happens if you can't get back to Seoul?

451
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,430
You don't need to worry about me.

452
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,160
What do you do when you need to kill time?

453
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,720
If there's a game that people your age play, please show me.

454
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,350
- Game?
- Yes.

455
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,400
Ah, a game.  Let me see.

456
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,890
My life is busy lately, so...

457
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,960
Ah, there's a new game these days.

458
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,820
It's called  a "Dagger" game.

459
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,200
You have to throw a dagger.

460
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,880
So in any case you just have to keep from laughing.

461
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,050
Grandmother!  Grandmother!

462
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:42,400
The girl that came with me yesterday.  Did she come here?

463
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,560
She didn't come.

464
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,470
Now where...

465
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,190
Hold on, you laughed.

466
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,330
- Come here.
- It's strangely funny.

467
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,730
- Get ready. 
- Ow!

468
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,890
Ah, really, Mr. President!

469
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,860
How can you hit me with feelings?

470
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,390
How is this a game?  This is an assault.

471
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:17,020
If you're going to go easy, why play the game at all?

472
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,160
This is quite fun.

473
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,170
I can really see why people play this game.

474
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,020
You laughed.  You laughed, right?

475
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,020
Right now. Ow!

476
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:33,640
Really, this person!

477
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,590
Are you crying?

478
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,760
It hurts so much.

479
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,500
Oppa!

480
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,940
Stay in the car, Soo In.  I'll go by myself.
 DANGER Do not enter under any circumstance. 

481
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,320
Oppa!

482
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,450
Oppa!  It's dangerous!

483
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,220
Oppa...

484
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,410
Why don't you sleep some more?

485
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,840
President, the rain has stopped.

486
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,730
Since the car can't move, 
should we try walking?

487
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,700
Yes.

488
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,120
President.  Why did you come here?

489
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,680
Did you have business to take care of nearby?

490
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,280
When I told you last time that you're not worthy of being a singer.

491
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,300
I think I was a bit harsh.

492
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,550
I'm sorry.

493
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,830
No, it's fine.

494
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,480
It's the truth, though.

495
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,380
But ...  you came all the way here to say that?

496
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,620
That's not it, of course.

497
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,120
Of course.

498
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,560
President, you are a busy person.

499
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,430
I came because I wanted to see you.

500
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,430
Sir, really, you're kidding!

501
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,940
But I'm not kidding.

502
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,020
I really came because I wanted to see you.

503
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,680
I hear a car over there!

504
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,860
Here!

505
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,120
Jang Joon Hyeon!

506
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,460
What kind of jerk are you?

507
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,440
What did you do to Choi Chun Hee?

508
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,660
For that matter, what are you doing?

509
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,760
Are you crazy?

510
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,710
What's wrong with you, seriously?

511
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,990
Oh, President, I'm sorry!  His personality is a little-

512
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,440
The company President is with a newbie singer, and is unable to be contacted all night.

513
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,780
Wouldn't you be worried?

514
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,290
You said you were worried because she was with me, right?

515
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:18,220
That she's with a manager who doesn't even know she's hurt...

516
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,790
makes me more worried.

517
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,440
Oh hey, Jang Joon Hyeon!

518
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,560
Oh President, I'm sorry!  I'll contact you later.

519
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,550
Oh!

520
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,040
Hey!

521
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,370
Hey Jang Joon Hyeon!

522
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:58,090
I seriously can't live because of you!

523
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,530
Why are you like that to the President?  Huh?

524
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,610
Do you only think about the president?

525
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:09,790
Do you know how much I worried about you?

526
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,950
Do you know what thoughts I had all night?

527
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,710
Do you like having the president's clothes draped over you?  Do you like it?  Aish!

528
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,350
Really, why are you like this?

529
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,500
It wasn't enough to wield your fist at the president earlier, now his clothes, too!

530
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,450
Is there something wrong with your head?

531
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,740
You are so annoying.

532
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,130
Crazy bastard.

533
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:56,400
♬  After going around and around,  ♬

534
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:03,760
♬ This moment when we finally faced each other,  ♬

535
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,390
♬  What should I tell you?  ♬

536
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:11,910
♬  I just hesitated  ♬

537
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,580
Aigoo, where have you been? 
 ♬  and just laughed.  ♬

538
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:19,700
The young man made such a fuss looking for you all night. 
♬  Like a passing shower,  ♬

539
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,320
Oh, here he comes. 
 ♬  You shook my heart,  ♬

540
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:28,590
♬  and came into me,  ♬

541
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,040
♬  One step every day,  ♬

542
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,510
Crazy bastard!  Aish! 
 ♬  Love, like snowflakes,  ♬

543
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:38,790
Jang Joon Hyeon, just what have you done?  You're out of your mind. 
 ♬  On your name,  ♬

544
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:41,550
♬  flowers bloomed.  ♬

545
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:47,290
♬  Before I knew it, like  my feelings,  ♬

546
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:51,720
♬  I'm growing to resemble you.. ♬

547
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,280
♬  This must be love. ♬

548
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,580
Park Soo In, what brings you here?

549
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,450
I was worried because you left the party like that.

550
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:04,560
You should clear up the misunderstanding before you go.

551
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,630
Misunderstanding?

552
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:09,070
I don't think that it is a misunderstanding.

553
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:13,730
It's all because of me that my mother is like that.

554
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:14,620
So...

555
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:20,170
I... don't group you and Director Yang together.

556
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,560
It's a matter between me and Director Yang.

557
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:27,830
So there's no reason for you to be troubled... or anything like that.

558
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:34,680
♬ One step each day , love like a snowflake, ♬

559
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:40,020
♬  On your name flowers bloom  ♬

560
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:44,970
♬  Before I knew it,  like my feelings  ♬

561
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:50,070
♬  I'm growing to resemble you  ♬

562
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:56,510
♬  Love must be like this  ♬

563
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:01,110
♬  The one  I'm facing and laughing together with  ♬

564
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:04,370
 I want to see you so I came here. 

565
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,980
 I really came here because I  want to see you. 

566
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:20,160
♬  To love like living for a day  ♬

567
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:25,410
♬  Your day becomes mine   ♬

568
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:35,460
♬  Before I knew it,  like my feelings I'm growing to resemble you,   ♬

569
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:41,630
♬  I must love you.  ♬

570
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:48,100
Excuse me... Well...

571
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,050
I don't like being uncomfortable with you.

572
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:59,670
So what I'm saying is...

573
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:04,110
If this is about what happened earlier, 
don't worry about it.

574
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:06,900
You know I'm a crazy punk.

575
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,300
If you feel bad, I'm sorry.

576
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,480
- Rest.
- Ok.

577
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,160
What's this?

578
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:44,110
♬ Koong Jak , Koong Jak, Koong Jajak Koong Jak ♬

579
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:47,880
♬ In those four beats ♬

580
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:56,060
♬ There are loves, break-ups and tears as well. ♬

581
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:03,920
♬ Each phrase, each tremor when it swerves and passes♬

582
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:11,860
♬ It carries our story ♬

583
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:20,250
Since you have a lot of experience, President Jo,

584
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:23,260
if you help us this once it would be nice!

585
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,160
What do you want?

586
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,970
A way to lift the broadcast ban.

587
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:31,520
Let's see.

588
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:34,540
When you're backed into a corner, you see,

589
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:41,530
you need to fight fairly no matter what.

590
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:46,140
In the ways of the world, shortcuts don't really work.

591
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,750
What do you mean by that?

592
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,490
If you work hard and face it head on, you'll find a way.  Don't you think?

593
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:57,620
Hello. I'm the Manager of Choi Chun Hee who's been banned from broadcast.

594
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,010
Have some nutritious tonics...

595
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,980
Get out.

596
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:08,660
What's this?

597
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,450
It splashed! It splashed!

598
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,410
Right here!

599
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:17,580
Please lift the broadcast ban for Choi Chun Hee.

600
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:20,940
Wow. Amazing!

601
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,230
   

602
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:27,290
One more time, one more time. Give us a chance.

603
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,010
Really, I can't even have a meal peacefully.

604
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,720
Hey, please order one black bean noodle for me.

605
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,540
Jajangmyeon ( Black bean sauced noodles), pickled radish, and chopsticks!

606
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,280
The other one!

607
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,470
Please let it go for Choi Chun Hee one more time.

608
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,380
Just once!

609
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:58,810
Hello, Chief!  Please have a cup of coffee.

610
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,400
Ah, what now?

611
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,110
I just brought it right now!

612
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:03,220
Move!

613
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:06,520
Hey, It's hot, it's hot!

614
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,510
- Aigoo, this freak (same pronunciation as burn)!
- Burn!

615
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,140
That's right, you freak!

616
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,430
Call 119!  119!

617
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:18,870
Why are you doing this? What do you want?

618
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:22,310
You already know.

619
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,980
Hello, Sunbae. From last time...

620
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,160
Choi Chun Hee, aren't you a singer?

621
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,540
What?

622
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,900
Even if you're a trot singer, how could a Shine Star singer perform in a place like that?

623
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:47,370
Aren't you ashamed?

624
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,830
I have a reason then...

625
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:51,150
For a singer, the stage itself is your pride.

626
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:54,790
From now on, I think it will be good if you don't sing like that.

627
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,810
I don't know.

628
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:12,150
♬ I changed into tight jeans ♬

629
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:15,670
♬ and walking on the street ♬

630
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:22,240
♬ Missing you exceptionally today ♬

631
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:28,240
♬ So I went to that cafe.
 Bam bam bam bam ♬

632
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:34,880
♬ I couldn't find you there ♬

633
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,320
 Hello, Chief. 

634
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,860
This is regarding to Choi Chun Hee's case...

635
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:00,140
If it's about that matter, it's already been resolved.

636
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,880
I've already ordered  the broadcast ban to be lifted! 

637
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,760
What?

638
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:13,330
♬ The woman who comforts the pain ♬

639
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:17,370
♬ I don't know how much ♬

640
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:21,420
♬ I need your love ♬

641
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:26,060
♬ The woman who dreams her happiness.Together!
♬ The woman who waits for her love. Louder!

642
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:29,870
♬ She is a woman like that ♬

643
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,900
Seol Tae Song!

644
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:47,390
Since when did you sing so well?

645
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,480
What?

646
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:54,360
You were the best! It's very good.

647
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,560
Become a singer.

648
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,030
Boss!

649
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:04,470
Noonim, please become my first fan.

650
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,420
It's an honor.

651
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,840
You must become my star, okay?

652
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:18,900
Yes.

653
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:25,150
Of course.

654
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:29,100
  No, he  has
  
 Queen of Ballade: Not so many people here. 

655
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:30,990
 God of Trot: That's right. 

656
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:35,440
Meek eyed, sharp nose, and

657
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,520
smooth jawline.

658
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,960
And to save me from a dangerous situation,

659
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,850
he is brave and doesn't spare his own body.

660
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:50,790
I think it is impossible to be more perfect.

661
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,710
She met the right guy.

662
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,720
Lady Ball(ade) , congrats!

663
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:02,300
I also met my ideal type.

664
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:07,280
Is she pretty?

665
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:12,760
Is she pretty?  Why would you ask something so obvious?

666
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,760
It's not enough to just say she's pretty.

667
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:24,480
Choi Chun Hee!

668
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,740
President, hello.

669
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:27,260
There's good news.
- Yes?

670
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,890
Your broadcast ban has been lifted.

671
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:32,330
- Really?
- Yes.

672
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:34,720
Thank you, thank you, President.

673
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,660
- Work hard! 
-Yes.

674
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,560
What a relief.

675
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,740
Hey, Choi Chun Hee.

676
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:46,450
Hey, our broadcasting ban has been lifted, the president lifted it.

677
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,640
What? President?

678
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,040
Isn't it good to hear?

679
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,750
It worked out then.

680
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,920
How should I show my thanks?

681
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:58,420
Hey, did you apologize for trying to punch him before?

682
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:04,590
You didn't yet. Did you? Do it fast. He's such a help for us.

683
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:07,090
Alright, I will just apologize.

684
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,640
Hey, what happened to your arm?  Did you hurt yourself?

685
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:14,410
It's nothing.

686
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,740
What you mean nothing?  Let me see.

687
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,960
I'm so glad for you.

688
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,690
I know.

689
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,760
 That's right, Choi Chun Hee. 

690
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,710
 If you are happy, that's enough for me. 

691
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:31,500
 There's a new song that's coming up the chart
with a frightening speed, 

692
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,120
 it's a Trot (Teuroteu genre) song! 

693
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,030
 It's been reported that the middle aged
 to elderly segment that has been 

694
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:40,580
 excluded from the music market
has opened its wallet to buy this track, 

695
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,660
 A new generation Trot singer for whom even more is anticipated in the future, 

696
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,120
 Ms. Choi Chun Hee.  Here's her song "Go Choo (pepper)" 

697
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:51,950
♫  Living a life which is only a life which will flit here and there   ♫

698
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:57,410
♫  Hotter than a pepper, a pepper!  ♫

699
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:00,930
♫  which is only a life which will flit here and there ♫ 

700
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:04,660
♫ Hotter than the... ♫

701
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,780
Hey, how do you kids know this song?

702
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:10,210
My mommy plays it every day!

703
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:12,340
Then tell her to keep playing it!

704
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:16,890
 "A song to sing with love and emotion", Elation song class.
♫ round and plumply keep on living ♫ 

705
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,890
♫ Way of my love, and way of my life ♫

706
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,610
♫  Hotter than a pepper, a pepper. ♫ 
Excuse me... 

707
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:28,260
Do you have a new one of this shirt in the same size?

708
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,890
You've all helped me in many ways up to this point,

709
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:33,050
I felt as if I didn't get a chance to thank you properly, so

710
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,470
I prepared in a meager way.

711
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,430
It's not like I made them all,

712
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:38,320
still...

713
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,710
enjoy the meal!

714
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,890
- Okay.
- Please help yourselves.
- Wow!

715
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,100
- Wow!
- What a great meal!
- Ah!

716
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,420
Also...

717
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:49,600
this is something I purchased

718
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,550
with the money I received from the event.

719
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:54,700
This is my Byeol's.

720
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,320
Wow!

721
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,350
Wow!

722
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:01,080
It's pretty!

723
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,050
This is for our younger uncle's
(Uncle: Korean man of middle age may/may not related
to the speaker, familiarity)

724
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:05,610
Wah-uh... Mine?

725
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:08,540
And this is for the older uncle.

726
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:12,770
Man, it's the first time I received a gift from the "client".
 (Client: person who owes money to him)

727
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,300
And this is for my coach.

728
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,330
One for me too?

729
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:18,270
Of course!  You care for my Byeol as well.

730
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:22,460
Where's mine?  This sort of stuff suits me totally fine.

731
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:23,250
Come on.

732
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,030
Where is it?

733
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:25,710
I have none.

734
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:26,760
You really don't have one  ?

735
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,900
Does this look good on me?

736
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,070
Yes, it does!

737
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:33,820
Poo, I have no socks left.

738
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,670
Ugh, what's with the stench?

739
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:41,220
Unni, my sneakers are too dirty.

740
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,170
Who put the toilet paper in the toilet?

741
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:45,010
How many times have I said not to do it?!

742
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:46,620
Unni, what should I do?

743
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:48,910
I can't let this go on.  I better do some housework today.

744
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:50,550
You said you have to practice singing medley, didn't you?

745
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:52,310
Um-hm.

746
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:56,820
You go to school, and you go practice singing.

747
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,650
I'll do the household chores.  Quickly get going!

748
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:02,720

775
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:51,810
Hello President!  How are you?

776
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,120
I hear you're busy due to many events?

777
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,360
Are you making sure to not skip meals?

778
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,650
Here you go.

779
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:08,590
Thank you.

780
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:13,410
Uh...

781
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:17,240
Ah, it's okay.

782
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,080
A new knife please!

783
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,640
I'm sorry, I'm not used to places like this...

784
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,550
What's there to be used to or not at a place to eat a meal?

785
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:26,660
A meal is a meal.

786
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:37,150
Have you thought about it?

787
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:38,070
What about?

788
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:40,910
The thing I said to you in the car a while ago.

789
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:45,160
When I said I wanted to go see you.

790
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:48,970
That was a sort of a   confession on my part.

791
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:57,580
I guess I haven't really specifically suggested an action
from you apart from my comment...

792
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,240
Ms. Choi Chun Hee,

793
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,500
Y-e-s?

794
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,050
Let's date officially.

795
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:11,910
Am I not much of a catch...?

796
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,600
No, no, no, no, no!  It's not that.  It's just that...

797
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:20,220
Dad!  I have to find my dad, and then

798
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,180
have to sing, and

799
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:25,920
have to stretch my legs apart too, 
and send Byeol to school, and

800
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,920
I have so much to do, so

801
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,560
dating is not something I had time to thi-thi-

802
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:34,090
think about.

803
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:39,320
Why do schools make you do things like this these days?

804
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,570
Plant growth observation diary is a science assignment.

805
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,290
Plant those already!

806
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:49,710
There's just no end to the household chores!

807
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:51,870
What are you going to do for me if I do all these for you?

808
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:54,330
Shall I plant (bury) you too?

809
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,570
How come a person who only had a little more practice left
comes home so late?

810
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:01,410
When I have made a kick-butt bean-paste stew.

811
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,480
- Ahjussi!
- Yes?

812
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,770
Dinner!

813
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:06,860
It's all done.  Come over here.

814
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,280
Is it tasty?

815
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:14,460
It's tasty!

816
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:16,160
Okay.

817
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,560
I was rejected by you today, right?

818
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,210
Aihyoo, not at all.  How would I rej...

819
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:32,990
Not at all.

820
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:35,930
Is there another person you like perhaps?

821
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:37,140
No.

822
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:39,800
Well, it doesn't matter if there is.

823
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,900
Heart is something that can always change.

824
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:44,540
Go on in.

825
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,520
Okay, take care.

826
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,930
- Good night.
- It's good night then to you too.

827
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,400
Woo!!!

828
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,230
I ought to...

829
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:08,210
Feels so refreshing  .

830
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:22,350
  Timing  and

831
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,470
Don't you even think about a person who prepares a meal
and waits for you at home?

832
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:29,070
Shouldn't you call to say you'll be late, if you're going to be, no?

833
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:32,030
Isn't that a polite thing to do for people who live together?

834
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:34,490
Come on, I'm sorry.

835
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:35,610
Let's go.

836
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:37,260
Call!  (Agree/alright)

837
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,680
Did you prepare dinner already?

838
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:48,320
♫  Step by step towards love,
Like a snowflake of love.  ♫

839
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:53,710
♫  On your name the flowers bloom.   ♫

840
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:59,320
♫  Before I knew It as much as my feelings    ♫

841
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:03,740
♫  I grew to resemble you.  ♫

842
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:10,400
♫  This must be love.   ♫

843
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:21,650
♫  Gazing at me quietly,  ♫

844
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:24,260
 Let me make a suggestion.  
I would like to eat dinner at your home. 

845
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,190
 Why does that punk want to be treated to a meal at home? 

846
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:28,590
 I like you, Ms. Choi Chun Hee. 

847
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:29,890
 What is your purpose for entering this company? 

848
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:31,000
 Of course it was to sing... 

849
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,810
 Then why don't you stick to singing instead of dating and crap! 

850
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:33,920
 Dig up Choi Chun Hee's background! 

851
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,690
 - Whatever you can get on her.
- Do NOT harass Ms. Choi Chun Hee. 

852
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:36,890
 It bothers me, you see. 

853
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:39,620
 Thanks for the info, but I can't leave this house.
Because... 

854
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:42,530
 as you say, I'm Choi Chun Hee's manager.
