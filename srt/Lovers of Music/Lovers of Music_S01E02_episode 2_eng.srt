1
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,800
Who is it?

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,800
Is this Choi Chun Hee's...

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,900
Choi Chun Hee is you?

4
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,000
You're the one who made me like this,

5
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,200
the God of Music on a roll, Jang Joon Hyeon, you're the one who made me like this.

6
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,000
What?

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,600
If only you didn't make a big deal with that medal!

8
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,490
If you didn't chase me to the hotel and make all that trouble.

9
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,800
So the reason I, who am innocent, got mixed with this current scandal,

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,970
that I am facing  your dirty, cheap face,

11
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,290
that the Net is full of false accusations,

12
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,060
and that the world is full of lies and distrust

13
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,430
driven by an evil force

14
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,440
is every bit, all, all  because of you!

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,990
You, troublemaking medal girl!!!

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,330
Who are you, Ajusshi?

17
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,560
Byul, go inside.

18
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,500
Go inside and lock the door. Scoot.

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,360
But, they want me to train you?

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,390
I  can't  do it!

21
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,210
I  won't  do it!

22
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,200
Who's training whom?

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,530
What is he saying after showing up out of the blue?

24
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,290
Anyone else except her is fine.

25
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,450
I can never do it.

26
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,430
Hello?

27
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,530
You're the owner of 1006 right? Please move your stuff this instant!

28
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,410
You're probably here to get your stuff?

29
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,300
President

30
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,130
I would have thought you'll be busy these days, but here you are.

31
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,830
President, how can you do this?

32
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,810
I was going to do it if possible.

33
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,430
So, you mean it's not possible?

34
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,090
It's both her exterior appearance and not having to listen to her singing.

35
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,030
So, you're going to give up?

36
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,400
So, your talent reaches only up to there?

37
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,210
Excuse me?

38
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,370
No, what I mean is, I can do it if I wanted to,

39
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,940
but when I think about what I had to go through because of her,

40
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,300
I  still can't even sleep comfortably now.

41
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,540
You must have some bad relationship with that kid.

42
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,270
It's not even your average bad relationship.

43
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,850
No matter how much you pay me, I won't do it.

44
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,290
No, I can't do it.

45
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,210
Then, it can't be helped.

46
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,310
Well, if you can't do it, then you can't do it.

47
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,140
President Jo, perhaps you could say something in the same language.

48
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,630
Then, President, taking this opportunity...

49
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,190
Get out.

50
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,990
Where are we?

51
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,200
Drag him out!

52
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,450
Ahh! All right! All right!

53
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,180
Oh! Not this!

54
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,800
Ahh really...

55
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,470
Isn't this the court?

56
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,900
Why are we at the court?

57
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,470
I invested one billion won for your next album!

58
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,370
And for the lawsuit regarding to the drink and the department store you were an advertising model for, 2 billion won.

59
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,160
And most of all,

60
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,340
the fallen image of my Shine Star 
because of you, 3 billion won!

61
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,980
And you can read the rest yourself.

62
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,670
President!

63
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,820
Why are you like this? You're joking right?

64
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,930
You said you can't do it.

65
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,090
Then our contract is automatically breached.

66
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,750
President!

67
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,560
You still think the world, no,

68
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,340
the entire universe is still revolving around you?

69
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,530
Then continue to live like that, and see how your life will turn out.

70
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,100
-President!
-Let go of me!!

71
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,190
Please...

72
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,210
Please give me another chance.

73
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:58,050
I already gave you a chance.

74
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,890
 Choi Byul ☆ 

75
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,510
 Dad, I love you. 

76
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,390
Who are you?

77
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,250
- Who are you to come into someone else's house?
- Where's your dad?

78
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:38,780
Excuse me?

79
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,040
Choi Myeong Sik, your dad, where is he?

80
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,540
If a person borrowed some money, then he should repay it!

81
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,990
No. I can't do it. I won't do it!

82
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,350
Lady, I'm telling you now.

83
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,540
I'm not going to go easy because you're a girl.

84
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,860
So hurry up and tell me.

85
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,210
I don't know either. I'm just waiting for my dad to call.

86
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,230
Waiting for him?

87
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,970
There's nothing worth any money 
in this house either.

88
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,300
This evil fate can't get eviler. 
You and I must be really fated.

89
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,370
Please work hard.

90
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,570
Hey hey hey hey!

91
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,350
Where do you think you're going?

92
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,980
I have no relationship with this house.

93
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,190
You walked in here saying it's fate.

94
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,140
No... It's...

95
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,800
Hello, please quickly tell them that we don't know each other.

96
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,590
This person has no relationship to me.

97
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,320
He walked in here with all his stuff just now, prepared to live here, and you're saying you guys have no relationship?

98
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,260
I feel like I've seen you many times somewhere.

99
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,690
Oh? Oh?

100
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,140
Did you borrow money from me?

101
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,430
Your face looks familiar.

102
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,010
Excuse me?!

103
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,440
So why did you have come again? 
Now even you're  here, seriously...

104
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,480
So what are you going to do now?

105
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,390
Do what?

106
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,300
We can't  "plant"  a girl ... 
 (implying "bury") 

107
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,100
 "Plant"  what?

108
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,540
You said it's fate.

109
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,130
Were you going somewhere to plant something?

110
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,810
If you can't keep your promise, then you should die!

111
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,750
Why are you doing this to me?

112
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,960
Don't.  Please don't do this!

113
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,780
I will pay back the money no matter what, 
so if you give me a little time...

114
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,400
We have no time. We are very busy people!

115
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,800
Well there's no way I can pay you back right away,

116
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,600
so I'll work somewhere part-time and slowly...

117
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,920
Hey, are you crazy?!

118
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,670
Slowly my butt! That girl can make money right now.

119
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,270
If you get to know her, you'll see she is like an ATM machine!

120
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,690
That girl is a singer. You know Shine Star right?

121
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,680
She's going to sign a contract with Shine Star tomorrow.

122
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,790
Hey! What are you saying right now?

123
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,350
Miss, is this true?

124
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:09,860
What?

125
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,420
- Are you really a singer?
 -Me?

126
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,400
Then, go sing.

127
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,570
It's not true. He's saying something untrue.

128
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,290
Go and sing.

129
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,680
She's saying it's not true!

130
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,090
Aihoo!

131
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:26,860
Hello?

132
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,040
What?

133
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,050
You lost him again?!

134
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,430
Catch him for now.

135
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,220
Catch him and break his legs right there.

136
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,480
No, you can't! You can't!

137
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,760
By any chance, is this my dad?

138
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,090
Dad or whatever, anyone who doesn't pay back the money needs to die!

139
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,680
Hey, what do you mean by they need to die?

140
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,510
Why do you say things so violently?

141
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,190
Just  plant  him somewhere nearby in the mountains.

142
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,860
Hey, just  plant  him in a nearby mountain.

143
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,790
Hey, up to his head,

144
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,060
just  plant  him up to his head.

145
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,200
Hey, just  plant  him fully!

146
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,530
Up to... Up to his head?

147
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,820
And him, too. Hurry up and  plant  him!  
 Plant  all of them!

148
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,280
Yes.

149
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,440
No, no, you can't!

150
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,150
You should know that I really have no relationship with her!

151
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,550
Stop! I will sing!

152
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,500
I will sing!

153
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,660
You told me to sing!

154
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,730
So I'll sing...aish

155
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,600
♬ On a green meadow, ♬

156
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,460
♬ In a house we build as pretty as a picture, ♬

157
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:44,700
♬ I want us loving and living for a hundred years. ♬

158
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,180
♬ When it's spring, plant the seeds ♬

159
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,010
plant the seeds!

160
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,550
♬ When it's summer, the flowers bloom ♬

161
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,430
Flowers bloom!

162
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,770
♬ In the fall, we harvest. ♬

163
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,600
♬ In the winter we are happy ♬

164
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,000
♬ Although one brags about a trendy high-rise, ♬

165
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,140
♬ although following the trend in living too may be one's style ♬

166
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,570
♬ I like it. I like it. If you and I will live together. ♬

167
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:13,360
♬ If you and I live together, woah, woah ♬

168
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,760
Hey!

169
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,810
You're pretty good. You have a nice voice.

170
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,330
No, him there making sounds 
with that paper bag over his head.

171
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:26,060
They're pretty funny aren't they?

172
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,920
I know, right, Hyungnim?

173
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,660
Unnie,

174
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,710
are you really going to sign the contract tomorrow?

175
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,260
Of course! I'll guarantee it!

176
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,840
Please!

177
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,740
Really?

178
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,770
We just made an eye contract right now.

179
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:52,140
We're going to go to Shine Star together in our car.

180
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,440
Let's go, Hyungnim.

181
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,230
Hey, did they leave?

182
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,030
Be quiet!

183
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,520
Did they leave?

184
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,280
What are you doing?! Move this thing away quickly!

185
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,490
Ah that's it. Rascal.

186
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,600
Tell me. What do you want me to do?

187
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,730
At the next New Year's do you want me to play yunnori (korean traditional board game) twice

188
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,190
or do you want me to act as a driver for one year?

189
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,260
I don't need any of that.

190
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,450
Just take the company for a year.

191
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,420
What?

192
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,340
Nothing more.

193
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,160
Just one year.

194
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,420
After a year, I will hand it over 
to a professional manager.

195
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,450
Why wait a year? Just hand it over right now.

196
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,610
If you can just do it, that's even better.

197
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,600
These days when adults retire, they age so quickly.

198
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Why do you talk so much?

199
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,330
You know I lost to you on purpose.

200
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,200
I've been eating and sleeping off of your money, 
so I put an effort to lose to pay you back.

201
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,210
Oh yeah?

202
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,480
Yes, I know it's 5:30 today.

203
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,550
Let's see each other at the hospital.

204
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,900
You go to the meeting with Director Yang today 
instead of me.

205
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,260
I really don't have high expectations of you.

206
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:15,350
At least do work worth 1/10,000 of what was spent teaching you.

207
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,090
Hey ... your music style was trot?

208
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,680
I'm really going crazy. How could it fit you so perfectly?

209
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,340
As tacky as you look.

210
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,580
Hey, that shovel really suits you.

211
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,440
Hey, isn't this a worm?!

212
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,500
I hate worms the most! Move this away!

213
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,350
What's so scary about this, huh?

214
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,690
You really act the way you look. 
It  is cute to me.

215
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,400
Hey, this one here is even bigger! Move it away!

216
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,900
Hey!

217
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,010
Hello?

218
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,600
Hey, I told you to move this away.

219
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,860
Excuse me?

220
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,920
My father's identification came out?

221
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,750
Hey!

222
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,100
All right.

223
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,130
Hey, where are you going?! Where are you going? Hey!

224
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,060
You're joking around right now, right?

225
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,920
Hey back number 17!

226
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,900
It's not him.

227
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,600
It's not my dad.

228
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,550
Thank you.

229
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,420
Thank you.

230
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,850
Is anyone there?

231
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,370
Excuse me!

232
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,120
There's a person here!

233
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,710
Is it a ghost?

234
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,050
Don't come! Don't come!

235
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,710
Don't come! Don't come!

236
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:41,350


237
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,750
Have you done warming-up properly?

238
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,490
Coach!

239
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,140
When I went to go check the body,

240
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,370
I was praying that it wasn't my dad.

241
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:12,110
I was praying for just that.

242
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,530
Now that I know it wasn't my dad,

243
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,680
it's fortunate but,

244
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,610
I suddenly felt angry.

245
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,020
Honestly, I really hate my dad.

246
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,600
How could he not call even once,

247
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,490
to me,

248
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,940
to Byul, how could he do this to us?

249
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,320
You,

250
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,900
that time,

251
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,700
when you fainted on the track,

252
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,150
your father came to the school.

253
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,090
My dad?

254
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,030
 Teacher, 

255
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:05,300
 please save my kid. 

256
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,600
 A marathon runner needs to know
 how to give up as well. 

257
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,900
 That's a skill as well. 

258
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,470
 My kid is so stubborn, 

259
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,840
 once she starts running,
 she doesn't know how to give up. 

260
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,140
 You've already seen it, right? 
She's going to die if she keeps that up. 

261
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,940
 Teacher, 

262
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,600
  please rein my kid in. 

263
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,210
If your dad disappeared,

264
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,590
there's probably a reason.

265
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,760
More than anyone in this world,

266
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,810
he loved his kids to death.

267
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,420
You know this as well.

268
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,250
Yes.

269
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,300
Unni!

270
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,910
Unni told me not to open the door to suspicious people.

271
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,660
Suspicious?

272
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,690
I'm not a suspicious person.

273
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,580
I'm a well known celebrity.

274
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,180
Little kid, you really don't know me?

275
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,630
Are you sure you're a celebrity?

276
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,540
Then why are you so dirty?

277
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,110
It just happened that way.

278
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,790
I'm not suspicious anymore, right?

279
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,900
Little kid,

280
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,410
do you have anything to eat?

281
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,340
Follow me.

282
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,310
I need to eat.

283
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,750
Look here.

284
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,670
Oh?

285
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,910
Not that, the one underneath it.

286
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,330
Eat that one, it's the older one.

287
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,370
Unni told me to eat the newer ones, 
but we shouldn't do that.

288
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,860
We have to eat the older ones first.

289
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:40,940
So this one is the older one and this one is the newer one...

290
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,160
April 2014?

291
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,180
Are you sure this is the newer one?

292
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,730
You guys live off these?

293
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,270
Just hurry and close the freezer door.

294
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,130
Mom, why did you suddenly schedule a dinner meeting?

295
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,120
I can't even stop by the salon.

296
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,440
Then what? It's the first dinner 
with the new president,

297
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,250
do you want him to be taken by others?

298
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,080
You just have to follow what I say.

299
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,170
All right.

300
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,100
The car you sent is here. Bye.

301
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,060
We're going to the hotel right?

302
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,020
Yes.

303
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,210
Yeah.

304
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,760
What do you want me to do to the  parachute  president? 
 (parachute : implying nepotism) 

305
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,710
So I can act the way I usually act right?

306
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:59,050
Just sit down and eat a little,

307
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,260
And when he asks me something, I just smile.

308
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,180
Ok.

309
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,380
But Mom, the driver is a little weird.

310
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,400
He keeps on looking at me.

311
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,360
Why are you following me?

312
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,520
It's not like that.

313
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,040
Here you go.

314
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,640
Take it.

315
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,580
You've worked hard.

316
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,070
Do you still have unfinished business with me? What are you?

317
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,360
How did you guys come together?

318
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,440
Mom, what's with this guy? Why does he keep on following me?

319
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,770
Hello.

320
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:18,220
Welcome, President. I've only seen you in pictures.

321
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,040
Please sit.

322
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,810
Why are you not sitting, Soo In?

323
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,310
Yes.

324
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,940
I heard President Jo is on vacation right now.

325
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,090
For him to have such a great and successful son,

326
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,220
President Jo can now relax.

327
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,550
Well, I'm only here for a year.

328
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:48,550
Just while my father is resting, like a substitute.

329
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:53,710
First, please exchange greetings. This is my daughter, a trainee at Shine Star Entertainment.

330
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,320
She is pretty busy preparing for auditions lately.

331
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,390
Like your mother, you are very pretty.

332
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:08,200
Oh yeah, you are aware of the auditions for the Shine Star trainees?

333
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,920
I was wondering if that plan is still continuing without President Jo here.

334
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,900
Nothing will be changing while I'm here.

335
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,510
Everything will be continuing just as it is.

336
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,090
Your father was originally the judge,

337
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,860
but now you will be doing it instead?

338
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,770
Well, can't you use a different person? I think you can.

339
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:34,710
I think it is better for you to do it personally.

340
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,620
Because, in your position, 
many people must keep an eye on you.

341
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,450
Oh yes... If that's what you think.

342
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,880
- Unnie!
- Oh Byul.

343
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,460
You're hungry right? I'll quickly make you food.

344
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:03,040
Unnie, I think it's a good idea for you to become a singer.

345
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:09,000
I like it when you sing, so if you sing to other people besides me,

346
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,440
other people will feel happy like me.

347
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,180
Who said those kinds of things?

348
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,860
Whether it's the shower or sink, 
each drop of water is precious.

349
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,450
What are you? What are you to shower in someone else's house?

350
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,250
Hey.  Did you forget because of whom did  I get buried in the ground?

351
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:34,840
Then do you want me, Jang Joon Hyeon, to walk around outside looking such a sight!

352
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,640
Exactly why is President Jo attracted to her?

353
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,920
Exactly who is President Jo? Who is he to tell me to become a singer? Does he know me?

354
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,580
That's what I want to ask!

355
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,420
- What's going on?
- What  do you mean what's going on?

356
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,850
Then do you have another plan? Do you think those guys from earlier can't find your dad?

357
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,840
You should pay back the money before they find your dad.

358
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,160
Then are you really becoming a singer tomorrow, Unnie?

359
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,180
That's right! Thanks to my total talent  you'll succeed.

360
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,140
Hey, do you have a dryer?

361
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,100
Go dry it outside!

362
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,260
Hey hey.

363
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,110
- Hurry and go.
 - Hey.

364
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,630
I don't like your small, dirty house as well. I'm going to go to a hotel.

365
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:23,080
So hurry up and go. Go safely and don't ever come back. Bye.

366
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,430
That girl. Really...

367
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:41,400
 The song you gave me. You're the one who gave me my debut song. 

368
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:58,510
Unnie, that Ajusshi is lying down outside.

369
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,970
Don't mind him and come here. Let's sleep Byul.

370
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,900
Tadaa!

371
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,640
Here you go.

372
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:22,470
But Unnie, if you become a singer, will you be wearing sparkly dresses and taking pictures?

373
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,080
Mom wore a dress too.

374
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,320
- Well, that's...
- You're going to be on TV as well, right?

375
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,450
If I can see you on TV, that'll be really great.

376
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:42,610
Then that means Dad will be listening to your song somewhere as well?

377
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:47,610
That means he might come home faster because he misses us? Right, Unnie?

378
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,490
Should we sleep now?

379
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,660
Good night!

380
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,470
 

381
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:07,180
 Do you have 40 million won? 
If I had the money for the penalty, 

382
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,100
 I would close down this store right away. 

383
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,490
 I can't even sleep with my back stretched out. 

384
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:24,520


385
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,530
 

386
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,450
What is this? Ah, seriously?

387
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,070
Seriously, what kind of suffering is this?

388
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,310
Ajusshi!

389
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,180
Shh! Unnie will wake up.

390
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,400
Ajusshi, good night!

391
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,480
You too!

392
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,410
Ajusshi, eat with us.

393
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:22,650
How can you eat fried rice in the morning?

394
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,880
Then don't eat.

395
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,550
Wow, there's even seaweed in this fried rice.

396
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,100
Then would there be no seaweed for the triangle kimbap?

397
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,180
Why are you making fried rice with triangle kimbap?

398
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,850
If you don't fry it, it'll be cold.

399
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:44,510
Is this, by any chance, the old food?

400
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,040
Are you guys trying to kill me?!

401
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,240
You better eat it again.

402
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,790
Yoo Sik, didn't I tell you to escort the Unnie and Oppa well?

403
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,090
Of course, Hyungnim.

404
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,400
- They have a big future ahead of them. 
 -Yes.

405
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,230
Careful, careful.

406
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,280
Oh, our precious people. Do you want me to escort you to the president's office?

407
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,420
No, it's ok!

408
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:31,120
Out of the three judges, two of them are 
me and Yoon Gun, K-pop critic.

409
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,330
There's nothing the new president can do on his own.

410
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:37,320
That judge, you're sure he's on our side?

411
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,490
Of course. He's my high school friend.

412
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:45,730
Whether they look at skill or whatever, Soo In will definitely win.

413
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:48,050
Just trust me.

414
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:54,720
Oppa, when you studied in New York, you had a classmate name Jo Geun Woo right?

415
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,610
What kind of person is he?

416
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:01,970
Not those kind of things. Like his personality or hobbies?

417
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,410
Or his ideal type?

418
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,470
Hello.

419
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:11,220
Why did you hang up so abruptly?

420
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,340
It's nothing.

421
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,850
You came early.

422
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,850
To prepare for the audition.

423
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:29,520
Yesterday, I made a mistake.

424
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,580
About what? It's true that I'm a parachute president.    

425
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,430
Why didn't you say that you weren't a driver?

426
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,030
Why would I when you didn't even ask?

427
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,190
Why did you give a ride to a woman you don't even know?

428
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,930
I was going to the same hotel anyway,

429
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:51,810
and instead of going alone, it's nice to go with a pretty lady.

430
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,480
I really want to win this audition.

431
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,000
If I win, treat me to a meal. That much is fine, right?

432
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,810
I don't want to.

433
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:09,560
If you win, you should be the one treating.

434
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,700
Ah, that's fine too.

435
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,910
Then you're going to buy.

436
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,490
Oh, and the money you gave yesterday.

437
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,170
Ah, yes.

438
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,100
I'll use it well.

439
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:31,740
Why isn't he picking up the phone?

440
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,440
Hey, you wait here.

441
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,430
Okay.

442
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:44,270


443
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,500
Hello?

444
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,950
This is the child care center, right?

445
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,320
Teacher, I'm sorry, but can you drop off Byeol at home today?

446
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,490
Yes, thank you.

447
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:03,320
 You have entered incorrectly. 

448
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,030
Here.

449
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,370
Ah, you're the weird member-nim from before, right?

450
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,260
- You know me?
-  You have entered incorrectly. 

451
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:29,730
Ah. Um.

452
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,270
  Wang Dong Kyu
Shine Star Entertainment 

453
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,480
Ah,  that...

454
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,180
Not that. That!

455
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,220
Omo, excuse me?

456
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,270
Give me my phone!

457
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,430
Aish, give me that!

458
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,740
Why do you just take someone else's phone like that?

459
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,260
You're such a weird person, seriously. You must be a kleptomaniac.

460
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,500
Take this.

461
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,500
It must lock automatically from the outside.

462
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,770
The security in this building is very outstanding.

463
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,520
Do you always act any way you want?

464
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,270
Why did you take my phone and...

465
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,020
You're the one who closed the door.

466
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,310
That's true, but...

467
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:26,220
Should we go down one floor? It may be unlocked there.

468
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,330
Okay.

469
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:33,200
Ah, look. It will be tiresome for two people to go down.

470
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,660
You try go down and come back.

471
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,830
What?

472
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,770
I'm joking.

473
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,880
Joke.

474
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,980
Really, he's such a weird person.

475
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:52,420
Excuse me! Anyone out there?

476
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:57,150
Excuse me! There are people in here!

477
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,890
Try calling security.

478
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:02,490
How do I know their phone number? It's my first time here.

479
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:05,670
If it's your first time here, why were you in front of the president's office?

480
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,600
I came to see him.

481
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,730
Why would you see the president?

482
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:12,040
I don't want to tell you!

483
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,950
Look here!

484
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,450
- Excuse me, where is the president?
- I don't know.

485
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,610
Excuse me...

486
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:31,650
Oppa! What brings you here?

487
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:35,290
Oh... President Jo asked me to help him with something.

488
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,580
President Jo?

489
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:43,770
Ah, this. I carried it around so I can give it to you when I see you.

490
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,970
What is this?

491
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:47,790
You just left last time.

492
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,550
It's okay, Oppa. This is just my heart.

493
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,140
I'll be thankful if you just thought of it like that.

494
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:58,120
No. I don't know about anyone else, but I can't be indebted to you.

495
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,710
I understand. If that's how you feel.

496
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,930
But don't you have to pick up the phone?

497
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:10,030
Huh? Yeah.

498
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,050
Hello?

499
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,630
What? Locked in somewhere?

500
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,080
You don't have anywhere else to call?

501
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,360
It doesn't look like he's coming.

502
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,880
But, what in the world do you do?

503
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,130
Who are you to recklessly press 
whatever passcode for the president's room?

504
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,960
At the sports center too, you tried to open the lock with any key.

505
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,600
And am I your secretary? Huh?

506
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,020
You did that last time too. Why do you make me hold that drink for you? Seriously, huh?

507
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,740
You just took my phone too!

508
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,890
You're such a strange person, really!

509
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:45,670
Wow, you talk really fast.

510
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,490
You got yourself in trouble already?

511
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,280
Who is that person?

512
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,340
Let's go.

513
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,330
So...You're the president's son?

514
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:12,190
So he's saying he is the president's son, 
and now he became the president.

515
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,170
That's why... Yeah.

516
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:20,410
So you're saying my father gave you a mission?

517
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:24,630
To raise this lady? So you came to sign the contract?

518
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:28,570
That's right. Should I try call the president directly?

519
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,600
 The phone is turned off... 

520
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,960
Ah, why did he turn off his phone?

521
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,990
This. Documents given personally by the president.

522
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,840
This.

523
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,840
 Shine Star Audition Application
Next Shine Star Audition
 

524
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,120
What is this?

525
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,370
So, it's not about a contract.

526
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:01,100
He's telling you to participate in the audition.

527
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:06,710
Will you participate in the Next Shine Star Audition, Ms. Choi Chun Hee?

528
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,600
What? Me?

529
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,580
Although it's cable, it's still broadcast nationwide. There's even prize money.

530
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,660
 Winner Prize Money: $100,000 

531
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,240
The audition preliminaries are tomorrow.

532
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:26,380
What, tomorr...? Just a day before the audition, how can she...?

533
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,960
Does that even make sense?

534
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,270
You two make the decision.

535
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:36,270
We'll have to do as much as we can. We can't just back out. Do you have any ideas?

536
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:41,030
You want me to go on stage tomorrow? Do you think I'll be able to do that?

537
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,640
I don't know what I'm talking about either.

538
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,870
Ah, it's driving me crazy.

539
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:49,360
Hey. I've never even dreamed about being a singer.

540
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,980
Right now, finding a part time job is my priority, and I need to eat and survive with Byul.

541
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,560
I need to repay my dad's debt too.

542
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,160
I must've been crazy. What contract?

543
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:08,660
I'm sorry for being buried because of me. So you just go your way.

544
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,720
I'll take care of my business.

545
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,750
Hey, look...

546
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:19,430
So the window on this side won't open all the way down...

547
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,690
- Oh! Hyungnim.
- Huh? 
- She's coming. She's here.

548
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,230
What happened? Did you sign the contract?

549
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:30,230
What is this? You couldn't?

550
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:34,580
I'm sorry. I'll work part time and make sure I repay the money.

551
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:39,170
Hey, are you now just going to leave doing whatever? Are you going to bite me?

552
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:41,730
But what happened to that oppa?

553
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,440
He left.

554
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,460
What?!

555
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:51,290
- But he has nothing to do with me. Really...
- What is that you're holding?

556
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,900
 Next Shine Star Audition
Winner Prize Money: $100,000 

557
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:59,740
$100,000? Hyungnim, the winner of the audition gets $100,000.

558
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:03,090
From the second preliminary round, it will be broadcast on national cable TV.

559
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:07,870
To all the participants who pass the preliminaries, a fixed appearance fee will be provided.

560
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:10,120
There's even an appearance fee.

561
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,620
First, get in.

562
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,550
Why?

563
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,630
Just get in first.

564
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,200
When the preliminaries start tomorrow,

565
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,900
adding more participants... How will that be received by the public?

566
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:27,150
Plus, we've already advertised that this was an audition targeted towards trainees.

567
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:32,650
As for me, I approve a new member coming in.

568
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,190
What is the goal of the Shine Star Audition?

569
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:39,370
Isn't it to bring out good talents to the world under our company's name?

570
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:44,520
If President Jo Hee Mun personally recommended this person, there must be a good reason.

571
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,300
Yes.

572
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,570
I want to meet that person as soon as possible.

573
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,660
Can I ask you what you're thinking?

574
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:01,120
You told me not to worry because the judges are you, Manager Wang, and a critic on our side.

575
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,140
Well, that's true.

576
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,810
The winner will be our Soo In anyway.

577
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:11,820
In an event where our Soo In is the heroine, it's good to have many bridesmaids.

578
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,370
Well, that's true.

579
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,030
Hello.

580
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:19,530
Oh, hey!

581
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,020
Choose one.  
You should go to that audition.

582
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:29,720
You should be wearing at least these kinds of clothes for the audition.

583
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,100
Don't be too burdened,

584
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,450
this is our sincere offer.

585
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:38,090
You heard Hyungnim right?

586
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,300
Pick as much as you want.

587
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:45,120
Our hyungnim picked the best fashion, so pick one without burden,

588
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,670
Here, yeah, things like this.

589
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,700
These kinds of things are good.

590
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,030
Why? What do you think of this?

591
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,530
I don't think it's that one.

592
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,240
Things like this, how about this?

593
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,810
Why?

594
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,180
Let's see.

595
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,530
 This is not a usable card. 

596
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,400
 

597
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,390
Is it President Jo?

598
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,330
What should I do?

599
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,370
What do I do?

600
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,060
Aish!

601
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,640
I have something to say as well.

602
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,480
Honestly you didn't even sign a contract with her, so what do you want me to  do?

603
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,250
Hello?

604
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,000
You're preparing for the audition well, right?

605
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,300
Ah... The thing is... The audition preparation...

606
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,960
We have to do it, right?

607
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,970
- What?
- So what I'm saying is,

608
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:38,360
we went there thinking to sign a contract but they told us to prepare for an audition so...

609
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,950
When did I say that I was going to contract? I never said that.

610
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:41,740
Excuse me?

611
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,500
Are you trying to feed off me?

612
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,860
Did you think training a person was that easy?

613
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:52,390
Wait, hold on a minute. You're not starting to have different thoughts, are you?

614
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:53,410
How could I?

615
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:57,260
Don't forget I'm always watching you with my two eyes.

616
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,830
President, we are doing our best to prepare for the audition.

617
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:02,650
So don't worry about anything.

618
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,720
Don't worry about anything.

619
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,590
All right.

620
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,900
Then I'll trust you.

621
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,830
I can't even run away.

622
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,720
Did they say nothing at Midas?

623
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,640
You said you wanted to be a singer.

624
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,250
Yes.

625
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:28,530
But, do I have to lower my nose?

626
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:31,130
Then that means I have to shave my bone.

627
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:31,910
Why?

628
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:34,220
Ah, these days, Jang Dong Gun doesn't work.

629
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,210
We have to go with that younger trend.

630
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:39,930
Yeah, that's right. Not only should we fix your nose,

631
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:42,940
we should also stretch your eyes and raise your lips.

632
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,750
You know the Joker surgery?

633
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,320
It's pretty sexy.

634
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,640
I already made an appointment at this hospital,

635
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,240
so you just need to make a deposit in here.

636
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,760
Ok?

637
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:06,750
 

638
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:15,170
Aigoo!

639
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,440
Oh, patient Seol Tae Song?

640
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,470
Yes?

641
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:20,330
Let's take a look.

642
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:22,740
Let's see.

643
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,810
Open widely.

644
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:30,380
Okay. Nurse Kim! Please prepare for teeth extraction.

645
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,570
Top two, bottom two.

646
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,990
Wow...

647
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:43,410
Hello?

648
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,250
 Hyung. Where are you? 

649
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,060
Who is this?

650
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,160
Ah, it's me Hyo Yeol.

651
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,510
Shin Hyo Yeol.

652
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:51,910
I heard that you're my manager starting from today.

653
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,600
- What? Me? 
- Whatever.

654
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,510
I'm at the Cheongpyeong villa right now, 
hurry up and come.

655
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:59,190
Hey, do you know how far that is from here?

656
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,090
Hello?

657
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,310
Hey!

658
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,200
You were leaving a young kid at home?

659
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,910
Huh!

660
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:23,680
What, what, did I say something wrong?

661
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,490
But, have you decided to do the audition?

662
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,430
Are you going to wear this?

663
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:38,020
I didn't bring it home because I wanted to wear it either!

664
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,790
Aish.

665
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:44,050
But, why are we doing this audition?

666
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,740
What?

667
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,460
If you're not going to do it, what are you going to do?

668
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,710
Can you tell those guys tomorrow that you're not doing the audition?

669
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:53,230
Not me, you. You, you, you.

670
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,680
- Why are you doing it?
 - That's me!

671
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,560
Stop asking and let's start. Now,

672
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,850
you know we have to finish what others prepared for ten years, in one day, right?

673
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:07,010
Forget about respiration or phonation,

674
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:09,640
let's decide a song first.

675
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:17,480
♪ Kkungttari syabara ppappappa...ppappappa ♪

676
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,970
♪ When you feel gloomy and frustrated ♪

677
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:22,830
It's so frustrating.

678
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:27,960
♪ Your appearance ♪

679
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,600
♪ Like a violet light ♪

680
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,650
♪ You softly came to me ♪

681
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:43,190
♪ A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P God will protect! ♪

682
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:52,450
♪ Hills over hills I climb, but there's another hill left ♪

683
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:57,060
In the end, you can only sing trot.

684
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,220
♪ I climb over and climb over ♪

685
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,510
Stop!

686
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:02,070
- The rhythm and the beat don't match. 
- That's because I'm nervous!

687
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:05,250
Just imagine as if in this universe there is this string attached to your head,

688
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:07,080
and you raise this string.

689
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,330
Sing in this position.

690
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:09,770
Stop!

691
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:12,880
What's wrong with your pronunciation?

692
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:16,430
Bite that and practice. I'm tired.

693
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,960
I'm not sleeping.

694
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,250
♪ I climb over and climb over ♪

695
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,700
What are you doing and not getting on?

696
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,860
Mom, you go up first.

697
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,980
Why?
- I have something to get from the car.

698
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,460
Here you go!

699
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,450
Unnie!

700
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:15,490
Fighting!

701
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:17,070
Jeez.

702
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:18,680
Choi Chun Hee,

703
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,880
you have to pass in order to live.

704
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,480
- Please go.
- Fighting!

705
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,680
Please!

706
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:29,820
Looking at your outfit,

707
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,360
it must be the audition day today.

708
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,420
Is that a compliment?

709
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:36,540
Oh, of course. It suits you.

710
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,820
Thank you.

711
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:49,590
It must really be the audition day.

712
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,200
Sorry.

713
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:05,230
I see you again, Oppa.

714
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,630
Why are you here, Soo In?

715
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:08,970
I'm here for the audition.

716
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:10,610
Why?

717
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:12,730
Your album is coming out, 
so why are you auditioning?

718
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:14,590
I'm still a trainee.

719
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:17,050
So you're going to participate as well?

720
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,280
We're really screwed.

721
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,410
Aren't you getting off?

722
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:28,300
The waiting room is off limits to people other 
than the contestants and audition staff.

723
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,990
Why am I not a staff?

724
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:31,970
Oppa, I'll see you later.

725
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:52,320
This is the person that President Jo recommended, right?

726
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,690
Yes, that's right.

727
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:57,220
- Hello.
- Hello.

728
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,800
All the trainees are curious.

729
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,010
What kind of person you are.

730
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:16,350
♬ You are my Mr. Lee Lee  ♬

738
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,900
Hey.

739
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:50,890
Yes? Me?

740
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:54,900
Yes, you. Can't you see the water bottle is empty?

741
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,210
She's pretty good.

742
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:15,460
Oh, you're strong.

743
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,410
Hey.

744
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:21,740
Water.

745
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:25,840
- Excuse me?
- Why?

746
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,530
Do you have any complaints when I'm asking you for water?

747
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,730
Unnie, I'll get it for you.

748
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:36,650
Here.

749
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:40,690
Wow, look at what she's wearing.

750
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:43,350
This is trending in what era?

751
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,530
Do you sing trot or something? What was it?

752
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,300
I hope you receive a special compliment.

753
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,310
Thank you.

754
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:04,780
She's the big sister around here, so you should understand.

755
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,120
Everyone seems to be sensitive because of the audition.

756
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,000
No wonder, it looked that way.

757
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:19,300
There are many voices of concern regarding our Geun Woo?

758
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:23,150
Do you think that way, too?

759
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:26,470
President, why would I?

760
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,430
Don't worry too much.

761
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:33,200

00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,720
Yes.

773
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,130
That fact alone makes me look forward to this.

 The audition is all about the 'energy battle' with the judges.

00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:32,270
 Don't lose in the eye fight with the judges.

00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:12,100
Hello, I am #47, Choi Chun Hee. Please take good care of me.

796
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:17,280
Ms. Choi Chun Hee. Interestingly, you picked a trot song.

797
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,470
By chance, is there a special reason behind choosing this song?

798
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:23,150
Ah, I...

799
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:30,090
When I was young, I grew up listening to my mother sing, who worked at the marketplace.

800
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:34,080
This is a remake song that my mom sang.

801
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,300
Your mother sang?

802
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:41,070
Yes. She released one album.

803
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:43,430
That was the story.

804
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,950
Have you been a trainee at another agency,

805
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:50,960
uploaded videos on Youtube,

806
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,830
or have any stage experience?

807
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:54,330
I don't.

808
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:55,650
None at all?

809
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:58,450
Yes, none at all.
