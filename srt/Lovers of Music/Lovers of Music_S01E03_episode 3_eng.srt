1
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,400


2
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,840
Hello, I am #47, Choi Chun Hee. Please take good care of me.

3
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,040
- Oh, President..? 
 - Ms. Choi Chun Hee. Interestingly, you picked a trot song.

4
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,580
By any chance, is there a special reason behind choosing this song?

5
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,060
Ah, I...

6
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:58,040
When I was young, I grew up listening to my mother sing.  She worked at the marketplace.

7
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,700
This is a song that my mom remade.

8
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,930
Let's listen to the song.

9
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,540
♬  Hills over hills I climb   ♬ 
What's with her?

10
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,470
♬   But there's another hill left   ♬ 
Aiyoo, that... that.

11
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:29,000
♬  I climb over and over, but the hilly path is endless ♬

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,640
♬ Living in this world, living this life ♬

13
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,780
♬  It's hotter than pepper  ♬ 
 Let's keep watching. It's fun for me.

14
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:45,300
♬  If the two of us are loving and being loved ♬

15
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:52,180
♬ For hundred years, for thousands of years ♬

16
00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:00,200
♬ Fleetly flee, fleetly flee, we will live ♬

17
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:07,380
♬ Living in this world, living this life ♬

18
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,870
♬ It's hotter than pepper ♬

19
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,270
♬ Hills over hills I climb, but there's another hill left ♬

20
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:42,160
She should've been like this from the beginning! 
 ♬ I climb over and climb over but the hilly path is endless ♬

21
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,490
♬ Living in this world, living this life ♬

22
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:55,030
♬ It's hotter than pepper

23
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:01,000
♬ If it's just the two of us loving and being loved ♬

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,320
♬ For a hundred years, for thousands of years ♬

25
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,560
♬ Fleetly flee, fleetly flee, we will live ♬

26
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,760
♬ Living in this world, living this life ♬

27
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,060
♬ It's hotter than pepper ♬

28
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,350
I'm going to have to give you a fail for stage manners.

29
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,300
That bastard.

30
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,910
I...

31
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,430
will give you a pass.

32
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,350
I don't know music very well so I looked at the audience's reactions.

33
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,780
They were all excited. I was excited too.

34
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,670
Isn't that enough for singing?

35
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,830
It was an exciting performance!

36
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,570
However, looking at the techniques

37
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,330
to say it was a professional performance, it was a bit lacking.

38
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,400
So I'm

39
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,330
going to have to give you a fail.

40
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,620
Hey, if she gets two fails, isn't that bad?

41
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,870
She failed.

42
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,390
Congratulations on your first performance.

43
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,470
In the past, there was a singer that I really liked

44
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,850
but you are exactly like her.

45
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,830
So I'm going to become your first fan.

46
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,700
Oh, thank you!

47
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,260
Hey, Choi Chun Hee!

48
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,400
Then, I will see you again later.

49
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,240
Yes. Thank you.

50
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,670
How could you turn around and sing?

51
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,440
Did anyone say they wanted to see your butt and hear you sing?

52
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,480
I even sent you a text message not to lose in the battle of spirits against the judges.

53
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,620
Anyway, because you failed the audition there's no reason for us to see each other anymore.

54
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,400
Hey! You bastards.

55
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,360
You two. How are you going to pay back the money?

56
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,010
I will do a part time job and pay you back for sure.

57
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,780
You're going to pay back 30 million by doing a part time job?

58
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,260
You can't!

59
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,910
Hey. What is that?

60
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,000
It must be pretty valuable if you keep carrying it around everywhere.

61
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,190
How much will it sell for?

62
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,600
This is not something you can buy and sell.

63
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,300
This is what I would hold and die with...

64
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,030
This must sell for a lot of money.

65
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,280
- Give it to me. 
 - No!

66
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,510
- Give it to me. 
 - No, I'd rather you bury me instead.

67
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,960
Why are you guys being like this? Let him go. This is a matter between my dad and me.

68
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,340
Let him go where?

69
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,410
Let go!

70
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,430
Stop!

71
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,500
Choi Chun Hee!

72
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,900
I am President Heo of Heo Entertainment.

73
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,430
Can I talk to you for a bit about signing your contract?

74
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,950
Hey. How much did you say your debt was?

75
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,260
3,000 (x 10,000 = 30 million).

76
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,500
You get 30 million.  I get 30 million. They can take exactly half.

77
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,250
The interest for last week is 2 million won!

78
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,500
How could interest be 2 million won?

79
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,400
Okay, okay. 62 million won. Call!

80
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,650
Yes. That's good. It's exact too.

81
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,760
Yes.

82
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,510
The people who know music will talk alone.

83
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,180
I am an expert at this type  of business.

84
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,300
Just trust me.

85
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,290
Oh, okay, okay. Do well!

86
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,180
Hyungnim. That President Heo...

87
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,470
I feel like I've seen him before.

88
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,450
I don't know.

89
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,970
How could the signing fee be only...

90
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:35,990
If not, then don't.

91
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,140
Can't you give us a little bit more?

92
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,140
Why are you being like this? You know very well.

93
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,020
How much money it takes to take care of a newbie.

94
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,870
Okay. I'll take care of her well.

95
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,060
Get the best staff too.

96
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,280
But what did you do to get into this situation, Jang Joon Hyeon?

97
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,090
Ha. I never even dreamt that I would meet 
a top star like you in this situation.

98
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,790
You can wire the money right away, right?

99
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,140
 Your credit card has been suspended 
due to late payments. 

100
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,580
Why is the talking going on so long?

101
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,670
Hey, shouldn't you go in?

102
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:28,320
No. These type of things the manager should do.

103
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,400
What is that? Are they selling something?

104
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,900
- Hold on to him. 
 - Hey. Put that down.

105
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,440
Uh, why are you being like this?

106
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:38,900
There's only one.

107
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,790
Hey!

108
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,630
Jang Joon Hy-

109
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,570
What is this? Where did he go?

110
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,520
Hey!

111
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,920
He's not there.

112
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,730
This dirty bastard.

113
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,750
Choi Chun Hee.

114
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,550
He already took care of your signing fee.

115
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,240
Your schedule is taken care of by me, okay?

116
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,050
- Excuse me? 
 - Since you've been working hard for the audition,

117
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:35,030
you can rest for today. Starting tomorrow, fighting!

118
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,480
  Contract    

119
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,960
10,000,000 (won)?

120
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,300
This bastard. 
Did he run away after taking this?

121
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,440
How much?

122
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,260
The suspension on your credit card is now lifted.

123
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,590
  38 missed calls
The medal wench    

124
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,280
Stay here and relax.

125
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,690
In life, one can be buried in the grave that he dug himself. 
 (being caught in his own snare) 

126
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,470
You get as much as you gave.

127
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,580
All of this is something that happened because of her. No?

128
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,600
I even got buried in a hole because of her.

129
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,650
  The medal wench    

130
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,520
I'm sorry. If you're like this, my battery will die.

131
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,970
Okay. Don't answer.

132
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,200
If you answer, you'll die in my hands.

133
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,390
  The person you called can't answer the phone   

134
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,570
Where are you? Do you want to die?

135
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,950
Oh, President. Hello.

136
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,420
- Debut today? 
 - Yes. Today.

137
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,230
But even for a short distance run, 
you should prepare at least for a month

138
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,130
and while you have kept in shape. 
 - Hey, it's President Heo.

139
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,460
Oh my.

140
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,640
Aigoo. Our agassi's fate is really something.

141
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,350
Her own boyfriend sold her off 
to this kind of place and ran away.

142
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,960
But

143
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,790
where is this rat, Jang Joon Hyeon?

144
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,890
But Hyungnim, looking at her like this,

145
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,930
our agassi is pretty okay, right?

146
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,770
Hey!

147
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,530
President!

148
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,340
Is this me by any chance?

149
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,820
No way! Is this the way my face looks right now?

150
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,040
Is that why you didn't even let me look at  the mirror?

151
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,000
- I can't do it! 
 - What are you doing? Why are you ripping these precious posters?

152
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,220
Making these cost money.

153
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,620
I can't sing in this type of atmosphere.

154
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,390
You're really funny. Then,

155
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,550
did you think you would stand on a Music Tank stage from the beginning?  (KBS has a show called "Music Bank".) 

156
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,380
- It's not that, but- 
 - You signed the contract.

157
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,180
- 3 times the original singing fee for breach of contract. Can you return 30,000,000 won? 
 - I never received that money.

158
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,410
Wow, you're... Look , look here.

159
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,230
This. Right here. You...

160
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,780
This is the copy of the contract that you put your manager as your proxy regarding to your performance.

161
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,360
This is your signature, right? And, this here.

162
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,320
And this is the contract your manager, Jang Joon Hyeon, gave me.

163
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,460
The signing fee of $10,000 
which Jang Joon Hyeon himself will receive.

164
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,940
I'm right, aren't I? Okay?

165
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,500
Really. Okay,

166
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,540
just work for 6 months.

167
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,150
If you just endure it a little more, you can pay off all your debt.

168
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,260
You know the auditions start in the afternoon, right?

169
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,500
Ah... Yes.

170
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,390
What  ... What are you watching so intently?

171
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,790
The number of clicks (views) is no joke.

172
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,500
She already has a fan club.

173
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,680
La Traviata, Choi Chun Hee's love. 
 ("La Traviata" is translated as "Chun Hee(椿姬)" in Korea.) 

174
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,880
Look at the audience's reactions.

175
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,850
I told you that there's a good feeling to her, right?

176
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,510
You're right...

177
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,950
Without even knowing what was going on,

178
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,530
I gave her a fail. 
 - This friend...

179
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,630
Let's bring her here.

180
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,870
Do you know Choi Chun Hee's contact information?

181
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,390
Hello?

182
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,280
Isn't this Choi Chun Hee's cell phone?

183
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,940
Woo!!

184
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,390
What is this?

185
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:16,550
Where is the glamour?

186
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,190
♬ On a green meadow ♬

187
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,960
♬ in a house we build as pretty as a picture ♬

188
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,210
♬ I want us loving ... ♬

189
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,430
What are you doing?

190
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,170
Don't come near me!

191
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,910
Come here!

192
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,000
Go down, go down!

193
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,160
Go down, quickly!

194
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,810
Aigoo, this girl.

195
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,640
Let me down!

196
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,540
Things got a bit messy.

197
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,000
You saw, right? How the stage was destroyed.

198
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,830
I put a lot of effort on  Choi Chun Hee.

199
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,720
A huge amount of money was spent on outfits,

200
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,430
And I even funded the production of posters.

201
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,080
The CG for this poster cost a couple thousand dollars.

202
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,570
So...

203
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,510
how much is enough?

204
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:28,120
I don't really know because I'm at a really big disadvantage.

205
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,800
Okay, fine. If you give me 10 times the signing fee.

206
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,020
Then I will think about it a bit.

207
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,120
I will give back the original amount.

208
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,560
Think about the quality of the product.

209
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,860
There's way too many flaws.

210
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,320
The quality of the product? Flaws?

211
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,550
It's not like she has technique. She doesn't have good stage manners.

212
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:53,140
Well, it's not like the audience like people who only have technique and good stage manners.

213
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,080
The audience's reactions weren't that good.

214
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,740
You saw earlier that she failed to control the audience's anger.

215
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,490
But, still. At the audition it was okay, wasn't it?

216
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,370
President Jo, didn't you also see her potential

217
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,280
and come here?

218
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,210
She is not suitable for the stage here.

219
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,800
She will only cause accidents every day like today.

220
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,050
Her temper

221
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,490
is pretty amazing too.

222
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,910
Well what do you mean her temper... Her temper seemed okay.

223
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,870
And decisively,

224
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,180
she's not sexy. 
 - Sexy...

225
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,450
She's not.

226
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,090
But the amount I gave her is-

227
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,050
I was listening and... You two are really... I'm right here.

228
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,950
How can you say it in front of me? Am I an object?

229
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,610
What are you two doing?

230
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,470
- What? You? 
 - You. You.

231
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,020
What did I tell you? Her temper is amazing.

232
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,830
I admit it.

233
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,500
Did you get your feelings hurt when I said you weren't sexy?

234
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,860
Well, it's the truth.

235
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,660
Look here, ahjussis.

236
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,890
I feel really wronged to death for being sold here once.

237
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,440
But you want me to be sold again? Even worse, to this person?

238
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,080
You asked me to sign you last time.

239
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,660
Go. Go. I'm not going to follow you.

240
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,780
I'm never going to follow you. So know that's how it is.

241
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,100
If you say so yourself,

242
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,750
good luck.

243
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,370
Where are you going while we were talking... President Jo!

244
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,180
President Jo! I was joking 
when I said ten times the amount of the contract fee!

245
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,050
Miss Choi Chun Hee!

246
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,170
Wait a minute, Choi Chun Hee.

247
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,700
What is it, again?

248
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,750
I had something I was curious about from before. 
Just because I was curious, I'm asking.

249
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,590
- How do you know my father? 
 - Excuse me?

250
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,590
My step...?

251
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,350
No, you're not my stepmom.

252
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,670
By any chance,

253
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,050
are you my hidden younger sister?

254
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,490
What? Younger sister?

255
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,620
Stepmom?

256
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,880
Do I look that laughable to you?

257
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,990
Because I'm here like this,

258
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,640
I look like someone you can just say anything to, doesn't it?

259
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,430
Look here. I am also really curious about your father.

260
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:05,020
So if you're that curious go ask your dad yourself, you psycho-like person.

261
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,320
Really.

262
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:23,710


263
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,420
Mom.

264
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,910
What do I do now?

265
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,790
Dad isn't here either

266
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,740
and I'm so tired.

267
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,200
Unni!

268
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,560
Have you been well?

269
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,960
But... Where did you go?

270
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,280
Your lips are red.

271
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,560
Oh, this.

272
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,280
I was trying to erase my stage make-up earlier.

273
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,800
Did you sing on a stage?

274
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,980
Wow! So did you wear that sparkly dress?

275
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,630
Umm... well...

276
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,910
I want to go see you sing too!

277
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,710
That can't be allowed.

278
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,480
I can't?

279
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,940
Then... do I have to wait to see you on the television?

280
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,890
When will you come out on the television?

281
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,270
When will you come out?

282
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:28,390
  Shine Star Final Audition    

283
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,800
♬ In this amazing moment, ♬

284
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:37,030
♬ Our bright love back then ♬

285
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:41,590
♬ I will miss it. ♬

286
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,480
Why is it only 50,000 won ($50)?

287
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,040
Give me my 10,000,000 won, 
you son of a b**ch!

288
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,150
Customer, customer? Are you alright?

289
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,190
Ah, yes.

290
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,060
If you need anything, then-

291
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,190
I must be seeing these because things I've eaten aren't okay.

292
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,450
This is what humans eat.

293
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,860
It's been a long time since I've used a knife. Shall we?

294
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,430
 Tuna Mayo; JunJu Mix  

295
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,370
My appetite is going to disappear.

296
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,210
Go away, go away.

297
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,590
Hey. Hey, let this ahjussi eat.

298
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:19,570
You can buy it on your own when you grow up.

299
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,390
These sisters are getting on my nerves.

300
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,210
Hey, kiddo.

301
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,190
Ahjussi!

302
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:48,680
I brought you here to show you what real humans eat.

303
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,340
You're thankful, right?

304
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,610
The food that you eat every day is not considered food.

305
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,630
Hey, you should take care of your own things!

306
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,980
Do you think the world is easy?

307
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,630
Just because you are young doesn't mean 
that people are going to feed it to you.

308
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,020
Things like that don't exist in this world.

309
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,140
There, eat.

310
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,600
But,

311
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,150
what is your unni doing nowadays?

312
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,730
My unni? She's busy these days.

313
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,190
Unni became a singer like you.

314
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,590
Ah, is that so?

315
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,760
She is going to sing while wearing a sparkling dress. Also,

316
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,410
she is going to appear on TV! 
-Really?

317
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,540
The PDs in the stations are crazy. How can your sister appear on TV?

318
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,970
That's what you call "wasting airwaves", you know?

319
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,520
What's "wasting airwaves"?

320
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,140
Ah, never mind.

321
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,380
It was useless for me to be concerned. She is fine on her own.

322
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,930
Doesn't it taste amazing? Isn't this the first time you tried something like this?

323
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:12,810
Hey, kiddo, why are you only eating bread? You're not touching the good food.

324
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,690
- There's blood. 
- Blood?

325
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,090
Where? Where did you get hurt?

326
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,850
It's not cooked.

327
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,110
Hey, meat is supposed to taste the best when it's cooked like this.

328
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,330
Okay, let's just say that that's the reason why you are not eating the steak. Why aren't you eating this?

329
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,600
It taste weird.

330
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,080
This is bitter, and the color of this is weird. And then...

331
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,070
Be quiet, be quiet!

332
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,730
Hey, do you know how much it is?

333
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,730
Hey, if you always eat old triangle kimbap,

334
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,110
you are going to live a triangle kimbap life.

335
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:51,880
You shouldn't be blamed for anything. It's not like you tried good food.

336
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,670
Choose one.

337
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:00,460
Why? You can't eat this either?

338
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,330
I don't know what to choose.

339
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:08,140
I want to eat this. This one looks delicious, too.

340
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,940
And this, too.

341
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:14,810
Ah,  what are you agonizing over,  just take it all.

342
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:17,620
Really! All?

343
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,730
-Are you sure you can eat everything? 
-Yeah.

344
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,510
Here.

345
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,600
- Do you like it a lot? 
- Yes, I like it.

346
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,990
Now I am not indebted to you guys.

347
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,040
I really am not.

348
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,960
Anyway, I'm sorry for getting mad at you before.

349
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,540
- It's fine.
- Thank you!

350
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,510
I wish that your sister had at least half of your personality.

351
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,310
I don't have money. I don't have anyone.

352
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:25,580
I don't have luck.

353
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:33,280
How could I forget my lyrics at that moment?!

354
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,180
Wow, I found it!

355
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,800
Ajumma, ddeokbokki, ddeokbokki,! Quickly! One serving. Hurry!

356
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,790
- I don't have any dddeokbokki.
- Pardon?

357
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,180
Then what is that?

358
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,580
This, is for this young lady.

359
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,830
I will give you ten dollars. Ten dollars!

360
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,290
Ah, seriously.

361
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,850
Bastard. You outstanding bastard.

362
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,560
What are you to take my ddeokbokki? I ordered it first!

363
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,800
No, just, well...

364
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,020
it's very important. My life depends on it.

365
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,200
Can't you just give it to me, this once?

366
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,890
My life isn't easy, either.

367
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,180
Ddeokbokki.

368
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,330
Ajumma. Fifty dollars.

369
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:27,420
Ahjumma, sixty dollars.

370
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,270
Seventy dollars.

371
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,060
Eighty dollars.

372
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,210
Hundred dollars, I will give you a hundred dollars.

373
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,290
Ahjumma!

374
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,540
Ajumma, I don't want it anymore.

375
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,550
You are a crazy guy.

376
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,640
What kind of ddeokbokki are you buying for a hundred dollars?

377
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,920
You must be filthy rich. 
You rich bastard!

378
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,300
You are a weird man. 
You earned a hundred dollars because of me.

379
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,520
A hundred dollars....

380
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,720
This...!

381
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,090
Here.

382
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:03,060
- Ajumma!
- Ajumma?!

383
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,290
I'm going to take this and go, all right?

384
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,650
Hey, you bastard!

385
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,310
Wow, why is there no place that sells ddeokbokki 
in this area? Do you know how far I went to get this?

386
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:24,440
I went all the way to the subway station. 
This ddeokbokki  is expensive.

387
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,820
Here, eat this.

388
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,180
I'm so hungry.

389
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,260
You worked hard.

390
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,210
Why, does it taste bad?

391
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,900
It doesn't taste that good now.

392
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,830
When I ate the steak, 
I really wanted something spicy,

393
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,790
but I missed the timing.

394
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,540
Because you came so late.

395
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,100
Ah, correct. Sorry. Sorry.

396
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,370
You should have bought this when you left.

397
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,010
Oh, okay.

398
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,290
But can I eat this first and then go? I'm hungry.
 I didn't eat anything today.

399
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,950
I will go there right away after eating this.

400
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:08,430
So what is it? Are you telling me to wait till you are done eating?

401
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,880
Jang Joon Hyeon must have let things like this pass.

402
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,140
Ah, what can you do? I don't let these things pass.

403
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:28,500
What are you doing? I'm Sin Hyo Yeol!

404
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,200
I'm Sin Hyo Yeol.

405
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,610
I'm bored.

406
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,550
I ruined my eyes.

407
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:55,100
  She debuted as a solo. 

408
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:00,490
I'm here with the legend, Yang Joo Hee, and winner of the Shine Star audition,

409
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,920
Park Soo In. Hello, nice to meet you.

410
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,360
Hello.

411
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,040
Park Soo In, congratulations on winning.

412
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,850
Mother, how happy are you?

413
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,020
Because of my daughter, I'm getting attention.

414
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,230
Have you guys ever thought about doing a duet album?

415
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:22,500
If we have an opportunity, it will be nice to create an album with my mother.

416
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,650
Park Soo In, you are very popular nowadays. Do you feel your popularity?

417
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,070
You did it.

418
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,940
When I go out on the streets, many people recognize me.

419
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,310
And I feel like I've became famous.

420
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:38,040
I'm sorry. But this credit card is maxed out.

421
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,990
Pardon?

422
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,120
Already?

423
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,560
♬ C.I.A.R.A Let's go ♬

424
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,450
♬ Oh I'm so glad you came
'Cause you are the cutest thing  ♬  

425
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,920
♬  Beauty should be your name
And I should be your lady  ♬  

426
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,400
Yes, Mom.

427
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,670
You said you'd pick me up.
I've been waiting for you.

428
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:12,080
Then who should I have dinner with?

429
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,940
I hate eating by myself the most!

430
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,740
Omo, President!

431
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,510
We meet again!

432
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,090
Are you going home?

433
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,170
You made eye contact with me just now.

434
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,110
What? When did I?

435
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:36,340
Just now, when you were inside.

436
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,390
Were you practicing?

437
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,840
Yes, I don't have much time until my debut stage.

438
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,630
You must be busy then.

439
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,910
I was going to ask you to eat dinner together.

440
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,740
Work hard.

441
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,600
W...wait,  Mr President!

442
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,520
Yes?

443
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,550
Would you buy me dinner?

444
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,190
I wanted you to congratulate me for winning the audition.

445
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,890
You should buy me dinner, Soo In.

446
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,940
You promised me last time

447
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,560
that you would buy me dinner if you win.

448
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,390
Ah, that's right.

449
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,430
I know a really really good restaurant.

450
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,450
Why aren't you eating?

451
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,040
Don't you like udon?

452
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,750
It's not that but,

453
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:33,670
I expected to eat something more special since I'm treating.

454
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,960
The udon here is very special.

455
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,130
You can't find a restaurant this good even in Kagawa Prefecture.

456
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,070
Before this restaurant opened, I flew (to Japan) in the morning when I craved udon.

457
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,020
We saved a lot today.

458
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,430
Is that so?

459
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,160
For me, the best thing is what I like.

460
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,270
Why? Are you disappointed?

461
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,380
No.

462
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:56,480
As a matter of fact, I like this kind of hidden gem restaurant, too.

463
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:13,050
Aish, where can I get money from?

464
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,090
  First message 

465
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,870
 Joon Hyeon, 

466
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:37,640
  I shouldn't have done that to you... 

467
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,130
 I will repay you for sure. Someday I will repay.   

468
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,980
 Joon Hyeon, 

469
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,460
 Joon Hyeon... 

470
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,800
He's overacting.

471
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,190
Well, I treated him really well.

472
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,710
He can't be a human if he doesn't know that.

473
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:02,030
They say 'You reap what you sow".

474
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,390
Tae Song Hyung, I'm at Midas to see you.

475
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:11,070
What makes you so busy that you did not pick up the phone or stay  at home?

476
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,990
You said you will repay me.

477
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:15,020
You can repay me now.

478
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,840
What is it?

479
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,790
What do we need to talk about in a quiet place?

480
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,180
Listen carefully.

481
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,780
I

482
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,220
quit being a manager.

483
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,320
I'm not your manager any more.

484
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,670
What?
- I will also be performing on the stage.

485
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,130
The company told me that they will make me an album.

486
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,450
Every Tom, Dick and Harry wants to be a singer now.

487
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:31,190
Why? Is that funny to you?

488
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,050
Yes, it is.The President never thought about making you a singer from the beginning.

489
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:39,610
It's because he decided to put you as my manager from the beginning.

490
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,600
What noise it this?

491
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,460
What do you mean by that?

492
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,210
Let me give you some advice.

493
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,530
The sooner you give up the better.

494
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,940
That way, you can be less ruined. 
Look how Jang Joon Hyeon fell.

495
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,220
It would have been nice if he stepped back at the right time.

496
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,890
That, that rude bastard!

497
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,530
He struggled so much to keep his place.

498
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,800
In the end, it leads to "cool ruining"!

499
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,510
It means that being ruined coolly.

500
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,190
Hey!

501
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,770
Joon Hyeon is not a guy whom you can speak recklessly about!

502
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,790
His personality is bad but

503
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:15,050
he really does the real music. Do you know that?

504
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,530
Ah, really.

505
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,950
Tae Song Hyung...
--So you're on Jang Joon Hyeon's side now?

506
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:23,050
It really feels weird to hear it from you.

507
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,780
You know what I mean.

508
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,880
Why did he fall to the bottom like that?

509
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,260
You made it happen!

510
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,520
I felt so thankful for you at the time.

511
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,700
No.

512
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,580
It wasn't me.

513
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,150
He was going to fall anyway. 
The President made all the plans.

514
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,080
He couldn't have escaped.

515
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,740
It wasn't me.

516
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,470
But, you were the one who actually carried out the plan.

517
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:48,250
You leaked the information to the reporters and spread the pictures everywhere.

518
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:52,310
Honestly, you said you wanted to have revenge on him.

519
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:56,440
No, I didn't! No!

520
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,180
Why did I say something wrong?

521
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,770
Aigo.

522
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,750
Tell me.

523
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,390
What have you done to me!?

524
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:11,860
Tell me the truth, you bastard!

525
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,930
It... it wasn't me.

526
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,440
I didn't do it.

527
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,910
- Where are you going?
- What? You can't control him?

528
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,380
Stay close to Hyo Yeol, team leader Na!

529
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,860
Yes, I understand.

530
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,300
What brings you here, Jang Joon Hyeon?

531
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,190
It was you!

532
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:34,270
It was you who planned from the beginning to the end to make me fail like this.

533
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,850
Son of a b**ch!

534
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:39,900
How could you do this to me?
You built this building thanks to me.

535
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,450
Jang Joon Hyeon.

536
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,810
- Please calm down.
- Get lost!

537
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,850
Team leader Na, you can go now.

538
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:49,610
I don't know what he might do...
Go now!

539
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,410
Kim Woo Gap, listen carefully.

540
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,190
I'm an artist.

541
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,540
The god of music, Jang Joon Hyeon!

542
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,200
I'm different from those idols you mass produce.

543
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,550
I will proudly step up again!

544
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:12,870
I won't fall down like this!

545
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:17,690
You will step up again?

546
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,660
When you stabbed my back,

547
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,400
you know what I was thinking about?

548
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:35,560
I was thinking that I will kill you.

549
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,840
Without letting the rats or birds know (in secret).

550
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:47,420
But I wasn't satisfied with that idea.

551
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,910
Because it will be over too soon.

552
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:55,890
So I decided to take the thing most valuable to you.

553
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:01,020
Which is music.

554
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,700
Because you are nothing without music.

555
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,700
You're not living without music.

556
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,430
You're just a useless loser.

557
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,660
From now on,  neither a single nor an album,

558
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,320
or the instrumental music you like,

559
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,260
you won't be able to release any songs of yours.

560
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:21,520
You're done in this field

561
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,480
forever!

562
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,790
You jerk, I'm going to kill you!

563
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,950
I will kill you and set fire to the building!

564
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,490
Die!
-What are you doing out there!

565
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,740
Die! Let me go!

566
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:51,700
 Seoul Western District Court 

567
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,130
Hello, President.

568
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,690
This is Choi Chun Hee.

569
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:09,850
Here.

570
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:12,050
Thank you, President.

571
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:24,280
  Bill; $947 dollars. 

572
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:28,360
Excuse me, is this...

573
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,750
Does it mean that my appearance fee is $947?

574
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,670
Your appearance fee so far was $450.

575
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,940
But...

576
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,240
Hair, makeup, outfits, and filming equipment

577
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,060
in total is $1,397.

578
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:47,270
So paying  up now, the fee until now, $947 dollars.

579
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:51,990
- Excuse me?
- Ah, that's right, you don't have the money.

580
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:57,480
Then, there is an easy way to make money.

581
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,280
What is it?

582
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,560
- It's nothing much.

583
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,260
You just have to have fun playing and singing.

584
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,760
In a room with the customer.

585
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,330
Excuse me?

586
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,690
Without a deposit

587
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,580
it's hard to get a room like this.

588
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,360
You said you have a child too.

589
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,450
Ah, it's my younger sister.

590
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,210
Who said she wasn't?

591
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,100
Anyway, you need to decide quickly.

592
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,790
Several people have come to look already today.

593
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,700
Today we...

594
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,700
are going as far as we can.

595
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,560
Hey, Byeol.

596
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,330
Oh, Chun Hee.  It's me.

597
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,040
Coach.

598
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,480
Byeol was in my mother's store so she's with me right now.

599
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,410
I'm planning to take her home now.

600
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:52,740
Thank you, Coach.  I'll be there soon.

601
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,300
Yes.

602
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,030
The clean up is done.

603
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,920
You worked hard.
- Thank you.

604
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:12,710
Yes, what is it?

605
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:16,890
The young lady you nominated did not make the cut.

606
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:19,080
Did you already know?

607
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,310
I wanted to let you know.

608
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:25,670
Since when have you reported everything to me?

609
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:28,610
That young lady's personality is not to be taken lightly.

610
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:30,010
Is that so?
- Yes.

611
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:33,570
But where are you right now, Father?

612
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:35,090
You're never home lately.

613
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:39,180
What do you mean, where?  I'm in Hawaii, you rascal!

614
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:44,720
Wow, the weather is so nice. There are so many people along the beach.

615
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,230
There is a cute girl under the palm tree.

616
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,380
Aloha!

617
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,710
Aloha!

618
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,200
I'll do it!

619
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,220
What?

620
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:03,430
Singing in the room... I'll do it.

621
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:05,090
Then I'll make lots of money, right?

622
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:09,030
Of course!  There's no other job like it.

623
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:11,170
I'll do it.

624
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,930
Let's pack all you belongings in here.

625
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,380
Are we moving?  Where are we going?

626
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,270
What about Dad?

627
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,880
I'll send a text message to Dad.

628
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,150
Don't worry about it.

629
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:45,430
What if Dad can't find us?

630
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:49,220
No, there's no way that will happen.

631
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,630
Why wouldn't Dad be able to find us?

632
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:56,930
Let's pack all the important things for now.  I'll buy everything else for you later.

633
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,360
Move away from there.

634
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,710
Are you hiding something inside there?

635
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,320
Move away.

636
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,230
Move!

637
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,020
Where did you get these from?

638
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:23,890
I asked you where you got this from!

639
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:26,030
Did you perhaps...
- It's not.  It's not!

640
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,650
Then what is it?  Where did you get this?

641
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:32,760
If you didn't steal it, then why can't you say where you got this from?

642
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,630
A friend gave it to me.

643
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:38,740
Which friend?

644
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:44,680
Which friend?
- Ahjusshi.

645
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,060
You met with Jang Joon Hyeon?

646
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,450
That jerk bought you this?

647
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:57,020
Where is that jerk?  Where is he now?

648
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,850
I don't know, really.

649
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:01,210
I'm not lying.

650
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,850
Do you know what money he bought this with?

651
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:07,920
That jerk conned your sister with this and...

652
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:20,270
Never mind.  How could you be at fault?

653
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:25,700
Let's pack our things later.

654
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,020
 In the Olympic road in Seoul,  

655
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,970
Jang Joon Hyeon, you son of a b**ch.

656
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:43,960


657
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,870
Unni.

658
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,100
Ahjusshi is on the television.

659
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,520
What?

660
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:56,740
 The rumors didn't stop. 

661
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:59,560
 This time he barged into his ex- company illegally 

662
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,390
 while being drunk and made a fuss. 

663
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:04,580
Ahjusshi must really be a celebrity.

664
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,640
Tell the truth!

665
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,910
I told you everything.  Really.

666
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:15,520
Is this all you are going to say?

667
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:23,230
 What should I do?  I'm sorry, but I won't be able to attend the farewell party today. 

668
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:26,780
 I have something to take care of, you see. 

669
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,380
 Let's stay in contact sometimes. 

670
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,520
 Even in the future, we should have a good relationship. 

671
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,460
 As we have had until now. 

672
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,990
 You're out of this industry forever. 

673
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:10,680
Jang Joon Hyeon, come out.

674
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:14,520
Midas CEO Kim Wu Gap came here personally

675
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,560
to drop the charges.

676
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,650
So, from now on, get yourself together, and live a straight  life.

677
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:26,170
Still, at one time you were a successful person.

678
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:30,790
Sign here.

679
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:33,510
- Whoa...
- Be quiet!

680
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:35,570
What's so interesting?

681
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:37,850
Let's look together.

682
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,300
 Withdrawal of charges 

683
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:19,690
 ♬ The hills have no end even after climbing one after another. ♬ 

684
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:27,830
 ♬ Living in the world, living your life in this world, ♬ 

685
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:34,480
 ♬ Is more hot than red hot peppers. ♬  

686
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:41,200
 ♬ If I'm with you, who I love, ♬ 

687
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,450
 ♬ Thousand or ten thousand years, ♬ 

688
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:50,830
What. What are you doing now?

689
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:55,550
 ♬ I will keep living well. ♬ 

690
00:48:55,550 --> 00:49:03,000
 ♬ Living in this world, living my life in this world, ♬ 

691
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,260
 ♬ Is more hot than red hot peppers. ♬ 

692
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,010
This rascal, when he's out this time, I will break him apart.

693
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:17,420
This guy is basically really...

694
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:22,380
Hey! You bastard!

695
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:26,630
What should I do?  We didn't prepare any tofu.

696
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:30,720
You douche, you sold your girlfriend and jumped off a two-story building

697
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,210
and ran away. To think you ended up here?

698
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:38,020
You homeless punk.

699
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:55,620
Are you kidding me right now?

700
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:59,130
All I have right now is this.

701
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,180
So whether you cut my wrist or drown me.

702
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,700
It's your decision.

703
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,200
But what are you two going to do with me?

704
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,430
If you bury me in the ground, you won't get any money.

705
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:12,820
You might as well collect properly with interest.

706
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:16,680
Double the interest.  Just give me three months.

707
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:23,920
Jang Joon Hyeon?

708
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,250
You said that  Choi Chun Hee passed, right?

709
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,410
You feel good about her?

710
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:30,720
Then I will be responsible for her and make her into a singer.

711
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,890
What are you talking about all of sudden?

712
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:35,210
If I were to take that woman away, I need $30,000 including penalty.

713
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:37,950
Can Shine Star invest that money?

714
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:42,600
Why should I listen to your suggestions?

715
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,770
For what reason?

716
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,580
I will leave this here as a  collateral.

717
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:51,390
No matter where you sell this, 
 it will be worth more than $30,000 dollars.

718
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:56,240
$30,000?

719
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,770
Ah, what a joke.

720
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:01,350
Do you know how much trouble she caused?

721
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:04,250
The set and the mike broke, and so on!

722
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:06,420
And the filming fee and fee for outfits and makeup...

723
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,440
Then, how much will it take?

724
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,220
Well, in terms of money, about...

725
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,750
How large a number should I call out?

726
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:18,850
The thing is...

727
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:22,910
Truthfully, I want you more than money.

728
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:25,080
What do you mean?

729
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,840
♬ If it's not you, ♬

730
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:35,570
♬ I can not live. ♬

731
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:37,800
Ah, this is killing me.

732
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,920
♬ I love you. ♬

733
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,470
All of the decent ladies have already been 
called to other rooms.

734
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,670
She is pretty good at singing.

735
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:49,940
You rascal.

736
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,890
You really don't know my taste( in terms of women). 

737
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:54,780
Woah, this is really killing me.

738
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,120
Here, let's change the atmosphere.

739
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:01,420
Here, sing an energetic song.

740
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,150
Here.

741
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:20,800
Tip, tip.

742
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:29,910
No need for a tip.

743
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,410
Are you crazy?

744
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:36,710
Get out!

745
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:41,300
So are you telling me to stand on your stage?

746
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:43,970
On the stage?

747
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:48,150
Who would put you on a stage?

748
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:49,610
Then?

749
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:52,070
Go and sing in one of the rooms.

750
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:53,930
What?

751
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:59,300
Sing the background music in a room.

752
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,750
If you just listen to the customer's demands,

753
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,970
the earnings are pretty high.

754
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:06,910
What do you think?

755
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,090
There is a ruckus in room 22.

756
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:15,520
They said we sent in a stick or a broom which sang a song.

757
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,430
A stick?

758
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:20,270
Broomstick?

759
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:33,990
I'm telling you to sing a fun song!

760
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:37,110
Here,

761
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,260
Oh, isn't he a singer?

762
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,740
Let's go.

763
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:48,190
My hyungnim is talking.

764
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:50,240
Are you her pimp?

765
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,890
If you're her pimp,

766
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:54,340
you should be waiting after cooking food at home.

767
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,130
Why are you acting up rashly?

768
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:59,960
Do you have food in your house?

769
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,300
I'm talking...

770
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,640
This is shocking.

771
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,300
Wouldn't you put that down!

772
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:09,440
How dare you touch my hyungnim's drink?!

773
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:17,050
Attack me. I'm here to die anyway.

774
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:19,650
Great.  I didn't want to die alone.

775
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:20,860
Let's all die together.

776
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,050
Hyungnim, he's crazy.

777
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:25,400
Are you a&nbsp;black belt?

778
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,110
Make him so that he will never be able to stand on a stage again.

779
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,230
Endure it even if it hurts

780
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:40,940
You, who don't even know his place.

781
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,470
Yah!

782
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:54,220
Are you crazy?

783
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,320
He is a black belt.

784
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,980
I don't care if you hit me, but

785
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,310
don't touch this woman.

786
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:02,860
I need this woman.

787
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:06,760
I can't live without this woman.

788
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,310
This is quite romantic.

789
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:13,300
Don't move!

790
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:17,340
You rascals!!

791
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,790
Yah, take the woman and get out.

792
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:21,610
Now!

793
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,860
I will take care of it.

794
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:29,070
No,

795
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:31,160
that's not right.

796
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,040
Are you a black belt?

797
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,760
No, if I do this, you guys are going to bleed.

798
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,200
Hey!

799
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,520
Stop right there!

800
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,570
Hey, stop.

801
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,430
Hey!

802
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,870
Hey, you!

803
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,200
Does it hurt?

804
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,950
So, you can feel the pain too, I guess.

805
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:18,170
Do you know what I have been through because of you?

806
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:20,900
Are you even human?

807
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,090
You conning bastard?

808
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,580
Let's go.

809
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,590
Yah.

810
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:38,420
Go? Go where?

811
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,210
Are you not going to let go?

812
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,640
Let's go to our Shine Star.

813
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,150
I'll make you a real singer.

814
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:52,680
No matter how stupid I am, do you think that I will be deceived by you again?

815
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,020
You said that you will make me a singer.

816
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,650
But after making me write an agreement, 
you ran away with $10,000.

817
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:59,740
What is it this time?

818
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:03,120
Where are you going to sell me this time?

819
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:05,900
And,

820
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:10,270
with the money you got after selling me, did you want to buy shoes for Byeol?

821
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:14,370
With that money, are you happy that

822
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:16,140
you made my sister on your side?

823
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:19,450
You call yourself a human? Huh?

824
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,480
What you said is right.

825
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:30,280
I am sorry.

826
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,670
There's nothing for me to say to you.

827
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:34,170
Sorry...

828
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,210
What are you sorry about?

829
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,870
Do you even understand what it means to be sorry?

830
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,460
Honestly, the things that happened,

831
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,630
that I was turned like this,

832
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:53,360
was all because of you. So I detested you.

833
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:57,130
But that wasn't true.

834
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,430
First off, I apologize.

835
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:05,560
And for running away with the money,

836
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:09,330
I'm sorry.

837
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:11,890
I didn't know that you were singing 
on stages like that.

838
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:15,810
I thought that you were being trained on good stages.

839
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:20,840
I know that everything I say right now sounds like an excuse.

840
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,240
But everything you say is correct.

841
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,160
And I did something that I should not have done to you.

842
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,900
Please forgive me just once, Choi Chun Hee.

843
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:45,190
I thought about it.

844
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:48,110
Regardless of how much I think about it,

845
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:50,970
I only have you right now.

846
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:53,670
The only way I can survive in this world,

847
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:55,840
there's no one but you.

848
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:01,270
Honestly, I can't guarantee the result.

849
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:04,660
But I am able to make you a singer.

850
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,460
So even when I don't deserve this,

851
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:10,310
Just once more.

852
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,800
Give me one more chance.

853
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,060
Please Choi Chun Hee.

854
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:46,100
