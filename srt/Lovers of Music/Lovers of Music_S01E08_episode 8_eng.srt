2
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,260
 Episode 8 

3
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,440
Don't you think about the person who waits at home and prepares food for you?

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,700
Hey, sorry.

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,370
- Let's go.
- Call.

6
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,960
Why are you hitting me?

7
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,540
You don't even think about the people waiting at home. Only busy with what she needs to do.

8
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,430
But where did my cell phone go?

9
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,190
See? See? Look at her.

10
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,170
- Hello?
- Yes.

11
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,530
Oh, President. Seems like I left my phone in your car.

12
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,840
- Oh, right.
- Sister, Ahjussi says to eat.

13
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,060
 Hey, what are you doing? 

14
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,260
 First coming in late, now making a phone call? 

15
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,410
President, did you go far already?

16
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,320
If you didn't go far yet I'll come and pick it up.

17
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,020
I'm sorry, but I'm already far away.

18
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,530
I'll give you the phone tomorrow.

19
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,870
 Ok, understood. Please go safely. 

20
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,970
- Come and eat.
- I ate already.

21
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,420
What?

22
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,360
How can you eat while making us wait for you?

23
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,260
Sorry.

24
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,300
But what did you prepare?

25
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,320
- Can I taste this?
- Whatever, go ahead.

26
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,990
Oh,  Jang Joon Hyeon!

27
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,700
That can't be, I'll have to eat a bit. Please give me some rice.

28
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,390
Yeah?

29
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,560
 How can you hit me emotionally? 

30
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,710
 - You laughed right?
 - No, not now... 

31
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,150
This time

32
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,610
it hurts.

33
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,430
It grew so much!

34
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,450
Teacher said she'll give a reward for the student with a good plant diary!

35
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,630
We can try it right?

36
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,990
It really tastes like lettuce. It's amazing.

37
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,330
Wow you're really flexible.

38
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,930
Does it hurt a lot?

39
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,190
Stop!

40
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,590
President, hello.

41
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,250
Here.

42
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,530
Thank you.

43
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,940
Not as easy as this.

44
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,760
I want to eat dinner at your house today.

45
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,070
I haven't eaten home made food in a long time.

46
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,650
I'll take this as a yes and go.

47
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,790
See you later.

48
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,790
What's up with him? He does whatever he wants.

49
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,700
But why does this guy have your phone?

50
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,020
Well, there was such a situation.

51
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,700
You were together with that guy yesterday?

52
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,600
You're not seriously letting him come home?

53
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,620
Hey, you could have just said no before.
Why are you making all this fuss ?

54
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,660
How can I refuse him under these circumstances?

55
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,050
Aigo, when am I going to clean everything.

56
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,120
Just do it roughly. It's not like someone amazing is coming over.

57
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,450
Hey, I'll give you this so you go buy some groceries.

58
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,920
- What?
- Oh, you know the lettuce in the front yard?

59
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,400
Get the lettuce, too.

60
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,890
Are you crazy?

61
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,360
I don't know about anything else, but you can never touch that lettuce.

62
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,510
Go.

63
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,160
- You're here?
- I'm so tired.

64
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,350
Good job.

65
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,230
- What are you doing?
- What?

66
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,670
- Go out.
- Go where?

67
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,820
The president is coming, if you are here too it would seem weird.

68
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,080
- What do you mean it seems weird?
- Go out and come back two hours later.

69
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,760
Two hours?

70
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,510
Go. Bye!

71
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,880
- Where did Ahjussi go?
- A guest is coming today.

72
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,350
Byeol, you can help me with cleaning the house.

73
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,770
I'm going to go crazy because of that president.

74
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,630
But where should I be for two hours?

75
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,310
 Didn't I tell you the cabinet above the sink was dangerous? 

76
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,990
 Be careful. 

77
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,130
NO!

78
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,470
The dangerous thing is not the cabinet door 
but you, you jerk!

79
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,910
Wow.

80
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,360
Wow, you really cook well.

81
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,740
- Actually Ahjussi did...
- Byeol, eat a lot.

82
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,970
I'm relieved that you think it's tasty.

83
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,620
I didn't prepare much but please eat a lot.

84
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,060
Because I eat alone every day, 
eating together tastes good.

85
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,890
Then, come every day!

86
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,810
- If that's okay, it would be great for me!
- Hey, hey.

87
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,810
But your sister says I can't (come every day).

88
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:31,690
Actually, I asked your sister out but got rejected.

89
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,250
I would be grateful if you could help me.

90
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,500
Ok! How can I help?

91
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,080
Byeol, don't say useless stuff and let's  eat. Here beans, beans.

92
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,900
You don't like the president? I do.

93
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,280
Byeol.

94
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,960
Byeol.

95
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,620
Who is there?

96
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,180
Oh! What a tasty smell!

97
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,900
Hey! What brings you here?

98
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,950
You must have prepared a lot of delicious food!

99
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,180
How did you know?

100
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,270
- Ahjussi!
- Hi.

101
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,480
Oh, the president is here too.

102
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,350
Jang Joon Hyeon.

103
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:29,230
Wow, meat! I love meat!

104
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,550
President, please drink this.

105
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,150
Yes.

106
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,550
Why do I like lettuce so much these days?

107
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,920
- Please have some stew.
- Just mixing it is delicious as well.

108
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,610
Yes. Thank you.

109
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,050
Tasty.

110
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,160
I ate meat and fruit today. I'm so full.

111
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,990
- Aren't you going to leave quickly?
- Why should I?

112
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,500
Are you going to be like this?

113
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,050
I haven't eaten so well in a long time.

114
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,210
Didn't I eat too much just for returning your phone?

115
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,740
As long as you know.

116
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,800
No, I'm thankful that you think it's tasty.

117
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,940
I should have treated you to dinner earlier.

118
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,460
Then I'll go now.

119
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,480
Yes.

120
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,910
Jang Joon Hyeon, aren't you leaving?

121
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,250
Me?

122
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,450
Go home safely.

123
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,900
Thank you for dinner, I ate well.

124
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,730
Bye, Miss Little Lady.

125
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,320
Goodbye.

126
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,980
Excuse me.

127
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,350
I'm saying this because I'm concerned, but don't come here often from now on.

128
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,450
It doesn't look good for the president 
to drop by the home of his company's singer.

129
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:12,720
What should I do?  I intend to come here often in the future.

130
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,520
- What did you say?
- Because I like eating the food that Choi Chun Hee makes for me.

131
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,680
Excuse me?

132
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,120
Ah, right.  I didn't come here today as the company president.

133
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,230
What are you saying?

134
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,580
But you understood what I said.

135
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,560
- Then...
- Yes.

136
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,380
I like Choi Chun Hee.

137
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:52,550
Just what's happening here?

138
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,520
Then, are the three of them in a love triangle?

139
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:08,560
Hey!  How can you come in like that all of a sudden?  I was completely flustered.

140
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,180
Hey, where are you going?  Hey!

141
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,140
You're the one at fault!  Why are you the one getting angry?

142
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,430
Hey.

143
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,230
Are you mad because I picked the lettuce?

144
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,930
- Hey!
- What?

145
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,780
You like Choi Chun Hee?

146
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,580
You.

147
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,580
What about you?

148
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,260
Here, Byeol.

149
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,080
Eat.

150
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,500
Now, let's eat!

151
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,000
Let's eat.

152
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,240
 It's not the eyes. 

153
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,080
 It's not the nose. 

154
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,420
Byeol.

155
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,100
 Her mouth is not pretty either. 

156
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:18,610
 Well, her smile is... a bit... okay. 

157
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,320
What are you doing?

158
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,070
You've been acting suspicious since yesterday.

159
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,300
What do you mean?

160
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,290
You...

161
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,880
are still upset because of the lettuce, aren't you?

162
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,620
What?

163
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,330
Sheesh!  I'm sorry!

164
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,430
Whoa!  You're in third place!

165
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,240
What is?

166
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,520
What is she third place in?

167
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,420
Oh, Choi Chun Hee!

168
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,480
Wow!

169
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:11,220


170
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,720
♬  Climbing hill after hill   ♬

171
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,520
Look at him.
♬  there is one more hill left   ♬

172
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,370
You're gaining popularity recently with a unique trot remake album.

173
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:27,160
How does it feel?  If you want to sing love songs, you probably need some dating experience.

174
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,280
Well I... have never dated because I was busy with athletics.

175
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,410
Athletics?

176
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,350
Yes, I was a marathon runner.

177
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,880
Wow. That's very unique.

178
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,710
Then, what is your best trait?

179
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,580
Well...

180
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,430
since I was an athlete, I'm pretty strong.

181
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,230
She's going too far again, too far.

182
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,300
Why would she talk about being strong there?

183
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,370
This is the car that Choi Chun Hee will be using from now on.

184
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,090
Oh, I don't need such a nice car!

185
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,710
What do you mean you don't need it!  Of course the company should give you a car!

186
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,070
Then you can move quickly and make money.

187
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,150
Really, you!

188
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,370
Well, what you said isn't wrong.  Then, work hard.

189
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,310
Thank you!  I've got a car.

190
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,810
Hey, this is a really nice car.

191
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,960
This is standard these days.

192
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,220
Why aren't you wearing the scarf?

193
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,770
I told you that you need to protect your throat.   Come here!

194
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,250
But it feels uncomfortable.

195
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,360
When you ride a car on a hot day like this, you have the air conditioning on.

196
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,050
- So you need to wear the scarf right away.  Got it?
- Yes.

197
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,850
Stop!  Don't drink the coffee, it's not good 
for your throat.  Drink water.

198
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,750
But I get sleepy when I drive.

199
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,180
 Wow, this is an honor!  To be driven in a car by you. 

200
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,000
 Relax a bit.  You just have to make a right turn up there.. 

201
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,880
 - A right turn?
-Yes, right turn.. 

202
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,810
 Right, right, right.. 

203
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,770
 No, no, right turn.  Right turn!. 

204
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,410
 No, no, no, not that.. 

205
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,780
 There, there.. 

206
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,470
 -- J- J- Joon Hyeon!  G- go slowly, slowly!
-- Just be quiet!. 

207
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,930
 G-go slowly, slowly.  S-stop, stop.. 

208
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,360
 -- J-Joon Hyeon, g- go slowly for real, slowly.
-- Shush.. 

209
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,930
 -Oh, oh, oh, oh! 
-Oh!. 

210
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,200
 Oh really.. 

211
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,210
Get closer.  More, more, really close.

212
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,510
Okay.  This time can you lean your face slightly on her shoulder?

213
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,860
Good, good.

214
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,380
This time, put your hand around Chun Hee's waist.

215
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,740
Like that.

216
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,760
Good, good.  Good.  Okay!

217
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,480
- That bastard, how far is he lowering his hand?
- Just stick together a little more.

218
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,620
Okay.

219
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,060
Chun Hee,

220
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,590
- have you never dated?
 - No.

221
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,540
This is a couple look.

222
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:22,580
You have to look like you're in love. Make your eyes mellow and shine.

223
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,710
Try it!

224
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,150
Look. Look, really.

225
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,730
Like this... lovingly.

226
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,010
Darling.

227
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,020
Why does a mountain gear shoot have to be soft and moist?

228
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,250
It's weird.

229
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,670
Where is he going now?

230
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,110
Chun Hee, your feeling today was good.

231
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,190
- Is it really your first time filming an advertisement?
- Yes.

232
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,090
Your eyes were very alive.

233
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:58,660
The manager can stay in the hall.

234
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,320
Eat deliciously.

235
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,280
Soo In!

236
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,240
Unni!

237
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,720
The first pitch is also going to be thrown 
by Choi Chun Hee, not you.

238
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,020
What did you say?

239
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,060
 Trot Singer Choi Chun Hee 
Throws First Pitch at Jamsil Stadium 

240
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,590
What are you going to do now?

241
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,590
You lost to her at the chart rank, 
and you lost the advertisements as well.

242
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,270
And now the first pitch?

243
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,560
What more will you have taken away?

244
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,030
Park Soo In, listen closely!

245
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,650
This is a cold world.

246
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,570
Even though it took you 8 years to get up here,

247
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,120
going down takes less than a day.

248
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,000
If you're going to get pushed out by a trot singer like Choi Chun Hee,

249
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,320
just give it all up right now!  Understand?

250
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,780
It must be hard for you lately.

251
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,460
Ahjussi.

252
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,550
Whenever I went on stage, I was scared.

253
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:42,030
Because of the pressure of having to be solely responsible for the three minutes on stage.

254
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,460
But now that I've come off the stage,

255
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,030
it's harder to endure the lonely feeling.

256
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,930
It's me.

257
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,700
See if you can find anything on Choi Chun Hee.  Anything.

258
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,790
If you look, something should come out.

259
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,340
What's wrong with you? Are you sick?

260
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,230
You know your schedule is hectic.

261
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,060
I'm just tired.

262
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,530
Should I make you feel better?

263
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,970
How?

264
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,970
Tada!

265
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,610
What is it?

266
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,180
Open it.

267
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,300
You were upset I didn't buy yours last time.

268
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,150
When did I?

269
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,140
Ah this, the model guy wore it.

270
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,020
It isn't worn, I bought it!

271
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,530
Really?

272
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,560
If you're not going to have it then I'll have it.

273
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,900
Where are you touching? Just ...

274
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,880
Just work.

275
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:18,390
Geez I should've been the male model for this.

276
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:21,650
Thanks Choi Chun Hee. I'll wear it well.

277
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:27,570
This jacket is nice and not that hot!

278
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:30,240
Should I wear this and go hiking...?

279
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:36,780
Why is that dude picking lettuce from another person's house?

280
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,470
What are you doing here!

281
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,740
President?

282
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,970
Wow! This lettuce is very well grown!

283
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,300
Why are you in another person's neighbourhood?

284
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,500
What do you mean another person's neighbourhood? I live there.

285
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,670
Eh?!

286
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,580
It just turned out that way.

287
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,250
By the way...

288
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,630
Are things working out well?

289
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,900
A while ago we went up to the third place 
on   Inkigayo. (A chart rank program by SBS) 

290
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,420
You didn't forget did you? If Choi Chun Hee gets first you're releasing my album.

291
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,340
It's near here.

292
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,500
 Let's meet at the Sundae Gook Bab House 
at 4 o' clock. - Trot God. 

293
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,500
Welcome Customer!

294
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,950
Uh excuse me?

295
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,370
Yes, Customer?

296
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:52,480
Don't you know me?

297
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,390
I- I'm not sure, Customer, are you perhaps here to eat some Sundae Gook Bab?

298
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,180
Y- Yes.

299
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,460
H- Hold on a moment.

300
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,810
Daebak. Daebak situation.

301
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,330
Why did she come here?

302
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,570
- Hello?
- Hello?

303
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,210
Yes, Trot God?

304
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:19,610
Oh yes, Bal-God (Ballad Goddess). 
Where are you at?

305
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,020
Sorry it's not that. I just now

306
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,610
met my destined person

307
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,660
So I think I have to postpone our meeting. 
Are you ok with that?

308
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,420
Ah well, it can't be helped.

309
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,140
Since you met your destined person, 
I have to concede.

310
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,600
Instead you have to do well. Fighting!

311
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,760
Fighting!

312
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,040
Are you...?

313
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,870
Trot... God?

314
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,330
Ballad Goddess?

315
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,630
Daebak situation!

316
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,980
When you're feeling down, it's ok to rest.

317
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,940
What's this?

318
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,920
Go with the President. It's hard to find this kind of ticket.

319
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:27,320


320
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,690
What ya doing?

321
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,410
Oh, I was hot.

322
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,790
Then what about us?

323
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,320
I mean we're making some money now, why not buy another fan?

324
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,200
We have no money for that. Give me that.

325
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,350
I'm too hot, I can't sleep.

326
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,470
We can't sleep either!

327
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,370
Hey!

328
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,280
What about Byeol?

329
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,740
Why are you talking about Byeol here?

330
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,470
-Ah, whatever. 
- Ah, whatever.

331
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,680
Whatever for me too!

332
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,810
Did you come to see me?

333
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,440
Yes.

334
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,270
Do you want to watch some opera this evening?

335
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,980
I got two tickets.  I heard they're hard to get.

336
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:47,340
Sorry, can we go next time? I have to go somewhere right now.

337
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,780
- Sure.
- Sorry

338
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,440
Ah yes...

339
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,180
President did you call?

340
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,370
Get in.

341
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:04,610
Why, is there something wrong?

342
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:05,900
If you go, you'll know.

343
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,270
Why?

344
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,280
- Get in.
- Get in.

345
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,440
But ... where exactly are we going?

346
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,140
- A friend asked me to invite you.
- What?

347
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,980
When I talked about you,

348
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,850
he said he was curious about you..

349
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,260
Are you ok with that ?

350
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,610
I... Umm... Uhh...

351
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,310
♫   I climb hill after hill, but there's another hill left. I climb over and over  ♫

352
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,430
 Jang Joon Hyeon. 

353
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,390
Aren't you going to answer the phone?

354
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,910
Hello?

355
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,430
Where are you now?

356
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,320
- Are you still in the practice room?
- Yeah.

357
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,590
Y-Yup. But why?

358
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,670
I'm going to pick you up.

359
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,900
You?

360
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,460
I practiced driving, so I can pick you up.

361
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,770
N- No, you don't have to.

362
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,750
Why? I'm at the intersection in front of the company

363
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,860
- so I'll be there soon.
- Don't come!

364
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,510
I have to meet someone.

365
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,880
An appointment? You didn't say anything about that.

366
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,630
It just happened. Talk to you later.

367
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,280
H- Hello?

368
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,840
Why does she have to meet someone all of a sudden?

369
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,220
I'm driving by myself for the first time.

370
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,450
If you don't want to, fine!

371
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,730
- Does  your friend live  here?
- Probably.

372
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,700
Dal Bong, have you been well?

373
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,920
I told you about him, my friend Dal Bong. 
My best friend.

374
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,890
So the friend you were talking about earlier was...

375
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:02,740
You! Hi, nice to meet you!

376
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,650
He's so pretty looking.

377
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,350
How old is he?

378
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,760
- Since he's 20; so in human years, 50?
- 50?

379
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,660
So don't look at the horse's ears.

380
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,880
Look way... over there. Do you want to hold the reins?

381
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,770
Me? Oh he's moving!

382
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,780
Good.

383
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,930
Wow you can ride horses well. Now try riding by yourself.

384
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,160
By myself? I'm scared though.

385
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,370
Come on, in this world you have to live on your own anyway.

386
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:33,540
Ah well, I'll be...

387
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,830
By your side.

388
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,640
I think Dal Bong is really calm.

389
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,990
How hard it must've been to get here.

390
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,480
Probably went through heaven and hell 12 times.

391
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,500
Really? It doesn't look like that.

392
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,860
Do you know what's really effective in opening a scared heart?

393
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,640
Waiting.

394
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,380
At first it was interesting, but as time passed  it was really fun.

395
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,500
I wanted to get closer.

396
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:19,310
So I got interested and watched.

397
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:24,510
And stayed by his side. But then this rascal ...

398
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,150
Then I figured out.

399
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:39,000
If you patiently wait, 
they'll open their hearts one day.

400
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,410
This is why I like you Choi Chun Hee.

401
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,660
You are really  productive. 

402
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,880
Let's go!

403
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,120
Dal Bong, did you also hear my stomach growling?

404
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,220
Thank you.

405
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,400
Is it delicious?

406
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,710
Yes, it is delicious.

407
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,360
Horse meat is usually good.

408
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:28,180
Thank you, Dal Bong.

409
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,920
You're very gullible, Miss Choi Chun Hee.

410
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,780
Do you really think

411
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,790
I would do something like that to Dal Bong?

412
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:48,650
I was not able to eat it.

413
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,080
Eat up.

414
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,690
Yes.

415
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,710
I packed some for your sister, too, so take it with you later.

416
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:01,740
Thank you.

417
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:06,210
But can you pack one more for me?

418
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:09,230
I want to take it and eat it at home.

419
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,250
Thank you.

420
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,430
Ah, do it well.

421
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,730
Ahjussi, you are not that much better either!

422
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,160
Byeol.

423
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,050
Unni is here.

424
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,020
Aigoo. Was it fun today?

425
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,320
Why is there a steak here?

426
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,690
A friend gave it to me.

427
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,380
You have a friend like that to treat you like this?

428
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,570
Let's eat.

429
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,800
Eat.

430
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,850
I saw your car here and thought maybe...

431
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,740
Weren't you supposed to go to the opera today?

432
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,090
Yup. I'm tired.

433
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,860
Why? Is the president busy?

434
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,900
It's not like that.

435
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:08,450
Ok, rest then.

436
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:21,820
Soo In is pretty and can sing well so you don't have to worry about her getting married.

437
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,360
If there is a good man, 
please introduce him to us.

438
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,350
At your party last time, was it the Shine Star's son?

439
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,910
The two of them look good together.

440
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:34,260
But he looks like he has a woman already.

441
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,460
Really?

442
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,530
My son and he went to the same school in America.

443
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,990
You know about it too, right?

444
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:41,840
Yes.

445
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,460
Was it yesterday? I heard he took some girl horse-riding.

446
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,860
Executive Director Wang,

447
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,010
Please check if the president has a woman.

448
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,520
Here you go.

449
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,590
Thank you.

450
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,810
Choi Chun Hee,

451
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,520
come out and talk to me a bit.

452
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,720
Where were you yesterday?

453
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,810
What?

454
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:26,490
Did you go horseback riding yesterday?

455
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,810
Yes.

456
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,790
Exactly with what motive did you come into Shine Star?

457
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,770
Of course I came to sing...

458
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:34,170
Then sing, don't date!

459
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:34,990
What?

460
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:38,200
The president in one hand 
and Joon Hyeon in the other hand.

461
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,980
With two men in the palms of your hands.

462
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,990
I didn't really look at you this way, but really

463
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,570
you're not an average girl Choi Chun Hee.

464
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:48,660
- Sunbae, you must be misunderstanding something.
- Misunderstanding?

465
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,920
Then is it also my misunderstanding that you went horseback riding with the president yesterday?

466
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,330
I'm warning you.

467
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:59,370
If you plan to succeed by seducing men, then go find a different workplace.

468
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,090
Shine Star is not a place for a person like you to stay at.

469
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:05,150
- Sunbae. 
- Don't call me sunbae anymore.

470
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:09,240
I've never had a hoobae like you.

471
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,340
What are you doing?

472
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,830
- Don't interfere!
- How can I not interfere when Choi Chun Hee is the singer I produce?

473
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,170
Choi Chun Hee! Choi Chun Hee! Choi Chun Hee!

474
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:30,750
Why is everyone protecting only Choi Chun Hee?

475
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,930
- Soo In.
- Oppa, you should get your head straight.

476
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:36,780
You said she is the singer you're producing? Then you should manage her properly!

477
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,070
Wouldn't it be bad to have a rumor with the president?

478
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,810
What do you mean?

479
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:46,090
Choi Chun Hee is seducing the president and everyone is talking about it. You didn't know?

480
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,500
What do you know about Choi Chun Hee?

481
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,860
She is not that kind of person.

482
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,050
I guess you really don't know about her.

483
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,950
Did you know they went  horseback riding yesterday?

484
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,740
What?

485
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,060
Did you find out if the president has a woman?

486
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,650
Better than that, I found out something interesting.

487
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,580
Interesting?

488
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,070
President Jo Geun Wu!

489
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,010
I have something to talk to you about.

490
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,280
Who are you?

491
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,350
You should look at this first.

492
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,220
Get in. I will drive.

493
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,250
You will?

494
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,950
Turn left at that pharmacy.

495
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,220
I know.

496
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,660
Hey, Hey, there are people walking.

497
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,830
Stop nagging!

498
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,120
Because of you, we almost had an accident.

499
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:28,620
No, no, I thought you didn't see it.

500
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,010
Jang Joon Hyeon.

501
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,940
Have a talk with me for a moment.

502
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,710
If you have something to say, say it quickly.

503
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,650
Get out of Choi Chun Hee's house immediately.

504
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:58,150
- What? 
 - About you living at that house...

505
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,260
I already know.

506
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,410
It doesn't matter.

507
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,520
The manager is living together with his trainee.

508
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,710
Well, I can understand.

509
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,010
But the problem is not me.

510
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,160
One reporter came to me.

511
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,100
If I give him double the amount Director Yang is giving,

512
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,610
he said he would hand over those pictures.

513
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:45,120
I may have blocked it this time, but this will not be the last.

514
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:53,510
Thank you for your advice, but

515
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,350
I can't leave this house now. You want to know why?

516
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:59,590
Just like you said I'm Choi Chun Hee's manager.

517
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:03,740
Tell the people to think whatever they want of it. I don't mind it anyway.

518
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,150
A singer's career ends with one breath of scandal.

519
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,410
You, Jang Joon Hyeon, should know this very well.

520
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,810
You will get out of that house, right?

521
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,990
Because, Jang Joon Hyeon,

522
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,130
you like Choi Chun Hee.

523
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,450
I'll take care of my own business.

524
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,500
Ahjussi?

525
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,640
Yes.

526
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,550
Why does it take you so long to park?

527
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:52,150
Well, this is pretty fast for you.

528
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,360
Here.

529
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,850
You should've told us sooner!

530
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,770
This pretty boy.

531
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,900
But you're not going to eat?

532
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,060
Eat.

533
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,920
We're going to eat it all then.

534
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,560
Here, eat.

535
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:34,400
I don't know if you should be doing this, working at the same company and all.

536
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,700
Then should you be doing this as well, president?

537
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,750
Taking away the advertisements and first pitch throwing event at the baseball game from the same company singer.

538
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,910
Why are you protecting only Choi Chun Hee?

539
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,930
That. Did I?

540
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,700
Well I could have protected her.

541
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,370
Actually I like Choi Chun Hee.

542
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:02,020
Excuse me?

543
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:06,230
So don't bother Choi Chun Hee anymore.

544
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:10,160
It's getting on my nerves.

545
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,040
Why? Is your throat sore?

546
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,710
I'll go refill it with warm water.

547
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,990
Ah, excuse me.

548
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,780
I'm Choi Chun Hee's fan.

549
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,750
Can you give this to Choi Chun Hee?

550
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:01,430
♫   I climb hill after  hill,  ♫

551
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:04,770
♫  But there's another hill left.  ♫

552
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:08,880
♫  I climb over and over  ♫

553
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,660
That looks delicious. Want to eat it?

554
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,200
It looks like it's a gift from the heart.

555
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,560
Here. You want some?

556
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,950
Here.

557
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,150
- Wow chicken!
- There are cherries, too.

558
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,030
 I listen to your song well every day. 

559
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,680
 Because I listen to your song while I work, 

560
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,550
 I feel like I'm always with you. 

561
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:48,790
 There is a bellflower tea 
which  I boiled when your mother would sing. 

562
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:51,100
 I'm sending you one package. 

563
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:58,620
Why? What is that?

564
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,350
Dad?

565
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,950
It's Dad!

566
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,450
- Dad!
- See,

567
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:12,240
Dad sent you another letter because you appear on TV and sing.

568
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,930
That's right, Byeol.

569
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,940
  I'm Choi Chun Hee's fan. 

570
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,420
  Can you give this to Choi Chun Hee? 

571
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,880
I will sing harder.

572
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,910
Ah, I should have recognized him right away.

573
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,440
What are you doing?

574
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,920
Are you crying?

575
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,620
You&nbsp;see,

576
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,240
I'm going to work really hard.

577
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,250
Because from working hard, I want to quickly live

578
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,320
with Byeol and my dad.

579
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,930
You're going to help me, right?

580
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:30,700
 A singer's career ends with one breath of scandal. 

581
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,540
  You, Jang Joon Hyeon, should know this very well.  

582
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,410
     

583
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,060
What do you mean by you're stopping here?

584
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,960
She even went to third place on the music popularity charts.

585
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,650
I said I'm going to give you an album if she reaches first  place!

586
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:11,190
I'm saying I don't want it.

587
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,490
This bastard, did you eat something wrong?

588
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:18,210
Hey, your career is right in front of you. What the heck are you saying right now?

589
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,310
There's a saying that even the Pyongyang's ruler position can be refused if one doesn't want it.

590
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,750
I don't want it, so

591
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,790
our contract is automatically broken.

592
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,800
I'm sorry.

593
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,720
Hey, you. Hey, kiddo!

594
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:39,210
♬   I believe although you're not at my side  ♬ 
  

595
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,510
She needs to take care of her throat. 
♬   As it is, we aren't separated.  ♫

596
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:44,410
Don't ever let her drink cold beverages.
♬   As it is, we aren't separated.  ♫

597
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,900
Please boil her some bellflower tea.
♬   As it is, we aren't separated.  ♫

598
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:51,340
She needs to regularly wear a scarf around her neck. 
♫   I believe   ♫  

599
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,020
This is the most important, 
♫   The path  which comes to me  ♫

600
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,890
but because she's a pyscho 
 ♫  is just a little farther coming back.  ♫

601
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,310
she won't stop once she starts practicing.
 ♫  is just a little farther coming back.  ♫

602
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:07,160
Stop her from time to time. 
♫   Everything past  in memory  ♫

603
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,130
Do you have some incurable disease? Are you going somewhere? 
 ♫ makes me shed tears while I am in pain. ♫ 

604
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,720
I know right? Why are you leaving the manager stuff to us?
♫  makes me shed tears while I am in pain. ♫ 

605
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,010
Ah...so, then

606
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:20,730
agencies here and there are asking me to contract for a new album.

607
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,810
Choi Chun Hee is all grown now. 
♫   Only you, who will not cry as much as me  ♫

608
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:25,060
I have to do my music now as well.
♫   Only you, who will not cry as much as me  ♫

609
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:28,200
Do you know how much time I sacrificed for her?
♫  are tearlessly easily leaving me  ♫

610
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:33,060
Do you think we can do it?
♫  are tearlessly easily leaving me  ♫

611
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,090
♫ In knowing that you will someday return again to me ♫ 

612
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,760
Where are we going right now?
♫  In  knowing that you will someday return again to me  ♫

613
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,790
To study music theory.
♫  In  knowing that you will someday return again to me  ♫

614
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,460
Is it a good place?

615
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:46,850
Yeah 
 ♫  I believe and being here  ♫

616
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,360
It would be nice if Byeol came along as well.
♫   I'll wait  ♫

617
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,860
♫   I'll wait  ♫

618
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,330
Hey, where is this place? 
    

619
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:58,120
Go in and see.

620
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:12,850
This is really the sounds of waves.

621
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:15,270
The sea sound.

622
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:29,450


623
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,830
- Choi Chun Hee.
- Yes?

624
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:38,000
How long has it been since you traveled last time?

625
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:42,060
This is the first since the high school field trip.

626
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,450
Do you like it?

627
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:45,620
Yeah, it's fun.

628
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,480
I like it, too.

629
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,170
- Choi Chun Hee.
- What?

630
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:55,670
Thank you.

631
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:57,330
About what?

632
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,260
Just... everything.

633
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:05,840
Me too, I'm thankful for taking me here today.

634
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,100
I'm sorry.

635
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,600
About what?

636
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,210
I'm just saying sorry. I'm sorry.

637
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:19,760
Well you did do a lot of things to me.

638
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,790
Me too.

639
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,120
Are we all good?

640
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,890
- Excuse me.
- What?

641
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:37,880
What are you doing?

642
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,830
Coloring.

643
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:48,230
♫  Your day will become mine.  ♫

644
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:53,060
Hey, take this stuff. Thank you. 
 ♬  Before I knew it,  like my feelings  ♬

645
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:58,160
♬  I'm growing to resemble you,  ♬

646
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,660
Do you like it? Look at your taste on stuff. 
 ♬  I must be in love with you   ♬

647
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:07,240
Why? I think it's pretty.

648
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:12,010
- Work hard.
- Yes good bye.

649
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:13,900
Come quickly.

650
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,840
Ah, it's nice!

651
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,020
This is a special point that only I know of.

652
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:29,180
You're the first person I brought here.

653
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,390
Really? I'm honored.

654
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:40,850
You have those moments in life,

655
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:45,430
getting sad, annoyed and depressed for no reason.

656
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,750
That's right...

657
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:49,220
When you want to get comforted by someone.

658
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,140
Close your eyes.

659
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:56,910
And feel it.

660
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:12,010
If you're here by yourself,

661
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:13,830
you'll feel at peace.

662
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,990
Ah. That's really good.

663
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:27,220
Choi Chun Hee,

664
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:36,360
no matter where you are,

665
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,640
you're going to be a shining singer.

666
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:45,260
Hey, why are you like this? So cheesy.

667
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,880
This Jang Joon Hyeon is great at this kind of stuff.

668
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,350
I know this song.

669
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:00,980
- You do?
- Yep.

670
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,060
Oh, you know something other than Trot?

671
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:06,540
Hey, don't look down on me.  I hear lots of   songs!

672
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:12,140
♫ I really like you, ♫

673
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:18,850
♫ I want to tell you, but I can't muster up the courage. ♫

674
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:24,780
♫ I really like you. ♫

675
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:31,300
♫ I want to tell you, I can't muster up the courage. ♫

676
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:37,860
♫ I want to say that I love you. ♫

677
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:43,960
♫ Fret myself like this. ♫

678
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:50,320
♫ What if you were to leave? ♫

679
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:55,750
♫ Always just worry like a fool. ♫

680
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:59,400
♫ Us  ♫

681
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,620
1, 2, 3, 4,

682
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:06,280
♫ When I catch your eyes, I look away flustered. ♫

683
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,630
♫ When I stand before you, I blush like a fool. ♫

684
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:17,580
♫ Though I practiced over and over so many times
that I love you. ♫

685
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:22,520
♫ Unable to confess... ♫

686
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,620
What do you want to eat?

687
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:40,750
Triangular Gim Bab (triangle seaweed roll) fried rice!

688
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:42,990
The kind that still has time left on the expiration date...

689
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:47,610
Why do you ask?

690
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:50,150
I was going to cook for you.

691
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,880
Why?

692
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,180
Because I want to.

693
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:11,500
Boy, when is it going to be ready? 
 If it were me, it would've been done a long time ago.

694
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,730
Ahjussi, hurry up!  I'm hungry.

695
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:17,510
It's almost done.

696
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,470
Here we go.  It's done!

697
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:32,370
Quickly-bring-it-heeeere~

698
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,900
Wow, it looks delicious!

699
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:37,330
Wow, there are a lot of ingredients.

700
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,960
Let's see...

701
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,360
Take your time and chew carefully.

702
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:48,260
Won't you join in?

703
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,060
- I'm okay.
- What do you mean you're okay?

704
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,940
Here you go.  Say "Ah".

705
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,040
It's delicious, isn't it?

706
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:03,900
You can just tell me inside.  Why the move outside?

707
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:13,950
I... will be moving out of your house.

708
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,590
What?

709
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:20,380
I'm going to quit being your manager as well.

710
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:23,220
Isn't this a bit sudden?

711
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,130
It isn't sudden.

712
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:29,490
Did you think I'd always take care of your needs?

713
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,740
You can live on now.

714
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:36,680
People who recognize you have increased too.

715
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,590
Because of what I am now, you may have forgotten ,

716
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:44,450
but I'm a singer.  I should also prepare for the album.

717
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:46,310
Don't you think?

718
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,950
What you say is right, but

719
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:52,540
my reaction is like this because you didn't say anything
until now.

720
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:58,340
You asked me before as to why I was trying to make you into a singer?

721
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,500
To tell you the truth, there was a deal.

722
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:06,680
President Jo Hee Mun said that if I succeed in
making you into a singer

723
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,410
he will record my come-back album.

724
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:10,630
What?

725
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:15,780
That's why this artist Jang Joon Hyeon
made you into a trot singer.

726
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,730
I'm saying that I wasn't staying around because you're cute.

727
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,400
Do you comprehend it now?

728
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,980
Hey... Then what's to become of me?

729
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:33,230
We should each walk our paths.

730
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,940
I'm going in first.

731
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:26,950
Here you go.

732
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:28,190
I'm headed to school and will be back.

733
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:31,510
Byeol, did you pack your observation diary?

734
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:32,280
Oops.

735
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,000
Aigoo, come here.

736
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,110
You can't forget from now on, okay?

737
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:41,160
You can just get it for me like now.

738
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:43,030
Come here.

739
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,590
All done.

740
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:49,610
I'll be back.

741
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:51,230
Byeol,

742
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:53,600
if you get 100% on your observation diary,
it's all owing to me.

743
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:56,100
You better treat me.

744
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,140
- Bye Unni...
- Okay.

745
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,370
Your first appointment is a radio show, right?  Let's go.

746
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,030
Just a minute.

747
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:26,320
Why?

748
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:28,100
Let's break a leg.

749
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,640
Okay.

750
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:35,050
Hello, here's Ms. Choi Chun Hee.

751
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:36,810
- Hello.
- Hello, I'm Choi Chun Hee.

752
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,310
Ms. Choi Chun Hee, please take your seat.

753
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:39,800
Okay.

754
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,490
Good luck.

755
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,870
You're going to be here, right?

756
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,020
Of course.

757
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,900
You have to stay right here.

758
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:18,250


759
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:33,790
♫ The moment you stood next to you. ♫

760
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:40,150
♫ I like the look of you so much. ♫

761
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:44,950
♫ Yesterday, although I may have cried today♫

762
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:48,130
♫ but tomorrow, because of you, ♫

763
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:52,800
♫ I will be happy. ♫

764
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:59,540
♫ Not the looks, not anything else, no, no. ♫

765
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:04,720
♫ All I required was your gentle love. ♫

766
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:11,670
♫ All the time that has passed, ♫

767
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:17,970
Let's go.

♫ I can do.  I know nothing but love. ♫

770
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:55,900
♫  Hesitating to say something,  ♫

771
00:58:55,900 --> 00:59:00,330
♫  then I just smiled.  ♫

772
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:05,500
♫   Like the passing rain shower,  ♫

00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:31,990
♫  Like my feeling for you that grew unknowingly,  ♫

777
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:38,800
♫  I'm growing to resemble you.This must be love. ♫
