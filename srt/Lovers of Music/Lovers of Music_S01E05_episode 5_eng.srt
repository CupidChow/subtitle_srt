1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,900
 .

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,750
Just one moment, please!

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,170
Here, is, another, ball!

4
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,460
1,000 balls!

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,270
Come on, put it in.  Quickly!

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,970
Ms. Choi Chun Hee, then you've succeeded in this mission.

7
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,940
Thank you!

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,090
Wow!  Awesome!

9
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,070
Thank you!

10
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,130
Snake's going to come out!  
(Wives tale about whistling conjuring snakes)

11
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,250
-Oh, stop!
- Wh- a- a- t is it?

12
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,460
Where do you think you're going in?

13
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,420
Your spot is way over there, don't you know?

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,440
Have you any idea how much hardship I suffered for that last ball?

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,590
How can you not even say "thank you"?

16
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,240
Ah, thank you for  that.   Sleep tight~

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,370
Hey...  Unbelievable.

18
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,550
That wretched wench.

19
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,450
Byeol, Unni successfully finished her first mission today.

20
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,250
Proud of me, aren't you?

21
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,000
 President Heo. 

22
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,230
Hello.

23
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,880
Ah, it slipped my mind and I forgot to return the costume.

24
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,820
I will return it shortly.  Yes.

25
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,400
Yes.

26
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,440
Where did he disappear to already?

27
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,790
Ah, smile a bit.  Smile.  Here we go.

28
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,920
Hyungnim, how are you doing?  Did you wait long, Hyungnim?

29
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,240
Hey you ass.  What do you take me for?

30
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,140
Make me wait?  Do you know who I am?

31
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,730
Ah, it wasn't that, but it was just that we were going to
bring a good act just for you...

32
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,710
Hyungnim, I'm sorry.  We will be right back.

33
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,340
Crap.

34
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,010
He's got his panties in a bunch without you messing around,

35
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,600
what in the heck is this?  Do you want to see me dead?

36
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,130
This is a service on a whole other level.

37
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,130
Man, his guitar handling is totally like Jang Joon Hyeon.

38
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,800
Hey.  What are you?

39
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,320
What are you doing?

40
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,110
Are you playing at Jang Joon Hyeon to piss me off?

41
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,640
In front of this  Sin Hyo Yeol, huh?!

42
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,170
Alright.  You there, won't you remove your mask, eh?

43
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,560
Let's see if your face look similar as well.  Take it off.

44
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,440
Remove your mask, punk.

45
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,220
Look at this punk.

46
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,640
Hey, aish.

47
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,910
Ouch.

48
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,920
Daaaang, Jang Joon Hyeon!

49
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,120
Man, THIS is where I run into Jang Joon Hyeon!

50
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,310
How can Jang Joon Hyeon end up as an  "Oburi" 
(a slang for "accompanist")  at a joint like this?

51
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,470
Why didn't you just stay put as my manager
if you were going to sink to this level?

52
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,110
Seol Tae Song quit thanks to you as well.
What do you say?

53
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,060
What?  Does it feel bad?

54
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,080
I heard you're a manager for a trot singer.  No?

55
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,180
Though you can be her manager, but not be mine...
Is that it?

56
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,690
I guess you have some pride left in your situation.

57
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,560
 Make a claim for dry cleaning fee.  However much. 

58
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,630
 President!  President! 

59
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,210
Go ahead.  Hit.  Try hitting me.

60
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,800
That's right.  Land one on me like you do usually.

61
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,850
Hey, hey, hey!  Are you crazy to do this to a customer?

62
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,970
Aigoo.  Were you hurt anywhere?

63
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,430
 I'm so sorry, Customer. 

64
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,100
 - Manage your staff better, eh?
- Yes, I got it. 

65
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,220
 Better, huh?! 

66
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,110
 Yes, better. 

67
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,790
 I'm sorry.  Sorry. 

68
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,420
Hey you daft punk.  Are you trying to ruin my business?

69
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,090
Hey, did I force you to become an accompanist?

70
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,810
You said you would do it to pay off her debt!

71
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:28,150
How can you cause trouble on the last day, unluckily?

72
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,820
Hey, I can't stand the sight of you.

73
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,140
Don't ever show up in front of me.  Aish.

74
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,130
Hyun Gyu!

75
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,540
Aish!

76
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,570
Goodness... You aren't him.

77
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:15,250
By the way, aren't you Mr. Sin Hyo Yeol?  I'm a fan...

78
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,570
Ah right.  Don't be a fan.  Just go.

79
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,130
- It wasn't the right room, just go.
- Okay.

80
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,260
Jeez.

81
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,710
- Are you f#%* crazy?!
- What are you, huh?

82
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,220
What are you trying to pull?

83
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,860
I was going to let it pass,

84
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,910
but you just ask for it.

85
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,890
Do you think you will be successful for 1,000 and 10,000 years more?

86
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,000
Live properly from this moment for the sake of that future, you punk.

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,310
What the hell is she spewing?

88
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,690
I saw you messing with Jang Joon Hyeon.

89
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,940
Lame ass for a dude.

90
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,690
Are you carrying on about me splashing
 some alcohol on Jang Joon Hyeon or something?

91
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,590
What are you?  His girlfriend?

92
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,550
Did he ask you to get paid for it or something?

93
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:07,680
Money?  I'll give you.  I'll give plenty of it

94
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,670
Go on and use it for a dry cleaning fee, eh?

95
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,420
Get lost.

96
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,500
Hey.  Dry clean your mouth with it instead.

97
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,360
At least Jang Joon Hyeon isn't this low.

98
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,920
Good for nothing trash...

99
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,580
Hey.  HEY!!!

100
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,790
Ajussi!  Breakfast.

101
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,320
Breakfast?

102
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,980
Wow, what dried pollak stew(hangover soup) in the morning?

103
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,090
You couldn't put me in a corner fast enough yesterday.
Are you using a stick and switch (pacifying me) ?

104
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,470
Never mind if you don't want it.

105
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,550
When did I say I didn't want it?

106
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,460
Hey, let's have a change of clothes while I'm in.

107
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,590
Where did you put my carry on luggage?

108
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,660
I put it in your living room corner for sure.

109
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,910
Did you throw it out somewhere?

110
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,760
Go on, take a look.

111
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,570
I don't owe you anything now.

112
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,950
Owe me?  Owe what?

113
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,990
Just something like that.

114
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:59,140
Hey, does that mean that I don't have to sleep
on a low wooden bench then?

115
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,150
Hey, Choi Chun Hee!

116
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,240
Geesh, how long did he take his shower for?

117
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,970
He hasn't even been here for that long!

118
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,220
Tenant's responsibility and duties.

119
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:33,390
As when in Rome you must do as Romans,
you should follow our house rules while you're here.

120
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,590
What is she talking about?

121
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:44,160
 Towel use is limited to 1 per a shower and a shampoo
 (hair washing), and 1 per 3 face washes. 

122
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,580
Okay, okay.

123
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,820
 Toothpaste must be pressed from the bottom up,
squeezing, squeezing, and squeezing some more. 

124
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:04,110
 Our country has shortage of water, hence
save water! 

125
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,460
When you poop, use six sheets!

126
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,790
 For big things (poop) six sheets!
For small things (pee) four sheets! 

127
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,780
Preparing the meal and then washing the dishes,

128
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,240
I will do it on even days and you should do it on odd days. You don't have any problem with that, right?

129
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,090
With these holy hands, which I play guitar with,

130
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,060
you want me to wash the dishes?

131
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,930
Are you crazy?

132
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,980
It might be strange now,

133
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,640
but you will get used to it soon.

134
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,000
Fighting!

135
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,640
 - Everyone knows it. 
-That startled me. 

136
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,860
 Words like participating in charity events and readings mean nothing. 

137
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,830
 Excuse me? 

138
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,260
 "I just want to sleep". I like this answer. 

139
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,980
 She sounds like a human.  

140
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,750
Why are you laughing alone?

141
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,230
Right, you are going to KBC's Survival Immortal Classics.

142
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,980
I'm so jealous. Do well.

143
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,560
Yes.

144
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,180
Hello?

145
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,080
There is a meeting in the television station for Survival Immortal Classics, right?

146
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,620
Go with me on my car.

147
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,020
Ah, yes.

148
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,250
I'll see you in the parking lot in ten minutes.

149
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,980
Yes.

150
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:20,710


151
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,290
Welcome.

152
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,990
-Please start driving. 
- Yes, I'll start.

153
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,780
I heard that Shine Star discovered a good rookie.

154
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:39,720
Park Soo In, light up this Survival Classic songs.

155
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,260
I was worried that people will not be as interested because only rookies are coming out this time.

156
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,020
But I'm glad that there is a hot rookie like you.

157
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,450
There are many singers who are pressured by competition.

158
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,990
Her singing skills are already proven. There is no reason to decline.

159
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,860
I'm sorry, I'm late.

160
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,650
Don't be late!

161
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,710
Director, you know Lee Sang Hyeon, who was going to appear this time

162
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,510
We have to substitute an another singer.

163
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,870
Why?

164
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,370
- He drove while drunk ... 
 - Of all times, that guy ...

165
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,780
I will print out a list for the singers who can be substituted.

166
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,600
Perhaps, if you need one,

167
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,780
may I recommend a singer from my company?

168
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,030
Her name is Choi Chun Hee, and she is a new singer that we newly contracted with.

169
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,530
-President, that's a bit... 
- An unknown singer can be troublesome.

170
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,830
There are already many rookies. We need some hot...

171
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,790
I thought this episode was for rookies.

172
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,760
Even so...

173
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,380
- We never heard of that name... 
- You should decide after researching about her.

174
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,940
Do it.

175
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,110
Ah, here.

176
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,830
Shine, you are fast.

177
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,750
You are fast.

178
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,750
To put her in our program is not...

179
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,910
But it's good! Take a look at the hits!

180
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,890
Oh, she is perfect! Wow, she's fresh!

181
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,000
There's a feeling to it.

182
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,940
Ok, good.

183
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,450
Isn't it too early for Choi Chun Hee to participate in a tv show?

184
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,700
It feels like that we just throw her in with Soo In.

185
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,860
Yes, we are throwing her in with Park Soon In.

186
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,970
People from the same company can cheer and help each other on.

187
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,600
Isn't that good?

188
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,110
I said something that I shouldn't have.

189
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,410
Hello?

190
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,180
An agreement was already settled with Midas.

191
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,390
And Choi Chun Hee is still a trainee,

192
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,380
so we're not expecting a big sum of money.

193
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,490
Just let's settle an agreement  for a reasonable level.

194
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,290
Ah, our Choi Chun Hee is suffering a lot.

195
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,000
- It's hot, right?
- Yeah.

196
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,060
The weather is too hot.

197
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,920
Here, enjoy the breeze.

198
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,180
- Is it cool?
- Yeah, I feel much better.

199
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,750
-You feel better now?
--Yes.

200
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,260
Here, since you're feeling better, keep stretching your legs.

201
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,560
Ah... I feel much better.

202
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,540
Why is a young kid like you so stiff?

203
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,350
Practice every free time.

204
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,500
- Go down.
- No, hey!

205
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,430
Chun Hee.

206
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,650
Ah, hello.

207
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,060
In the episode for rookies in KBC's Suvival Classic songs,

208
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,320
it was decided that you will participate with Park Soo In.

209
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,340
What are you saying?

210
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,500
There will be time when you will get assigned a song randomly.

211
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,840
Just know that.

212
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,320
Ah, thank you.

213
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,780
- I'm going to be on TV?
- I told you to only believe in me.

214
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,220
Then our Byeol can see me too!

215
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,300
Stretch.

216
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,610
I think that I can stretch well now.

217
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,630
Guys, did you guys hear about it?

218
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:13,380
- Soo In and that trot girl are both going on tv. 
 -Heol!

219
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,880
The President has ordered that.

220
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,820
- What?
- Is she really in that kind of relationship with the President?

221
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,810
Aiyoo! Seriously.

222
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,870
What is it?

223
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,250
Hello?!

224
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,770
It must be difficult for you to be like this when you've been a trainee for ten years.

225
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,730
Even a  parachute  like Choi Chun Hee has been given an opportunity to go on a tv show.

226
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,270
Since this topic came up,

227
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,740
aren't you a little too much?

228
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,860
How can a newbie who just came go out on a show?

229
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,180
There are many trainees like me in this company.

230
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,810
This is really unbelievable Executive Director Wang!

231
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,730
I know...

232
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,850
It has been bad since the new President came, right?

233
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,520
So I thought about it.

234
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,620
This could be an opportunity for you.

235
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,630
 Five, six, seven, eight. 

236
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,890
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.

237
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,310
One, two, three, four.

238
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,560
- Hold (the pose). Hold.
 - Ah, it's so hot!

239
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,110
- Hold.
- Woah, this is too hard.

240
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,580
Hey, daebak! A trainee in Shine Star.

241
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,920
-She is singing in a room at a nightclub.
--No way!

242
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,780
Ah, really?

243
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,820
Wow, what kind of kid did this? Isn't she crazy?

244
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,880
- Wow, amazing.
- Is this perhaps...

245
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,490
The silhouette looks like Choi Chun Hee, doesn't it?

246
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,490
Hey, that's correct. That is Choi Chun Hee!

247
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,940
Here, this looks like a room in a nightclub.

248
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,500
Choi Chun Hee, why did you go at this nightclub?

249
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,650
I went to return my stage outfit.

250
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,990
What are you talking about?

251
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:22,600
Before I entered Shine Star, I sang there for a while.

252
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,830
I was returning the clothes that I wore then.

253
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:31,680
Before you entered Shine Star, you sang in that kind of place?

254
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,480
Ok, right, let's forget about the past.

255
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,050
Are you still singing here even  after you became a trainee?

256
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,960
Ah, no. I never did it.

257
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,920
Then, what is the money that Shin Hyo Yeol is holding for?

258
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,510
This looks like a tip to me.

259
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,280
Tip? It's not that.

260
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,720
If that's not a tip, what is it then?

261
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,800
Please talk Choi Chun Hee.

262
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,880
Choi Chun Hee.

263
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,830
If you won't talk ( tell ), 
you could be thrown out of Shine Star.

264
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,410
I can't tell you the details, but

265
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,850
it's really not a tip. Please believe me, I'm speaking the truth.

266
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,490
You are even not going to give an excuse?

267
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,990
What an impudent girl.

268
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:30,130
It hasn't been a while since she became a trainee. Oh my...

269
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,220
What happened?

270
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,470
Did you really, go to the nightclub to sing?

271
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,840
Tell me honestly.

272
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,230
I need to know to resolve the problem.

273
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,360
Why aren't you saying anything?

274
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,850
Then, perhaps

275
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,040
Is it true?

276
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,890
Do you know what I had to do 
to take you out of that place?

277
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,600
You're driving me crazy. Seriously.

278
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,360
Hey, Choi Chun Hee.

279
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,940
Did you really want money that much?

280
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,360
Is that why you did things like this?

281
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,080
You fool! No matter how much you need money, 
how can you go there and do such a thing?

282
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,000
Doing that, are you still a singer? You're not!

283
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,890
Why aren't you saying anything?

284
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,280
What is it, just say it.

285
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,370
Say something for yourself, even if it's an excuse!

286
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,090
If I give you an excuse,

287
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,870
will you believe me?

288
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,020
You don't believe me.

289
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,800
How can you give an excuse to someone who doesn't believe you?

290
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,980
Hey Jang Joon Hyeon,

291
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,170
I get that you're disappointed in me,

292
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,210
I was disappointed in you as well.

293
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:08,390
Hey! Who said I didn't believe you?

294
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,170
What's the problem?

295
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,620
You're the President. You're the one who contracted her.

296
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,250
If something happens to the singer, isn't the President suppose to stand up for her?

297
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,000
Even though Choi Chun Hee's personality is a little dirty,

298
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,010
she's not a type of person who would do something secretly from the company when she is a trainee.

299
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,670
I have nothing but I can guarantee that.

300
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,810
When you talk to me, tell me facts instead of speculation.

301
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:36,410
If you just give speculation, when she is not telling herself

302
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,400
it will not help at all.

303
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,440
You'll feel better if you eat something warm.

304
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,920
Eat a lot.

305
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,540
If I don't tell them the truth,

306
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:03,670
it was a situation where I could be wrongly fired from the company. But,

307
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:08,200
if I did say anything, it could have ruined 
one person's pride.

308
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,370
Seeing that you're talking in past tense, I see you've already decided.

309
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,320
If you closed your mouth at that time, 
then that's the right thing to do.

310
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,520
If you made a decision just push through all the way with it. That seems more like you.

311
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,180
Eat. Eat a lot.

312
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,770
Yes.

313
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,690
Yes Ah Reum?

314
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:32,700
Oppa? I in the middle of filming. I'm tired to death right now.

315
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,210
I feel better after listening to Ah Reum's voice though.

316
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,000
What are you?

317
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,540
What exactly did you do?

318
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,910
You've finally gone crazy Jang Joon Hyeon.

319
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,690
Can't you speak clearly? Why did you meet Choi Chun Hee?

320
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,010
What exactly was that money for?

321
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:52,710
What is this punk saying?! Who exactly is Choi Chun Hee...

322
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,520
Ah, I know now.

323
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,720
You mean you girlfriend right now, right? Wow even her name fits perfectly (to her appearance).

324
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,230
Well, now that you're in this position,

325
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,550
your standards for a girl are falling as well.

326
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:10,330
-What?
-Now that I see, you must have a great stomach, saying that she's your girlfriend and everything.

327
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,830
Let's say her face is average. But what kind of body is that?

328
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:17,580
She is skinny like a smelly anchovy.

329
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,980
Watch what you say.

330
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,790
She's not a type of person you can talk carelessly about.

331
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,910
Aish, it hurts.

332
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,720
Tell me correctly.

333
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,600
Why did you meet her? Why did you give her money?!

334
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,860
It's heart wrenching, the both of you.

335
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:39,160
One b**** comes to me and goes insane about 
that I mocked you when you worked as an accompanist.

336
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,430
One bastard comes to me saying to watch my mouth about her.

337
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,160
What are you two?! Huh?!

338
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,540
Are you guys filming some tear-jerking drama?

339
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,710
I'll ask you for the last time.

340
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,780
In this situation, there is no other way

341
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,320
except explaining yourself.

342
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,230
Then it seems that we have reached a conclusion.

343
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,410
Stop! Stop right there!

344
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,620
Everything is all my fault.

345
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:22,950
That money was not the tips that she received from singing in the room at the night (club).

346
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:28,200
Sin Hyo Yeol gave her the money in order 
to insult me for doing  oburi (the accompanist job) .

347
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,220
Choi Chun Hee,

348
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,490
in order to hide the fact that I was an  accompanist,

349
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,480
she couldn't tell the truth.

350
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,710
Jang Joon Hyeon, you sure are hitting rock bottom.

351
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,970
What's an  oburi? 

352
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:51,160
They play the background music and play the tambourine in a room for the people drinking.

353
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,760
Executive Director Wang, this is unfair.

354
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,180
I was doing what you told me to do, so why do I have to leave the company?

355
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,110
You're the one who posted the false rumor onto the company's website.

356
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:12,720
I did that only because you told me to.

357
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,420
I did?

358
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,300
Yes.

359
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,740
Stay low for awhile.

360
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,280
You never know,

361
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,050
that I might call you again if there is a chance.

362
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,100
Why didn't you say anything under all that pressure?

363
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,230
You were about to get fired from the company for this.

364
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,220
By hiding about that I played the background music,

365
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,400
what, did you think I would be touched or something you idiot?

366
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,900
Idiot?

367
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,920
Do you really have to use words like that?

368
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,060
You're saying I'm wrong? Are you my family or something?

369
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,480
Why did you have to say things to Sin Hyo Yeol, that jerk?

370
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,450
You don't know how low class he is.

371
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,950
You have no fear for a girl.

372
00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:00,000
Hey. Afraid of what? He won't last one punch.

373
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,220
Hey Choi Chun Hee.

374
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:09,560
Next time, don't ever get involved again for that kind of matter.

375
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,090
If you need to get involved, then call me.

376
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,430
You know Sin Hyo Yeol,

377
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,540
What about that jerk?

378
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,200
Kyaa...

379
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,100
He's really an asshole.

380
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,690
-Right?
--Yes.

381
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,800
We seem to agree in this area.

382
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,520
He was originally an asshole to begin with.

383
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,400
Huh? What is this?

384
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,970
Are they living together?

385
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,860
Aigoo...

386
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:49,070
Is that boy going to do something else?

387
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,400
Huh. Aihoo.

388
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,720
There's nothing that works properly in this house.

389
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,790
This is probably the best thing (in this house).

390
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:16,500
From now on this is my cup. Dibs.

391
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,240
Hey come out here and help me.

392
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,660
Next time you do this since you're tall.

393
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,560
Hurry up.

394
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,170
How dare you tell me to do that?

395
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,430
Ah, really...

396
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,440
Hold it properly.

397
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,770
I got it.

398
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:51,540
Hey hold this.

399
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:01,020


400
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,230
I was about to get hurt because of you!

401
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,820
Next time you're changing it.

402
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,840
Why is it like this?

403
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,540
♬ Baby love is love is you. Baby love is love is you. ♬

404
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,500
♬ If you only want me ♬

405
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,740
♬ If everything I am is yours ♬

406
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,330
Are you on a diet these days?

407
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:47,040
Your face looks really pale.

408
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,570
But it'll probably look better on screen.

409
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:54,040
I interrupted you didn't I? I'm sorry, keep practicing.

410
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,600
President.

411
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,320
Can I ask you something?

412
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,060
Of course. Ask me anything.

413
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:10,600
Why did you recommend Choi Chun Hee for the Survival Classic Songs?

414
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:15,750
Why? Does it hurt your pride to appear together?

415
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,980
It's not like that.

416
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,110
Just... I have been curious 
about that for a while.

417
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,930
The way I see it is that her basics aren't even good,

418
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:28,370
There are many singers of that level of skill among the trainees in this agency.

419
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:34,040
I was wondering why you took special interest in her.

420
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,020
I don't have a special interest in her.

421
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,030
I just thought it was fun.

422
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:46,180
Like you said, her basics are not good, but

423
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,220
There is a feeling.

424
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:53,990
What should I say is the difference between you two?

425
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:57,000
"Admiration" and  "emotivity"?

426
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:02,230
Are you saying that I'm just admirable,

427
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,980
and Choi Chun Hee is emotionally moving?

428
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,250
Is that what you think?

429
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,890
Candidates, please choose one.

430
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,400
 Avoid one or two! 

431
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,910
Everyone has picked carefully. Now everyone may go back to their seats.

432
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,580
We will be checking,

433
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,680
whether you picked the number you were hoping for.

434
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,020
Please open the ball.

435
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,830
 DAE... BAK. 

436
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,030
Of course you would do that.

437
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:53,190
As you all know, our program is a tournament.

438
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:58,190
#1 and #2 will compete, and the winner will compete with #3.

439
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,230
Okay, let's begin round one.

440
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:03,310
#1 and #2, please come up.

441
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,410
Okay, who is #1?...

442
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,880
Oh! Wow!

443
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,470
Things are getting very interesting from round one!

444
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,880
Park Soon In and Choi Chun Hee.

445
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,330
Wow, a competition between senior and junior from the same agency. We can look forward to it.

446
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,930
Why Soon In of all people?

447
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,850
I think this is good.

448
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,500
Things turned out this way.

449
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,610
Let's do well, Soo In.

450
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,590
Sure, Oppa.

451
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:51,200
Let's do well, Choi Chun Hee.

452
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,560
Yes, Sunbaenim.

453
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,360
Keep up the great work.

454
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,740
President Jo, did you hear?

455
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,060
That Soo In and Choi Chun Hee are going to face each other?

456
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,470
Yes. I just heard.

457
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:19,340
Singers from the same agency competing against each other... it doesn't look good.

458
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:23,500
When Soo In goes on TV broadcast next time, make sure this doesn't happen again.

459
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,790
What you just said...

460
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:29,440
Are you saying that as the Director of Shine Star, or...

461
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,890
Are you saying it as Park Soo In's mother?

462
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,110
What a rude jerk.

463
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:53,420
Hey! Come here and help me.

464
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,740
Hey.

465
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,440
- Hey!
- Hey! Let me sleep!

466
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,120
How many days has it been?

467
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,010
Why don't you know how to stop once you start something!

468
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:04,440
So ignorant, really.

469
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,840
I'm going to sleep today.

470
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,380
Ah, what?

471
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,930
How can you sleep at this point?

472
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:15,080
Our singer-nim is practicing until her throat explodes.

473
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,580
You're sleepy right now?

474
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,940
- No...
- You're sleepy?

475
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,480
Why did you come here?

476
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,640
Our lady is going to be on TV tomorrow!

477
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,000
How can we stay put? We came to give our support.

478
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,600
Don't be concerned with us, and continue with your practice.

479
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:35,530
No! That's not it. That won't do!

480
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,860
Yoo Sik, try stand there.

481
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,760
Yes, Hyungnim.

482
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,110
Give strength to your belly, 
and it (the sound) should come up from the bottom.

483
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,470
Hey, you stand there too.

484
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,980
Hey, Yoo Sik, start!

485
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,460
Pay back the money!

486
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,870
Everyone together! Start!

487
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,830
Pay back the money!

488
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,640
Reach further. Start!

489
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,250
Pay back the money!

490
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,830
Ah...no!

491
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,900
I sent you $5,000!

492
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,400
At least give me what's left!

493
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,490
Where are there leftovers?

494
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:09,100
It is you, who ran out while saying that you didn't want the surgery.

495
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,110
President! President!

496
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,570
Why don't you take the liver from a flea! 
(Taking every penny from the poor)

497
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:18,210
That money was not just any money.

498
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,590
It serves ( me ) right to be scammed, Seol Tae Song.

499
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,870
You betrayed Joon Hyeon. I knew this would happen to you, you fool.

500
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,540
Joon Hyeon.

501
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,800
It's the knock, the knock.
( The girl who knocked in the washroom.)

502
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,450
Why is she here?

503
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,380
President Heo!

504
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,670
Come on in, Pil Nyeo.

505
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,180
Hello.

506
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:55,140
Oh no, he's a scammer. You'll get scammed when you go in here.

507
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,040
What do I do? Do I need to help her?

508
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,050
I can't hear!

509
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,430
Ah, it's great that our talk turned out well.

510
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:10,060
First, let's take pictures for the wardrobe concept.

511
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,050
And film the music video.

512
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,270
That fast?

513
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,060
Of course!

514
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,760
You're the leading star in our agency.

515
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,900
We should hurry, don't you think?

516
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,430
Hold on.

517
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,950
R-Right. Yes.

518
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,480
When you debut, you really won't have time.

519
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,070
Today, we should go somewhere with a good atmosphere.

520
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,910
Somewhere nice?

521
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:43,210
You know it all already. Why are you acting like this?

522
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,170
President! President, why are you being like this?

523
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,160
President, why are you being like this?

524
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,610
President!

525
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:51,730
Why are you being like this?

526
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,640
What are you doing, run!

527
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,100
Hey, you jerk! What are you? Hey. HEY!

528
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,830
Excuse me.

529
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:38,940
Ah. I wasn't trying to do that earlier.

530
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,790
I was just trying to save you...

531
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,980
That's not it.

532
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,550
This hand too... I didn't mean to hold it.

533
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,870
No, that's not it. I'm saying thank you!

534
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,810
Can't you tell me your name?

535
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,280
Hi!

536
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,610
Hello, President.

537
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,580
- You can't get up right now, right?
- No.

538
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,870
- Hey, I'm right!
- No, you're not.

539
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,380
Oh, thank you.

540
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,200
Aigoo.

541
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,220
- I'm okay.
- Here.

542
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,290
Ah, yes.

543
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,440
Aigoo.

544
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,270
Is this that painful?

545
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:37,010
 ♬ It's going to explode... ♬ 

546
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,770
 ♬ It will explode... ♬ 

547
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,650
 It's vocal cord nodules. 

548
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,420
 You need to just rest, and for the time being, absolutely no singing. 

549
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,380
What medicine is that?

550
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,930
Aren't you being too sensitive?

551
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:13,410
A singer can be in a bad condition sometimes.

552
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:16,220
So her throat is not in the best condition. So what?

553
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,780
You think Soo In can't beat that newbie?

554
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,160
But it seemed really bad.

555
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,090
Executive Director Wang, why do you have so many worries?

556
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:30,350
She wouldn't have came this far if she was worried just because of a cold.

557
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,900
No.

558
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:39,650
Hey, don't sing with your throat. Sing with your stomach.

559
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,200
- Pull in your chin.
- Pull in.

560
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,650
- Loosen your shoulders.
- Loosen.

561
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,490
- Look far away.
- Far away.

562
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,300
- Okay, give strength in your belly.
- Give strength.

563
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,920
Okay, 1- 2 - 3!

564
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,920
Oh, it came out.

565
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,150
If I compare this to a marathon, you're being 
trained by Lee Bong Ju.  ( A famous marathoner)  

566
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,540
You're kidding me.

567
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,570
Keeping that joking spirit alive...

568
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,420
Here. The genius composer

569
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,260
newly arranged this yesterday. Sing the ssabi (chorus) first.

570
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,640
Try singing it!

571
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,060
But what's ssabi?

572
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,420
What?

573
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,100
You don't even know ssabi?

574
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,890
Chorus.

575
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,730
- You know now, right?
- Yeah.
 - Try sing it.

576
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,940
What now?

577
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,480
Can't you sing it for me once?

578
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,780
Just look at the music score and sing.

579
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,690
What is this?

580
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,740
No way... you don't know how to read music?

581
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,890
You really don't know?!

582
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:51,330
All this time, what were you doing while living? Huh?

583
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,520
- Did you sleep during music class at school?
- Yeah.

584
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,060
- How praiseworthy.
- Yeah!

585
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,080
Hey, just in case...

586
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:02,800
Don't tell the trainees here or anyone else that you can't read music.

587
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,040
You can't go on Survival Immortal Classics tomorrow and make it obvious to anyone.

588
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,310
I got it!

589
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,850
- You got it?
- Yeah.

590
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,690
Sing it for me.

591
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,080
She doesn't know how to read a sheet of music?

592
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:25,610
This piece of paper being distributed now has the song and order you will all be singing.

593
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:28,640
Please check it now and get ready.

594
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,040
This isn't the song I selected.

595
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,660
 Like that smiling face letting me go 

596
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,300
This isn't my song.

597
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:55,200
Does it make sense that the song changes on the day of the broadcast?

598
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,820
Why did only Choi Chun Hee's song change?

599
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,840
No matter how ( much of a ) new singer she is,

600
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,770
how can you play around with a singer like this?

601
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,760
Participant 5 will be singing Choi Chun Hee's original song.

602
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,300
And we already notified Shine Star about this.

603
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,680
We never even heard of this and,

604
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,680
we already practiced for the assigned song.

605
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,170
Does it make sense that the song changes on the day of the performance?

606
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:23,160
Then what do you what me to do?

607
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,030
I'll give you the music sheet so practice with that.

608
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,550
Or do you want me to take you out?

609
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,210
You know I can't read the music sheet? What do I do?

610
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:40,000
I know how to read it.

611
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,670
There isn't that much time, so as I sing each phrase, repeat after me.

612
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:50,050
♬ Don't cry for me. ♬

613
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:54,180
♬ Don't cry for me. ♬

614
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,720
Get ready, Choi Chun Hee.

615
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,710
I'm really nervous, I feel like I'm going to make a mistake. What should I do?

616
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:13,740
Choi Chun Hee, lyrics and tone isn't important in singing.

617
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,340
What's important is that you sing sincerely.

618
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:27,010
This is the last time I'm going to sing this, so listen well.

619
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:34,920
♬ I told you before. ♬

620
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:40,780
♬ Do not cry for me. ♬

621
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,970
♬ Do not be sad for me. ♬

622
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:53,790
 ♬ Do not look at me like that. ♬ 

623
00:42:55,930 --> 00:43:00,570
♬ That expression, which lost its reason. ♬

624
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:03,270
♬ My heart ♬

625
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:07,840
♬ will burst. ♬

626
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,520
♬ Love is, ♬

627
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,800
♬ is not left for me. ♬

628
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,990
♬ I can't have any feelings. ♬

629
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,920
♬ With a smile, ♬

630
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:30,110
♬ Like how you're letting me go. ♬

631
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,790
Miss Chun Hee?

632
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:06,380
I'll be back.

633
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,830
Choi Chun Hee.
Huh?

634
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,560
You'll do well.

635
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,690
♬ Don't cry for me. ♬

636
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:56,150
♬ Don't be sad for me. ♬

637
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,810
♬ Don't look at me like that. ♬

638
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,410
♬ That expression, which lost its reason. ♬

639
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:14,400
♬ Don't love me. ♬

640
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,470
♬ It's too late. ♬

641
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:28,210
♬ Don't wait for me. ♬

642
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,960
♬ Love already ended. ♬

643
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:42,690
♬ You, why did you let me leave? ♬

644
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:48,840
♬ If I knew that I'll regret like this, ♬

645
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,590
♬ During this difficult time, ♬

646
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:59,170
♬ I wouldn't have to have wondered. ♬

647
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:04,050
♬ Love is already, ♬

648
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:07,090
 ♬ not left for me. ♬ 

649
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:13,130
♬ I can't have any feelings. ♬

650
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:16,980
♬ With a smile, ♬

651
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:23,010
♬ like how you're letting me go. ♬

652
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:36,030
♬ Like how you're letting me go. ♬

653
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:00,430
You wretch.

654
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:02,000
Did I do well?

655
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
- A little.
- Yah, this is something...

656
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,100
Even so,

657
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,560
it is rewarding to teach you.

658
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,590
The singers who just ended their performance.

659
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:17,610
We will lead Park Soo In and Choi Chun Hee back on stage.

660
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:23,750
In this Survival Classic Songs,

661
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:27,240
the two performers will be competing in a tournament-like fashion.

662
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,660
The audiences' vote will account for 50%.

663
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:34,740
And the netizen's vote will account for 50% to evaluate the winner.

664
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,760
We will ask some basic questions.

665
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,650
First of all, I heard Park Soo In is suffering from a singer's nodule.

666
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,280
How was today's stage to you?

667
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:50,680
While standing on this stage, 
I forgot about the pain and the fear.

668
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,430
I believe that I tried my best.

669
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:57,950
And Choi Chun Hee, I heard that this is your first performance.

670
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:02,690
How do you feel about meeting a strong rival on your first performance?

671
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:07,490
I don't remember with what mind I sang the song.

672
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:11,310
Yes, she seems to be very nervous still.

673
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:16,800
Before she becomes more nervous, let's see the results of the audiences.

674
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,480
Can you wait a moment?

675
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,190
If I came out on television.

676
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,420
there was something I wanted to say.

677
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,210
Yes. Go on.

678
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:27,630
Yes.

679
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:31,760
There's something I must say to my dad.

680
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,590
Dad,

681
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,080
although I don't know where you are right now,

682
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,100
I believe you are watching this show.

683
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:49,830
Byeol and I are really doing well.

684
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:53,600
If you see this show, be sure to call me.

685
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,440
Okay?

686
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,550
Thank you.

687
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:08,530
Yes, Choi Chun Hee must have a story.

688
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:12,380
Here, the results of the audience vote is...

689
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,930
with 135 votes against 63 votes,

690
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,590
Choi Chun Hee wins.

691
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:47,950
In this first round of the  Survival Immortal Classics, the final winner is...

692
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:05,520
Park Soo In! I welcome your applause!

693
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:33,400
I'm sorry. You put in a lot of effort for me.

694
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:40,670
Hey, Jang Joon Hyeon!

695
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,440
What happened here?

696
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:52,070
There was a big difference in the audience evaluation points. How did it get overturned with the netizen evaluation?

697
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:53,790
Why are you asking me?

698
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,610
The result is that way because netizens voted like that.

699
00:50:56,610 --> 00:51:00,080
Didn't you see the atmosphere at the site? Choi Chun Hee dominated!

700
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,860
So what? Did you come here to argue about that?

701
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,880
Jang Joon Hyeon, it seems you still haven't woken up?

702
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,410
If you keep this up, it won't be just you.

703
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:13,160
Choi Chun Hee will not also be able to appear in a broadcast.

704
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,980
You know that?

705
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:22,000
Still, this isn't right!!

706
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,360
Thank you for helping today, Director.

707
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:31,830
When this is over, we'll treat you.

708
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,860
For today, it was good that I took 
your advice, Executive Director Wang.

709
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,770
-You did so well.
--Really!

710
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,380
-Buy us a drink later!
--Congratulations!

711
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:49,010
You were really great, Soo In.
Are you really suffering from the singer's nodules?

712
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:52,720
If your throat didn't hurt, you would've made the audience faint.

713
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,110
-Sunbae.
--Well done.

714
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:58,700
Soo In did well, but

715
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,080
that Choi Chun Hee earlier, don't you think she has something?

716
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,320
I know, right? There's something quite touching.

717
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,450
Really, there is something special with the one Jang Joon Hyeon trains.

718
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:09,890
But... wasn't the point tally a little weird?

719
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:12,580
How much were the netizen votes for the rank to be reversed?

720
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,220
Do things like that happen only once or twice?

721
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,670
True. Let's go.

722
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,100
Oppa.

723
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:48,110
You didn't leave yet?

724
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:50,480
What about Choi Chun Hee?

725
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,510
She probably left first.

726
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:56,980
Then, it has been a while, should we have a coffee together?

727
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:00,950
Sorry Soo In, my mood is not that good today.

728
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:06,240
But today is a special day for me.
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

729
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,290
Jang Joon Hyeon!

730
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,630
A mango juice for you, right?

731
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,520
Yes? Yes.

732
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,990
A mango juice and a lemonade please.

733
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:33,680
Yes.

734
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,630
Soo In, your song is playing.

735
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:46,080
It's also your song.

736
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,630
You are very popular lately.

737
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:50,980
It's all thanks to you.

738
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,980
No need to say that.

739
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:02,160
Unni, I'm hungry.

740
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,440
Unni.

741
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:15,050
Unni. Wake up.

742
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,020
Unni! Unni!

743
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,980
 Jang Joon Hyeon 

744
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:34,260
Uhm... Oppa.

745
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,900
Can't you come to me again?

746
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:49,280
I'm asking you whether you can stop being Choi Chun Hee's manager, and can come to me again.

747
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:56,390
Honestly, I would like you to make my next song.

748
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,340
 "Chili Pepper" - Oh Seong Ju 

749
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:20,050
I have one person you need to do research on.

750
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:22,920
- Who?
- You know Myeong Sik Oppa?

751
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:27,280
Seong Ju's husband. Myeong Sik oppa.

752
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,590
Why suddenly this person?

753
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:32,540
I saw a similar looking person some time ago.

754
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:37,510
I need to find out what Myeong Sik Oppa is doing these days.

755
00:55:55,320 --> 00:56:01,120
Hey Choi Chun Hee, 
You aren't hiding somewhere and crying, right?

756
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,830
I'm casting one vote on Choi Chun Hee!

757
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:07,290
Hello? Choi Chun Hee?

758
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:11,120
Unni is very sick.

759
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:32,470
Unni, are you okay?

760
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,340
Unni.

761
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:46,300
- Soo In.
- Yes, Oppa.

762
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:51,380
I'm thankful for your suggestion.

763
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:56,550
But it seems like you have your things to do,
and I have my things to do.

764
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:05,270
I'll get up first.

765
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:19,800
Oh Byeol, what is wrong?

766
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,340
What, Unni?

767
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,180
Yes, understood.

768
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,820
Taxi, taxi!

769
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,180
It's about Choi Chun Hee, right?

770
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:48,130
It seems like an urgent matter, I'll take you there.

771
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:01,470
It seems like she's in a state of prostration brought on by the overworking. You can go in, she woke up.

772
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:04,320
Ok, thank you.

773
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:14,420
Thank you, President.

774
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:19,090
Right, I helped you again.

775
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:20,910
Originally I'm not that type.

776
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:23,280
Ahjussi is a president?

777
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,730
- Byeol, you're being rude.
- Yeah.

778
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:28,650
I'm the President of your sister's agency.

779
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:31,460
President of the agency?

780
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,180
But,

781
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:38,430
- is that all?
- Byeol!

782
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:43,290
That is all. Until now.

783
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:46,650
- Until now?
- You, really.

784
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:51,950
Here. You head looks uncomfortable.

785
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:16,840
♬  Why did you just let me leave  ♬

786
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:22,800
♬  If I had known I'd regret it again like this  ♬

787
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:32,450
♬ Through the hardship, I wouldn't have wandered  ♬
