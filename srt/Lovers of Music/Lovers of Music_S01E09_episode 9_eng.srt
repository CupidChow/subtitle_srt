 Episode 9 

2
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,990
  ♫ You shook up my heart like a passing storm ♫ 

3
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:38,900
  ♫ The person who entered and shook my heart ♫ 

4
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:46,540
 ♬ One step each day , love like a snowflake, ♬ 

5
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,860
♬ On your name, flowers bloom   ♬  

6
00:00:51,860 --> 00:01:01,910
♬ Before I knew it,  like my feelings, I'm growing to resemble you ♬

7
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:08,250
♬ I must love you.  ♬

8
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,820


9
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,160
Okay.

10
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,180
Here.

11
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,130
What is this? Wow, it's fried rice!

12
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,620
You even put in seaweed. It looks delicious. Thanks, I'll eat well.

13
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,610
Let's eat.

14
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,940
But where is ahjusshi? I got 100% on my plant diary.

15
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,500
Ahjusshi isn't coming back anymore.

16
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,910
Why?

17
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,130
Where did he go?

18
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,160
He went back where he was originally.

19
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,600
Originally?

20
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,280
Let's eat.

21
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,300
You like this?

22
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,770
Your standards are so you.

23
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,360
  I'll definitely get your guitar later. 

24
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,900
President Jo is not the one.

25
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,940
Why not?

26
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,360
I was trying to bring down Choi Chun Hee with a scandal with Jang Joon Hyeon, but

27
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,530
President Jo blocked it. And even kicked out Jang Joon Hyeon.

28
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,510
Really? Even Oppa Joon Hyeon?

29
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,030
A different woman,

30
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,040
and a guy who looks at a girl like Choi Chun Hee,

31
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,270
don't hold onto him any longer. Just give up.

32
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,570
Mom.

33
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:07,190
 Your body heat that was so comforting and warm   

34
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,680
 I really missed it 

35
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,040
 I only think about you all day 

36
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,950
Soo In.

37
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,660
You came?

38
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,900
What's going on?

39
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,350
I want to ask you for my next album's song.

40
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,330
We talked about this before.

41
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,110
I heard you're not Choi Chun Hee's manager anymore.

42
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,560
If you can be the producer for my album,

43
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,210
a scandal with Choi Chun Hee,

44
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,960
I think you can completely avoid that.

45
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,590
No?

46
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,120
How would you know...

47
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,550
And it's good for me because I get to work with you.

48
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,320
Soo In... The thing is...

49
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,470
Then I'll take it as you're doing it and wait for you tomorrow at work. See you tomorrow.

50
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,490
Soo In.

51
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,540
Choi Chun Hee, go in.

52
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,390
Okay.

53
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,170
Choi Chun Hee.

54
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,780
Do well.

55
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,200
Here.

56
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,870
Tae Song will be here soon.

57
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,140
Thank you.

58
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,490
Tae Song has such a beautiful girlfriend. Why didn't he tell me?

59
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,260
A girl ...  girlfriend?

60
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,600
No wonder,

61
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,740
Tae Song looks much better these days and he's always smiling.

62
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,570
It was all because of you, wasn't it?

63
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,100
Be ... Because of me? Oh, what ...?

64
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,560
Please come often in the future. I'll push you two together.

65
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,660
Thank you, President. No ...  Unni!

66
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,940
I'm here.

67
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,480
Oh, he came.

68
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,370
Thank you for coming with me.

69
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,840
I've never bought women's cosmetics.

70
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,570
It must be for a gift.

71
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,220
A girl you like?

72
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,980
It's not just a girl.

73
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,860
How should I say it?

74
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,990
-A goddess? 
 - Goddess?

75
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,120
Somewhere ...

76
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,950
With cherry-like lips,

77
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,860
with deer-like eyes.

78
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,860
Even though I am like a goddess, it's embarrassing to hear it like this.

79
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,820
What about this one, Tae Song? 
The color is really popular these days.

80
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,300
Oh, is it?

81
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,760
Why don't you try it on so I can see the color?

82
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,310
Good idea. Quickly.

83
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,550
What are you doing?

84
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,080
Huh?

85
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,050
It's nothing special.

86
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,160
 You know you like it. 

87
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,190
What about this one then?

88
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,220
Were you going to leave after finishing your recording?

89
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,710
To disappoint me?

90
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,420
You should at least have a cup of coffee.

91
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,890
I'll enjoy it.

92
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,940
You know it's because of coffee that your broadcasting ban was lifted, right?

93
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,760
- What? 
- You didn't know?

94
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,060
Don't even say anything.

95
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,640
Jang Joon Hyeon, that tenacious guy 
 would stay in my office all the time.

96
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,220
And later, I spilled that hot coffee

97
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,310
on Jang Joon Hyeon's arm.

98
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,770
Now that I think about it, I think he purposely made a show like that.

99
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,180
To make me feel sorry and lift the broadcasting ban.

100
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,110
Really.

101
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,760
Well I'm thinking about it, I haven't seen Jang Joon Hyeon around lately.

102
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,150
Jang Joon Hyeon!

103
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,060
How did you know to come here?

104
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,670
I heard from Tae Song.

105
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:11,680
Hey, how can you leave like that without saying anything?

106
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,780
I told you that I was moving out.

107
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,570
Even so. You should at least say goodbye before you leave.

108
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,360
You tell me the night before and just leave like that?

109
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,010
And you didn't even call once.

110
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,350
Why should I call you?

111
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,580
Because we're friends, aren't we?

112
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,160
What friends? We're only connected by work.

113
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,140
I'm busy. And I need to prepare for my comeback album.

114
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,940
Hey, you really...

115
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,030
I came because I have something to say.

116
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,120
I heard from the director.

117
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,160
That you hurt your arm last time because of me.

118
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,460
I don't know what you heard from the director,

119
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,130
but I didn't get hurt because of you.

120
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,080
So...

121
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,830
don't come here and look for me again.

122
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,460
Get in.

123
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,110
Hey!

124
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,020
Go!

125
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,960
Okay.

126
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,850
I'm leaving.

127
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,050
What are you doing?

128
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,930
Hey! You!

129
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,170
If you do this one more time,  I'll kill you!

130
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,830
 Oppa, if you produce my album... 

131
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,820
 The scandal with Choi Chun Hee 

132
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,190
 can be gotten rid of completely, can't it? 

133
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,300
Welcome.

134
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,080
I knew you would come, Oppa.

135
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,360
Hello, Choi Chun Hee.

136
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,230
Hello, Sunbaenim.

137
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,880
The producer for this album is Oppa Joon Hyeon.

138
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,570
What?

139
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,180
Ah-- you'll be a bit uncomfortable?

140
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,730
For what?

141
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,880
Oppa, you were Choi Chun Hee's Manager...  But now you're my producer.

142
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,970
It could be a bit uncomfortable.

143
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,560
Why should it be that way?

144
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,940
We're professionals.

145
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,930
Let's go.

146
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,260
I heard Joon Hyeon agreed to be  Soo In's producer.

147
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,470
Yes.

148
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,650
He told me that he was working on his comeback album.

149
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,330
Then I guess he still hasn't forgotten about Soo In.

150
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,540
What? Then...

151
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,680
Joon Hyeon and Park Soo In  were dating?

152
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,920
What? Well, it's not that...

153
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,840
Soo In was Joon Hyeon's first love.

154
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,650
He even wrote Soo In's debut song for her.

155
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,270
You...

156
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,330
Don't you like Joon Hyeon?

157
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,160
Eh?

158
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,020
Aigoo- say something that makes sense. Goodness, really!

159
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,510
Well, I don't know much about things like this, so

160
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,110
I can be your coach for this matter.

161
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:48,760
But for this sort of thing, don't other people catch on first?

162
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,510
If not, forget it.

163
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,930
President! Hello.

164
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,030
Why are you here?

165
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,390
Last time I was treated by you.

166
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,170
So today I was going to  cook.

167
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,870
Eh?

168
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,490
Ah... Last time Byeol said that she liked me coming to the house.

169
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,100
Byeol really likes me .

170
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,460
Believing a kid's word like that.

171
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,140
Excuse me,  President! President Jo!

172
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,660
- Salt. 
 -Salt.

173
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,460
- Plate. 
 - Plate.

174
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,830
Oh yeah, weren't you suppose to change this cabinet door above the sink?

175
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,400
Ah, it's ok now.

176
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,250
Ahjusshi already fixed it for us.

177
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,170
- Which ahjusshi? 
 - Our Ahjussi!

178
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,710
Never mind.

179
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,620
Wow. You can really cook well, President.

180
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,080
Eat a lot.

181
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,420
Yes.

182
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,290
Our Byeol is eating well.

183
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,730
They said that meat tastes better 
if there is a little blood.

184
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,480
Who said so?

185
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,730
The old Ahjussi did.

186
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,340
Eat, eat, eat.

187
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,790
Uh.

188
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,340
There's still a crack here so,

189
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,630
I'll change it to a different cup .

190
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:20,440


191
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,560
Are you punching the time clock here? 
Why do you keep coming here?

192
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,320
How did you know...

193
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,220
Why are you here, Father?

194
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,200
You answer first.

195
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,300
I ate dinner

196
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,170
at Choi Chun Hee's house.

197
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,900
Why does your face look like that after eating dinner?

198
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,440
Why? Is something wrong?

199
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,690
Serves you right. Makes me feel all relieved.

200
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,880
Are you really my dad?

201
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,580
I know that you like Choi Chun Hee.

202
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,650
You're a ghost.

203
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,530
What is there that I don't know?

204
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,070
Anyway, you sure got caught this time.

205
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:23,010
You've never waited for a person or anything right?

206
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,160
This time, try waiting.  And don't beg.

207
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,620
If you wait for anything, you'll get a chance eventually.

208
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,170
Father, it's easy to say it, but...

209
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,120
Ahhh I don't know.

210
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,610
I'm just going to do my best at work.

211
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,180
Really? That's a great idea.

212
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,130
Only my father is getting excited again.

213
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:05,180
President, you're having lunch here?

214
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,110
It's simple and good.

215
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,390
Why?

216
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,810
Jang Joon Hyeon is going 
to be Soo In's producer this time.

217
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,040
Please sign here.

218
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,120
Ok. I'll look it over at my leisure and give it to you tomorrow.

219
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,300
Yes?

220
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,320
Yes.

221
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,350
I'm trying to do my work properly. Why,  is it weird?

222
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,540
Ah... No.

223
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,080
I think we need to reorganize our website page.

224
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,140
Like setting up prohibited words 
or stopping people from posting on the page.

225
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,710
I think we need to have some security on there.

226
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,150
Why? Did something happen?

227
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,650
Because Choi Chun Hee is rising on Music Bank,

228
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:51,110
there are rumors that Shine Star is raising trot singers.

229
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,310
Saying they want to become 
the second generation of Choi Chun Hee,

230
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:57,340
so many people are sending mails 
and posting video clips.

231
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,980
The 2nd generation of Choi Chun Hee?

232
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,620
Come here.

233
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,270
Come.

234
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,440
I'll really love you, Executive Director Wang.

235
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,990
Let's continue with that project.

236
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,150
But, since it's trot, the level is really low.

237
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,420
The neighborhood ahjummas and ahjusshi will all gather...

238
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,080
We only need to find one gem from them.

239
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,250
I will definitely talk about this with Choi Chun Hee.

240
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,710
As expected, you are the brain (of our company).

241
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,080
You can leave that there.

242
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,490
I said to do the chorus, who said to start fighting?

243
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,020
No, that's not it .  They started first.

244
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,890
It's true.

245
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,540
Na Pil Nyeo, you can't do this, huh?

246
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,260
- Starting tomorrow, don't come!  
-  PD Kim..

247
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,270
Those kids really...

248
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,610
Sunbaenim.

249
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,340
Sunbae?

250
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,290
Na Pil Nyeo is your sunbae?

251
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,410
Yes. She's my sunbae from Shine Star.

252
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,460
Oh really? Given that,

253
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,460
then come tomorrow one more time, or not.

254
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,810
MIss Chun Hee, you're going to come to our broadcast this time. Don't forget!

255
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,770
Okay.

256
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:31,630
Sunbaenim, how have you been these days?

257
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,780
What do you mean sunbae?

258
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,100
Because of you, I've been kicked out of Shine Star.

259
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,310
Why, because now you are popular,

260
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,840
do I look pitiful?

261
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,110
No, I was just glad to see you, Sunbaenim.

262
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,690
From now on, don't greet me even if you see me.

263
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:50,240
It's annoying,

264
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,260
You got it?

265
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,650
Hello?

266
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,190
Yes, President?

267
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,180
I'm going to judge the  auditions?

268
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,610
Woah, am I able to do such a big task?

269
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,720
The company is trying to pick out rookies.

270
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,040
As you know, there's only you, Choi Chun Hee, 
who sings trot in our company.

271
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:31,210
That's why you should definitely -- definitely -- help us.

272
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,260
Then, I don't know if I'll be a help, but I'll work hard.

273
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,340
Here it is.

274
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,220
We ate well.

275
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,480
Thank you.

276
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,020
Hello.

277
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,590
Welcome! How come you're here alone today?

278
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,370
Ah... That punk... No...

279
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:55,640
Yoo Shik is busy today.

280
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,860
Because of Chun Hee, you're having a lot of hardships, right?

281
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,410
Hardships? What hardships?

282
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,360
If our singer does well, then it's good for me and

283
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,610
you, Coach Bang. Wouldn't it be good for everybody?

284
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,280
I get to see you and do my work as well.

285
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,630
What?

286
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,640
No...

287
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,190
This...

288
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,600
What is this?

289
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,350
Every time I come,

290
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:27,790
you cook warm soondae-guk, so I'm thankful.

291
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,990
No! Not at all!

292
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,890
It's ok.

293
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:37,460
Please take this. This is my small heart.

294
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,910
But, even so, this is...

295
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,930
Open it.

296
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:46,820
A present is supposed to be opened 
in front of the giver.

297
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,360
If you press here...

298
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,220
My goodness! It seems to be really expensive!

299
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,310
I'm not sure if I should really take this.

300
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:03,070
You should definitely take this! Who do you think I bought this for?

301
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,200
Hyung-nim!

302
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,360
What kind of rule like this exists?

303
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:14,530
We should come together if you're going to have sundae-guk, but you ditched me saying you were  busy. This is betrayal!

304
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:19,290
Be quiet. You were going to break this! We'll be going now for today.

305
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,330
-Get out! 
 - But, Hyung-nim, I'm hungry. 

306
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,980
No, you need to lose weight!

307
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,410
No!!

308
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,720
Hey you!

309
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,240
Tae Song, didn't you leave after work earlier?

310
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,650
I'm about to go now.

311
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,460
Goodbye!

312
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,270
If I picked out a gift, he could just give it to me. Why is he taking so long?

313
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,080
Did you write a confession letter?

314
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,830
Tae Song!

315
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,210
Tae Song, really...

316
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,940
What were you thinking about so hard? You just had to give it.

317
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,650
Thank you!

318
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,160
But, what kind of friend is she that we have
 to drive this far?

319
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,750
Instead of a long explanation,

320
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,820
on the internet, search up the trot prodigy, Seo Yoo Mi.

321
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,720
Seo Yoo Mi?

322
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,520
For some reason, it's empty. I guess there's not a trot audition today.

323
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,350
Today, they're going to cast at the countryside.

324
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,550
Hello, Executive Director Wang.

325
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,550
Then, did the President personally go?

326
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,880
The President and Choi Chun Hee.

327
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,310
Why is she...?

328
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:52,010
These days, the President is working too hard.

329
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,720
He must really be free these days. Why would the president go there himself?

330
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,290
Oppa, what are you doing?

331
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,510
You like Choi Chun Hee!

332
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,980
What?

333
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,410
I even put her next to you. Why aren't you doing anything?

334
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,920
So frustrating!

335
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:19,860
Hey kids, do you know where a student named
 Seo Yoo Mi is?

336
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,590
Seo Yoo Mi?

337
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:24,050
Ah, her? The girl who sings?

338
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,360
You know... Her.

339
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,250
The girl with the scar on her face?

340
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,270
Go to the the area with the bronze statue.

341
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:34,020
Okay, thank you!

342
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:42,600
♫ A thing you cannot possess in life, ♫

343
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,780
♫ for that name, for that name alone, ♫

344
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:55,960
 Inside my tears, my heart that misses you   

345
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:02,930
♫ I just send, send myself drifting. ♫

346
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,020
I want to,

347
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,320
but my dad won't ever allow me to.

348
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,890
My dad is embarrassed about me.

349
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:31,330


350
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,520
I don't have anything to say anymore, so please go back.

351
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,700
Can't you give her a chance?

352
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,970
Father, Yoo Mi really wants to sing.

353
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,740
In Shine Star, we will train her to be a great trot singer.

354
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,580
I don't need anything!

355
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:49,670
I can't ever let my daughter do things 
 that requires her to appear in front of people.

356
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,690
Wait a minute!

357
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,980
Now, what?

358
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,940
By any chance,

359
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,690
just really by any chance,

360
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,440
is it because of Yoo Mi's face?

361
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,350
What?

362
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:07,660
Do you hate that Yoo Mi's injured face will be 
presented in front of people?

363
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,480
What?

364
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,280
You people, get out of my sight.

365
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,860
Right now!

366
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,620
Father, fath-

367
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,100
What is it now?

368
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,020
I have something to show you.

369
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,750
Here.

370
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,410
You don't know how happy Yoo Mi is 
when she sings, do you?

371
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:37,380
If you see this video, you will probably change your mind.

372
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,860
I'm warning you,

373
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,450
if you bother me one more time, I'm calling the police.

374
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:49,360
Father. Can't you think about it one more time?

375
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,910
For Yoo Mi. Please?

376
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,860
Father. Father.

377
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,530
Father!

378
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,910
They say once you start, you see the end.

379
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,940
Choi Chun Hee, you're really stubborn.

380
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,340
Yoo Mi will be disappointed.

381
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,930
We did as much as we could.

382
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,960
Let's go.

383
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,960
Where's the car? It should be somewhere around here.

384
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,250
Our car must have been towed.

385
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,230
 Right now the operating hours are over 

386
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,870
They said the operating hours are over.

387
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,870
Excuse me?

388
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,260
We're in trouble.

389
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,170
It's going to be hard to ride the train.

390
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,870
- Why?
- The time.

391
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,590
There's only about 53 seconds left.

392
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,060
We only need 47 seconds.

393
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,360
Choi Chun Hee!

394
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,100
Hurry up and come! Why are you just standing there?

395
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,780
I think we missed the train.

396
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,630
Here.

397
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,270
Excuse me?

398
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,240
Huh?

399
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,100
What is this?

400
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,730
Were you joking around?

401
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,340
You really don't know how to give up, Choi Chun Hee.

402
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,460
I was a former marathon runner.

403
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,430
Ah really.

404
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,370
I forgot.

405
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,750
Aren't you the singer Choi Chun Hee?

406
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,700
Ah yes. I am.

407
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,610
See? I told you.

408
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:44,090
I'm a fan.

409
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:49,060
But, is he your boyfriend? He's really good looking.

410
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,790
No, he's not.

411
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,680
I won't spread any rumors around.

412
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,360
But instead,

413
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,750
can I have your autograph?
-Me too

414
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,380
Ah, yes.

415
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,180
Here.

416
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,560
Here you go.

417
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,980
Then I should pay you back in kind, no?

418
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,520
Here. This is squid, please eat it.

419
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,250
Thank you.

420
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,940
Share it well between you two.

421
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,150
Yes. Thank you.

422
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:14,180
Ah, ma'am, the secret...

423
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,960
I'm telling you don't worry.

424
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,620
We're really not.

425
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,090
When I was in New York,

426
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,750
I would occasionally roast and eat squid.

427
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,430
But someone must have reported it because of the smell...

428
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,880
because the police came.

429
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,230
Then... you couldn't eat squid again after that time?

430
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,740
Would Jo Geun Wu do that?

431
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,260
I ate it even more often than before.

432
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,360
They came a few times after that...

433
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,680
then the police stopped coming.

434
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,450
Wow, you could run a marathon.

435
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:08,250
Hey!  That's not how you eat yogurt!  Watch this.

436
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,750
Hold it like this...and see this thing underneath, like this?

437
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,730
Do it like this, and then...

438
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,490
Like this.

439
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,080
Why do you eat it like that?

440
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,090
You have to do it this way to get every last drop out.

441
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,230
Oh, really?  Oh...

442
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,810
Uh huh, that's not bad.

443
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,690
It's pretty good, right?
- Yes!

444
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,820
Ah, what are you doing?
- Mom!  Mom!

445
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:44,110
Mom!  Mom!

446
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,790
Should we run away?

447
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,650
What?

448
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,040
Once a child starts crying, they usually don't stop.

449
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,820
And there are staff members over there.

450
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,260
Mom!  Mom!

451
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,450
Child, are you crying? Where are your parents?

452
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,550
Where did your mom go?

453
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,940
- Mom!
-  There, there.

454
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,530
We made an announcement, so the baby's mom should be here soon.

455
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:18,100
Oh, thank you.

456
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,640
But Chun Hee, if we don't go quickly, we will miss our train.

457
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,250
Baby...

458
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,690
your mom will be here soon, so just wait a little bit, okay?

459
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:30,990
I'll be going first.

460
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,060
Let's go.

461
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,550
Don't go.

462
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,430
Do you really want me not to go?

463
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,310
Then do you want to sing and play with Noona?

464
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,090
Uh...well...

465
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:02,610
 Boong boong boong. A very small car 

466
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,770
 A little car is going out. 

467
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:08,530
That song is from our generation.

468
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:12,260
  I like playing the best 

469
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:16,000
 Gather around friends 

470
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,440
 I am always happy 

471
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,630
 Little prankster, "Sang Beom". 
(originally it's Pororo) 

472
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,260
Should we eat something?

473
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,290
Sang Beom!

474
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,490
Mom!

475
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:32,840
My little baby.

476
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,690
Oh no, the train that just left...

477
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,800
was the last train.

478
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,490
Oh, then...

479
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,870
Until the first morning train comes...

480
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,010
we'll just have to wait.

481
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:56,120
Oh no... But Byeol will be waiting...

482
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,550
What, they missed the train?

483
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,400
Then when are they coming?

484
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,920
Since they missed the last train, they'll probably take the first train in the morning.

485
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,040
She called because she was worried about Byeol.  I'm going there right now.

486
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,800
Wait...

487
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:19,100
How can a girl be so fearless?  What, she's taking the early morning train?

488
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,380
It's so ridiculous.

489
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:26,160
What are you doing here talking to yourself?

490
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,370
President, you came at a good time!

491
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,180
Please call your son right now.

492
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,660
Why should I call him?

493
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,000
Because of work,

494
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,260
he went to a different province with Choi Chun Hee.  But they haven't come back yet.

495
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,760
Ch-Choi Chun Hee and Geun Wu went to another province?

496
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,180
That's what I'm saying!  Call him quickly, and see where they are.

497
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,330
Huh?  W-why should I?

498
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:49,190
The way I see it, it's not... that worrisome.

499
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,050
What?

500
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:53,490
But, a fully grown girl

501
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:58,360
is spending the night with a top grade ultra snake-like guy, and you're not worried?!

502
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,820
Wow...  I'm about to go crazy!

503
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,030
I think you've forgotten for a moment, but...

504
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:08,210
that ultra snake-like guy is my son.

505
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:11,780
But son or not, if they missed the train, they should take a taxi home...

506
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,920
What is it?  Do they not have money or something?

507
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,710
Isn't he doing this on purpose?

508
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,790
President, you're always lecturing me to do this or that...

509
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,190
-- Is this honestly how you taught your son?
 -- It is.

510
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,830
Even I... have things that I have no power over.

511
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,770
- Cheers.
 - Yes.

512
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,970
If I stop and think about it...

513
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,920
I think I was being too presumptuous earlier.

514
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,470
Huh?

515
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,510
My father...

516
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:02,370
was also against me running marathons, you see.

517
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,480
But it turns out...

518
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,220
that he did it all to save me.

519
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,710
Yoo Mi's father also...

520
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:17,240
is not embarrassed by  her,

521
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,620
but may be opposing it because he's afraid she will get hurt, don't you think?

522
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:26,460
I thought that even if Yoo Mi gets hurt...

523
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,810
I hoped that she could do what she loves, which is sing.

524
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:36,920
But a parent's heart could be different.

525
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,680
Nah...it's just that each person thinks differently.

526
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,170
However, I... cast one vote for what you said.

527
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,450
You must be tired, so get some sleep.

528
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,510
Yes, get home safely, President.

529
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,770
Sleep well.
- I will.

530
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,670
What is this?

531
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:09,200
Are you sure you're the president?

532
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:14,490
You ask me to leave because I might cause a scandal, but what is this?

533
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:19,080
Taking a female singer to another region and coming back together early in the morning.

534
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,150
What are you going to do if there is a scandal between you and Choi Chun Hee?

535
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,270
A scandal?

536
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,370
It doesn't matter to me.

537
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,470
Excuse me?

538
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:34,540
You can't block a scandal, but I can.

539
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,750
Work hard.

540
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,950
Unni...

541
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:58,210
Unni!  Wake up!

542
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,050
I'm awake.

543
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:06,300
- Unni, there's a family cooking contest at school today.
- Is that right?

544
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,830
Byeol, are you hungry?

545
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,410
I'm just going to sleep a little bit more.

546
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,970
I'll be back.

547
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,010
Byeol, you sleep well too.

548
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:38,180
Hello, Chun Hee!

549
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,960
Hello, Sunbae.

550
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,320
Did you eat yet?

551
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,100
If you haven't eaten yet, let's go together.

552
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,970
- Ah, I...
- Why?  Because of what I said before?

553
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,760
I was too sensitive back then.

554
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,190
As an apology, I'll buy something delicious.
- But...

555
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,130
Let's go!

556
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,050
Ah, but I already ate.

557
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,700
Welcome.

558
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,940
Come in.

559
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,440
I met Chun Hee so I came with her. It's fine, right?

560
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:19,690
Well... I guess...

561
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,560
Have a seat,  Chun Hee.

562
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,530
Ok.

563
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,790
Soo In, you're eating water noodles right?

564
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:36,990
I ordered it.

565
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,460
Thanks.

566
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,060
What about you, Chun Hee?

567
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,020
I'll have spicy noodles.

568
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,770
One more spicy noodle here, please.

569
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,920
Soo In, did you think about your new song's concept?

570
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,590
I'm not sure, I'm going to entrust everything to you.

571
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,360
Working with you makes me feel at ease.

572
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,530
I'll trust you.

573
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,870
And you should have made some songs for Chun Hee.

574
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,540
You were her manager before.

575
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,490
I don't give songs to anyone.

576
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,030
Looks like ours came first.

577
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:23,140
You can go ahead and eat first.

578
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,650
- Soo In, you don't put mustard sauce, right?
 -Yeah.

579
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:43,210
Oppa, give me some water.

580
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:46,370
Instead of water, drink some warm broth.

581
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,110
A singer should take care of her throat.

582
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,670
Thanks, Oppa.

583
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,950
Hold on.

584
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,710
Done.

585
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,000
Eat well.

586
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,030
You too.

587
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,160
"I don't give songs to anyone."

588
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,360
Huh! Really?

589
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,620
You don't give songs to anyone? Then you're a bad bastard now.

590
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,900
You bad bastard.

591
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,330
You're going to be "Bad Bastard" from now on.

592
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:24,640
 

593
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,470
Hmph! Bad bastard!

594
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,680
Choi Byeol!

595
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,680
Ahjussi!

596
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,070
For all this time, where were you and what were you doing?

597
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:48,440
What was I doing? I'm a really busy person!

598
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,770
But what's with your expression?

599
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:58,100
Did you get a zero on your test?

600
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,290
No I didn't.

601
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,910
Family cooking competition?

602
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,390
Your school does these kind of things?

603
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:13,750
Unni is tired and coach is busy...

604
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,110
I don't think I can do this...

605
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,800
Really?

606
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:26,370
Hyung! Why are you taking all the keys?

607
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,980
Sorry, sorry. Here.

608
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,950
Byeol's here too, let's go in.

609
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,370
It's ok.

610
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:36,430
I'm going now, Ahjussi.

611
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:38,400
See you later.

612
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:52,870
For today's family cooking competition topic, it's "Our warm house."

613
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:56,500
For the first place family, tada!

614
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,270
They will receive a ukulele, so everyone do your best!

615
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,360
Shall we start?

616
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,410
Yes!

617
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:19,520
For kids whose family couldn't participate, 
you can do it with me.

618
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,810
Byeol, come here.

619
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,600
Byeol's family is here!

620
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:47,810
- What's this?
- Red, orange, yellow, and green.

621
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,620
Slice it!

622
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,730
Ahjussi, you're the best!

623
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,440
Byeol, shall we flip it?

624
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:05,870
One more time?

625
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,760
Yay!

626
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,050
You did well.

627
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,330
Thank you.

628
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:22,000
Today's first place goes to...

629
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,670
Choi Byeol's family!

630
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,800
Congratulations!

631
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,810
- You did well.
- You did well too, Byeol.

632
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:40,720
For first place, they receive a ukulele.

633
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,100
- Congratulations, Byeol!
- Thank you!

634
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,390
This is totally a scam!

635
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:50,550
That ahjussi isn't Byeol's family!

636
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:53,230
You only have a sister!

637
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,570
He's not even your dad!

638
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:57,470
Ahjussi is my family though...

639
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,370
Really?

640
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:01,270
This is a family cooking competition,

641
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:03,490
if they aren't family, isn't that cheating?

642
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:07,650
What are you talking about? Cheating?

643
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:10,420
Byeol, is he your uncle?

644
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,300
I'm not her uncle but,

645
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,370
I'm her family.

646
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,390
- If he's not her uncle, who is he?
- What is going on?

647
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:23,630
For now, I'll hold off the prize.

648
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:28,270
After talking with the mothers, we’ll tell you the results.

649
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:31,660
Good job today everyone.

650
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,420
Hey Teacher, you can't take back what you gave.

651
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,260
Hey Ladybug.

652
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:45,820
- We are family!
- Hold it in.

653
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,810
Don't be too disappointed.

654
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:52,520
I'm just happy that you came.

655
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,110
You're acting like a saint.

656
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:58,410
How are you two sisters so alike?

657
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,530
But how did you come today, Ahjussi?

658
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:05,110
Because,

659
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,490
we're family.

660
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:13,660
But this is a secret to your sister, you know that right?

661
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:20,250
Aish, so close.

662
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:30,470
 

663
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,850
Byeol.

664
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,640
What is it, Unni?

665
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,640
Why didn't you tell me about this?

666
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,730
Well...

667
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,950
Today...

668
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,480
- Hello?
- Hello, I'm Byeol's teacher.

669
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,090
Oh, hello!

670
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:56,300
It's been decided that Byeol is first place.

671
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,680
I wanted tell you that.

672
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,620
Eh?

673
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:04,380
Ah... Thank you... Yes.

674
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:11,120
Byeol, she says you won first place on the cooking competition.

675
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,290
Wow! Really?

676
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:17,280
Congratulations...

677
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:22,440
But Byeol... Who did you go with to the family cooking competition?

678
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:33,380
 This is a secret but... 

679
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:36,080
 Ahjussi helped me out. 

680
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,780
To MJ... MJ?

681
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:55,530
Who’s MJ?

682
00:48:55,530 --> 00:49:00,600
Mee... Mee Jung? Min Joo? Mee... What?

683
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,290
Soo In is... SI.

684
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:06,450
Ah, who is this?

685
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:09,680
God there’s a lot.

686
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,820
What are you doing?

687
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:15,550
- Ah... Sorry...
- From now on, don't touch my stuff.

688
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,450
Sorry.

689
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,090
Jang Joon Hyeon.

690
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:43,180
It’s good to keep your distance with her,

691
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,720
but you shouldn't treat her harshly.

692
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:55,270
Before giving me advice, you should behave yourself properly.

693
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:57,680
A scandal to a female singer is critical.

694
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,800
I know. And you should stop minding Choi Chun Hee's business.

695
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,530
I’ll handle it.

696
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,080
Come in.

697
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:32,950
Hello, Sunbaenim.

698
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,690
I have something to show you.

699
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,860
What's this?

700
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:59,990
The paparazzi must've gotten some money 
from our company for these pictures.

701
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:03,300
That's why Oppa Joon Hyeon stopped 
being your manager.

702
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,920
And he left your house too.

703
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,160
To protect you.

704
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,940
I can't watch Joon Hyeon having a hard time anymore.

705
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,810
So I wanted to tell you.

706
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:40,600


707
00:51:56,140 --> 00:52:02,790
♫ It's not as if her eyes are pretty,
nor is her nose pretty.

708
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:09,490
 MJ (Medal "Jinsang" (commotion) Girl) 
  ♫ How did I come to love you?

709
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:15,860
  To MJ   
♫ Did my heart melt at the sight of your smiling face?

710
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:22,060
♫  I like the way you look in that way you decided to look.

711
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:28,650
♫ When I was in your embrace, all the hard obstacles,

712
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:35,100
♫ all disappeared, really like a lie.

713
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:41,900
♫ Such warmth and coziness that I felt
 from  your body temperature

714
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:49,860
♫ I longed for it so. I only think of you all day.

715
00:52:49,860 --> 00:53:00,600
♫ I only think about you all day.

716
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:07,240
♫ More than anyone else in this world,
I suit you the best.

717
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:15,560
♫ Hold on to me so that I can stay next to you.

718
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:38,220
I heard.

719
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:41,910
I heard that you left my house for me.

720
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:46,850
What are you talking about?

721
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,240
I heard it all.

722
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:52,270
Because the paparazzi took a picture-

723
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:56,300
I don't know what you heard from whom, but

724
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:01,160
I didn't do this to protect you. I only did it for myself.

725
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,740
Because it's bothering me now 
when I'm preparing for my comeback.

726
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:09,930
Did you really leave 
because of your comeback album?

727
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:11,890
Is that true?

728
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:15,730
Hey, Choi Chun Hee.

729
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,730
You must have misunderstood something.

730
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:24,680
You're nothing to me.

731
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:29,540
Hey, you piece of gum. Why are you trying 
to stick to me?

732
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,420
All the memories with you,

733
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:36,120
I want to erase it all, without leaving anything out.

734
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:46,480
Then what about this?  What is this?

735
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:49,860
What about it?

736
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,890
Can you say that after seeing this?

737
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,980
Then why did you buy this for me?

738
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,550
When we went to Ganghwa Island, 
I said this was pretty.

739
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:05,530
Now you're finding meaning behind this cheap pin.

740
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:11,820
Anyway, I want to forget everything with you.

741
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:18,320
Hey, Jang Joon Hyeon,  the God of music,  
being the trot singer Choi Chun Hee's manager

742
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:24,950
was the worst time in my life.

743
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:30,320
So, don't show up in front of me anymore.

744
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,820
Don't even talked to me anymore.

745
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,650
Could you leave now?

746
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,000
Get out.

747
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,840
I said get out.

748
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,220
Get out!

749
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:54,390
You're not leaving?

750
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:57,990
Than I'll just leave.

751
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:17,750
I'm sorry.

752
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,690
- What is it? 
 - Jang Joon Hyeon!

753
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:05,800
Hey, didn't the girl come to you?

754
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,140
What about Choi Chun Hee?

755
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:10,120
She's been acting weird lately and then she disappeared without saying anything!

756
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,160
What?

757
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,920
What kind of manager are you? You're supposed to be watching her!

758
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,290
Hey! How can I watch her for 24 hours?

759
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:22,620
That's not the problem right now!

760
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:25,620
She's rising in Music Bank and her concert is around the corner.

761
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:30,290
 She has so many things to practice for. 
Where do I find her?   

762
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:32,610
Choi Chun Hee.

763
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:41,460
Choi Chun Hee! Choi Chun Hee!

764
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:45,230
Byeol! Choi Byeol!

 It sounds like you're saying that you have found
someone nice for yourself, Ms. Choi Chun Hee? 

795
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:16,870
  I'm going to propose on stage with this. 

796
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:20,220
 You know how you asked whether I had someone
I like in mind before? 

797
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:21,790
 I found someone like that. 

798
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:23,100
  Choi Chun Hee likes someone else. 

799
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,080
  I don't care who she likes. 

800
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,190
  It's enough that I like her. 

801
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:29,020
 Are you saying that Soo In can't perform on stage today? 

802
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:30,990
 Park Soo In's drunk driving incident is everywhere! 

803
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:33,460
 Is it Choi Chun Hee, that girl again? 
Are you being this way because of her again?! 

804
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,190
 Where do you think this is to repeat such heinous rumors?! 

805
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:37,610
 All the rumors are spreading. 

806
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:41,320
 I guess she has a lot of enemies in 
Shine Star  , Ms. Choi Chun Hee?
