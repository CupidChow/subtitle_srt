1
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,250


2
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,450
Welcome.

3
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,830
Ah, Mr. Jang Joon Hyeon.

4
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,240
I called because of the medallion necklace.

5
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,480
Ah, yes.

6
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,790
You said you'd be proposing on stage, then didn't pick it up, so...

7
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,410
I wondered whether something was going on with you.

8
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,450
Propose?

9
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,230
It's because of the accident, isn't it?

10
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,010
It's fortunate that the accident caused you no greater injury.

11
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,350
MJ?

12
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,490
I guess MJ is Park Soo In's real name?

13
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,190
Why is Soo In MJ?

14
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,480
It should be SI.

15
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,190
What's with you?

16
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,470
This is what you left at my place.

17
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,730
Why did I leave my carry-on bag at your place?

18
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,960
Ah, that is... Well, when you were at the hospital,

19
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,180
I packed your stuff to bring them to you, 
but... I, I forgot about it, and...

20
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,510
Why did I forget that?

21
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,370
Is that so?

22
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,580
Is it okay if I go to the bathroom?

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,530
"The first party and the second party to this contact  must compliment  each other once each day and,"

24
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,700
pat each other's head."

25
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,200
MJ really is Soo In!

26
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,350
Oppa!

27
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,320
Oh.

28
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,460
- What is it?
- Ah, nothing.

29
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,920
Sit comfortably.

30
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,100
This is comfortable.

31
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,440
Here.

32
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,060
The cake that you like.

33
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,020
Did you go all the way to Dogok-dong (to get this)?

34
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,490
I'll eat well, Oppa.

35
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,340
Soo In.

36
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,300
I did one thing that's worth a good compliment from you.

37
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,330
Here.

38
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,160
What?

39
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,400
What are you doing?

40
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,610
Thanks, Oppa.

41
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,470
This is not right.

42
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,910
Soo In, you must have forgotten.

43
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,950
You should do it like this.

44
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,400
Ah, sorry.

45
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,300
I don't like it when someone touches my hair.

46
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,760
It looks tasty. Try it as well, Oppa.

47
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:37,480
By the way, did I call you by something like a special nickname?

48
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,540
What?

49
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,030
I mean, maybe I called you in initials or something.

50
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,530
No, it seems I'm wrong.

51
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,240
Eat.

52
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,360
Oh, you got called by the promotional team.

53
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,740
Yeah? I'll be back.

54
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,620
Yes, Oppa.

55
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,990
If it's not Soo In, then who is it?

56
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,370
Did I really cheat on her?

57
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,070
MJ?

58
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,820
Hey Medal Troublemaker, what are you doing right now?!

59
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,290
Then perhaps...

60
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,550
Mom!

61
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,470
The MJ that Joon Hyeon is talking about seems to be Choi Chun Hee.

62
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,560
I should have told him the truth at the time.

63
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,120
What should we do if his memory returns?

64
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,290
Don't make a fuss. I will take care of it.

65
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,540
Get up now.

66
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,910
Let's go home.

67
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,780
  I stroked your head already. 

68
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,470
  You promised me that you will make me laugh everyday. 

69
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,890
 Let's go, Jang Joon Hyeon. 

70
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,970
It's driving me crazy.

71
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,230
Ah, I barely fell asleep.

72
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,450
Joon Hyeon, you're getting a new car.

73
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,040
A new car for me?

74
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,550
Remember Me became a hit.

75
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,700
Thank you.

76
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,560
By the way, you got an email from Professor Cornell who was your vocal trainer

77
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,830
asking if our MJ is alright?

78
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,480
Mmh?

79
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,750
What?

80
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,580
When she went to LA for her training,

81
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,450
Soo In's English name was Mary Jane.

82
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,740
It's nice having lunch together.

83
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,640
No matter how busy we get, let's spare some time from now on.

84
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,330
We're going to be a family anyway.

85
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,310
Isn't that right?

86
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:02,590
If this accident hadn't happened, you two would be married already.

87
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,980
Since our son-in-law is alright now, let's have the engagement ceremony soon.

88
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,400
Mom?

89
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,250
We already had selected a day before the accident.

90
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:19,840
It can't be that you have forgotten that as well?

91
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,990
Mom, are you crazy?

92
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,970
What on earth are you thinking?

93
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,640
Talking about an engagement suddenly, does that make sense?

94
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,740
There is no way left for you except this.

95
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,050
Even so, how could you make an engagement?

96
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,260
We used the Assemblyman Pyo card up.

97
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,390
Jang Joon Hyeon, if his memory returns now,

98
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,130
like you already said, what are you going to do then?

99
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,080
You should make Jang Joon Hyeon your family so you  will live.

100
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,000
After then, even if his memory comes back, he can't do anything about it.

101
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,890
Did you wait for long?

102
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,550
What about the director?

103
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,290
Mom left.

104
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,490
Why?

105
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,110
Why, to step aside from us on purpose.

106
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,380
To let us talk alone.

107
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,620
Oppa, our side will handle the preparation for the engagement.

108
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,590
Just do well on stage.

109
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:32,050
It hasn't been long since you've been discharged, if you worry about this and that, what should we do if your body gets worse.

110
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,860
Soo In, but that...

111
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,290
Second Part of the couple must obey the First Part unconditionally.

112
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,310
What?

113
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,280
Did you think I totally forgot about our couple contract?

114
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,200
I forgot about it for a bit since I was out of my mind because of your accident.

115
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,980
I'm sorry if you felt bad.

116
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,600
From now on, I'm totally going to act as the First Part.

117
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,470
Right.

118
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,330
What?

119
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,260
Hyung Tae Song,

120
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:31,840
Hyung maybe, did I have a woman?

121
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,750
Isn't Soo In the only woman you had?

122
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:42,720
Right, besides Soo In, there wasn't any other person, right?

123
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,470
Why why why?

124
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,810
Is there something wrong?
Why are you like that suddenly?

125
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,250
Right,

126
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,400
I don't know what's up with me lately.

127
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,740
You, where are you? I'll come to pick you up.

128
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,230
No, it's alright.

129
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,160
I'll hang up.

130
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,700
Go!

131
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,590
Aigoo...

132
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,100
You should sleep at home.

133
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,750
Stop!

134
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,560
♬ I really ♬

135
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,510
♬ like you a lot. ♬

136
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,370
It's Ahjussi!

137
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,350
Ahjussi!

138
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,250
It smells like alcohol.

139
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,010
Byeol.

140
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,380
Ahjussi is sleeping, so why don't we stay outside?

141
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,960
Let's go.

142
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,670
Why is he wearing sunglasses while sleeping...?

143
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,910
It's been a while.

144
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,610
Did your memory come back?

145
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:34,500
  ♫ The moment you stood next to me ♫ 

146
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:41,440
  ♫ I really liked the way you looked at me ♫ 

147
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:48,290
  ♫ Yesterday I cried, today ♫ 

148
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,060
  ♫ because of you. Tomorrow ♫ 

149
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:57,700
  ♫ I'll be happy ♫ 

150
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:04,580
  ♫ Neither his face or style, no not that ♫ 

151
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,880
  ♫ I just needed his tender love ♫ 

152
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:24,650
  ♫ To forget all that's passed ♫ 

153
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:32,570
  ♫ Without you, there's nothing I can do. ♫ 

154
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,330
  ♫ I can't do anything ♫ 

155
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,800
  ♫ I don't know anything but love ♫ 

156
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:52,900


157
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,320
Oh, water.

158
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,180
Water.

159
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,790
What are you...? Why are you here?

160
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,310
What did you do to me?

161
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,430
Did you kidnap me?

162
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,160
What?

163
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,390
Hey, you're really scary!  I didn't do-

164
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,370
How can you take me here even though I was drunk.

165
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,440
You came here with your own feet.

166
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
What?

167
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,770
Don't lie! How would I know to come to your house...?

168
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,560
Hey.

169
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,260
Did you perhaps... The reporters...

170
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,240
- Did you call them? 
 - What the heck do you think of me?

171
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,790
Hey, you don't come close! Stay 2 meters away from me.

172
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,000
This is my house.

173
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,130
- Tae Song Hyung! Where are you, Hyung? Save me.
-  Hello. 

174
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,980
Where are you?

175
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,500
Where I am is...

176
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,930
Bogwang-dong... Somewhere... Near townhouses...

177
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,210
What? Did you go to Chun Hee's house?

178
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,950
What?

179
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,700
How do you know where Choi Chun Hee's house is?

180
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,140
Hey, don't go anywhere. I'm coming right away.

181
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,230
What was that?

182
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,640
Has he come here before?

183
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,530
Did you even buy the dried pollack?

184
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,560
Why? You want to cook 
dried pollack soup (hangover soup) for me?

185
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,710
Don't get me wrong. It's not for you but for me.

186
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,010
Hey, it's dangerous!

187
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,000
But...

188
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,610
Have we...

189
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,980
been in the same situation before?

190
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,090
It wasn't you.

191
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,600
Is that you, Tae Song?

192
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,430
But how, how did you go all the way there?

193
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,820
That's what I want to know.

194
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,040
I don't remember anything after drinking.

195
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,560
But how would I know her house to go there?

196
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,480
- Do you know why? 
 - What, me?

197
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,090
I... don't know a thing either.

198
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,550
Oh, my head hurts.

199
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,950
 Notice of Shine Star Unity Event 

200
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,140
What?

201
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,460
You're not even saying thank you.

202
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,920
Why are you holding it so carefully?

203
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,070
Is that something your lover bought for you?

204
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,810
Yes.

205
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,330
My lover bought it for me.

206
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,200
Lover?

207
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,280
President?

208
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,520
At least their taste matches.

209
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,620
Choi Chun Hee!

210
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,080
Oh, hello, President.

211
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,770
Did you see the notice?

212
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,900
It's the event to strengthen the unity. Let's go together.

213
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,240
I'll stay in the studio and practice.

214
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,600
Oh, you don't have a choice.

215
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,070
You are the secretary for this event, so you must go.

216
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,660
I assigned you  the position of the secretary.

217
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,120
Aiyoo...

218
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,820
But, can it be?

219
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,040
What?

220
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,460
Can my heart beat so fast when I don't even want to see her face?

221
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,230
When you see someone you don't like, your blood pressure goes up.

222
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,020
Isn't that why your heart is beating faster?

223
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,800
Really?

224
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:56,670
Wow! This song must be really popular. Every time I turn the radio on, this song comes on.

225
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:06,110
But, when I was making this song, 
why did I say Soo In's eyes and nose aren't pretty?

226
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,710
There were lyrics like that? I don't really know.

227
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,490
Where is Soo In not pretty?

228
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,230
Yeah, that's right, but

229
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,730
if you keep saying she's pretty, it's just cheesy.

230
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,310
Isn't it using irony?

231
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,860
Really?

232
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,700
But,

233
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,100
my chest hurts.

234
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,110
Why! Why, why, why, why? Is something wrong with you right now?

235
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,820
It's not that.

236
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,490
When I hear the song I made.

237
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,480
Surely I wrote it.

238
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,500
And Soo In is next to me now.

239
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,600
But when I hear this song,

240
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,580
it hurts right here so much.

241
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,940
Hyo Yeol!

242
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,640
Shin Hyo Yeol!

243
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,340
Ughh.

244
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,250
It's been a long time.

245
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,250
I heard it's hard on you these days because of the woman scandal.

246
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:41,620
I've been through it, so I know it makes you 
feel totally unfair and angry.

247
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,360
- At times like this you just...
- Hey! Jang Joon Hyeon!

248
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,110
"Hey, Jang Joon Hyeon"?

249
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,230
Are you acting like my Sunbae just because you got popular again these days?

250
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,980
Wow, you're really something.

251
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,360
A person that dropped to the floor and was Choi Chun Hee's manager!

252
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,530
Hey! What do you mean?

253
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:08,570
I was whose manager?

254
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,460
Let go.

255
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,790
Let go of me! Unluckily true.

256
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:29,490
Choi Chun Hee, is it true I was your manager?

257
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,300
Tell the truth.

258
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,090
What the heck happened between you and me?

259
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,900
That's because...

260
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,820
Did I have some of my weakness 
caught by you?

261
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,340
Did you threaten me with that?

262
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,120
Geez.

263
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,460
President Jo Hee Mun told you to take care of me.

264
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,500
That's why you became my manager.

265
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,340
President Jo Hee Mun? Why?

266
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,940
Why are you saying such absurd things?

267
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,970
I don't know it clearly, so if you're curious, then go and ask him yourself.

268
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,230
Move aside, I'm leaving.

269
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,380
Ahjussi!

270
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,350
Ahjussi?

271
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,440
- Me?
 - Why did you leave? 

272
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,400
I was sad because you left without seeing me.

273
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,970
You came at the right time. Can you fix my ukulele?

274
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,930
Ukulele?

275
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:32,350
Byeol, I'll leave the ukulele at the repair store so go up first.

276
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,220
Let's go up. Let's go.

277
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,700
Let's go. Go up quickly and open the door.

278
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:51,000
No, why on earth would President Jo Hee Mun make me...?

279
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,900
Where am I supposed to find President Jo, 
when he's on vacation?

280
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,010
What are you doing to someone else's lettuce?

281
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,970
Is this yours?

282
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,700
You have to keep on picking these 
so that they can grow more leaves.

283
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,740
But, President, what are you doing here?

284
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,380
Is your injured area all right?

285
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,500
Yes. Well...

286
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,580
By the way, after the accident in the hotel parking lot,

287
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:35,630
they say I used to be Choi Chun Hee's manager. 
Did you, President Jo, really order me to?

288
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,700
Ah, it's because of the accident, I don't remember it well.

289
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,770
Aigoo, what is this? It seems you really don't remember anything.

290
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:51,010
Well, does it make sense that I, the God of Music, Jang Joon Hyeon, became a manager for a trot singer?

291
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,530
Is this,

292
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:56,610
perhaps a candid camera to see my reaction?

293
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,770
What candid camera? What you said is right.

294
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:03,150
I ordered you to be Choi Chun Hee's manager.

295
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:06,200
- Excuse me?
- We made a deal.

296
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,130
If you make Choi Chun Hee win the first place
on the K-pop chart rank program,

297
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:13,100
then I would give you a comeback album.

298
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,810
But you broke your promise and just left.

299
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,670
Ah, I probably did!

300
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:23,950
Then, do you think I would keep on taking care of that trot singer?

301
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,120
Anyway,

302
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,090
perhaps, that Medal Troublemaker,

303
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:35,880
no, can Choi Chun Hee be your hiden daughter?

304
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,320
There is...

305
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,020
someone I'm indebted to. 
She is that person's daughter.

306
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,040
You know now? Did you vent everything?

307
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,370
Go now.

308
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:00,330
Right now is not the time for you to pick lettuce!

309
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,950
Your son is ruining the company right now.

310
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,020
What are you saying?

311
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,700
It's because I'm here that the company is ok.

312
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,800
President, hurry and go back to the company!

313
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,140
Unni, should we play the game 
of " connecting the story? "

314
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,810
Right now? No, we should sleep.

315
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,770
Unni, sit down.

316
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:40,930
A long long time ago, a dad who sold rice cakes, with a brother and a sister ...

317
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,500
No, a girl lived with her older sister.

318
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,800
This seems weird, though.

319
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,080
The rice cake owner is a father? Not a mother?

320
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,910
Listen.

321
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:01,860
The dad worked really hard every day for his two daughters.

322
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,520
But the problem was that the rice cakes didn't sell well.

323
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,940
- They  didn't sell? 
 - Next is your turn. 

324
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,240
- Do I just start from where you left off? 
 - Yeah.

325
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,180
Because the rice cakes didn't sell, 
did he sell something else?

326
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:20,270
Ahoo! I'm forgiving you this once!

327
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,110
Okay!

328
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:29,710
While Dad was working hard selling rice cakes, the older and younger sister waited at home.

329
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,510
The older sister worked hard by singing,
 while the younger studied diligently.

330
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:39,060
The two waited in earnest for their dad to come. 
Next, your turn!

331
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,390
Then, one day,

332
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,090
the dad sold all the rice cakes and returned home.

333
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,850
The end.

334
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,080
- And, 
 - And?

335
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,510
the mother who went far away, also returned back home.

336
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:01,550
Do you want to see Mom?

337
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:08,420
Unni, my teacher told me that what you say, comes true.

338
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,830
Oh, right! It's not the end yet.

339
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,260
Ahjussi also returned home!

340
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,900
How's that? Is it the end now?

341
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,820
The end.

342
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,930
Come here.

343
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,690
Where did you learn this kind of stuff?

344
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:40,840
Like that, everybody returned home and lived well happily.

345
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,760
Here, let's eat.

346
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,140
What are you doing? Go and bring some soondaeguk.

347
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,710
I'm not working here right now.

348
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:05,290
Then why are you here? If you aren't a part-time worker?

349
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:08,210
Then, why does the other side keep on coming here?

350
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,950
What? The other side?

351
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:12,730
I saw you nicely but you have no manners.

352
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:17,300
A kid doesn't need to know that.

353
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,480
I heard that you received all the debt money 
including interest from Choi Chun Hee.

354
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,920
I wonder if Noonim knows that?

355
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,340
A business is like a knife.

356
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,010
The world is a cold place.

357
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,810
The soondaeguk is here.

358
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:38,270
- Oh, Noonnim! Wait, give it to me.

359
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,700
Tae Song!

360
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,270
Tae Song, your girlfriend came. Hurry and go.

361
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,980
Hey, let go.

362
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,800
Where should I put this? At what table?

363
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,590
It goes here. I brought them for you to eat.

364
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,660
Hurry up and sit down. What are you doing? What?

365
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,720
Thank you.

366
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,900
Sit down.

367
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,670
Is this the soondaeguk?

368
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,880
As I expected ...

369
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,060
I knew if I came here I can see you, Tae Song.

370
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:13,320
Wh- why? Why did you come here?

371
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,510
Ah! Aren't you going on vacation?

372
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:19,930
- Excuse me?
- Well the weather is hot and it's perfect for a vacation.

373
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:22,900
I was wondering if I could help out in your vacation schedule.

374
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,720
Vacation my ass.

375
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,710
I already agreed to go 
to Shine Star's Unity Event for 1 night 2 days.

376
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,280
You're going to the Unity Event,

377
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,740
instead of vacation?

378
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,380
So I even used to visit that house?

379
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,820
No wonder. When I went there after being drunk,
 that place looked somehow familiar.

380
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,570
All small apartments in Korea 
do look similar anyway,

381
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,970
and now you're not curious 
about you being a manager any more, right?

382
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,190
Yeah.

383
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:45,360
Tomorrow Shine Star is having the Unity Event day, 
but you're not going, are you?

384
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,870
What do you mean the Unity Event? 
It's so tacky and the weather is too hot.

385
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:52,100
I knew that so I already told them you're not going.

386
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,940
So since you don't have anything scheduled tomorrow, 
I'll go instead.

387
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,290
What are you talking about?

388
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,900
Why are you going when I'm not even going?

389
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,230
I'm a secretary of the event with

390
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,480
Chun Hee. So I have to go.

391
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,450
What? Secretaries?

392
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,870
Who did you say you're a secretary with?

393
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:12,450
Miss ... Chun ... Hee.

394
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:16,060
Then, I'll go to get ready for tomorrow.

395
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,210
Wait, wait.

396
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,550
It's been a while, should I go?

397
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:24,650
It's fine for a person to do tacky things once in awhile.

398
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:29,520
And it's good for them if the god of music, Jang Joon Hyeon, goes and shines some light over there.

399
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,220
I only reserved one VIP room thinking that you wouldn't go.

400
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,660
What?

401
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,890
- Can I have your name?
- Jo Geun Woo.
- Ah, the person who reserved the VIP room?

402
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,730
Here you go.

403
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,630
I should take the VIP room.

404
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,210
Because I'm the artist, Jang Joon Hyeon.

405
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,460
Wait, wait.

406
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,340
But I'm the president.

407
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,630
If I'm not in a VIP room, I can't sleep.

408
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,120
You sleep perfectly well somewhere else.

409
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,510
What?

410
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,230
Nothing.

411
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,870
This is going to be my bed.

412
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,080
Ah, I should go take a shower.

413
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,710
Excuse me.

414
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,910
There's no need to look at me like that.

415
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,610
I'm not using this room because I like it.

416
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,750
It's because no one said they wanted to share a room with you.

417
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,430
Yes.

418
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,220
Wow the tension between the president and Joon Hyeon is no joke.

419
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,630
They won't end up fighting will they?

420
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,970
Wow, this is really nice.

421
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:23,610
I thought I wouldn't be able to rest like this.

422
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,140
Oh, this is nice.

423
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,620
Oh, you scared me.

424
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,410
How did you know to come here?

425
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,850
What?

426
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:44,160
Cheers for the Shine Star's Summer Unity day!

427
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,190
Cheers!

428
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,910
The meat will be cooked for everyone soon.

429
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:52,370
President! We want to hear you sing.

430
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:59,740
President! President! President!

431
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,310
A singer should be the one singing.

432
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,980
Soo In, I'll sing a song for you.

433
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:24,040
♬  It's not as if her eyes are pretty or her nose  ♬

434
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:30,680
♬  How did I come to love you?  ♬

435
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:37,370
♬  Did my heart melt completely at her smiling face?  ♬

436
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:43,040
♬  I like you exactly how you look  ♬

437
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,340
It's been a while.

438
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,390
Hello.

439
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,010
Why did you come here?

440
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:57,730
You're not part of the Shine Star family.

441
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,510
That's true.

442
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,410
I just wanted to see the kids so I came.

443
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,660
This place is only for the Shine Star family.

444
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,220
It's not a place that anyone can come to.

445
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,570
Anyone?

446
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,770
I've been part of the Shine Star family for 10 years.

447
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,850
Your words are too harsh.

448
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,960
Because of whom did I get kicked out.

449
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,510
You better watch your mouth.

450
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:25,380
Or it's going to be difficult for you.

451
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,350
Since you came, play for today.

452
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,480
But next time, know when to come or not.

453
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,130
Got it?

454
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,600
Move.

455
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,770
I'm going to kill Director Wang.

456
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:52,550
I'm leaving because I don't want to see you Wang asshole.

457
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,630
Do you want to go for a second round?

458
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:07,960
Everyone else is outside. Why did you come?

459
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,280
It's no fun out there.

460
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,530
Second round at my room, call?

461
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,400
Call.

462
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,720
I'm completely addicted to games these days.

463
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,020
Is there another game besides the "Dart" game?

464
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,710
I don't know either...

465
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,470
- Oh, there is! 
 - What?

466
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:32,800
It's a game that Byeol taught me recently.

467
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:39,080
It's when one person starts a sentence from a fairy tale, 
the next person continues it on.

468
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,460
Sounds fun.

469
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:44,590
Uhh... if you repeat the same sentence 
or can't say anything, you lose.

470
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,080
Oh, I like it.

471
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,390
Let's try it once.

472
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,950
Since we came to the beach,

473
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:55,310
long time ago, in the ocean, there was a sea cucumber,

474
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:58,990
a sea anemone and a mackerel lived there.

475
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,410
And a mermaid lived there too.

476
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:06,760
That mermaid sang very very well.

477
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:11,480
That mermaid fell for the prince.

478
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,100
Because the prince was good looking,

479
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:18,380
sexy, and sang very well also.

480
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:24,650
Although the mermaid and prince loved each other,

481
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:28,400
the prince couldn't remember the mermaid because of an accident.

482
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,500
There was a prince from the neighboring country, 
who loved

483
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:43,470
the mermaid who liked another guy.

484
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,900
That mermaid was crazy for a man,

485
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:52,030
and threw away her family, rudely.

486
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:56,800
She couldn't even stab the prince with the dagger 
which her sister got for her after giving up her hair.

487
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,520
Hey! We can only say one line at a time.

488
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,820
Soo In. You should do it too.

489
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,600
Oh.

490
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:12,820
In the end, the prince couldn't remember the mermaid,

491
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:17,010
and married the princess of another land.

492
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,010
So the mermaid,

493
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:28,040
decided to become bubbles and disappear.

494
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,170
What kind of ending is that?

495
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,990
It feels weird.

496
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:43,920
Hey, I saw the ending for this movie and the ending wasn't like this.

497
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,220
What are you doing now?!

498
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,600
Since you couldn't continue the story, you lost.

499
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,090
- Penalty!
 - I, really!

500
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:55,990
Then you should have told me earlier!

501
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:58,380
The other prince,

502
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:02,280
never allowed the mermaid

503
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,270
to become bubbles. Never.

504
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,630
The end.

505
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:30,910
Tae Song, I'm really happy right now.

506
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,980
- Don't do it.
 - I'll keep doing it!

507
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,510
Choi Tae Song...

508
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:49,890
Do I really have no talent for a singer even in your eyes?

509
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:53,440
Who said that? Who said that?

510
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,300
- What kind of bastard told you that?
- Wang A##hole!

511
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,610
Wang A##hole?

512
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:03,200
It's just because he doesn't know you well.

513
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,540
He doesn't know your charm.

514
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:12,110
No matter what anyone says you're still the ballad goddess.

515
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,330
Trot god?

516
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:19,350
Trot god my ass.

517
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,800
I don't have potential. I gave up.

518
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,540
Who said that? 
What kind of bastard told you that?

519
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:30,520
Our Tae Song is, among all the men I saw,

520
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,990
-  The best.
- The best?

521
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,610
The best.

522
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:40,730
I heard that for the first time.

523
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:45,080
Choi Tae Song...

524
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,740
This time I was faster?

525
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,920
 So the mermaid, 

526
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,040
 just decided to become bubbles and disappeared.   

527
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,410
Ah, it feels weird.

528
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,430
What kind of game was that?

529
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,440
Byeol, why?

530
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,340
You can't sleep?

531
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,310
Then, should I sing you a song?

532
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:58,850
One sheep, two sheep.

533
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:07,150
 ♬ On a green meadow ♬ 

534
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:12,700
♬ And Byeol who I love ♬    

535
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:17,840
♬  Living for a hundred years.  ♬

536
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,830
♬  Although one brags about a trendy high-rise  ♬

537
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:27,840
♬  Although following the trend in living too may be one's style   ♬

538
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:32,790
♬  I like it if I'm just with you. ♬

539
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:37,700
♬ I like it, I like it, if it's together with my darling. ♬

540
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:45,080
♬  If my Byeol and I will live together. ♬

541
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:49,880
♬  On a green meadow  ♬

542
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,750
♬ We build as pretty as a picture. ♬

543
00:43:54,750 --> 00:44:00,210
♬ I want us loving ♬

544
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:04,820
♬   And living for a hundred years.  ♬  

545
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,000
Who are y--?

546
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,050
Oppa!

547
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,950
Did you sleep well?

548
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:19,470
Oppa too?

549
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:27,130
Choi Chun Hee  must have left?

550
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:30,150
I don't know. When I woke up she wasn't there.

551
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:32,430
Where did she go the entire night?

552
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,670
What?

553
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:39,080
She went out at night and didn't come back?

554
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,420
By chance, the president too?

555
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:58,790
There she is.

556
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,440
I guess the rumors are true about Choi Chun Hee.

557
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,970
They said she had a complicated relationship with guys.

558
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:22,160


559
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,460
 Why are you holding that so preciously?
 What, did your lover buy it for you? 

560
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:35,330
 Yes, my boyfriend gave it to me. 

561
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:57,780
You were so stubborn about that VIP room,

562
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,960
but it seems you've slept somewhere else.

563
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:07,120
I guess so. I couldn't sleep because of your snoring.

564
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,140
I've enjoyed the stroll thanks to you.

565
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,350
- Yes.
- See you later.

566
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:15,000
Yes.

567
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:29,450
What?

568
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,350
Stroll?

569
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,270
Why am I ?

570
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,730
No, no, no...

571
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,420
Oh my god! Oh my god!

572
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:41,130
No, I didn't do it.

573
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,740
Yes, it was you.

574
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:53,130
Done!

575
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,980
What are you trying to look for?

576
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:18,260
Sunbae, have you seen a hairpin by chance?

577
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,750
Just now Joon Hyeon oppa threw it away.

578
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:26,080
- Jang Joon Hyeon?
- He threw it outside the window.

579
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:48,710
What is it?

580
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,530
Hey, you really threw  away my hair pin?

581
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:59,380
- What?
- Did you throw it away?

582
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,380
That cheap hairpin?

583
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,380
Yes, it's annoying so I threw it away.

584
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,350
Why did you throw it away without asking?
 Do you know what kind of hairpin that is?

585
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:08,520
What kind of hairpin is that?

586
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,180
Is it precious because the president gave it to you?

587
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,830
Jang Joon Hyeon, you really...

588
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:19,280
You're making a big scene for nothing. It's just a cheap pin.

589
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,970
Right...

590
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:24,950
What good is it talking to you?

591
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,210
Hey, are you going to look for the hairpin?

592
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:39,320
Yes, no matter how cheap it is to you, it's really precious to me.

593
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,280
Hey, Choi Chun Hee!

594
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,200
Ah, that girl.

595
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,520
Park Soo In, haven't you seen Choi Chun Hee?

596
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:59,050
She said she was going to sleep because she couldn't sleep last night.

597
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:01,060
Really?

598
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,010
Soo In!

599
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:05,840
Hey, haven't you seen Chun Hee?

600
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,920
I have something to discuss with her 
for our secretary work, but I can't find her.

601
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,960
She said she's sleeping inside.

602
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,320
I looked but she wasn't there.

603
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:16,820
Didn't she get in?
I don't see Joon Hyeon either, where did he go?

604
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,790
What the heck are we doing for a cheap pin?

605
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:42,630
Ah, yes, President.

606
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:46,620
 Choi Chun Hee,  where are you right now? You didn't get on the ship?

607
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:50,150
Ah, I left something important at the pension.

608
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:53,050
I'll follow you on the next ship.

609
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,570
Don't worry.

610
00:50:55,570 --> 00:51:00,250
Are you with Jang Joon Hyeon?

611
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,800
Yes.

612
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,210
Alright.

613
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:16,450
Hey. You said you threw it from my balcony, right?

614
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:19,090
How many times do I have to repeat the same words?

615
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:22,070
Then if we calculate the angle.

616
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:27,190
Ah, so I'm saying, if I throw it like this... So...

617
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,870
- Over there.
- Yes.

618
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,000
There.

619
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:42,650
Try going higher.

620
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:45,110
- Hurry up!
- Just a moment.

621
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:48,150
- My arms are about to fall off, hurry up.
- Wait for a second.

622
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:51,070
- I got it.
- Y-You got it?

623
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,750
Hey...

624
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:14,960
Are you okay?

625
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,050
Yeah.

626
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,650
Ow, my shoulder.

627
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:22,460
I found it!

628
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,300
Oh, that's a relief.

629
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:34,210
Do you like it that much?

630
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:38,400
Of course, this is really important to me.

631
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,050
Thank you.

632
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,170
Thank you.

633
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,880
The next ship is departing in three hours.

634
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,130
What? Three hours?

635
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:06,210
What do we do for three hours?

636
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:10,100
Since I found your hairpin, buy me food.

637
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,950
Since I used my strength, I'm so hungry that I'm about to die.

638
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,340
What do you want to eat?

639
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:22,240
It looks delicious. How much is it?

640
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,880
- Ten dollars.
- Ten dollars?

641
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,740
Hey, isn't selling food here unsanitary?

642
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:30,880
My grandmother is a diver, it's really fresh.

643
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,920
It's delicious! Hey, be quiet and sit down.

644
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,840
Here, try some.

645
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,960
I don't want to.

646
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,820
Here, eat it.

647
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,640
It's delicious, isn't it?

648
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:45,140
Fine, give me one dish of it.

649
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,880
Is it just you two selling these?

650
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,030
- My grandmother is sick, so I'm helping her sell these today. 
- Aigoo.

651
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:53,340
Oppa, I want to go home.

652
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:56,360
Just wait a little longer, we need to sell all these.

653
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,210
My legs hurt!

654
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:02,360
Then I'll buy you snacks on the way home.

655
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,500
I don't want to. I said I don't want to!

656
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,630
I'm sorry. Let's sell them quickly and go, huh?

657
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:13,090
Should Noona help you sell these?

658
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:17,450
Hey! What are you trying to do?

659
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,300
Come here and have a look! The food here is so good to die for and the BGM (background music) is awesome!

660
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,980
Hey, Choi Chun Hee! What are you doing?

661
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:39,150
♬ In a village of an island ♬

662
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:44,390
♬ Where sweetbriers bloom and fall ♬

663
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:46,600
Here, have a look.

664
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:52,880
♬ There was a bachelor teacher ♬

665
00:54:52,880 --> 00:55:00,140
♬ who followed the migratory birds ♬

666
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:08,810
♬ A 19 year old island girl gave all of her heart ♬

667
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:14,550
♬ to the name, bachelor teacher ♬

668
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,950
 Did you get on the ship? 

669
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:30,710
Sorry, I was mistaken.

670
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:39,800
Why is everything hard for me?

671
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,840
But thanks to that accident, you got what you wanted.

672
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,200
You even got rid of the scandal.

673
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:47,550
Do you really think it like that?

674
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:53,670
Anyway, everything that happened, is what you chose.

675
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:05,660
That's right... I chose it.

676
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:11,630
Thanks to you, we sold it all, thank you very much.

677
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:14,710
Your grandmother will soon be very healthy.

678
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:17,540
Thank you.

679
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:21,190
Bye...

680
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:50,030
Aish, seriously, it's falling again...

681
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:54,700
It's all because you chucked it and now it's loose.

682
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,840
Seriously...

683
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,250
Give it to me.

684
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:03,460
Tilt your head.

685
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:11,590
Are you done?

686
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:29,050
But, about the mermaid princess yesterday...

687
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,650
Does it really end like that?

688
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:36,840
From what I know, the mermaid princess doesn't turn into bubbles and then end.

689
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:43,460
What can she do since the prince doesn't remember?

690
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:51,420
Then how would you like it to end?

691
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,260
Me?

692
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:16,050
Hey! The ship arrived, hurry up and come!

693
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:24,050
People are waiting, let's go.

694
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:40,420
About the mermaid princess before...

695
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:45,020
I remembered how it ended.

696
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:49,090
How does it end?

697
00:58:58,050 --> 00:59:01,460
The moment the mermaid princess turns into bubbles.

698
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:10,950
The prince's memory came back.

699
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:15,000


700
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:18,830
♬  Please remember me.  ♬

701
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:21,820
♬  I'll always be behind you.  ♬

702
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:25,910
♬  Please remember me.   ♬

703
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:32,250
♬  Like a fool who doesn't know how to give up  ♬

704
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:36,600
♬  Even if you are, even if you are  ♬
