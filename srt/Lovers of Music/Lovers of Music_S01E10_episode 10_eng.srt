1
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,400
 I only needed 

2
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,420
 Your gentle love 

3
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:25,500
 I'm forgetting 

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,370
 All the time that's passing. 

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:38,080
 Without you  

6
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,800
 I can't do anything. 

7
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,830
 I only know how to love. 

8
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:11,370
♬ Like gum, you only chase me around ​♬

9
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:18,270
Why do you always cause trouble when you are out of my sight? 
♬  You're tacky and stubborn.  ♬

10
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:25,920
♬ You enter and fill my heart. ​♬

11
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,780
♬ Please remember me. ​♬

12
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,850
♬ I'm always behind you. ​♬

13
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,800
♬ Please remember me. ​♬

14
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,220
♬ Even if the fool who doesn't know how to give up. ​♬

15
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:47,170
I'm sorry. 
​♬ Even if that's you, even if that's so ​♬

16
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:58,970
♬  I love you whom I can watch over that way. ​♬

17
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,520
We're here.

18
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,720
Can you just come in for a moment?

19
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,090
Byeol wants to see you.

20
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,200
I want to see Byeol, too,

21
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,790
but we have to be careful from now on.

22
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,640
You are not the old Choi Chun Hee. Fifty million people are watching you.

23
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,320
- If a scandal breaks out...
- I don't care about that.

24
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,150
I care about that a lot.

25
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,200
Just wait a little.

26
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,320
Can we just be together like before?

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,690
I want to be with you.

28
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,530
What did you say?

29
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,240
- I think I heard that.
- I didn't say anything.

30
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,670
You said something.

31
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,060
Let me go.

32
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,070
- I'm going. 
- Go in!

33
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,190
Go safely! Don't fall asleep.

34
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:35,430


35
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,190
 Are you sleeping? 

36
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,620
 Are you sleeping? 

37
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,990
 Hey, are you really sleeping? 

38
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,370
 You are too much. How can you sleep when we just had our first kiss? 

39
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,670
 This isn't my first kiss. 

40
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,720
It's not her first kiss?

41
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,200
 You, who is that boy? 

42
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,650
 There is a boy. Who is bad. 

43
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,530
Bad boy?

44
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,830
Who is that boy? Tell me!

45
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,470
You did it before.

46
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,760
What? Me?

47
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,250
You are so loud! Let me sleep!

48
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,010
Hold on.

49
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,610
Okay...

50
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,910
You should have told me before. I was so shocked.

51
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,330
Hello, President.

52
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,060
Choi Chun Hee!

53
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,260
What happened yesterday? You didn't answer your phone.

54
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,730
I'm sorry. From now on, it won't happen again.

55
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,700
Did you come here to tell me that? It's fine.

56
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,360
- Let's just go have lunch. 
 - Huh?

57
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,900
Why are you so surprised? Meals that you eat three times a day,

58
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,580
You're not going to get in trouble just because you eat one meal with me.

59
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,060
I'm not asking you to marry me.

60
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,190
Um, President.

61
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,020
Before, you asked me if I liked someone else.

62
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,990
There is someone like that.

63
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,970
I decided to eat lunch with him today.

64
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,920
I'm sorry, President.

65
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,410
Since you explained it well,

66
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,160
I feel really weird.

67
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,430
Hello.

68
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,890
Hello.

69
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,540
- Hello. 
- Hello.

70
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:53,170
♬  I smiled in the thrill  of you quietly staring at me. ♬

71
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:58,410
♬ Like a passing shower,  ♬

72
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:05,490
♬ You are the person who entered and  shook my heart. ♬

73
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,820
 I'll see you soon~ 

74
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:13,870
♬ One step each day , love like a snowflake,  ♬

75
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:19,220
♬ On your name, flowers bloom. ♬

76
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,870
♬ Before I knew it, as much as my feelings  ♬

77
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,660
♬ I'm growing to resemble you, ♬

78
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,280
You have to point your toes like this and splash. 
♬ This must be love  ♬

79
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,820
Like a synchronized swimmer?

80
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,300
Splash with me! 
♬   It will be nice if the person facing me,  ♬

81
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,170
Splash with me! 
♬ and smiling at me and comes together with me is you.  ♬

82
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,530
What are you doing? Don't take a picture, I have ugly feet.

83
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,750
Why? They are cute.

84
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,150
Whose feet are this cute?

85
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:59,270
What kind of immature action is this?
 ♬ Living only a day I will love like that and ♬

86
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,650
♬ Your day becomes mine. ♬

87
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:10,330
♬ Before I knew it,  like my feelings  ♬

88
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,720
♬ I'm growing to resemble you, ♬

89
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,040
♬ I must be in love with you  ♬

90
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,980
Die.

91
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,070
I shouldn't play poker with this rascal.

92
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,680
I have never seen him lose money in Las Vegas.

93
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,620
Truthfully, I came to lose money today.

94
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,590
But even that isn't working out.

95
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:56,610
Oh right, who's the girl you brought horseback riding last time?

96
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,550
A girl I can't deal with.

97
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,040
Hey, who is "A" and who is "B" (in this contract)?

98
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,820
Of course the person who likes more is "B".

99
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,870
Then I must be "B".

100
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,500
Stop fooling around, of course I'm "B".

101
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,250
"B" will make "A" laugh once a day.

102
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,810
No matter what "A" says, "B" will obey.
   

103
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,130
Wow, "B" is very busy!

104
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,900
"B" is supposed to be busy.

105
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:32,400
"B" will compliment "A" once a day, 
and pat "A".

106
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,490
I'll do this one too.

107
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,000
Really?

108
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,610
Okay then, "A" and "B"

109
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,050
will compliment each other every day

110
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,920
and will pat each other's head.

111
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,220
Okay?

112
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,150
Call.

113
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,620
Call.

114
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,930
-Okay then, let's make the names our initials. 
 -Call.

115
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:58,540
"B" is JH and "A" is MJ.

116
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,510
Hey, why do you keep calling me MJ?

117
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:05,430
My name is CH. Choi Chun Hee, CCH.

118
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,130
Choi Chun Hee, Miss CCH.

119
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,370
Your name is very unique but what if this gets leaked?

120
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,740
But I don't like the name "Medal Troublemaker Girl"  ("Jinsangnyeo" in Korean) .

121
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:26,560
Why? It's what caused us to first meet.

122
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,260
Oh, so is that why you saved my name as "Medal Troublemaker Girl" in your phone?

123
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,160
All right then. It's the same in my phone as well.

124
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,230
What?

125
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,210
Hey!

126
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,580
You should give it to me.

127
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,510
Hello? You can take it.

128
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,560
You're acting up, don't!

129
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,490
What? Bad Dude?!

130
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,570
What are you going to put?

131
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,470
 Pretty Man 

132
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,090
What?

133
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,590
Try saying "pretty man."

134
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,690
Park Soo In, what brought you here?

135
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:52,230
I came to see you, President. You come here often.

136
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,600
Right. There's a couple in Shine Star.

137
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,710
Who are they?

138
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:08,100
Oppa Joon Hyeon  and Choi Chun Hee.

139
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,240
- You knew about it? 
 - Well  a little.

140
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,680
I see...

141
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,570
Now that you think about it, there is a different fate for everyone.

142
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,610
I didn't know that would happen between them.

143
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,610
Fate? Do you believe in that?

144
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,320
To an extent.

145
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,290
President, then... Do you also know this?

146
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,960
President, I like you.

147
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,860
It's unfortunate, but like you said,

148
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,770
I don't think we are fate.

149
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,740
Is it because of Choi Chun Hee?!

150
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:13,920
Choi Chun Hee likes someone else,
 but are you still going to wait for her, President?

151
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,720
It doesn't matter who Choi Chun Hee likes.

152
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,180
I'm okay with just liking her.

153
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,950
 Sung Hee is so lucky. She got proposed to. 

154
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:39,330
 Hey what are you doing  next Saturday? 

155
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,180
Why?

156
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,330
Why?

157
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,420
Why?

158
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,180
Why?

159
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:07,240
Oh, hey, isn't this too fast? I'm not ready.

160
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,710
What are you thinking?

161
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,520
This girl.

162
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,460
Oh, what is this?

163
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,220
It's me!

164
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,510
  -Stop looking. 
 -Okay.    

165
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,310
Come here.

166
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,640
It's me.

167
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,330
Quite pretty, aren't you?

168
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,830
It could be like that. I told you not to film my feet.

169
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,130
- Why not, they're cute. 
- No.

170
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,950
Last week, Soo In's chart rank was pushed down 
because of her record sales result.

171
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:12,120
But at the beginning of this week, Ronnie King's music was all ready back at a downward trend.

172
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,750
Really?

173
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:18,310
Then, Soo In is finally going to be first.

174
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,290
Director Wang, you know as well.

175
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,420
To a singer how important a first place title is.

176
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,540
This time it's for real.

177
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,550
Hello?

178
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,540
I'm saying to come out! 
Did you drink alcohol?

179
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,390
You have to come out so we can settle this!

180
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,560
Miss!

181
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,060
Come out! Aish.

182
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,850
Soo In! Park Soo In. Are you hurt?

183
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,660
Are you ok? Raise your head!

184
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,280
Aigoo, my neck hurts. Aigoo.

185
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,980
I'm sorry. We'll compensate you fully.

186
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,980
The compensation isn't the problem, fellow!

187
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,700
If there is an accident, then the person should come out!

188
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,910
She's been like this the entire time!

189
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,050
I'm sorry. I apologize instead.

190
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,430
Let's talk for a minute.

191
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,780
- Park Soo In.  
- Wait.

192
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,110
Soo In? Aren't you the singer, Park Soo In?

193
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,800
So Park Soo In drank alcohol (and drove a car)?! 
This is big news.

194
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,630
Ah, that's right . Hey, Park Soo In!

195
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,820
Aigoo, aigoo it hurts.

196
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,650
How could you be drunk driving right before becoming first on the chart rank? Are you crazy?

197
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,550
No matter how popular you are, your career can end in one blow like this!

198
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,340
Come to your senses, Park Soo In!

199
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,430
Wow.

200
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,700
Why are you here already?

201
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,270
Oh, it's omurice.

202
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,930
Th-that...

203
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,380
Ah, I don't like beans.

204
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,610
Hey! Hey!

205
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,140
You were here, too, Chun Hee.

206
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,030
Yes.

207
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,820
All right, all right. I won't be picky, I won't be picky.

208
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,450
Aigoo, Tae Song really... I spent so much time on that.

209
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,670
You worked hard.

210
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,860
But we patted each other's heads awhile ago.

211
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,830
Stay still.

212
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,630
"B" usually doesn't talk back.

213
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,530
What's this?

214
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,820
This is a new one.

215
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,210
Oh! Wow.

216
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,390
Wow.

217
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:59,450
Are Joon Hyeon and Chun Hee dating?

218
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,620
Not with Soo In?

219
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,720
What are you doing?

220
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,010
Hey! Jang Joon Hyeon. Since when did you and Choi Chun Hee start dating?

221
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,380
Aigoo, why are you looking at another's things?  Embarrassing.

222
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,510
Let go. Nut, this song is really good. Did you make it for Chun Hee?

223
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,970
Aigoo. Stop it.

224
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,920
Your style changed a lot.

225
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,850
  What are you doing? 
Take a selfie and send it to me.    

226
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,620
  Aren't you going to finish with first place today?    

227
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:11,180
  You never know so prepare your greetings for later.    

228
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,500
  First place? keke Are you joking around right now?    

229
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,660
Choi Chun Hee.

230
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,970
Please get ready.  You're at the third place.

231
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,050
Yes.

232
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,190
The fourth week of July, Music Tank!

233
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,570
We'll start off by meeting the first place candidates.

234
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,710
Let's meet them together!

235
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,550
  Yes, this week's candidates for number one 
are TopKet's "Emotion"    

236
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,060
  and Evolution's "Love". Please look forward to it.    

237
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:54,100
What happened? Did something go wrong?

238
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,000
Park Soo In, one moment please.

239
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,710
Then do you mean that Soo In can't go out on stage today?

240
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,770
No, the stage isn't the problem right now.

241
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,580
Park Soo In's drunk driving news has spread everywhere.

242
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,740
How could you make an accident at a time like this?

243
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,100
There are no confirmed facts in those news.

244
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,300
It's only the other side who's saying that you smelled like alcohol.

245
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,390
Sunbae!

246
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,980
Let's talk next time.

247
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,040
Just a moment. Only a little moment will be fine.

248
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,330
I wanted to say thank you to Sunbae.

249
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,600
Because you showed me the picture last time, everything between Jang Joon Hyeon and I is all good now.

250
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,520
Thank you, Sunbae.

251
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,720
Let's go.

252
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,880
You will win the first place today for sure!.
 Sunbaenim, fighting!

253
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,310
  Hello?    

254
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,540
You came to the broadcasting station?

255
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,670
Where are you now?

256
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,570
Where are you?

257
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,030
Where do you think?

258
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,410
It's Choi Chun Hee!

259
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:23,620
Choi Chun Hee!

260
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,910
President, how do you...?

261
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,450
You must be disappointed, Choi Chun Hee got third place today.

262
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,840
Disappointed about what?

263
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,800
If you waited a little bit longer, 
your album could've been released.

264
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,970
Right?

265
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,120
Choi Chun Hee succeeded with her own strength.

266
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,940
I don't want to connect Choi Chun Hee's success with my album.

267
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,910
I will take care of my comeback myself.

268
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,910
Then, I will see you again.

269
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,820
Really.

270
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:39,740
That's right. Seems like you'll rise back up again.

271
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,830
I'm home.

272
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,270
Why did you already come?

273
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,880
Why did you just leave?

274
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,450
Answer the phone.

275
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,100
Answer it.

276
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,560
I understand.

277
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,410
Hello.

278
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,630
Yes. Coach.

279
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,180
Where are you now?

280
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,150
We are all gathering here.

281
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,350
Oh my, it's our Chun Hee.

282
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,460
She ranked third place in Music Tank!

283
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,570
Wow!

284
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,750
Third! Third place!

285
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,750
Today, I will give it free, so drink all you want.

286
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:40,650
- Cheers!
- Cheers! Cheers!

287
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,720
Good!

288
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,180
I will pour our young lady a glass today.

289
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,840
Thank you.

290
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,630
From 3rd place to 1st let's go up!

291
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,430
Let's go. Drink all the way up.

292
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,700
No, stop drinking.

293
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:58,190
Hey, Hyungim is giving it to her, why are you stopping her?

294
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,200
Yes. She's tired so she can't.

295
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,370
This guy is overreacting.

296
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:07,040
Our Choi Chun Hee' managers are Hyungnim and me.
Right, Hyungnim?

297
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,510
You said you guys are not in any relationship. Isn't that right?

298
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,580
That...

299
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,420
It's true that we're not in a relationship.

300
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,820
But, she can't drink.

301
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,140
Wow,  Joon Hyeon looks awesome now.

302
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,440
Drinking Chun Hee's cup.

303
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,830
Then I will drink your cup.
 I will.

304
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,540
I will pour another cup for Coach.

305
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,980
Yes, yes. I ask you to take care 
of Chun Hee, Cheol Man.

306
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,940
Cheol Man (his name)... It's embar---.

307
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:44,820
Then, aren't we a family now?

308
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,720
Then, with that...

309
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,350
Do you want to do a love shot with me?

310
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,520
Yes, I like it.

311
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,300
Wait a moment, wait a  moment.

312
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,520
I , I will will sing, sing.

313
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,100
Right, our Tae Song can sing very well.

314
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,140
Here.
Sing, sing.

315
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,040
Sing.
 Sing.

316
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:12,450
♬ Do I have to leave with one car ticket in my hand? ♬

317
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:17,320
♬ I have to leave according to the schedule ♬

318
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:22,750
♬  You are on the up line, 
and I am on the down line. ♬

319
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,340
Ajusshi, I will dance with you.

320
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,300
Hyungnim!

321
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,070
Thank you.

322
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:34,720
♬ I did love you, but our paths to go were different. ♬

323
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,050
♬ Following the separation timetable, I have to leave. ♬

324

325
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,400
  Choi Chun Hee Concert    

326
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:54,270


327
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,370
Hey, pretty boy.

328
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,610
Why, Gum Stick?

329
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,130
I want to ask you to do something.

330
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,600
What is it?

331
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,900
On my concert stage, can't you perform?

332
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,820
There's the song that you made.

333
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,910
It's okay, right?

334
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,620
That's... a little difficult.

335
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,100
Why?

336
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,680
Isn't "B" supposed to obey "A"'s order, 
no matter what?

337
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,130
Wow you're already rebelling?

338
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,470
No, it's not that.

339
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:30,920
I'll listen to everything else, but let me off on this.

340
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,560
No! You have to go up on my stage.

341
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,480
Ah really.

342
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,870
You have to ask me something I can do for you.

343
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,880
Are you mad?

344
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,860
Ah I don't know.

345
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,540
I don't want to talk to you today.

346
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,190
Hey! Choi Chun Hee!

347
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,820
Choi Chun Hee!

348
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:56,440
You guys are really doing everything, now even a lover's spat. You're annoying me so much!

349
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,020
Why? Is it serious?

350
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,420
On her concert stage,

351
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,360
she wants me to sing.

352
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,950
Ey, well that's good! You can release your new song then.

353
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,530
Are you crazy?

354
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,880
Do you want me to expose our relationship and ruin Choi Chun Hee too?

355
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,940
She just barely made it up there now.

356
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,750
She still hasn't found her father yet either.

357
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,830
I will make a comeback no matter what. 
After I become successful again,

358
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:26,400
there will be a day when I can stand proudly 
on Choi Chun Hee's stage.

359
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:35,320
What I can do for you right now is only this. 
   

360
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,160
I hope it goes well.

361
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,130
  You have written on the forum    

362
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,270
Really!?

363
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,420
Are you crazy?!

364
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,080
What is this?!

365
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,470
What have you done right that you're acting like this?!

366
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,530
Why did you drink a few days ago?

367
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:07,000
You wouldn't drink for no reason 
 with that important event coming up.

368
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Is it because of President Jo Geun Wu?

369
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,530
Is it because of Choi Chun Hee?
 Are you doing that because of it?

370
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,960
After coming into Shine Star when I was fourteen years old,

371
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,690
except for the times when I would eat and sleep,

372
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,920
all day long I would only prepare for the stage.

373
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:31,190
I've never eaten that common ddukbokki with my school friends comfortably.

374
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,340
Still I've never regretted anything.

375
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,000
Because I wanted to go on stage that badly.

376
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,410
But Choi Chun Hee!

377
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,890
That girl!

378
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:45,930
Just because of something like that, do you want to break down here?!

379
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,730
This is nothing!

380
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:53,880
After time goes by, this will go away! I will make it like that!

381
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,310
So come back to your senses!

382
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,710
At these times, you have to come right back to your senses!

383
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,710
Step on her.

384
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,810
If you don't step on her, 
you will get stepped on.

385
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,520
This is that kind of place!

386
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,830
It's been a long time since I have seen you.

387
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,450
You're still beautiful.

388
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,730
Ah, thank you.

389
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,270
And you're the same too.

390
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,830
Truthfully, the reason why I wanted to meet you today is because I have a favor.

391
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,180
What is it?

392
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,480
I heard you're going to try to be elected for the third term.

393
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,850
You would need a successful campaign song.

394
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:44,470
I wanted to introduce a singer from our company.

395
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,900
Choi Chun Hee.

396
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,510
Ah, the young girl who sings trot?

397
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,210
I heard you were looking for me.

398
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,110
Yes.

399
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,910
I have a person I know very well, 
Assemblyman Pyo Sung Jin.

400
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,640
This time, they were searching for a successful campaign song.

401
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,110
I recommended you.

402
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,550
Thank you.

403
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:19,760
I don't know if you know, but the gig for a campaign song is quite large.

404
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,750
So,

405
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,380
Like last time when you were at the broadcasting,

406
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,350
you can't make a mistake.

407
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,210
Understand?

408
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:32,180
Yes, I will keep that in mind.

409
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,320
Thank you.

410
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:56,520
You heard about the campaign song 
for the election, right?

411
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,640
Yes.

412
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,540
Well, for the business, 
I can just talk with your company.

413
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:07,590
I just wanted to see your face.

414
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:10,500
So that is why I asked Director Yang 
if three of us can have dinner together.

415
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,230
Ah, yes.

416
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,130
I listened to your song and it was really good!

417
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:20,320
I'm your fan.

418
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,190
Thank you, Assemblyman.

419
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,400
Excuse me.

420
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,450
Yes, Director Yang.

421
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,370
Why aren't you coming?

422
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:35,310
 What should I do, Assemblyman Pyo? 

423
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:39,330
I wanted to go but something urgent came up.

424
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,850
For today, can't you just eat with Choi Chun Hee

425
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,210
and get together again next time?

426
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:48,620
It's fine. We can always eat any other time.

427
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,570
Yes.

428
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,770
Yes.

429
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,680
Director Yang can't come because something urgent came up. So let's just eat.

430
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:05,210
I'm honored if I can eat dinner with just you.

431
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,190
Is it ok?

432
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,530
Yes.

433
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:17,120
The song chosen from Pyo Sung Jin's office came.

434
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,720
We're going to record with this so get prepared.

435
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,180
Yes. I got it.

436
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,380
I've leaked the news to my friend working 
in the stock market, so

437
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,250
the rumor will soon spread everywhere.

438
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:38,870
A rumor in the stock market isn't always 
about its authenticity.

439
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,540
A scandal with a trot singer Miss "C" 
and Assemblyman Pyo.

440
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,660
You did well, Director Wang.

441
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,200
Hyung, will you listen to this once?

442
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,870
This is a really good song.

443
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,700
I still can't really work with you right now.

444
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,780
You know this field.

445
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,750
I'm sorry.

446
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:18,390
Who is this? Jang Joon Hyeon.

447
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,510
That Choi Chun Hee girl seems to be on a roll these days.

448
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,840
You should have just stayed as her manager.

449
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,040
I think a manager suits you more than a singer.

450
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,700
You want a piece of gum?

451
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,570
You just eat it you bastard.

452
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:39,640
Well she has an amazing sponsor now so she should be on a roll.

453
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:45,420
I heard that Choi Chun Hee and Assemblyman Pyo Sung Jin are in that kind of relationship.

454
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,610
She's on a roll. I'm jealous.

455
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,950
Do you want to die?

456
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,660
How can you say that dirty thing?

457
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,610
Well it's slowly spreading around in the stock market.

458
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,660
I guess only you didn't know, eh?

459
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,780
What?

460
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:06,710
Choi Chun Hee must have a lot of enemies at Shine Star.

461
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,600
What are you taking about?

462
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,220
Where would this rumor have started from?

463
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,610
Didn't it come out from Shine Star?

464
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:16,270
Your company.

465
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,710
You want a piece of gum?

466
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,490
Miss.

467
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,430
Don't fight with the piano.

468
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:53,810
Raise your fingers.

469
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:56,580
Not with too much strength. Smoothly.

470
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:02,910
 What is the- what is the same? 

471
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:09,420
 Joon Hyeon and Chun Hee are the same 

472
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,730
Do it properly, you punk!

473
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,410
Did you lock the door well?

474
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,340
I even blocked it with a plant.

475
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:29,760
It feels nice.

476
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,490
What are you so happy about?

477
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:36,230
Just because. It feels nice because we're together.

478
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,430
I'm getting scared these days.

479
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,080
About what?

480
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:51,080
Just because everything is working out so smoothly.

481
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:56,460
The song is popular, Byeol is growing well.

482
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,400
And even you're next to me.

483
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:06,430
Now if my dad just comes back, everything will be complete.

484
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:14,310
You're doing well now, so don't worry.

485
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,890
And your dad will definitely come back.

486
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:21,190
 Flowers bloom at your name. 

487
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:26,850
 Before I knew it, like my feelings  

488
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:31,390
 I'm growing to resemble you. 

489
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,010
 This must be love. 

490
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,310
Hello. This is the singer, Choi Chun Hee.

491
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:41,700
Yes, your first concert, "Filial Duty Concert" is 
around the corner now.

492
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,550
Why, of all, did you name it "Filial Duty Concert"?

493
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:47,440
The reason why I could officially start as a singer was

494
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,800
because I wanted to find my father.

495
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,670
So you had this reason.

496
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,970
Then is the song you'll be singing for us have to do with your father?

497
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,140
Yes.

498
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,410
Today's song

499
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:05,640
is for not only my dad but for all the parents out there in the world.

500
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,510
Yes. Then we'll listen to it right now.

501
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,440
 

502
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,430
 All the parent's in the world 

503
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:25,440
 all have the same mind 

504
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,380
 For their sons and daughters to succeed 

505
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:35,660
 For them to be happy 

506
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:43,420
 Praying for them with their hearts 

507
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:49,330
 A love without words. 

508
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,680
♬  Don't laugh at me and curse me, saying I'm a miser.  ♬

509
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,050
 My dad is embarrassed by me.
♬ Don't laugh at me and curse me, saying I'm a miser.  ♬

510
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:59,220
 You people get out of my sight. This instant!  
♬  There is still youth in me.  ♬

511
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:07,350
♬  There is still youth in me.  ♬

512
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:13,420
 Wonderful, wonderful. 

513
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:19,380
 The youth of a father 

514
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:25,420
 Bravo, bravo 

515
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:32,020
 A life of a father 

516
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,950
 Wonderful 
Yes?

517
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,950
You were looking for Choi Myeong Sik last time, right?

518
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:37,380
Yes.

519
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:43,460
 The youth of a father. 

520
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:49,190
 Bravo, bravo 
-Excuse me!

521
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,450
Excuse me!

522
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:58,140
Are you Choi Myeong Sik?

523
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,660
Who are you?

524
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:19,000
The reason why Choi Chun Hee became a singer

525
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
is because she wanted to find her father.

526
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:26,620
Don't stay alone like this,

527
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,840
and please go back home.

528
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,440
Chun Hee and Byeol are looking so hard for you.

529
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,480
I don't want to be a burden.

530
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,990
Wanting to help their kids in any way is the mind of a parent.

531
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:46,180
I don't know what's going on but,

532
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:51,990
the important thing right now is for you to stand next to Chun Hee.

533
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:57,110
Don't tell her that you met me.

534
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,910
I beg you.

535
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,430
You,

536
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:10,500
do you like my Chun Hee?

537
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,900
Yes. I like her.

538
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:24,080
In this harsh environment,

539
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,040
protect Chun Hee so she can sing.

540
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,850
You can do that right?

541
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:43,740


542
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:50,650
Choi Byeol!

543
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,550
Ahjussi!

544
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,720
What's that?

545
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,140
The prize we got for first place in the cooking competition!

546
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,640
- It's really cool, isn't it? 
- First place? In the end we got first place?

547
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,330
How come whatever I do, I get first place!

548
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:08,350
A while ago, didn't I get first place for twelve consecutive weeks on Music Tank?

549
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:11,350
Never mind that. But this sounds weird.

550
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,400
How can you cut off an adult when they're talking?!

551
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:24,220
Byeol is my sunshine, my only sunshine.

552
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:31,280
You make me happy ...

553
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,950
Wow! It can actually make sounds!

554
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:36,100
Not sound, music.   Music  

555
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:48,470
Shining beautifully.

556
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,940
- I know this song.
- You know this song?

557
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,340
Shall we sing it? Start.

558
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:59,450
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,

559
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:05,310
Shining beautifully.

560
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,050
Why are you drinking beer by yourself?

561
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,880
Let's drink together.

562
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,410
About Chun Hee...

563
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,110
On a rumor pamphlet (of the stock market), 
a scandal came up.

564
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:22,710
Really? Someone knows about you and Chun Hee?

565
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,920
Not me,

566
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,840
the assemblyman for whom Chun Hee sang the campaign song.

567
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,290
I think someone in Shine Star planned this.

568
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:34,600
That's bad news. 
A scandal about dating someone is one thing,

569
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:39,100
but if it's a "sponsorship" scandal with a politician, 
her image will have a heavy blow...

570
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,610
In these times, it would be good 
if she has an official boyfriend.

571
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,010
What are you going to do?

572
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:48,490
You can't just say that you're Choi Chun Hee's boyfriend.

573
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,580
You can make it like this right?

574
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,580
The initial is JH and MJ, yes?

575
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,640
Yes.

576
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,780
- You even designed this yourself.
- It must be a present for your girlfriend.

577
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,780
With this, I'm going to propose on stage.

578
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:20,270
Really? That would be wonderful!

579
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,470
Please take extra care of it.

580
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,730
Yes.

581
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:31,980
To go back to you again...

582
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,070
Well done.

583
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:51,090
From now on, drink warm bellflower tea instead of cold water.

584
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:52,310
What brought you here?

585
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,460
I came because I missed you.

586
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:01,300
You asked me to be a special guest on your concert.

587
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,480
You said you didn't want to.

588
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,520
I'll do it.

589
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,660
Really?

590
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:15,450
- Choi Chun Hee
- Yes?

591
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:17,610
I have something to say to you at the concert.

592
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,680
What?

593
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,370
Aigoo, have some patience.

594
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:27,060
Aigoo, ok then I'll wait.

595
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,660
Hello.

596
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,380
Oh, Yoo Mi!

597
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,820
Really? Your dad approved?

598
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:53,910
 Choi Chun Hee  likes someone else, 

599
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:57,390
 but you're still going to wait? 

600
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:00,190
 It doesn't matter whom Choi Chun Hee likes. 

601
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,310
 As long as I like her, 

602
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:06,120
 that's enough. 

603
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12,870
 Last time, thanks to the pictures you showed me, Jang Joon Hyeon and I resolved the problem. 

604
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:15,150
 Thank you! 

605
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:19,020
 Step on them! 

606
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,580
 If you don't step on them, you're going to get stepped on!
 This is that kind of place! 

607
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:25,680
 You've gotten prettier! 

608
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,130
 Before, you said you had never dated anyone. 

609
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:32,060
 Did something good happen? 

610
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,590
 I don't know... 

611
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:37,150
 I think it means Choi Chun Hee's got a nice man. 

612
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,820
 Ah no, it's not that. 

613
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,910
 I'm curious who currently makes Choi Chun Hee happy. 

614
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:47,760
 Anyway, good luck on your first concert, 

615
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,710
 and that's it for today. 

616
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:52,690
 Bye! 

617
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:01,770
Yes?

618
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,280
Hello, President.

619
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,980
Ah, yes, Choi Chun Hee.

620
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,140
I have sometihng to tell you.

621
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:15,850
Yoo Mi's father is allowing her to sing.

622
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:19,280
And since it's almost the break, she can get training.

623
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,860
Really? That's good.

624
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,750
I have something to tell you, too.

625
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,530
Come in for a moment.

626
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:28,960
Yes.

627
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,840
Here you go.

628
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,900
What's this?

629
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,850
Thank to you, we earned a lot of money.

630
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:39,470
Shall we call it, an incentive bonus?

631
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:48,090
This much won?

632
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:50,270
Since you earned a lot.

633
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:58,810
l'll just accept half.

634
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:00,210
Why?

635
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:05,690
For the other half, can I have that guitar?

636
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:12,140
Didn't you say you needed money urgently?

637
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,300
Well, if that's what you want.

638
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:24,340
Thank you, President.

639
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:33,480
Thank you. Bye...

640
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,630
Ouch! She hit a bull's eye!

641
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,660
Wait!

642
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:20,730
You need a partner for badminton.

643
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:22,910
Why are you alone?

644
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:26,810
Me, me? I'm a grandpa who lives next door.

645
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:29,730
Ah, Hawaii Grandpa.

646
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:32,980
- Hello.
- Yes, aloha!

647
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,800
Your sister's not home?

648
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:40,750
Yeah, I guess she's pretty busy 
as she's a popular singer now.

649
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,890
Then, you want to play badminton with me?

650
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:47,650
Really? Grandpa, you know how to play badminton?

651
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:49,830
This rascal, looks down on me.

652
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:51,680
Watch and see.

653
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,180
It was like a bullet.

654
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:08,220
Nice shot!

655
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,390
Ah! That's cold!

656
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:15,590
Hey after playing, it's even colder!

657
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,730
This time I went easy on you!

658
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:20,370
It's that you're bad at it.

659
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:23,820
Next time, we're going to play again.

660
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,660
What does your sister's boyfriend do?

661
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,750
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

662
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,190
You know last time,

663
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:42,320
some tall and handsome guy came and ate dinner, isn't he her boyfriend?

664
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,760
No, for now he's just a president.

665
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,980
Really?

666
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,930
But,

667
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:53,770
I think Unni has someone else she likes.

668
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:55,770
Hmm? What?

669
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:02,610
What does your sister like about him?

670
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:05,450
I don't know yet.

671
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:10,030
Honestly I haven't decided either.

672
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:14,710
I thought that the President was awesome, when he took her to the hospital,

673
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:19,370
but considering coolness, I think Ahjussi is good.

674
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:22,660
Between (facing up) the reality and keeping loyalty,

675
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:25,320
I'm thinking...

676
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,100
What does Geun Wu lack that

677
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,020
he can't even grab a woman's heart?

678
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,880
That pathetic fool.

679
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:42,650
What?  Oh, okay.  I'll talk to him.

680
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,130
Tae Song.

681
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:46,590
Yes?

682
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:50,820
Just for today, would you mind being the chorus 
for our Chun Hee?

683
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:54,100
Everyone in Chun Hee's team has a stomach ache
possibly from having eaten something bad.

684
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:57,430
It's not like we can get someone in short notice...
I beg you, huh?

685
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,990
Of course, since it's your request.

686
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:02,360
If it were you asking, wouldn't I be able to cross the Pacific Ocean?

687
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:07,640
Then never mind the work here and head over.
You know where Chun Hee's performing?

688
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,020
Hello, Unni.

689
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:14,820
Oh, it's you Pil Nyeo.

690
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,030
Tae Song, you're here too.

691
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:21,200
That's right.  Pil Nyeo can help out too.
Didn't you say you were a trainee at the Shine Star?
- What?

692
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,000
- Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go quickly!
 - Where?

693
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,440
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

694
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,300
I wasn't going to keep singing backup.

695
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,290
I'm doing this especially because you asked.

696
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:34,660
I really thank you.  It was a request by a special person
for me as well.

697
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:38,560
Choi Chun Hee?

698
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,370
Are you saying this backup is for Choi Chun Hee?

699
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:43,690
What are you doing there?  I said it's urgent!

700
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:46,270
Let's go.

701
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,710
Ah... Well it feels nice... if you hold my wrist like that, but...

702
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:54,920
Tae Song, the situation is a bit... You know... For me to
sing backup for Choi Chun Hee.

703
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:57,150
Let's go.

704
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:11,670
How much is this?

705
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:15,260
Hello, give a gift of a stuffed animal.

706
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:19,650
♫ Even when a stranger sees me. ♫

707
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:25,370
♫ I like you that look the way you want. ♫

708
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:31,590
♫ When I'm held by you, all my troublesome things ♫

709
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:35,860
♫ are all erased.  Like a true lie. ♫
Soo In!

710
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,750
What brings her here?

711
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:44,260
♫ That warm and cozy body temperature of yours. ♫

712
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:48,520
♫ I so missed it. ♫

713
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:54,370
♫ I think of you all throughout the day, all night. ♫

714
00:52:54,370 --> 00:53:02,320
♫ I think of you all throughout the day, all night. ♫
I Love You!

715
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,460
 I'm just trying to make you laugh today! 

716
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:07,840
 Break a leg, Choi Chun Hee!  Fighting! 

717
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:13,860
♫ So that I can be near you. ♫

718
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:20,250
Isn't that the performance costume?

719
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,770
Where are you now?

720
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,790
Where else would it be, but on stage?

721
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:31,980
On stage?  Why are you there already?

722
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,390
You said to come here.

723
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:34,390
Who said?

724
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:37,950
You sent me a text earlier to meet you on stage.

725
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,320
What?

726
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,840
 I guess she has a lot of enemies at Shine Star, Ms. Choi Chun Hee. 

727
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,160
 Choi Chun Hee, Choi Chun Hee, Choi Chun Hee! 

728
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,980
 Why is everyone fawning over Choi Chun Hee alone? 

729
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,510
 Hello?  Hello? 

730
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:59,480
Don't move an inch and stay!  I'll be right there.

731
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,080
What?

732
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:15,390
Dad,

733
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:20,730
this is my first concert ever in my life, so

734
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,200
you'll come to see it for sure, right?

735
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:29,190
I'll really sing my hardest.

736
00:54:54,550 --> 00:55:00,950
♫This must be love~ ♫

737
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,750
Jang Joon Hyeon!

738
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:20,270


739
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,630
What is it?

740
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:51,390
Jang Joon Hyeon, are you okay?

741
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:54,970
Hey!  Hey, Jang Joon Hyeon!

742
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:05,120
Jang Joon Hyeon!  Wake up, huh?

743
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:13,610
Jang Joon Hyeon.

744
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:17,320
Jang Joon Hyeon.

745
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,180
Jang Joon Hyeon.  Oh my god, what do I do?!

746
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:26,460
Jang Joon Hyeon.  Please wake up, huh?

747
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,440
Oh, what do I...

748
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,440
Is anyone out there?

749
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,180
A person is hurt!

750
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:38,990
Oh, Jang Joon Hyeon.  Wake up, please.

751
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:42,800
Someone!  Isn't there anyone there?

752
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:49,100
119.

753
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:53,350
119, my cell phone.

754
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:06,020
Jang Joon Hyeon.

755
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:12,670
Wait a little.  You bled quite a lot.

756
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:20,550
Jang Joon Hyeon, I will go and call 119 for you,
so you have to wait a little for me, okay?

757
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:22,870
You have to hang in there, okay?

758
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,060
I will be... be right back.

759
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:29,080
Oh...

760
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,740
Oh,  Oppa Joon Hyeon!

761
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,200
Is anyone out there?!

762
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:11,370
Ajumma, please lend me your cell phone.

763
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:13,580
My gosh, look at all that blood!

764
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:17,020
Oh, thank...

765
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:20,280
Hello?  It's 119, right?

766
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,580
Would you please come here quickly?

767
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:25,540
A person got hurt.

768
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,340
Please I beg you.

769
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,630
Oppa, wake up.  Oppa, don't be like this.

770
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:31,540
Oppa, wake up, please.

771
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:34,820
Oppa, open your eyes.  Oppa, don't be like this.  
Why are you doing this?

772
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,720
Oppa!  Please, Oppa!

773
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,640
What's going on?

774
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,720
Oh, wait a minute.  You can't go in.

775
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,110
I have to go in.

776
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:51,070
There was an accident, so there's no entry except for the involved.

777
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,970
I said I have to go in there!

778
00:58:56,850 --> 00:58:59,970
Oppa, wake up.  Oppa!

779
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:04,040
Oppa, please wake up.  Oppa!

780
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,220
Oppa!

781
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:10,420
Oppa!  Wake up, please!

782
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,570
You were the one who assisted at the scene, correct?

783
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:17,010
- Yes.
- Then get in, please!

784
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:24,600

Excuse me!  Can't I go with you?
