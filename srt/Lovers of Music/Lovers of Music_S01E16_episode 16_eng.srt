1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,760
Oppa, think of my Joon Hyeon and just please...

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,050
He's a singer. If his mom goes to the police station,

3
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,860
it'll be the end for him.

4
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:27,940
Oppa, please. Please! Please!

5
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,220
Please!

6
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,790
Why isn't she coming back?

7
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,600
  Pretty guy 

8
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:09,090
  Vegetables are here! Fresh and taste good!    

9
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,520
When did this come in?

10
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,950
Looks like this woman can't talk.

11
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,580
What is this?

12
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,040
  That night... 

13
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,320
  Pretty guy. 

14
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,860
Hello?

15
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,050
  Where did you you go all of a sudden? 

16
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,050
  And why haven't you been answering any of my calls? 

17
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,230
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,610
My dad was sick all of a sudden so I came home.

19
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,480
  Really? 

20
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,200
  Is he really sick? 

21
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,460
He's okay now.

22
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,260
I'll call you back later.

23
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,450
Mom!

24
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,150
How come you didn't even tell me you're leaving?

25
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,410
Joon Hyeon, no matter how I think about it,

26
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,740
this marriage can't ever happen.

27
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,490
What?

28
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:08,990
I checked upon her and found that she's a child breadwinner.

29
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:14,340
Do you want to live your whole life 
serving her family?

30
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,420
It can never happen.

31
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,980
Never.

32
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,580
Mom.

33
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,390
Even if Mom keeps objecting, I'll take care of it.

34
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,300
So don't worry about it, okay?

35
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,210
Is your dad doing really badly?

36
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,810
Your expression's been like that since earlier.

37
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,520
Jang Joon Hyeon.

38
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,560
Should we go have fun somewhere?

39
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,880
Okay.

40
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,660
Wow! So lucky! You and Chun Hee alone are going on a vacation?

41
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,680
Oh, I'm jealous.

42
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,290
Hey, Jang Joon Hyeon, come here for a minute.

43
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,690
Why?

44
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,370
Hyung will give you my know-how.

45
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,220
Know-how?

46
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,760
In the summer, and a guy and a girl are going on a vacation alone.

47
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,530
Then what would they do?

48
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,590
What do they do?

49
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,960
This won't do.

50
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,400
In the starry night sky, you start off with beer.

51
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,040
As you guys keep exchanging the glasses of beer...

52
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,780
As you do that?

53
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,830
Then she will have bleary eyes, right?

54
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,220
Then she'll become kind of drunk.

55
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,070
She'll look at you with eyes that want something from you.

56
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,830
But you just need to do this once.

57
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:02,030
Right! Then the girl will be like, "Ah! I can't bear it! Joon Hyeon!"

58
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,530
Then it becomes like this. Ok?

59
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,110
-The woman does? 
 -Yeah.

60
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,840
The woman pounced! Ah...

61
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,720
Who did that (to you)?

62
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,960
It's so good!

63
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,410
Jang Joon Hyeon, this is all done right?

64
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,720
It's not done yet.

65
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,420
It's all cooked!

66
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,440
Hey, this is pork, not beef!

67
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,800
-You have to completely cook it! 
 -It tastes good.

68
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,740
If you go to a company dinner and eat like a pi...

69
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,860
If you eat this way, you'll have no friends.

70
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,520
Did you just say that I eat like a pig?

71
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,590
I mean eat like this... This one is cooked.

72
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,350
- Hot. 
 - It's good, right?

73
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:06,940
♬   I'm afraid to be alone tonight. ♬ 

74
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:14,680
♬  Stroke my hair until I fall asleep.

75
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,470
♬ If you think I'm thinking something bad

76
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,500
♬ to have you tonight

77
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:27,400
♬ If you doubt me you can tie me to the tent

78
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,270
♬  Look at the time, it's late.

79
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,480
♬ It's wrong to go home now. ♬

80
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,830
♬ The buses have stopped and taxi's don't come here.

81
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:45,230
♬ Please believe me, I'm usually not this type of person.

82
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:51,290
♬ Just tonight be in my arms.

83
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:57,370
♬ Won't you listen to the lullaby I sing for you?

84
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:03,260
♬  Please just don't go tonight.

85
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,180
Jang Joon Hyeon.

86
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:19,570
I honestly asked to go on vacation because I have something to discuss with you.

87
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,950
Something to discuss?

88
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,560
What is it?

89
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,710
Sit.

90
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,610
Hand.

91
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:46,130
Everything I say from now on, don't think about anything else and just listen.

92
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,790
What is it that you're so serious about?

93
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,650
Is it something serious?

94
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,510
Yes.

95
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,090
It's kind of very serious.

96
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,800
Say it.

97
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:11,590
You know I left first on the day of our family meeting.

98
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,830
At that time, I coincidentally saw my dad and your mom

99
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,730
having a loud argument.

100
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,350
My mom and your dad?

101
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:37,110
Those two knew each other from before?

102
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,990
Yes.

103
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,420
It seemed that they knew each other, from a very long time ago.

104
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,320
What were they arguing  about?

105
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,690
That I don't really know,

106
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,690
what kind of a story they had in the past.

107
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,720
But I thought that you had to know, too.

108
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,020
Choi Chun Hee.

109
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,770
What?

110
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,780
Is it hard to say?

111
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,940
A little.

112
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,730
I've got it.

113
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll try to find out about it too.

114
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,940
I watched your press conference well.

115
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,760
Even though your memory came back, you were deceiving us.

116
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,450
Then how long did you think I would be deceived by you?

117
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,240
And you should rephrase your words.

118
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,600
The first one to deceive wasn't me,

119
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,900
but Directer Yang and Soo In.

120
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,060
Who's the one who made our Soo In become like this?

121
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,870
Stop blaming other people.

122
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,790
That Soo In turned out like that

123
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,730
is your fault.

124
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,530
- Being hard on her because she has to be first place, first place...

125
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,210
Stop it! How dare you! I'm her mother.

126
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,850
I lived my whole life only looking at her.

127
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,600
What do you know to babble like this?

128
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,720
Just to protect such a girl like Choi Chun Hee,

129
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,150
you brought our Soo In to this point?

130
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,610
Choi Chun Hee is the woman that I'm going to marry.

131
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,050
Don't talk carelessly about her.

132
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,870
What?

133
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,850
Marry?

134
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,420
You

135
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,380
will not ever be able to marry Choi Chun Hee!

136
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,260
It seems you're mistaken about something.

137
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,490
The issue of our marriage

138
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,420
is not something that concerns you.

139
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,090
You must have heard that Choi Chun Hee's mom was in an accident?

140
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,280
That hit-and-run culprit was your mom.

141
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,950
What?

142
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,720
Don't talk too freely.

143
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,250
There's a limit to my patience.

144
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,030
It's not talking freely,

145
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,200
go and ask your mother directly.

146
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,050
Mom...

147
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,650
do you know Chun Hee's parents?

148
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,180
No.

149
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,840
Ah... no... I don't.

150
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,260
Look straight into my eyes and tell me.

151
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,520
Mom,

152
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,840
did you do something wrong towards Choi Chun Hee's mother?

153
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,730
Mom,

154
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,190
Choi Chun Hee's mom...

155
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,530
Did you do a hit-and-run?

156
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,630
Joo... Joon Hyeon....

157
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,380
That, it's not like that. That....no,

158
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,330
I wanted to take her to the hospital...

159
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,520
Really, Joon Hyeon, it's true!

160
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,540
Mom.

161
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,240
Joon Hyeon, please believe me.

162
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,620
That is not true.

163
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,380
Joon Hyeon! Joon Hyeon!

164
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:22,090


165
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:33,370
♬  You’re half my size,  ♬

166
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:40,060
 Sleeping? 
♬  The one who is hard to find  ♬

167
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:46,160
♬  Old-fashioned and stubborn.  ♬

168
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,980
  Should we meet tomorrow?  
♬  Every day I think of you only.  ♬

169
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:01,920
♬  With a half squeezed tube of toothpaste,  ♬

170
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,330
♬  and atop of messy blankets.  ♬

171
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,960
Shall we  ... take some time to think? 
 ♬  While seeing your smiling face, ♬

172
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,680
I heard everything from Mom.

173
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:21,280
♬  My heart always returns and is filled.  ♬

174
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,760
- In this situation the both of us, 
♬  Please remember me.  ♬

175
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,910
- I don't think we'll be happy even if we're together.
♬  For you, I’ll always be behind you.  ♬

176
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,720
♬  Please Remember me  ♬

177
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,640
♬  Like a fool,  ♬

178
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,790
-These words, 
♬  who doesn't know how to give up.  ♬

179
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,000
♬  Even though that's you.  ♬

180
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,000
- are really difficult to say. 
♬  Even though that's you. ♬

181
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,400
♬  I  love the you   ♬

182
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:50,150
It must have been difficult for you.
♬  whom I can look at like this.  ♬

183
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,370
Don't let it bother you.

184
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,760
I'll do the difficult part.

185
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,680
Leave it to me.

186
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,080
♬  Please remember me  ♬

187
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,910
♬  I'm always behind you  ♬

188
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,290
I'll leave first. 
♬  Please remember me  ♬

189
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,830
- Take your time.
 ♬  Like a fool,  ♬

190
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,800
♬  who doesn't know how to give up. Even though that's you.  ♬

191

00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:25,350
♬  I love the you whom I can look at like this.  ♬

193
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,840
I'd like to order.

194
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,080
Yes, I'm coming.

195
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:41,830
Ah, why did Tae Song leave his phone here?

196
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,890
I'll take care of it.

197
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,910
This goddess is such an old nickname, and he's still calling me goddess?

198
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,090
 Oh my goddess   

199
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,520
Hello?

200
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
Hel-

201
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,360
Hey, what? Why are you calling when you're standing beside me?

202
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,910
Is it about a secret?

203
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,760
No, I accidentally dialed the wrong number.

204
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,810
Ah, you're so dull.

205
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,100
It's really not about a secret?

206
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,900
No, no... there's none.

207
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,820
- Would be nice if there was one.
- No.

208
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,940
What is this?
 Seol Tae Song   

209
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,370
 Silly Nag 

210
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,890
Tae Song!

211
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,960
That's not it, yesterday...

212
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,550
Why am I the "silly nag"?

213
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,730
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Why is Unni the goddess and I am the silly nag?

214
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,540
Huh?!

215
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,620
-Ah, that, I didn't do that. 
 -You did that.

216
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,610
-I didn't do that 
 -I saw it on your phone!

217
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,980
-You wait there 
 -I'm sorry!

218
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,230
-Be quiet! 
 -I'm sorry.

219
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,390
Hello?!

220
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,030
Yes, yes it is possible. We can certainly do that.

221
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,810
-Ah, thank you! 
 -She's like a mentally ill person, so scary.

222
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,150
-Tae Song. 
 -Why?

223
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,660
- They want to sign a contract.
- What contract?

224
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,450
The video we uploaded last time, they love it so much!

225
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,670
-Really? 
 -Yeah!

226
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,770
After meeting you everything has been going so well for me!

227
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,020
-Me too!! 
 -I'm so happy! I like you so much!

228
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,670
So why am the the silly nag when you like me?

229
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,180
-Let go, you psycho!
--Why? why? I'm not a psycho.

230
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,650
Let go.

231
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,280
I met Assemblyman Pyo lately.

232
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,470
Now Director Yang should be ready.

233
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,970
I heard Choi Chun Hee made to the final round for "Voice of Trot", is that right?

234
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,640
Yes. That program's final concert,

235
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,310
Shine Star is going to support it.

236
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,120
Why?

237
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,570
So you can give another shot 
 to hit on Choi Chun Hee with that excuse?

238
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,800
Do you think it's going to work on her?

239
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,110
-I'm just doing it since it'll be a profit for the company. 
 -Huh?

240
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,920
Profit?

241
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,990
Are you that happy?

242
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,780
The problem nowadays is,

243
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,880
Jang Joon Hyeon..

244
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,150
Yes, PD Jang, I'm really sorry.

245
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,050
-He's very sick right now, but this'll never happen again, yes. 
   ♬ I'll die for you, everyday ♬ 

246
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:30,600
Okay, bye.
  ♬ I'll die for you, everyday

247
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,820
-Hey Jang Joon Hyeon, what are you doing? Come back to your senses! 
   ♬ I will, all day long ♬ 

248
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,060
♬ I will, all day long

249
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:44,300
♬  I must be crazy.  I must be crazy.

250
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,280
Dad.

251
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,260
Tomorrow's the final stage.

252
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,120
I feel nervous again like a country bumpkin.

253
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,890
Honestly,

254
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,150
At these times, Jang Joon Hyeon was always next to me.

255
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,480
Tomorrow,

256
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,950
you can give me encouragements, right Dad?

257
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,280
But, Dad

258
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,450
What do I do?

259
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,230
I really miss Jang Joon Hyeon.

260
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,720
The final round of, "Voice of Trot," the last stage.

261
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,970
The fifth competitor, hello MJ.

262
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,170
Hello.

263
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,720
Yes, what kind of song are you singing today?

264
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,480
Yes I prepared a song called, "Life."

265
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,700
Is there a special reason you chose this song?

266
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,580
Yes. As I started trot,

267
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,400
it was exciting, sad,

268
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,330
hard,

269
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,010
and I felt happy.

270
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,650
But in this song, it contained everything.

271
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,330
That's why I prepared this song.

272
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:23,060
Yes. Now we'll listen to, "Life."

273
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:33,580
♬   Did life carry me and live?   ♬

274
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:40,470
♬  Did I carry life and live?   ♬

275
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:47,620
♬   Turning and turning through the fog I've lived through   ♬

276
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:54,660
♬   My life that's been through thorny roads  ♬

277
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:01,680
♬   If you tell me to go again, I can't go   ♬

278
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,000
♬ In short, because I'm sad I can't go ♬

279
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,690
Wow, it's a killer. 
She sounds exactly like Chun Hee.

280
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,250
♬   My love that's been rushed to the setting sun   ♬

281
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:15,740
It's right that I was eliminated. 
♬   My love that's been rushed to the setting sun   ♬

282
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,180
♬   My life that has disappeared like the wind  ♬

283
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:23,260
♬  My life   ♬ 
 Choi Chun Hee...

284
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,850
Yes, the final results have just arrived.

285
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:38,570
Voice of Trot's final round's final winner is...

286
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,890
MJ. Congratulations.

287
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,390
Please come out to the front.

288
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,800
Yes, I think there were many people that were curious who Miss MJ was.

289
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,840
The final winner MJ is the

290
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,630
Trot singer Choi Chun Hee.

291
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,490
Congratulations. How do you feel right now?

292
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,360
Thank you.

293
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,600
Singer Choi Chun Hee

294
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,810
will work hard to become a better singer in the future.

295
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,060
Thank you.

296
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,080
Thank you.Thank you. Thank you.

297
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,540
  While the encore was going out, many stories have been posted.  

298
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,560
  From 2998, come and sing at the marketplace again.  

299
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,100
  From 1685, the black goats also  

300
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,230
  fall for your songs. We're always cheering you on.  

301
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:54,020
  From 8301, my husband says he has completely fallen into your songs too.  

302
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,810
 There are such encouraging messages like those.  

303
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,630
Congratulations, Gum.

304
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,230
Oh my, Teacher Go Eun Tae. Hello!

305
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,590
How have you been doing? How come you're here?

306
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:21,280
I came out because I had work to do here but then I heard the radio and came here.

307
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,180
You heard?

308
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,430
As expected, President Jo still has

309
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,970
the sharp eye for people.

310
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,870
It was an amazing song.

311
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,040
Thank you.

312
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,550
But, how is Madame doing?

313
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,180
After you visited, she's been doing a lot better.

314
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,260
After listening to this song today, I'm anticipating

315
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,090
what kind of response she'll show.

316
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,270
I'm thankful so I prepared a present for you.

317
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:52,200
Aiyoo, why did you prepare something like this?

318
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,600
Oh, take it.

319
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,610
If you're going to give it to me, then I'll take it gratefully.

320
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,200
Thank you.

321
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,190
Thank you.

322
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,330
  This is 1 minute news. Just a moment ago on Voice of Trot,  

323
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:10,490
  Trot singer Choi Chun Hee was the final winner.  

324
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:15,260
  Choi Chun Hee's winning song 'Life' filled with sincerity and her skills  

325
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,550
  is rising in the current radio replay count and click view on the homepage.  

326
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,490
 Warm stories of the listeners keep coming in. 

327
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:27,900
 It started with a simple touching story and it's resonating with many people. 

328
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,210
- Try some of this too. 
 - Aigoo, thank you.

329
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,990
Thank you for cheering for us like this. Thank you!

330
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,440
Thank you.

331
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,180
It's Chun Hee!

332
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,650
Aigoo, Chun Hee is here.

333
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,460
I knew that you would get 1st place.

334
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,290
You already knew?

335
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,180
You did well, Chun Hee.

336
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,980
Congratulations!

337
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,820
Sing the song that you sang at the marketplace a while back.

338
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,410
You're the father that put in the last ball for me, right?

339
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,440
Hello.

340
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,160
After listening to your song at the homeless shelter, 
I gathered up courage and went home.

341
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,310
I also went home too!

342
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,740
Aiyoo, you did well. Your faces have just gotten brighter.

343
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,520
I was upset that so many bad things happened to you 
but after hearing that a good thing happened

344
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,290
I wanted to congratulate you so I came first.

345
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,530
Thank you.

346
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:21,250
Now, now. Let's listen to Choi Chun Hee's song.

347
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,430
Now, should I sing one song?

348
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,950
Now!

349
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:46,340
♬ Can anyone love? Who said it was easy?

350
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:53,780
♬ Can anyone love?

351
00:25:53,780 --> 00:26:00,140
♬ You should at least meet eyes

352
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:07,460
♬  Happiness from meeting and sadness from departing

353
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:15,530


354
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,130
  Trot Goddess Chun Hee, I love you!  

355
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:26,350
Choi Chun Hee! Choi Chun Hee! Choi Chun Hee! Choi Chun Hee!

356
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:32,220
Choi Chun Hee! Choi Chun Hee! Choi Chun Hee!

357
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,070
- Thank you.
- Choi Chun Hee! Choi Chun Hee!

358
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,020
  Choi Chun Hee, that's like you.  

359
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:55,750
  Now I will find the way for me to live like I should.  

360
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,760
Mom,

361
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,990
Should we go to U.S together?

362
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,470
After I finish up things in Korea.

363
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:29,640
- What? 
 - I got a call from Major from before to work together.

364
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,580
Aigoo, long time no see.

365
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,570
President!

366
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,190
Not a long ago I met Hwa Soon.

367
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,080
I had been looking for her for a long time...

368
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,660
but after actually meeting her,

369
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,490
my mind hasn't been at ease.

370
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,880
Because I had no knowledge at that time I didn't know,

371
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,510
but at that time there should have been a proper investigation.

372
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,920
As for me

373
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,450
I have regretted a lot all the time.

374
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,470
Now I even think that...

375
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,600
the truth that we know about

376
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,490
may not be all of it.

377
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,740
The person who started the Chun Hee and Assemblyman's scandal

378
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,410
is Yang Ju Hee.

379
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,360
Yang Ju Hee?

380
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,440
And also...

381
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,270
Director Yang.

382
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:15,250
Executing Director Wang, what type of things do you do? You can't even find Soo In!

383
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,500
I need to find her before the police do.

384
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:22,210
Is there anyone that we could call among Soo In's friends?

385
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,500
Who was Soo In close to normally?

386
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,880
Soo In's friends?

387
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,700
- I don't know. 
 - Excuse me?

388
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,250
There's no friend that you know about?

389
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,260
It's better to report her as a missing person to the police.

390
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,890
Are you crazy?

391
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,630
Are you saying we should publicize Soo In's incident?

392
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,600
In my opinion, we shouldn't be hiding this because of the fear from that.

393
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,620
If something really bad happens...

394
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,950
Well, have you checked about the details 
of the use of Soo In's credit card?

395
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:22,210


396
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,540
 President, do you have time tomorrow morning? 

397
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:12,730
Oh, Park Soo In. Your face looks better.

398
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:17,350
I'm hungry. Let's eat brunch together. Buy me something delicious.

399
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:20,550
How did you know that I'm free this morning?

400
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:24,370
Okay, I didn't want to eat alone anyway. That's great.

401
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,740
Let's go. Where should we go?

402
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,540
Park Soo In, you eat spicy rice cake really well.

403
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,930
When I was in school, I really wanted to eat it, but I couldn't.

404
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,860
It's really good.

405
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:46,060
Truthfully, for me too, it's the first time eating such a delicious fish cake.

406
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,640
The way you two look, you guys are lovers.

407
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,280
Do we look good together?

408
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:54,530
We're not lovers. He's the president.

409
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:59,150
- President? Then you should buy more!
- Yes.

410
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:03,380
Give me some eggs and tempura...and one serving of blood sausage.

411
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,160
Give us the lung too.

412
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,190
Alright.

413
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,040
You have to pay in cash.

414
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,250
Cash...

415
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,900
You wanted to eat this.

416
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,810
- Huh?
- The person who suggested to eat is supposed to pay.

417
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,250
Please hurry with the blood sausage.

418
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,640
What did you do away from Seoul?

419
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,890
I tried everything I wanted to do. Things I couldn't normally do.

420
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,050
I slept a lot.

421
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,720
I ate things I wanted to eat, and read a lot of comic books.

422
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,290
Wow, I'm envious.

423
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,090
I was a bit surprised.

424
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:49,490
It only took two days to try all this.

425
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,020
It only takes two days. Without being able to do these things,

426
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,740
I wonder what I lived for.

427
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,980
It's always like that.

428
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,660
Everyone lives like that.

429
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:08,120
From now on, I'll go alone.

430
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,690
It's okay, we can go together.

431
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,430
I'm really free today.

432
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,430
When you come back, let's go eat spicy rice cake again.

433
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,490
I'll buy then.

434
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,620
Go and come back.

435
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,110
 I checked the credit card spending, 

436
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,590
 and it's been confirmed that she's 
at a guest house in Gangwon Province. 

437
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,480
Really? Send me the address right away.

438
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:02,260
 Mom, I'm on my way to turn myself in. 

439
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:08,780
No. No! Soon In.

440
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,700
Yang Ju Hee.

441
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:15,740
Oppa Myeong Sik. What brings you here?

442
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,090
I have something to confirm with you.

443
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:24,980
I'm sorry, but I have an urgent matter to attend to. We'll talk later.

444
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:29,020
Back then, Seong Ju...when there was the accident,

445
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,280
you were also riding in that car, right?

446
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,430
- Did Hwa Soon say that?
- You said you couldn't even reach her.

447
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:43,080
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit busy. Let's talk later.

448
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,990
Yang Ju Hee.

449
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,030
Was it you that abandoned Seong Ju on the cold floor and left?

450
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:50,390
- I said I'm busy.
- Yang Ju Hee!

451
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,090
It's you!

452
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,330
Yeah! I did it.

453
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:58,930
I didn't take Seong Ju to the hospital, and I abandoned her on the cold floor.

454
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,990
What? Why did you do that? WHY?

455
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:05,770
What did Seong Ju ever do to you?

456
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,440
- If you didn't do that, Seong Ju wouldn't have lost her life.
- Back then, momentarily...

457
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,250
I wished that Seong Ju would disappear.

458
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,350
I sing as well as Seong Ju.

459
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,290
But I always had to be her bridesmaid.

460
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:20,020
I was sick and tired of it. That's why I did it!

461
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,110
Twenty years have already passed since.

462
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:25,290
That's why I did it! It's not like she died!

463
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,860
I don't think I need to hear these things from you.

464
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,630
Hey! You think it's only murder if you kill?

465
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,450
If you take the voice away from a singer, 
then that's murder!

466
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:37,480
Let go. I said let go!

467
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,100
Soo In!

468
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,250
Mom.

469
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:01,090
She doesn't know anything. I did it all.

470
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,390
So take me. Okay?

471
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,810
Soo In, you stay still. I was the one who did it.

472
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:09,900
Hurry up and tell them the truth!

473
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,200
It's all over now, Mom.

474
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,810
What?

475
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,730
Let's go.

476
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,380
- How do I do this?
- Hey, PD!

477
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,990
- Ah, yes.
- Are you done preparing for today?

478
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,140
- Yes, it's done.
- What about the mic?

479
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,420
Yes, I have them. It's all ready.

480
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,080
Your boyfriend is here.

481
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:49,500
They must have purposely given you the same waiting room because you're dating.

482
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,210
I'm here as the guest for the concert.

483
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,390
That's good.

484
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,630
I'll see you later on stage.

485
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,060
Okay.

486
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,450
Ms. Choi Chun Hee, Mr. Jang Joon Hyeon...please pose.

487
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,760
I ask you this favor.

488
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:25,400
Please make a friendlier pose. You two are officially a couple, so it's okay.

489
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,420
- Hello?
 - You're Mr. Choi Myeong Sik's guardian, right? 

490
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,550
 Please come to the hospital right now. 

491
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:49,710
 Mr. Choi Myeong Sik urgently needs to get surgery.
 - Excuse me?

492
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,560
What is it?

493
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,180
Dad is at the hospital right now.

494
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,620
Dad.

495
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:17,510
Dad, why didn't you tell me you were sick?

496
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,030
Why are you here?

497
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,040
Today is the day of the concert.

498
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,880
Dad.

499
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,970
We'll go down to the surgery room after 30 minutes.

500
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,280
Dad.

501
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:46,470
I have to go back to the stage.

502
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,080
So...

503
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:55,420
I won't be able to see you go into the surgery room.

504
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,520
I'm sorry.

505
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,790
Okay, you should hurry up and go.

506
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:08,180
Since you're a strong person,

507
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,140
you can endure it well, right?

508
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,650
I'll perform well until the end, and come back.

509
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:21,820
So you can't give up, and endure it until the end, too.

510
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,680
- You can promise me that, right?
- Yeah.

511
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:44,400
Chun Hee.

512
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:49,310
Coach.

513
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:54,130
I'm sorry, but please take good care of Dad.

514
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,230
We'll take good care of him. Don't worry.

515
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:06,050
While you're singing, forget everything else and just focus on the stage.

516
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,060
Poor girl...

517
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,390
You go first.

518
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:21,380
I'll go after seeing your father go into the OR.

519
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,500
I'm a guest so I have more time.

520
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,860
Thanks.

521
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,990
Thank you everyone.

522
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,880
Hurry and go. Hmm?

523
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,600
I'm going crazy, really.

524
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,950
Ahjussi, here.  I don't need change. Work hard.

525
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:03,260
Ahjussi, can you take me to the KBC performance hall?

526
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:19,170
Ahjussi, thank you. I'll send you the money.

527
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,070
Her dad fainted!

528
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,490
Will you take responsibility if she can't perform? Will you?

529
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,140
You have no flexibility, really!

530
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,040
- You're not supposed to say that. 
 - Oh, uncle!

531
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,380
- This.. at the entrance! Pay for me!

532
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,730
Chun Hee!

533
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,790
Hurry, let's go this way. Hurry and come.

534
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,890
- I'm going, uncle! 
 - Fighting! Fighting!

535
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,670
Breathe, like this!

536
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,970
Choi Chun Hee has arrived.

537
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:43,640
- You're going to do one song. 
 - Yes.

538
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,970
Hello, I'm singer Choi Chun Hee.

539
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:23,680
♬  Did life carry me and live?

540
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:30,620
♬  Did I carry life and live?

541
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:38,530
♬ Meandering through the fog I've lived through

542
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:45,610
♬  My life that's been through thorny roads

543
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:52,570
♬ If you tell me to go again, I can't go

544
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:58,670
♬ In short, because I'm sad I can't go

545
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:06,670
♬ My love that's been rushed to the setting sun

546
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:14,180
♬ My life that has disappeared like the wind

547
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:20,790
♬  Love

548
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:26,520
♬  Buried by tears

549
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:32,300
♬ My youth

550
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:42,200
♬ Love calls me over again

551
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:49,490
♬  Life became tears and is pushing me away

552
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:56,200
♬ Love

553
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,760
♬ Tears

554
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:06,360
♬ My youth that's been buried

555
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,370
♬  Mother

556
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:17,200
♬  Love calls me over again

557
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:28,360
♬  Life became tears and is pushing me away

558
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,190
Dad...

559
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,380
Don't cry...

560
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:36,010
Dad...

561
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:41,530
is okay, Chun Hee.

562
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:45,130
Thank you.

563
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,430
Thank you, Dad.

564
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,170
Thank you so much.

565
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:12,380
Soo In, don't lose hope.

566
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,640
I'll get you out of here whatever it takes.

567
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:23,020
Wherever I have to contact and beg, 
I will get you acquitted.

568
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,130
Mom...

569
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:31,840
Until now, I always thought that you were the one who ruined my life.

570
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,020
But that wasn't the case.

571
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,350
I think I ruined your life.

572
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:41,430
I'm not a 14 year old kid anymore.

573
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:44,700
I should take care of my own stuff on my own.

574
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:48,450
I feel like I've made things hard for you because of me.

575
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,780
I'm sorry, Mom.

576
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:21,480
Assemblyman Pyo's side must have sued for defamation.

577
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,920
The bribery incident is under investigation, too.

578
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,680
Soo In is in there.

579
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,910
Do you think that type of thing will be important to me right now?

580
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,840
Miss Yang Ju Hee?

581
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:41,080
I'm arresting you for defamation of Assemblyman Pyo Seong Jin, as well as spreading malicious rumors, and also bribery.

582
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,370
Get in.

583
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:54,490
Ah... today's weather is really nice, right, Dad?

584
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:57,880
Yes, that seems to be true.

585
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,940
Chun Hee.

586
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,540
Yes?

587
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:07,870
There's something I have to tell you today.

588
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:10,630
What?

589
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:17,720
The things that happened during the time 
of your mother and me are just the past.

590
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:22,520
I believe that the happiness 
for you guys who are living in the present

591
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:26,400
is more important than what happened in the past.

592
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:33,350
I should've said these words to you sooner but

593
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:37,670
because I'm a person too, I couldn't.

594
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:41,890
I'm sorry, Chun Hee.

595
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,160
Dad...

596
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:51,230
As I was going into the OR, 
because I couldn't say these words,

597
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:54,400
you don't know how much I regretted it.

598
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,680
Dad...

599
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,750
Hwa Soon!

600
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:35,250
Oppa!

601
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,280
I'm sorry, Oppa.

602
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,150
To you and Seong Ju...

603
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:06,570
Really...

604
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,750
I committed a grave sin.

605
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:17,510
Thank you for surviving, Oppa.

606
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,160
I'm sorry.

607
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,530
Have you been well?

608
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,600
You too?

609
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,030
Of course.

610
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:18,470
I brought my mom. She said she was too scared to come alone.

611
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:29,170
It's a relief that those two are resolving things now.

612
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,470
Between us...

613
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:52,690
We'll need more time, right?

614
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:01,110
I'm going to America.

615
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:03,280
America?

616
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:06,280
For how long?

617
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,720
I don't know.

618
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:14,790
Well, I might just live there forever.

619
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:16,950
What?

620
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:19,270
Why?

621
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:22,020
By chance, is it because of me?

622
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:25,340
Hey! Did you forget?

623
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,090
I'm Jang Joon Hyeon, God of Music.

624
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:31,710
There was a line of major record labels who wanted to work with me.

625
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:39,410
♬ This must be love.  ♬

626
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:44,350
♬ It will be nice if the person who is facing me  ♬

627
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:47,510
Keep your head on straight and do well while I'm not here.

628
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,910
When I debut in America, I'll become a global superstar.

629
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:56,160
If you want to date God of Music, Jang Joon Hyeon,

630
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,210
shouldn't you be a Queen of Trot at least?

631
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:03,780
♬ Living only a day I will love like that and ♬

632
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:09,120
♬ Your day becomes mine. ♬

633
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,530
♬ Before I knew it, ♬

634
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:14,340
You're not the one waiting.
♬   like my feelings  ♬

635
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,100
I'm the one waiting for you.
 ♬ I'm growing to resemble you, ♬

636
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:23,800
Gum.
♬ I must be in love with you  ♬

637
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,460
   

638
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,510
President, this location is the best. Best.

639
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:51,910
Right. The eye-level is important. It's unnecessary, these below.

640
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:54,000
It just needs to be on eye-level.

641
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,480
Oh! Na Star, Seol Star!

642
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,520
Here, here here. Look at this.

643
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,770
Omo, my babies.

644
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:16,900
It's really nice. It's so nice.

645
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:21,920
Na Star, look. The atmosphere is really awesome.

646
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,920
Ah, I think everyone recognizes me.

647
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,950
Honey, honey. I don't think that's it. Take off the hat.

648
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:31,170
- It's embarrassing so take off the hat.
- No, I need to wear this.

649
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:35,050
Hold on! She'll drink water first. 
(Gag Concert Parody)

650
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:36,360
Yoo Sik, don't you have water?

651
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,980
President! Na Star.

652
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,440
No.

653
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,300
She needs to drink this.

654
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,380
My baby doesn't have one body (pregnant).

655
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,930
- I want that!
- No, there's lots of that. It's useless.

656
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:52,980
- That tastes good.
- It's useless. Waste of money.

657
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,860
- Oh! Cucumber.
- Cucumber?

658
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,410
- You need cucumber for cold noodles.
- No.

659
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,410
Look, this is 3,800 won for three.

660
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:11,000
This is 2,800 won for five.

661
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,250
- This is cheaper.
- Aigoo.

662
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:21,950
Gosh, what's with him?

663
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:33,970
Then I'll see you at the company.

664
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,900
Thanks for helping me with grocery shopping.

665
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:40,200
In return, I'll send a present to the homeless shelter.

666
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,200
What kind of present...

667
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:50,120
Right now, hallyu star Jang Joon Hyeon just came to Korea with the agent, Julia Kang.

668
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:55,140
After the singer Jang Joon Hyeon made a successful comeback last year with Remember Me,

669
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:58,890
 he suddenly declared a U.S. debut and left the country. Within six months, 

670
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,880
- It's ahjusshi.
 - his single album entered the billboard chart 

671
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:06,230
 at number ten, resulting in a big success. Behind his sensational U.S. debut, 

672
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:08,390
- I know. 
 there is the agent, Julia Kang. 

673
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:16,590
 The two are together during all promotion locations, and  pink tinged scandal is starting to spread. 

674
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,160
Who is it?

675
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:30,910
Sunbae Soo In.

676
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,800
How were you?

677
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:42,270
I really hated you.

678
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:46,700
And honestly, I still find you unlikeable.

679
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,630
But...

680
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:00,550
I admit that what I did was really wrong.

681
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,540
I'm sorry.

682
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,430
Thank you for the leniency with the case.

683
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:11,350
It may be difficult, but can you also forgive my mom?

684
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:13,980
I'll apologize to you in her place.

685
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:19,670
Starting now, it's the beginning again.

686
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:23,540
I'm going to win fair and square with my talent.

687
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:27,390
Although people call you the Queen of Trot right now,

688
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:29,240
don't let down your guard.

689
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:33,650
I'm going to proudly stand as your rival soon.

690
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:40,540
Okay. I'll wait for you while diligently sharpening my skills.

691
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,910
Fighting!

692
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:43,890
Fighting.

693
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:51,510
Since you came back, you'll work at Shine Star again, right?

694
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,110
Depending on the conditions.

695
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:54,980
Jang Joon Hyeon, you have a debt you owe me.

696
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,880
Ah, so petty.

697
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,030
You're going to use that to lower the contract fee?

698
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:01,780
You're really unlikable.

699
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,230
Help me today.

700
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:09,860
Jang Joon Hyeon. There's somewhere you must go with me.

701
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:14,480
Unni works hard to sing,

702
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,610
and the younger sister studies hard.

703
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:19,630
And the two patiently waited for Dad. Next!

704
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:24,150
And then one day, Dad finished selling rice cake, and he came back home.

705
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:28,080
And Dad's illness was completely healed.

706
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,720
That...well..it's not completely healed...

707
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,220
I said whatever we say will come true.

708
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:37,440
Yes, I'm sorry, Teacher Byeol.

709
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:41,630
But this is the same as what we did last time...

710
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:43,610
Next.

711
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:51,580
And...Ahjusshi who went to America came back home.

712
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:14,410
Jang Joon Hyeon. How can you not contact me for one year?

713
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,970
- Enjoy the food.
- The soup is hot so be careful.

714
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:22,640
Eat a lot. Eat a lot.

715
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,670
The soup is hot, be careful.

716
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,170
Be careful, the soup...
- President.

717
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:31,730
Help her, help her. I'll do this.

718
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:34,140
- Ah, here.
- No, it's okay.

719
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:37,280
- I'll...
- Let's carry it together.
- I'll carry it.

720
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,260
Give it.

721
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:44,580
Wow, the soup is really...

722
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:48,540
Excuse me, I have something to ask you.

723
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:51,770
The person I found for you last time...

724
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:55,570
Your first love...Did you meet him?

725
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:57,250
No.

726
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:02,950
Then...will you meet him soon?

727
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,500
I don't know.

728
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,180
Depends on how you do.

729
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,940
What?

730
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,900
Move!

731
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,480
Oh, come this way.

732
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,630
This is hot.

733
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:20,370
Ah, the green onions and soup...

734
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:28,990
And...Jang Joon Hyeon came back.

735
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:34,650
I'm back.

736
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:54,240
♬  After turning and turning around a while   ♬

737

♬  One step each day  ♬

743
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:31,250

♬   Love like a snowflake  ♬

744
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:36,270
