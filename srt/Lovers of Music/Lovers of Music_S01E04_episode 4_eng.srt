1
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,100


2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,050
 Episode 4 

3
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,710
Please forgive me this once.

4
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,170
I thought about it,

5
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,050
no matter how much I thought about it,

6
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,720
I only have you right now.

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,610
In order for me to remain in this field, there is no one else except you.

8
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,070
Honestly I can't guarantee the results.

9
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,310
But I think I will be able to make you into a proper singer.

10
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,270
Even though I have no right,

11
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,960
this one time,

12
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,930
just give me one more chance.

13
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,950
I'm begging you, Choi Chun Hee.

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,200
Crazy bastard.

15
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,670
Starting from tomorrow, you don't need to come out to the night club.

16
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,480
I talked with Shine Star, about contracting with you.

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,500
-So... 
-You,

18
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,640
Do I look that easy to you?

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,660
- That's not what I mean, but.. 
- Do you know with what feeling I was there in the room?

20
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,720
This is probably the end. This is probably rock bottom.

21
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,720
But the feeling that there was more...

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,300
For someone like you 
 who was always famous and well-off,

23
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,360
can you even remotely understand what I felt?

24
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,440
I want to stop now.

25
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,170
Choi Chun Hee.

26
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,300
Now,

27
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,540
I really can't do it anymore.

28
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,810
 Of course, she wouldn't do that. 

29
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,140
 Even if it were me, 
it would be hard for me to do it. 

30
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,440
Hey! Aren't you going to start?!

31
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,710
Ah, yes.

32
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,250
Let's do this.

33
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,900
Pause!!!

34
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,650
Hey, let me see your hand.

35
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,430
You're going to give him a tip?

36
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,930
I'll give it to him.

37
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,390
Thank you.

38
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,750
Hey, can't you make it a bit more exciting?

39
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,570
Because of you, the atmosphere is so dark and gloomy.

40
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:06,960
What? Do you feel bitter? 
Fine, I'll give you a glass of alcohol.

41
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,970
It must be refreshing.

42
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,650
Is it good?

43
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,110
 For someone like you 
 who was always famous and well-off,  

44
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,280
 could you even remotely understand what I felt? 

45
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,620
 You still think the world, no, 

46
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,900
 the entire universe is still revolving around you? 

47
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,380
 Then continue to live like that, 
and see how your life will turn out. 

48
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,280
You have to work hard today.

49
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,340
Uh? It's Ahjussi!

50
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,260
Ahju-

51
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,680
He smells like alcohol.

52
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,390
Ajushi! Wake up! If you sleep here you'll get bit by mosquitoes.

53
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,660
Byeol, don't mind him. Let's go, we'll be late.

54
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,300
Hey! Have you thought about it?

55
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,540
-What?
-What do you mean what? Working with me, of course.

56
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,360
No thank you.

57
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,980
Hang on, Byeol.

58
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,370
Ajushi, I beg of you.

59
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,400
Can't you just let me live here as a monthly rent?

60
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,510
I can't leave the house right now. Please consider my situation.

61
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,320
Bye.

62
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,030
Bye!

63
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,820
Do you have experience at working at a place like this?

64
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,300
Yes. I've worked several times.

65
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,330
If you want to use this friend, you should be beware.

66
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,380
There are two loan sharks after her.

67
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,530
I, too, have been buried in the ground because of her.

68
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,060
If you want to experience it then.

69
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,890
Hey!

70
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,580
Why are you doing this to me?

71
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,640
It must be fun for you to interfere with my job interview.

72
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,870
I'm not a  person of leisure like you!

73
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,330
I'm not doing this because I'm free. 
I'm serious.

74
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,060
Choi Chun Hee.

75
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,970
Please trust me this one time. I'll make you into a singer.

76
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,640
It won't be right away, but I can do it.

77
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,370
You have to make money and pay off your debt, no?

78
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,920
Since when were you so interested 
in paying off someone else's debt?

79
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,630
Then, how could you decide to sell me 
and run away with the money?

80
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,740
I'm really sorry about that.

81
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,440
- But I restored it though. 
- Forget it.

82
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,090
I don't want to be involved with you anymore.

83
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,280
So please disappear from my life! Please!

84
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,770
Yes, Coach?

85
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,100
Ah yes.

86
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,490
My mom went on a vacation to Europe for one month.

87
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,880
-For one month?
-The headquarters paid for it after working for 4 years.

88
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,280
She was so happy. I couldn't stop her either.

89
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,400
So it became like this.

90
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,060
Welcome! How many are in your party?

91
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,810
-Two
-This way please.

92
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,350
Yes. Please tell me after you choose.

93
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,790
What is this? Did she already get hired?

94
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,730
Welcome.

95
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,130
Excuse me.

96
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,440
Yes?

97
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,520
May I ask for a favor?

98
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,170
- Who is he?
- You don't need to mind him.

99
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,440
Doesn't he look like a celebrity?

100
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,460
Aish, I don't remember.

101
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,860
- Excuse me.
- Yes, customer?

102
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,550
You're that person right? The person who sang "Pepper", right?

103
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,740
Excuse me?

104
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,510
Maybe she isn't.

105
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:04,920
Yes, you're right! Pepper! You all must have seen that audition video.

106
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,780
Isn't that song fun?

107
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,230
See, I was right!

108
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,940
That video was a hit!

109
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,790
Get her autograph.

110
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,560
Can I have your autograph? I'm your fan.

111
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,590
What are you doing? He's asking for your autograph.

112
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,470
I don't have an autograph.

113
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,910
Write your name.

114
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,910
Ah yes. My name is Choi Chun Hee.

115
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:33,040
Yes. Thank you.

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,530
You must be crazy!

117
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,370
What do you mean clap?

118
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,780
She sings so well.

119
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,910
Aren't you crazy?

120
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,330
Turn it off!

121
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,660
This is embarrassing!

122
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,090
Omo! I'm going crazy.

123
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,520
Hey, Choi Chun Hee.

124
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,970
How does it feel to become a star?

125
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,250
You know that I don't have skills, Coach.

126
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,390
You were like that when you first ran the marathon, saying you don't have skills.

127
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,320
Me?

128
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:25,380
You have a skill to make people happy.

129
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,660
Seeing the people's expressions earlier while listening to you singing,

130
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,180
you couldn't tell? I saw it right away.

131
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,340
Huh? I didn't call for delivery.

132
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,580
- What is this?
- I don't know. It was outside.

133
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,840
Open it.

134
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,640
Wow, it's what I like.

135
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,830
This too.

136
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,270
- This is the yellow melon you like!
- Right. Let's eat it later.

137
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,850
Should we eat meat for dinner tonight?

138
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,340
 Dad will quickly make money, 

139
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,420
 and come back for you guys soon. 

140
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,390
 Just wait a little bit. 

141
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,100
Dad.

142
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,580
Dad.

143
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,810
Dad!

144
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,880
Dad!

145
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,980
Dad!

146
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,070
Dad!

147
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,690
Dad.

148
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,380
Dad!

149
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,800
Hey kiddo.

150
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,580
What are you doing there?

151
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,890
My dad

152
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,610
sent a letter.

153
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,750
You couldn't find him?

154
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,980
Unni.

155
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,450
Here.

156
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,960
What is this?

157
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,430
I saw Dad's letter.

158
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,810
We can live with Dad if we have the money,

159
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,750
right?

160
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,120
Come here.

161
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,680
You're so nice.

162
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,390
 Here we have radishes, onions, potatoes, 

163
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,890
 fruits and vegetables. 

164
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,970
♬  Climbing hill after hill, there's another one.  ♬

165
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,320
♬  There's another hill to climb.  ♬

166
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,510
 She sings so well. She's so pretty. 

167
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:10,890
 - Ah yes. Do you want some radishes?
- She has such a pretty voice. 

168
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,950
If I sign the contract with Shine Star, 
will I be able to pay off my dad's debt?

169
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,840
What?

170
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,350
If I succeed as a singer, will I be able to make money?

171
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,940
That's right.

172
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,180
It may not be big money, but

173
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,360
you will be able to pay off your dad's debt.

174
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,280
Fine then.

175
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,570
Then let's try it once.

176
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,700
You're going to do it?

177
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,070
You're saying you're going to sing, right? You can't change your words later.

178
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,910
If I want to live with my family, I need money.

179
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,630
I think this is the only method at the moment.

180
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,480
But,

181
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,850
remember this.

182
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,740
I'm not working with you because I trust you and forgive you.

183
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,380
Because I will never know when you will betray me.

184
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,960
I will, too,

185
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,810
use you in order for me to become a singer. 
Understood?

186
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,450
But, will you be able to contract with a psycho?

187
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,050
Excuse me?

188
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,910
Last time you told me at the night club,

189
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,860
that I'm a psycho.

190
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,070
That time...

191
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,170
I'm sorry.

192
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,140
I don't really mind, 
as long as you're fine with me.

193
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,650
That's what I often hear.

194
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,460
Please sit.

195
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,870
But how much will I receive for the contract?

196
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,540
I need a lot of money urgently.

197
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,290
A newbie is talking about money rather than singing first.

198
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:12,300
Her father went somewhere because of money.

199
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,640
If I want to live with my entire family,

200
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,150
I need some money. 30 million (won) for 3 months!

201
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,090
I can't give it to you right away.

202
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,240
But, if you continue to show us your skills from now on,

203
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,010
then the story will change.

204
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,230
Congratulations on becoming part of the Shine Star family, Choi Chun Hee.

205
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,420
Thank you.

206
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,440
- Yes President?
- Ah, Director Wang.

207
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,410
If you have any questions, please ask him.

208
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,180
He will help you out.

209
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,510
Isn't that right, Director Wang?

210
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,440
Please show her around the office.

211
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,040
Yes, I understand. Miss Choi Chun Hee, this way please.

212
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,240
But since she signed the contract, wouldn't she need a manager as well?

213
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,850
Aren't you her manager?

214
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,770
- I'm a producer.
- Isn't it the same thing?

215
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,290
Excuse me, a manager and producer are two completely different things.

216
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,890
In my perspective as an employer, 
it's the same thing.

217
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,280
How could there be such a jerk?

218
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,480
Yes, President Jo.

219
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,010
Choi Chun Hee just signed the contract.

220
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,590
Wasn't I supposed to be her producer?

221
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,300
Does it make sense that I become her manager as well?

222
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,730
Then should I become her manager?

223
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,110
All right.

224
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,150
Whether it's a manager or producer,

225
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,710
I'll do anything you tell me. But,

226
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,540
you must release my comeback album.

227
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,670
Just make her number one in this year's ranking.

228
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,270
Your music career depends upon Choi Chun Hee.

229
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,410
You must remember that!

230
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,510
All right. Please keep your promise.

231
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,820
As you say, Choi Chun Hee's house was bought

232
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,350
and changed to a monthly rental.

233
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,050
Good job.

234
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,440
Please eat a lot!

235
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,740
Please eat a lot!

236
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,140
Please eat a lot.

237
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,630
Are you okay?

238
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,220
Oh, I'm fine.

239
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,650
Can you give me more kimchi? 
More, more!

240
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,300
Please give me a bit more.

241
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,540
- Please enjoy the meal. 
- Yes.

242
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,200
Myeong- Myeong Sik oppa?

243
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,220
I'm sorry!

244
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,420
- What should I do? 
- Ah, give me more kimchi!

245
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,130
Huh?

246
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,040
I thought I saw Myeong Sik oppa.

247
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,180
Did I see wrong?

248
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:09,460


249
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,140
Kids,

250
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,380
I'm really sorry.

251
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,660
Since you've become Shine Star's family,

252
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,410
I want to tell you a few tips as your producer.

253
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:55,390
So listen carefully.

254
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,270
A musician like me might not need it, 
but for a newbie like you,

255
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:03,180
to survive in this rough entertainment industry,

256
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,460
human relationship or learning how to get along,

257
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,420
those things are very important.

258
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,060
For you with that unfriendly personality,

259
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,750
it's going to be hard for you to survive.

260
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,880
Go away.

261
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,880
So there are a few rules that newbies need to follow.

262
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,650
I will tell you those today.

263
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,240
- What is it?
- Rule number one!

264
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,760
- One.
- Greet people properly.

265
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,530
Greet people properly.

266
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,500
Run to them from 100 meters and bow 90 degrees.

267
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,210
Hello, I'm Choi Chun Hee.

268
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,840
See? It's because you're a parachute. (meaning she got in her position because of connections)

269
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,510
The way I see it is all because of you.

270
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,650
- Rule number two!
- Two.

271
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,380
In front of your sunbaes always be smiling like a beam.

272
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,680
Like a beam.  And never show attitude.

273
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,950
Hello I'm Choi Chun Hee! Please look well upon me!

274
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,880
Hello I'm Choi Chun Hee!

275
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,420
Please look well upon me!

276
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,790
Smile.

277
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,960
Kimchi.

278
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,010
-Waikiki.
-Waikiki.

279
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:23,380
- Cardinal Rule 3!
- Three.
Whatever the Sunbaes give you,

280
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,520
whatever the hell it is,

281
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,810
never refuse it.

282
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,610
Eat this. Listen to me well.

283
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,450
Later when you go to Soo In's party,

284
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,870
and refuse what the sunbaes give you, you can never do that!

285
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:42,530
Eat whatever the sunbaes give you! Eat!

286
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,250
Aigoo, it's too complicated, really.

287
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,800
Yes, President. Right now?

288
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,480
All right.

289
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,490
Oppa! You're coming to the party later right?

290
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,840
I have something to take care of so I'll be a little late.

291
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,960
It's your party for your first album. I'm sorry.

292
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,140
It's ok. Hurry and go, Oppa.

293
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,890
Where did he go? Why is he not coming?

294
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,420
Really.

295
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,360
Hey newbie!

296
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,700
Hello!

297
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,720
Hello, I'm Choi Chun Hee, Sunbaenim!

298
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,930
- Sit down.
- Yes.

299
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,980
Let's eat together. It cooked well.

300
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,980
Rule three!

301
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,850
 Eat whatever the sunbaes give you, 

302
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,750
 even if you die while eaiting it. 

303
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,200
I really like ramyun, Sunbae.

304
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,060
Aunt, please give me one more ramyun.

305
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,780
You're going to Soo In's first album party later, right?

306
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:08,050
Since you're a newbie, you have to drink whatever they give you later. How could you go with an empty stomach?

307
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,710
I will eat well!

308
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,570
You're eating well, newbie.

309
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,570
Aigoo. Aigoo.

310
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,780
I'll pick it up.

311
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,730
I can pick it up.

312
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,810
Aigoo! Oh my gosh. Isn't it hot?

313
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,360
Oh my gosh. I'm sorry.

314
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,130
- It's ok.
- Isn't it hot?

315
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,970
It's ok. It's not like you did it on purpose.

316
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,860
What do you mean you're ok? 
How can you go to the party like this?

317
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,380
I'll let you borrow my practice outfit.

318
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,960
Change and go.

319
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,830
Hurry and come.

320
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,170
Did you take off all your clothes?

321
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,940
Yes.

322
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,010
Thank y-

323
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,670
Did you think I was going to give it to you?

324
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,570
What?

325
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,840
Sunbaenim!

326
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,350
Sunbaenim!

327
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,350
Sunbaenim!

328
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,440
Sunbaenim!

329
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,300
Please open the door! 
You're joking, right?

330
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,900
Please open the door!

331
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,570
You're going to the party?

332
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:30,520
I, Na Pil Nyeo am blocking right here, and you are?

333
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,820
Sunbaenim! Please open the door!

334
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:42,210
Excuse me! Please save me!

335
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,920
Anybody there?!!

336
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,210
Na Pil Nyeo Unni!

337
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,630
Sunbaenim!

338
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,300
What is she doing, not even answering her phone?

339
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,050
 You will be connected to voice mail 

340
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:02,850
Go to the party first. I have something urgent to take care of.

341
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,710
Na Pil Nyeo Sunbaenim!

342
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,200
Someone is in here.

343
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,610
If I get out then...

344
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,890
Choi Chun Hee, why are you locked in here?

345
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,840
Does someone have a grudge against you?

346
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,060
Wait here for a little bit.

347
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,110
I have been waiting here.

348
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,890
President? What brings you here?

349
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:14,500
Ah, Park Soo In.

350
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,250
- These are your clothes, right?
 -Yes.

351
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,130
Can I borrow it for a while?

352
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:39,520
A lovely concept is fine too.

353
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,440
Yes?

354
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,330
Give me my jacket.

355
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,620
Are you going right now?

356
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,120
Let's go together.

357
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,710
Everyone cheers!

358
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,550
Cheers!

359
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,710
Woo!

360
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,450
Hey,

361
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,090
Newbie, have a glass.

362
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,540
Yes, Sunbaenim.

363
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,170
You're not still mad, are you?

364
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:38,100
That was an initiation prank 
that we pull on all the newbies.

365
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,560
Right?

366
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,540
They did that right?

367
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,320
Soo In, what class are you in?

368
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,190
27th Class.

369
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,720
Who entered at the same time with you?

370
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,630
Yoon Joo, Si Won, and me.

371
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,810
Which class are you in?

372
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:56,360
Well...

373
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,100
Since you're a parachute you must not have any partners.

374
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:07,280
Partners are the best during this time. It must suck for you.

375
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,600
Why doesn't she have any partners?

376
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,930
She's partners with me. Parachute buddies.

377
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:20,040
Here. For the parachutes, cheer!

378
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,060
Cheers.

379
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:30,440
If I do it three more times, 
all Choi Chun Hee's debt will be cleared.

380
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,590
All right. How many times do I have to tell you?

381
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,290
But does Choi Chun Hee know?

382
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,870
That you're doing this to pay off her debt?

383
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:43,170
Don't tell her useless things. I'm leaving now.

384
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:50,170


385
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:59,600
Is she doing well? I'm concerned since she's by herself.

386
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,160
Hey! Hurry up and come out!

387
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,710
All right I'm going.

388
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:39,780
Hey Newbie, have one more glass.

389
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,790
I drank a lot though...

390
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,840
Sunbae's giving you the drink.

391
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,900
I poured all my affection in this so drink up.

392
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:56,440
Drink.

393
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,900
Drink.

394
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,600
Wait!

395
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,240
I'll be Choi Chun Hee's black knight.

396
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,870
No you can't. That's...

397
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,540
What do you mean I can't?

398
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,320
Did you pour laxatives in here by any chance?

399
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,650
Excuse me? What do you mean laxatives?

400
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,700
Your joking is even...

401
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,410
I'm not joking.

402
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,020
Excuse me?

403
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,590
Huh?

404
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,050
Drink it up! Drink it up!

405
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:44,110
Drink it up!  Up! Up! Up!

406
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,940
Hey!

407
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,920
Oh, don't come to me!

408
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,700
Waiter!

409
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,030
Waiter?

410
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,230
Waiter!

411
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,820
Jeez these laxatives work really well.

412
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,050
Choi Chun Hee. Aish.

413
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,910
Aigoo...

414
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,170
Aish. What the ...

415
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,420
What should I do?

416
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:21,740
Excuse me. Person next to me,

417
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,250
do you mind giving me some toilet paper?

418
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:31,700
You know how during times of crisis our people come together?

419
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,350
Hey next door!

420
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,950
I'm Na Pil Nyeo!

421
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:40,320
I may never forget a gratitude but once you're my enemy,

422
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,720
I will never forget either.

423
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,330
You know?!

424
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,050
Hey!

425
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,200
Hey!

426
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,130
That's right.

427
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,860
We are one nation together.

428
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,120
One nation, thank you!

429
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,070
I told you that I never forget a gratitude, right?

430
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:38,130
This must be some sort of fate.
Why don't we introduce ourselves?

431
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,540
As the same girls.

432
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,750
Does my word not seem like words?!

433
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,760
Unni, I have to do my business.

434
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,990
Unni? Yeah right, you pervert!

435
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,320
Hurry and come out!

436
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,520
Aren't you coming out?!

437
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,490
Aren't you that ddeokbokki thief from last time?

438
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,440
Hey you bastard!

439
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,660
Hey, you pervert!

440
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,190
Hey, what are you doing here?

441
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,630
What are you doing in the girl's bathroom?

442
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,290
It's your fault. It's your fault, right?

443
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,370
I'm going.

444
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,290
Hey you bastard!

445
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,230
Hey!

446
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,030
Oh yeah.

447
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:37,730
It's so good.

448
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,480
You should work hard too (like Soo In) .

449
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,350
You saw earlier right?

450
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,600
Choi Chun Hee, that girl is no joke.

451
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,750
What did she do to the President for him to take her side like that?

452
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,200
So despicable.

453
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,530
He could be looking favorably upon her because of her skills.

454
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,230
Hey, how can a trot singer have skills?

455
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:10,730
And you saw what she wore right?

456
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:16,650
The party's main person is you but why is she so dressed up?

457
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:20,720
Unni, those actually are my clothes.

458
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,250
Huh?

459
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,050
I was going to wear it at the concert.

460
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,770
Why is she wearing it then?

461
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,360
Earlier, the President took it because it was urgent,

462
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:34,460
but Choi Chun Hee showed up wearing them so I was little flustered as well.

463
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,750
There must have been some reason.

464
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,560
You're too nice.

465
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,750
Just stay still Soo In. Unni will take care of it.

466
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,660
Hey Choi Chun Hee,

467
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,220
Ah, yes, Sunbaenim?

468
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,020
You're not an average girl, are you?

469
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,330
I heard this belongs to Soo In.

470
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:10,150
Why did you swipe her clothes and  appear wearing them?

471
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,860
I didn't know it was her clothes really.

472
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,690
The president just gave it to me so...

473
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:19,540
The president gave you these clothes?

474
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,210
Why?

475
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:24,410
Are you his girlfriend?

476
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,710
Ahh, so you think you won't be able to do it with your singing skills so,

477
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:30,450
you're trying to use your seducing skills now?!

478
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:33,850
You know it's not like that, Sunbaenim.

479
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:38,040
It turned out like this because you locked me in the recording room earlier. Is it not?

480
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,090
This b***h.

481
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,230
Are you ok?

482
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,660
What are you?

483
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,520
Wow really.

484
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,560
Hey kids!

485
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,930
Omo Unni! What happened?

486
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:58,680
I was really dumbfounded.

487
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,500
She hits people.

488
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,640
She pushed me like this!

489
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,990
How could you push a sunbae? This is a mutiny!

490
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:14,580
Hey Choi Chun Hee! A newbie to a sunbae? Oh my gosh.

491
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,110
Choi Chun Hee.

492
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,030
What happened?

493
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,870
Mr. Jang Joon Hyeon,

494
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,660
you came at the right time.

495
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,510
I heard you're her manager.

496
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:28,010
I said some things but she pushed me.

497
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:31,910
Teach her correctly, all right?!

498
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:40,050
Are you crazy?

499
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,150
I told you so many times, but how dare you push a sunbae!

500
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,510
Did you see?

501
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:47,290
Did you see me push her?

502
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,330
With your hot-tempered personality, it's so obvious.

503
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:55,920
Just because Sunbae said some things, didn't you get mad and just push her?

504
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,190
No matter how mad you get, how could you push a sunbae?

505
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,400
You're not even allowed to step in a sunbae's shadow.

506
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,200
Did you even listen to me earlier?

507
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,410
Aren't you my manager?

508
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,650
I'm a producer!

509
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,560
Whether it's a producer or manager,

510
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,550
you said to trust you. You said you'll make me into a singer.

511
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,870
Hey what does that and this have to do with each other?

512
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:14,090
That kind of person doesn't believe me?

513
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,510
And disappear on a day like today without a word?

514
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,970
I sent a text saying I had urgent stuff to do so you go ahead first.

515
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,330
What urgent stuff? What is it?

516
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,560
That's...

517
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,010
I can't tell you now but I have urgent stuff,

518
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,340
You don't even know anything after leaving me alone.

519
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,700
And why is it my fault I wore Park Soo In's clothes?

520
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,690
You don't even know who's fault this is!

521
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,690
You're wearing Soo In's clothes?

522
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,260
Are you wearing Soo In's clothing now?

523
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,450
Just forget it.

524
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,900
Hey Choi Chun Hee!

525
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:05,020
- Stop drinking. 
- Let go!

526
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,850
I was a marathon athlete,

527
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:12,460
so if I start, I need to see the end.

528
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,830
Choi Chun Hee.

529
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,470
Me?

530
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,470
Remember this.

531
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,210
I don't like a parachute like you.

532
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:29,850
I don't like it I tell you!

533
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:37,210
It seems like everyone has something 
to tell me on a day like today.

534
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:41,350
What about this? 
Shall we play the "dropping-honorifics time" game?

535
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,050
President,

536
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:46,500
you didn't even drink so how can you even participate?

537
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,180
I didn't drink but everyone here is drunk.

538
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,600
Tell me things with the excuse of being drunk.

539
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,790
This is the chance.

540
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,330
Hey Na Pil Nyeo!  (in informal speech) 

541
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,630
Hey you!
--Be quiet!

542
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,750
Stop!

543
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:04,340
And Director Wang,

544
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:09,090
you bastard, why are you like that only to me?

545
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,830
He's a parachute too!

546
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:17,100
You  can't even say anything to him

547
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,820
no!

548
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,430
And you,

549
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,570
parachute buddy?

550
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:30,950
You've got to be kidding me. Are you and I the same?

551
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:35,320
You are a gold parachute.

552
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,480
- Do it correctly!
- Ah, I understand.

553
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,850
On that note, cheers!

554
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,080
Just look at you.

555
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,040
Can't you walk properly?

556
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,630
Me... Hey!

557
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,120
You've got to be kidding me.

558
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,270
Everyone go in safely.

559
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,500
Yes. Good bye!

560
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,190
Ah, right.  Miss Park Soo In?

561
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:17,830
Yes?

562
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:20,740
I called a substitute driver so he'll be here shortly.

563
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,270
Yes, President.

564
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,720
Miss Choi Chun Hee!

565
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,380
Yes?

566
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,030
Miss Choi Chun Hee, you're really drunk.

567
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,170
I'll take you home today.

568
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,880
No, it's ok, President.

569
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,110
No, it's too dangerous. Get in.

570
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,020
It's ok though...

571
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,280
Get in! Careful, careful.

572
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,690
Thank you.

573
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,070
Oh?

574
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,490
Are you ok?

575
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,590
What's wrong?

576
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,340
Do you feel like vomiting?

577
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,660
Don't be like this.

578
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,320
Don't be like this. There's nowhere to park.

579
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,940
I'm sorry.

580
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,610
Don't even apologize. 
I already know that you are sorry.

581
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,710
Don't nod. I already know.

582
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:26,180
I already know so please stay still.
Don't do that.

583
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:30,910


584
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,890
I'm sorry.

585
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,600
Do you remember it?

586
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,360
I keep remembering it and then not remembering it.

587
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,560
I was sorry.

588
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,390
I'm the one who is sorry. Because I'm the son of the President.

589
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:07,610
Go in.

590
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:08,780
Yes.

591
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:14,100
And, thank you.

592
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,680
For what?

593
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,660
For dropping me off here,

594
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:24,410
and for rescuing me out of the recording room. 
I really appreciate that.

595
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:28,160
That's right. I keep helping you when I see you.

596
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,830
I'm not usually that kind of person.

597
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,940
Then, good night.

598
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,840
♬  Like a passing shower  ♬

599
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:45,800
♬  The person who entered and shook my heart,  ♬

600
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:53,400
♬  One step each day, love like a snowflake,  ♬

601
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,980
♬  Your name   ♬

602
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,160
Are you okay? 
 ♬  Puts forth blossoms.  ♬

603
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,400
Were you planning to follow me in? 
 ♬  Before I knew it, resembling you  ♬

604
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,470
Your space is there. Sleep there. 
 ♬  as much as my heart growing bigger  ♬

605
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:15,240
♬  I must love you.  ♬

606
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,850
It was such a long time ago,

607
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:35,070
It had nothing to do with you.

608
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,860
Yang Ju Hee,

609
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,700
don't think about that.

610
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:49,310
Why are you so late!

611
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,480
I said that I had a party.

612
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,590
Oh, right.

613
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:55,640
Did many people come?

614
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,650
Yes. The President came too.

615
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,030
He said that he didn't care about the company's affairs.

616
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:06,440
But how is the new President?

617
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:12,220
It seems like I know him, but I don't. He is an unique person.

618
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,450
Hello.

619
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:24,770
I dry-cleaned this, but I really didn't know that this was your clothing.

620
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,630
I was really sorry yesterday.

621
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,330
It's fine.

622
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,310
But still... I am sorry.

623
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,210
Work hard!

624
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,840
In the history of Shine Star, there was no trainee like this.

625
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:53,570
She lost the audition, beat up her superior, and talked badly to the President...

626
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:58,100
Because of the contract with Choi Chun Hee, 
the fairness of this company is being tested.

627
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,510
So what you're saying is 
that we have to prove it, right?

628
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,280
Why Shine Star needs Choi Chun Hee.

629
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:03,900
Well...

630
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,010
Let's do it.

631
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,130
How?

632
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:07,760
Like this.

633
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:11,610
   

634
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:15,970
Like you know, our Shine Star funds a concert at the traditional market.

635
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:18,380
This year,

636
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:20,070
I'm planning to send out Choi Chun Hee.

637
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,930
What? Me?

638
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:25,580
You have to get 500 recommendation balls by today.

639
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:29,470
You can put them in this box right here, 
do you think it's possible?

640
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:33,230
We can even do a thousand, not five hundred.

641
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:36,710
I'm an emperor of busking.

642
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:41,110
That's good. Then like what Jang Joon Hyeon suggested, let's change it to a thousand balls.

643
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:43,400
But a thousand....

644
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,220
Just do a thousand. They seem to be confident.

645
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:55,030
Then we all agreed. I hope that you guys succeed. Then work hard.

646
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,670
Wait.

647
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:05,660
We need someone to see 
if each person from the audience puts one ball only.

648
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,750
Is there any volunteer?

649
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:08,630
I will do it.

650
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,340
Oh, good.

651
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:23,210
♬ Koong Jak , Koong Jak, Koong Jajak Koong Jak
In that four beats ♬

652
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:31,780
♬ There are loves, break-ups and tears as well. ♬

653
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,770
You said you were confident.

654
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:39,620
This isn't a place where people gather.

655
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,440
Do you think it will work here?

656
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,480
Oh? That's right.

657
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:53,550
That's good. Let's try to save this.

658
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:59,570
♬ The crying image of me. The stupid image of me. ♬

659
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:03,700
♬ I hate the sun that shines upon me. ♬

660
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:04,540
I really hate you.

661
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:07,490
Sunbae, please take care of that. 
♬ If anyone recognized me ♬

662
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:10,600
Ahjussis, bring all of them up, please.

663
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,180
Hurry up... please.

664
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:18,240
But... the amp... the wire... is it going to work?

665
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,720
If you agreed to help then just help, why do you talk so much?

666
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,710
- Will the wire work though?
 -Miss, hurry up and follow!

667
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,380
Hey wear this.

668
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,630
You need to have a friendly image.

669
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,370
Why are they wearing something like that, again.

670
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:37,640
Hurry up and wear it.

671
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:40,090
Will the wire work?

672
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,290
It works! It's fine!

673
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:43,030
-Will it work?
-It'll work!!

674
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,190
Mother, it's hard to work 
in this hot weather, isn't it?

675
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:47,170
I have more troubles than them.

676
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:49,640
If you can just pick a song, I will sing it for you.

677
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,570
Aigoo, I'm too busy.
What do you mean pick a song?

678
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,060
But still...

679
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:56,010
Miss are you a singer?

680
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:59,270
This shop hit the jackpot today, the jackpot.

681
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:02,800
You know Tae Jin Ah's song?

682
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:06,830
-Ah this song.
 -Yea, try and sing " Can anyone love " for me

683
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:10,360
I'll sing this song for you. If you like the song then,

684
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,400
move the ball from this box to this box.

685
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,270
All right! If you do well, I'll put in ten balls!

686
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,150
Is it possible?

687
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:31,410
♬ Can anyone love? Who said love was easy? ♬

688
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:38,580
♬ Can anyone can love ♬
-Tralala chachachacha!

689
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:44,850
♬ They need to at least make eye contact ♬

690
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:51,360
♬ In a dim memory that sparkles ♬

691
00:48:55,230 --> 00:49:01,300
Aigoo. Good! Very good!

692
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:07,400
♬ While dancing Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai twist ♬

693
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:13,250
♬ I got to know that girl for the first time in my life. ♬

694
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:19,140
♬ While dancing Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai Twist ♬

695
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:24,980
♬ I was famous in the town, ♬

696
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:30,670
♬ All the people that I loved, ♬

697
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:35,680
♬ The twist that is unforgettable, ♬

698
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:44,430
♬ Do not turn to cry
Wipe your tears ♬

699
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:53,410
 ♬ Tomorrow, there will be ♬ 

700
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:59,550
♬ a new wind tomorrow ♬

701
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:04,260
♬ Forget all the worries and dance together Cha Cha Cha ♬

702
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:24,100
What is happening?

703
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:34,680
What is this?!

704
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,540
Ahh!!

705
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:38,140
Hurry and pick it up!!

706
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,290
Ajumma, don't kick it.

707
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:41,450
Hey these are rolling away.
--Pick them up!

708
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:44,720
Don't kick it. Don't!

709
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,770
Don't kick it!

710
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:50,200
Pick up the balls and put them in.
--Keep picking them up!

711
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,110
What should we do about this?
-- Hyungnim ! Hyungnim !

712
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:55,830
Ahjussi, go slowly!

713
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:57,710
What should we do?

714
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:00,540
Stop!

715
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:05,090
Wait a minute! Excuse me!

716
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:07,530
Wait a minute! Don't kick it!

717
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:11,230
Don't kick it! Don't kick it! Don't kick it!

718
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:13,560
The balls are all rolling away.

719
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,420
Where did you guys come from?

720
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,160
What are you guys doing?
-The balls!

721
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,200
The balls!

722
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:36,200
Excuse me, excuse me!

723
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,140
Park Soo In, what was your dream (when you were young)?

724
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,540
I...
For her,

725
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,360
Besides singing, she had no other dreams.

726
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,770
She dreamed of being a singer since she was young.

727
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,070
Ahh, as expected.

728
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:51,250
That seems like Park Soo In.

729
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:53,220
Then, we'll move onto to the next question.

730
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:57,030
When you were singing, your emotions 
were great despite your young age.

731
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,710
Do you have a boyfriend by any chance?

732
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:01,510
I do not have anyone right now.

733
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:03,900
Please edit this part out?

734
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:08,410
What do you mean you don't have one now? 
That's like saying you had one in the past.

735
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:11,190
Just say "I don't have one" instead.

736
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,990
I do not have one  (boyfriend). 

737
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:19,720
Ah yes. Then can I ask you an everyday question?

738
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,230
What do you usually do in your free time?

739
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,320
Nowadays, I don't really have much free time.

740
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,720
In that case, what would you like to do 
if you had free time?

741
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,820
You have that thing that you do well with mom.

742
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:38,100
Ah, Director Yang, this isn't your interview 
but Park Soo In's, right?

743
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,730
- Pardon? 
- I am curious about Park Soo In's thoughts.

744
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:45,120
That's true, I'd really like to hear your honest opinions.

745
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,090
Miss Park Soo In?

746
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,760
If I get some time, what I'd really like to do is...

747
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,690
to sleep.

748
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:01,960
And get some rest.

749
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,190
What do you mean sleep?

750
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:11,070
You could have said that in your free time you go out to volunteer with your mom or read books.

751
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:13,170
Why are you so shortsighted?

752
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:15,110
Imagine how  many people were disappointed with you.

753
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:17,600
Everyone knows though.

754
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,770
That volunteering and studying are all fake.

755
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:25,190
-Excuse me?
-"I just want to sleep more." I really liked this answer.

756
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:26,980
It seems like a person.

757
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,100
Please work hard.

758
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:33,360
I'll go.

759
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,790
Mister! Mister!

760
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,160
Hey!!!

761
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:03,040
What are you doing, you punk?

762
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,820
What are you, punk?

763
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:13,850
Therefore, I'm not what you think of me,

764
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:16,460
such as a thief.

765
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:21,040
I just need this ball.
--Aigoo, how dare you touch it?

766
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,780
Ahh, it's Jang Joon Hyeon!

767
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,740
Grandma, this person is Jang Joon Hyeon.

768
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,260
- Jang Joon Hyeon?
- Ah, you know who I am, right?

769
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,620
Oh this smart kid.

770
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,720
Jang Joon Hyeon, who's that?

771
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,880
This person is famous.

772
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,070
- The singer, Jang Joon Hyeon.
- Singer?

773
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:40,280
Aigoo, really?

774
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,800
In that case, if you really are a singer, sing us a song.

775
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,820
-Excuse me?
-Hurry up and do it.

776
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:49,600
I need to hear to know if you're a thief,

777
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,810
or a singer.

778
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:53,940
Grandmother, I'm not a thief!

779
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,650
Okay then, I'll sing.

780
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:00,280
Then you have to give me this ball.

781
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,260
♬ Do you know? ♬

782
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,730
-What song is this?
-- Don't know.

783
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:08,560
♬ More than anyone in this world ♬

784
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,180
No, not that kind of song.

785
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:16,170
- Excuse me?
- Sing me a trot song!

786
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,100
What, trot?

787
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:24,380
Grandma, I can't sing a trot song even if I die.

788
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:28,030
Of all the music out there why does it have to be trot?

789
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:30,850
I am an artist, South Korea's greatest singer.

790
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:34,420
I cannot give this to you unless you sing once.

791
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:38,680
Grandma! Alright then, I'll do it.

792
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:43,930
I'll do it because you remind me of my late grandmother,

793
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:47,470
This is the first and last time I ever sing trot music.

794
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,280
So if I sing, you must give me the ball.

795
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,990
Aigoo, this punk. Were you lied to your entire life?

796
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:56,350
Just hurry up and sing!

797
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:19,230
♬ I came here with a dream. I came here. ♬

798
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:23,460
♬ Forget all the sadness and loneliness. ♬

799
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:28,130
♬ There's nothing you can't do if you try ♬

800
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:32,440
♬ A sunny, shining day will come back ♬

801
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,860
Everyone now!
♬ A sunny, shining day will come back ♬

802
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:43,500
For the last time!
♬ A sunny, shining day will come back ♬

803
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,880
He's good.

804
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,090
 

805
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:49,860
987

806
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,070
988

807
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:55,730
989

808
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:59,520
There's no more.

809
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:03,230
With a total of 989,

810
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:07,030
You need 11 more.

811
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:09,390
So now the results are out.

812
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:12,140
Choi Chun Hee's mission in the traditional market has...

813
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,570
Here! Over here!

814
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:17,030
You're the one who was singing here earlier right?

815
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:19,650
- Father.
--The lady is here!

816
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:21,780
- Here you go!
- Why, thank you.

817
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,040
What...?

818
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,500
We are from the Doremi Traditional Market's Merchants Association.

819
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,310
I just want to say thank you.

820
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,720
The economy isn't even that great,

821
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,790
and it was a tiring day so we didn't even feel like selling,

822
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:35,090
but because of this miss, we laughed for the first  time in a long time.

823
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:37,650
What's more to living than laughing,

824
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:40,840
and having fun selling?

825
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,320
Even the customers were laughing, so our income went up as well.

826
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,350
This is our gratitude, please accept it!

827
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:48,330
- Thank you.
- And this.

828
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:49,790
It's what the people found.

829
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:53,150
- What is this?
- I hope it will help you, miss.

830
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:57,370
Thank you!!

831
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:05,140
1, 2... 8,

832
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:09,850
8, 9,10

833
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,890
10...

834
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:16,640
Well, although unfortunate, 
but still...

835
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,560
You still need one more.

836
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,730
Hold on!

837
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:27,360
Here! Here's one more ball!

838
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,690
1000! Hey hurry up and put it in.

839
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:32,880
1000.

840
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,690
But it's too early to be happy.

841
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:40,050
How do we know if this ball is the ball the people picked out from that box?

842
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:42,020
What are you saying? It's definitely the...

843
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,230
It's definitely a fail.

844
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:44,600
- Mr. Jang Joon Hyeon. 
- What?

845
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,290
It's definitely 1000!

846
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:49,780
Mister what are you doing?!
It's 1000!
