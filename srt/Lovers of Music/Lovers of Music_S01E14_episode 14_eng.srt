00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,350


2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,490
 Episode 14 

3
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,490
I'll drink it well, piece of gum.

4
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:02,060
♬  After turning and turning around a while   ♬

5
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:08,600
♬  At the moment we were facing each other  ♬

6
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,070
I'm back.
♬  I hesitated to say what you were looking forward to  ♬

7
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:19,370
♬  and I just smiled  ♬

8
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,450
♬  Like a passing shower  ♬

9
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,750
Your memory is back right?
♬  The person who entered into and shook my heart,  ♬

10
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,350
It's really back right?

11
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:38,720
♬ One step each day, love like a snowflake, ♬

12
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,300
I wanted to hide it a little longer.
♬ One step each day , love like a snowflake, ♬

13
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,440
Hide what, really...

14
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,180
♬  On your name ...  ♬

15
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,520
You bad guy.
♬  Flowers bloom   ♬

16
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,540
How could you forget me?
♬  Before I knew it ♬

17
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,550
I had such a hard time because of you.
♬  as much as my feelings  ♬

18
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:02,160
Aigoo, I really want to hug you right now.
 ♬  I'm growing to resemble you, It must be love. 

19
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,260
But,

20
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,730
I can't do that right now.
♬  I smiled in the thrill  ♬

21
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,540
There is
♬  of you  ♬

22
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,020
something that I have to do.
♬  quietly staring  ♬

23
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,050
What thing?
♬  at me.  ♬

24
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,800
I can't tell you right now.
♬  Like a passing shower   ♬

25
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,510
I'll return to you soon.
♬ The person who entered into and shook my heart,  ♬

26
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,950
Choi Chun Hee.
♬   One step each day  ♬

27
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,140
You trust me, right? 
♬  love like a snowflake,  ♬

28
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,150
♬  On your name, Flowers bloom ♬

29
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,050
Then,
♬  On your name, Flowers bloom  ♬

30
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,010
that my memory returned, please keep it a secret.
♬  Before I knew it  ♬

31
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:01,140
♬  I must be in love with you  ♬

32
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,260
Come see me for a bit.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,740
With what thought are you doing this?

34
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,750
What?

35
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:33,840
Calling Oppa Joon Hyeon  out before the engagement ceremony. 
I heard it was you.

36
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,350
You ruined our engagement ceremony!

37
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,530
You seem to be confused about something 
because you dated Oppa Joon Hyeon for a short while.

38
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,920
Get yourself together.

39
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,880
This, Joon Hyeon oppa gave it to me before the ceremony as an engagement present.

40
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,180
Right now Joon Hyeon doesn't love you, but me!

41
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,820
So don't even think about coming in between us.

42
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,730
Because everything (you do) would come to nothing.

43
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,110
Then why do you look nervous right how?

44
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:11,460
Your face right now doesn't look like that of a woman in love.

45
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,260
Work hard.

46
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,790
HEY!

47
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,220
Damn it!

48
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,080
That crazy wrench!

49
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,510
Hello Mother-in-law, it's Soo In.

50
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,430
Yes, Soo In, what's up?

51
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,210
I have something to discuss with you.

52
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,320
Oh, you play pretty well now.

53
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,720
Continue playing.

54
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,060
Can you come over tomorrow and eat dinner?

55
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,790
The '2nd Generation of Choi Chun Hee' project?

56
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,510
Choi Chun Hee can't even stand on stage right now because of her scandals.

57
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,920
We recruited Seo Yoo Mi because of this project.

58
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,530
That was before all of these scandals.

59
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,920
We can't ruin Seo Yoo Mi's image because of her.

60
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,060
There's a difference between image and truth.

61
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,680
In this industry, they only care about image.

62
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,940
Is it possible that the reason why you oppose Director Wang's opinion

63
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,850
is your personal feelings?

64
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:21,790
The Choi Chun Hee project is a bit overboard, but she can sing a guide song.

65
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,790
She's an experienced singer who even has an album released!

66
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,960
What do you mean a guide song 
 for a newbie singer?

67
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,710
I'll forget what you have just said.

68
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,420
She already agreed to it.

69
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:40,070
 When you're sad, clap your hands. 

70
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,950
Unni.

71
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,310
You came?

72
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:49,370
How could you sing my guide song?

73
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,040
That's nonsense.

74
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,480
What's wrong? It's ok.

75
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,720
I also wouldn't be this far, if people haven't helped me.

76
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,560
Since you came all the way here, trusting me. Of course I have to help you. Isn't that so?

77
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,990
Did you hear the song?

78
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,030
Yes.

79
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,440
Listen to the song and follow me, ok?

80
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,490
- Yes.
- Ok.

81
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,060
Lift your left hand, lift your right hand. Clap, clap, clap.

82
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,130
Lift your right hand, lift your left hand. Clap, clap, clap.

83
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:27,620
When you're sad, clap you hands!

84
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,070
Lift your left hand, lift your right hand. Clap, clap, clap.

85
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,880
 Lift your right hand, lift your left hand. Clap, clap, clap. 

86
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:41,460
At love, clap you hands!

87
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:49,600
 While you live life, everything doesn't go as you want it to be. 

88
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,640
Jang Joon Hyeon!

89
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,740
Oh, Hyung. I have a dinner plan tonight.

90
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,070
You can go and rest first.

91
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,540
Ok.

92
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,190
Ah, hey Joon Hyeon.

93
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,270
Until when are you going to hide 
that your memory came back?

94
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,480
I haven't got enough convincing evidence.

95
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,990
The CCTV tape is gone too.

96
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,620
So, what are you going to do?

97
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,990
That scared me.

98
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,390
To capture a tiger, you need to go into the tiger's cave.

99
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,120
If we bother them nearby, something will come up.

100
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,660
It won't take long.

101
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,920
Now. Go!

102
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,510
Joon Hyeon!

103
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,400
Mom.

104
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,650
It's seaweed soup. And japchae.

105
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,140
Is it someone's birthday?

106
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,680
Ahjussi's birthday. Let's have his birthday party.

107
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,600
Wow! Really?

108
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,680
So is the secret over?

109
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,510
Secret?

110
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,850
What? There was another secret I didn't know about?

111
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,260
Wow, Jang Joon Hyeon, this rascal, he can't do.

112
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,630
He always makes me the outcast.

113
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,170
I'm letting him off the hook because it's his birthday.

114
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,820
Yes, Director Wang.

115
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,530
 Choi Chun Hee, come to You You Hotel right now. 

116
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,410
You You Hotel?

117
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,170
 You have to sing a birthday song. 

118
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:03,000
Oh, what should I do? I have to go somewhere.

119
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,200
 Somewhere? 

120
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,720
Choi Chun Hee, why are you so unprofessional?

121
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,020
I will just know that you are coming.

122
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,470
Hello? Director Wang?

123
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,750
Director Wang? Hel...?

124
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,500
  MJ medal troublemaker    

125
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,040
- It's here right?
- Since we came all the way here, let's go up.

126
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,310
- Why should I? I have an appointment.
- Just a minute will be fine.

127
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,300
Just greet and go.

128
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,550
- What's that about?
- Hurry!

129
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,470
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

130
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,570
Soo In prepared your birthday.

131
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,040
I'm so proud of you.

132
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,900
Happy Birthday Oppa.

133
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,620
- Soo In. 
- Coming to a party like this

134
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,080
reminds me of LA.

135
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,000
Parties that are loud, with many people.

136
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,240
- How long has it been? 
- Mother...

137
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,930
 Can you call me?  
- On your birthday, I will do the same thing for you.

138
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,080
Soo In, I like you better and better.

139
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,050
Mother?

140
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,660
I found a house that you will like.

141
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,670
If you have time this weekend, let's go see it.

142
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:34,460
You must be busy working. When did you have time to look for that?

143
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,600
It's a house in which  we three will live. Of course I have to try my best.

144
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,190
Us three?

145
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,740
Mother, Joon Hyeon oppa, and I.

146
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,660
What?

147
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,070
Soo In, you are not an ordinary girl.

148
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,110
Okay, rather than having a daughter-in-law that resembles a bear (too nice, slow),

149
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,980
I like a daughter-in-law that is like a fox (sly, cunning).

150
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,410
But Mother, I am upset about something.

151
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,050
What is it? Is Joon Hyeon giving you a hard time?
 Should I scold him?

152
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:07,940
There is someone interfering in our relationship.

153
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,810
What should I do? I have to delay our meeting.

154
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,480
That's great. Actually I have something to do so I 'm going to be late.

155
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,840
Then later, I will go to your house...

156
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,380
When I lived with David,

157
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,470
those fox-like girls...

158
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,140
- Why are you here?
- I came here to sing.

159
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,740
Why?

160
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,180
Mom, she even came here.

161
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,250
- Who?
 - The person that is bothering me is Choi Chun Hee.

162
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,670
And you?

163
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,510
- It's her?
- Yes.

164
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,190
You are Choi Chun Hee right?

165
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,150
Mom!

166
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,780
Yes, hello.

167
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:09,510
You, do you know what is the worst thing that you can do in the world?

168
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,240
That is desiring another person's man.

169
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,680
Mom, what are you doing?

170
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,300
How dare you flirt with somebody else's man?

171
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,120
Does Joon Hyeon look easy to you? He's an engaged man.

172
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,050
Even if he is a good man, know your position!

173
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,690
How dare you attempt to take my son?

174
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,260
- Choi Chun Hee, listen carefully.
- Mom!

175
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,530
If you dare mess with my son  just once more,

176
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,050
then I won't stay still. Understand?

177
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,980
- Mom, have a talk with me.
- Talk about what?

178
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,100
Please!

179
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,180
Mom, why are you doing that to Choi Chun Hee?

180
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,850
What did I do wrong?

181
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,240
This is the best medicine that can be given to a girl who tempts somebody else's man!

182
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,700
She will only get her grip together if she is embarrassed like that.

183
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,810
It's not like that!

184
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,930
You innocent rascal. Can't you tell?

185
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,800
The way Choi Chun Hee looks at you all moistly.

186
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,420
Didn't that seem strange to you? Oh, really.

187
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,510
How sad must Soo In have been for her to complain about her to me?

188
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,150
Soo In?

189
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:34,330
Yes, that's right. 
When I first saw Soo In, she was just so-so.

190
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,690
But the more I see her, she seems nice and polite.

191
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,790
She is the opposite of her mother.

192
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,500
She has a pretty face too.

193
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,640
Son, please be nice to Soo In. Don't let your eyes wander somewhere else!

194
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:11,600


195
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,140
How come you're here at Joon Hyeon's birthday party? I didn't think  you were invited.

196
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,750
I got a call from Director Wang to sing a congratulatory song here.

197
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,250
Oh my. There is a stain.

198
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,540
Please take care of the congratulation song well.

199
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,310
Oh, Choi Chun Hee, you're here. Hurry and get ready.

200
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,910
Yes.

201
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,660
Hello, everybody.

202
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,310
Today is Joon Hyeon's birthday, but

203
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,490
it's also Joon Hyeon and my engagement party. You guys know, right?

204
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,060
Oppa, come out for  a moment. We have to greet the guests.

205
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,620
Joon Hyeon, hurry!

206
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:40,610
Go up! Go up! Go up!

207
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:48,300
Go up! Go up! Go up!

208
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,480
Thank you for attending even when you guys are busy.

209
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,220
That's all?

210
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:08,160
Oppa is bland like this.

211
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,290
Everybody, we will live well from now on.

212
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,280
Thank you for attending.

213
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,930
Choi Chun Hee, let's go.

214
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,460
President...

215
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,030
Do you think that I signed a contract with you and made you a singer for you to do this?

216
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,190
If I say let's go, let's just go.

217
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,380
I  will just sing...

218
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,790
It's strange for me to leave now.

219
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,870
Choi Chun Hee...

220
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,770
Choi Chun Hee!

221
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,640
Please start singing.

222
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,130
Yes.

223
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:26,040
♬  I'm happy. My precious, you.  ♬

224
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:33,030
♬  Because you are here, the world is more beautiful.  ♬

225
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:39,970
♬  I'm happy. Meeting you,  ♬

226
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:46,410
♬  was a gift that was given to me by the world.  ♬

227
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:53,760
♬  My love, I love you.  ♬

228
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,620
♬  Even if the world splits us apart,  ♬

229
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:08,320
♬  My love, I love you.  ♬

230
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,990
♬  Even if the world ends.  ♬

231
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:18,420
Choi Chun Hee, she has a strong heart.

232
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,350
How can she sing like that without changing her facial expression?

233
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,630
But doesn't she look like someone?

234
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,020
Who?

235
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,740
Who is it?

236
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,310
Oh Seong Joo.

237
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,290
Seong Joo?

238
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,770
I don't know.

239
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,500
No, the way she sings.

240
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,480
The way she changes completely on stage.

241
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,790
It is the same as Seong Ju.

242
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,770
Choi Chun Hee!

243
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,250
Do you still not get it?

244
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,550
How can you look at someone else's man while singing a nuptial song?

245
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,570
You are the one who made me sing today, right?

246
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,980
Did you have to go that far?

247
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,610
Now you know?

248
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,130
No one is on your side.

249
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,480
Joon Hyeon, Mother-in-law, too and the others

250
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,000
are all on my side.

251
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You're such a pitiful person, Sunbae Soo In.

252
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:46,430
- What did you say? 
- I don't know what you are trying to gain from this,

253
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:49,140
but it doesn't seem like love.

254
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,300
Hey!

255
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,580
Choi Chun  Hee!

256
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,940
Hey, aren't they drowning?

257
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,730
Hey, are they drowning?

258
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,180
The man should have saved his fiancée instead!

259
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,620
What?

260
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,820
Are you okay?

261
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,840
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come here.

262
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,320
No, go to Soo In quickly.

263
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,140
Soo In.

264
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,410
Oppa, how can you do this to me?

265
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,410
How can you save Choi Chun Hee and not me?

266
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:41,420
Do you know how embarrassed I was in front of the other people?

267
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,710
Today is our engagement party.

268
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,750
But, how can you do that?

269
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,030
Oppa, perhaps...

270
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,800
It isn't, right, is it?

271
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,710
It's not what I'm thinking right now, right?

272
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,270
Oppa.

273
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,020
What you are thinking

274
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,940
is right.

275
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,970
What?

276
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,140
I'm sorry.

277
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,900
Today I found out.

278
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,750
That I

279
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,110
like Choi Chun Hee.

280
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,840
What?

281
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,120
My mind is wavering.

282
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,310
That's the truth.

283
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,850
Give me some time.

284
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,940
Are you a fool?

285
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,320
President...

286
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,700
As you can see, I'm perfectly fine.

287
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,290
Is it enough for you to be the only one that is okay?

288
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,270
If you listened to me and got off the stage, this wouldn't have happened.

289
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:11,030
Why didn't you listen to me?

290
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,110
I'm sorry.

291
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,600
I'm very angry.

292
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,690
Why do you never listen to me and always get hurt by doing what you want to do?

293
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,620
Why do you make even me hurt?

294
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:02,870


295
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,500
What?

296
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,930
Oppa Joon Hyeon

297
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,830
says he likes Chun Hee.

298
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,840
Even if he lost his memory,

299
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,010
emotions cannot be controlled.

300
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,510
Do you like Jang Joon Hyeon?

301
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,200
No.

302
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,480
I just don't want Choi Chun Hee, 
who made me like this, to be happy.

303
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,930
I don't care if Joon Hyeon likes Choi Chun Hee.

304
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,800
But  I can't ever accept

305
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,470
returning to Choi Chun Hee.

306
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,960
I'm more relieved.

307
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,680
That means Jang Joon Hyeon's memory is not back yet.

308
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,960
If Jang Joon Hyeon comes back to Choi Chun Hee in that state,

309
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,590
that will beneficial for us.

310
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:50,850
We can just make him a man who betrayed his loyal fiance,

311
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:55,540
and ruin Jang Joon Hyeon and Choi Chun Hee.

312
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,160
Hi.

313
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,650
Hi.

314
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,750
Be careful of Director Yang, that woman. 
She's a dangerous person.

315
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,620
- I already know.
-  Really?

316
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,870
How did you know?

317
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,500
I'm your son.

318
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,690
I already knew that she is a dangerous woman,

319
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,470
Thinking that I have to embrace 
all the family (employees/singers) in my company,

320
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,940
Until now, I just watched her.

321
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,820
I'm regretting that decision. Very much so.

322
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,550
Father, even you regret your decisions.

323
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,280
But, that's that.

324
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,200
Why did you come here?

325
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,530
Did you follow Choi Chun Hee again?

326
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,580
I came here because I wanted to see you.

327
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,080
You are a man.

328
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,450
Your parent already met the girl you like, 
but you are still not making any progress.

329
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,630
In blunt words, what do you lack?

330
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:57,000
Is your style lacking, or are you short?

331
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,540
I know, right?

332
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,030
I don't lack anything.

333
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,320
If I was you, the game would be over already.

334
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,580
Don't be sad. Ahjussi is a top star.

335
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,800
Did you think that dating a top star would be easy?

336
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,860
- What?
- You know what.

337
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,280
Know what?

338
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,630
Byeol!

339
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,640
Ahjussi!

340
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,350
You waited for me? I'm sorry.

341
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,360
Are you mad?

342
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,110
You came so it's okay.

343
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,230
Since you came it's alright.

344
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:08,360
How can I eat this? It's too precious.

345
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,630
This is Ahjussi and you?

346
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,770
No.

347
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,280
It's Byeol and me.

348
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,350
If you were me, would you believe that?

349
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,930
I know right?

350
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,420
Aiya, eat.

351
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,430
Got it.

352
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,750
Eat well.

353
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,910
I'll eat well.

354
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,230
Happy birthday.

355
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,880
Thank you.

356
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,590
I'll eat well.

357
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,750
Eat well.

358
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,290
There was a bug over here.

359
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,800
Eat deliciously.

360
00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:01,040
While celebrating your birthday, Choi Byeol will perform with her ukulele, starting now!

You are the best!

 Pretty man! 

370
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:06,040
 Even if our start was awkward and rough, let's make it toward the end! 

371
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,560
 -Singing gum- 

372
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:41,140
Oh, pretty man, did you go home well?

373
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,150
I did.

374
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:44,250
Byeol,

375
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,150
is she sleeping?

376
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:49,330
- Yes, she is sleeping. 
- And you?

377
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:54,790
Oh, for Yoo Mi, I'm going to hear her recorded voice and then sleep.

378
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:57,320
I got it. Work hard.

379
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,650
Sleep well. Dream a good dream.

380
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,960
He's not sleeping yet?

381
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,480
 Come out to the living room. 

382
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,650
Why?

383
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:51,190
♬ After turning and turning around a while   ♬

384
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,660
 Were the prince, who found his memory, and the mermaid princess happy? 

385
00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:00,510
♬ At the moment we were facing each other  ♬

386
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,720
 The mermaid princess was less than what he expected. 
♬  I hesitated to say  ♬

387
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,250
 She didn't have pretty eyes or nose. 
♬  I hesitated to say what you were looking forward to  ♬

388
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:10,940
♬  and I just smiled  ♬

389
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,850
 She had a bad personality, too. It was obvious that the Prince would suffer. 

390
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:18,350
♬ Like a passing shower  ♬

391
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,540
 But what can be done? 

392
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:25,080
 It has to be the mermaid princess for the prince. 
♬ T he person who entered into and shook my heart,  ♬

393
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,920
♬ One step each day,  ♬

394
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,100
 To protect the mermaid princess,  

395
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,690
 the prince got engaged with the princess from another country. 
♬   love like a snowflake,  ♬

396
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:37,530
♬ On your name, flowers bloom   ♬

397
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,850
 That jerk, prince. 

398
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:44,470
 The mermaid princess was very hurt. 
♬  Before I knew it, as much as my feelings  ♬

399
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:48,280
♬ I'm growing to resemble you, 

400
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:53,950
 The prince said that he is sorry 
♬  This must be love.  ♬

401
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,580
 And thankful. 

402
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:08,710
♬  I smiled in the thrill of you quitely staring at me. ♬

403
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,490
 And he also said that he loves her. 

404
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,510
♬  Like a passing shower  ♬

405
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,290
♬ The person who entered  ♬

406
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:22,530
Jang Joon Hyeon, what is this? He should say things like this personally.
♬  into and shook my heart,  ♬

407
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:31,980
 ♬  One step each day , love like a snowflake,  ♬ 

408
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,660
♬  On your name, flowers bloom   ♬

409
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,340
Today was difficult for you, right?

410
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:43,180
♬  Before I knew it, as much as my feelings  ♬

411
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,650
Sorry to hurt you.
♬  I'm growing to resemble you,  ♬

412
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,250
♬  This must be love.  ♬

413
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,750
Thank you for waiting.

414
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:58,620
♬ It will be nice if the person who is facing me  ♬

415
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,840
And...

416
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,620
♬ smiling at me and comes together with me is you.  ♬

417
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,580
I love you.

418
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:14,110
♬ Before I knew it,  like my feelings  ♬

419
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:18,760
♬ I'm growing to resemble you, ♬

420
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,500
Thank you.
♬  I must be in love with you  ♬

421
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,940
Thank you, too.

422
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,670
Yes.

423
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,230
Come here.

424
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,470
Why did you want to see me?

425
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,940
I have something to tell you.

426
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,230
Not as the president though.

427
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,870
That makes me nervous.

428
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,970
I'll tell you a secret.

429
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:55,010
You cannot remember, but

430
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:01,580
Jang Joon Hyeon, you and Choi Chun Hee were in love.

431
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:08,090
I'm not telling you to look cool. You'll find out anyway.

432
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:12,000
Even if I shut my mouth till the end,

433
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,120
it isn't advantageous for me.

434
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,180
But I'm not saying that I will ever  move aside.

435
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,430
What?

436
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,000
Jang Joon Hyeon.

437
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:32,270
Your memory returned?

438
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,420
You pretended you didn't know until now?

439
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,410
Jang-- You are very annoying.

440
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,200
Why?

441
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,160
For the first time, I actually like you today.

442
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,760
Then Choi Chun Hee...

443
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,590
Ah, it's embarrassing. I, really...

444
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:55,090
Then should I tell you a secret too?

445
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:10,590
When I heard that your heart was shaken by Choi Chun Hee,

446
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:15,420
my pride was hurt. But I will still wait for you.

447
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,330
- Soo In.
- I still love you.

448
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,530
I can wait.

449
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,290
Sorry.

450
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:29,990
The reason why I talked about Choi Chun Hee was because I thought there shouldn't be secrets between lovers.

451
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:32,100
Isn't that right, Soo In?

452
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:37,950
Of course.

453
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:42,580
Then do you have anything to say to me?

454
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:46,680
If there is anything that is bothering you, tell me.

455
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,080
I'm on your side.

456
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,810
Oppa. I don't have anything like that.

457
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,710
There really isn't anything?

458
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,280
Yes.

459
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,510
Ok.

460
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,290
That's a relief then.

461
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,140
Hey, what if somebody sees us?

462
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,540
All of them have gone home already.

463
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:39,080
Chun Hee, I have something to tell you.

464
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:44,420
That day on the stage wasn't a coincidence.

465
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,570
Then somebody did it on purpose?

466
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,190
Because of that, you almost died.

467
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,530
They weren't targeting me,

468
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:55,310
but you.

469
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:59,730
I also hid the fact that my memory returned because you might get hurt.

470
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:04,560
For the time being, you might have a hard time.

471
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,670
But, you can believe in me and wait, right?

472
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:22,100


473
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,630
Oh?

474
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,550
Why are you here?

475
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:29,130
Only for a moment please.

476
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,260
I'm here from KBC.

477
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,180
In our program, we are investigating about Jang Joon Hyeon's stage accident.

478
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,780
I know you were a witness for that case.

479
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,800
Can you tell us what exactly happened then?

480
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,080
Sorry, I don't have anything to tell you. Please move.

481
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:47,030
Park Soo In, tell us what exactly happened when the object fell on top of him.

482
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:50,280
I don't know. Please move.

483
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,120
What should we do, Mom?

484
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,820
If the TV station starts to investigate what exactly happened that day, what is going to happen to me?

485
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:01,120
I already took care of that accident as the theater's equipment problem, but why now...?

486
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:06,740
Perhaps, Joon Hyeon was suspicious and reported it?

487
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:10,460
He keeps talking strangely, it's making me uncomfortable.

488
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,580
I will stop the broadcast. Just trust me.

489
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,720
I'll believe in you. Please make me believe.

490
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:28,400
♪  Clap for the love. ♪

491
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:30,840
Don't do that.

492
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,620
Why? I'm also practicing.

493
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,120
I have to practice. Can you leave?

494
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,970
I have to practice too, so can you leave?

495
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:42,710
Ah, really. Don't.

496
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,750
May I come in for a moment?

497
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,270
Yes.

498
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,360
You came.

499
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,310
My father sent some traditional Korean cookies for you.

500
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,740
Wow, really. I'll eat it well.

501
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,150
Please be sure to tell thank your to your father.

502
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:06,610
But, did your father return home?

503
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:12,760
My father cried while listening to your radio broadcast.

504
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,120
Not yet.

505
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:14,830
But when I was on broadcast, he called a couple times.

506
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,150
But when I was on other the broadcasting shows,

507
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,350
he contacted me.

508
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:21,350
I hope your dad comes back really soon.

509
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,410
I know right.

510
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:26,090
It's almost Mom's death anniversary soon.

511
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,680
Dad will think of it, too.

512
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,300
I have an appointment, so I will go first.

513
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,100
- I'll see you again
- Good bye.

514
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,800
Yes. Have a good day, Sunbaenim.

515
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,190
Yeah, okay.

516
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,930
Mom will be sad.

517
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,400
Because Dad is not here.

518
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,000
I know.

519
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,730
Mom will be upset.

520
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:14,600
Because Dad is not here.

521
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,830
Right, Dad?

522
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:46,400
To the kids, it's a secret that I'm sick.

523
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,070
Yes.

524
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,630
Who is ...?

525
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,390
Dad!

526
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,700
Dad?

527
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,180
It's Dad!

528
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,240
Byeol!

529
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,290
Dad, why do you come now?

530
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:27,280
Do you know how much Unni and I waited for you?

531
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,810
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Byeol.

532
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:34,890
Dad! You came back for good, right?

533
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:37,110
That's it, right?

534
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,070
That's right.

535
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,700
But

536
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:45,620
our Byeol grew a lot.

537
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,390
I ate carrots and cucumbers, and I grew 1 cm.

538
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,490
Is that right?

539
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,360
You did well, my Byeol.

540
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,440
Chun Hee!

541
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,750
Dad!

542
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,860
I'm sorry.

543
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,430
I'm sorry, kids.

544
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,820
Honey, thank you.

545
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:59,740
For protecting our children while I was gone.

546
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:08,060
Our Chun Hee became a singer. 
You know, right?

547
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,500
She takes after you, so she sings so well.

548
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,770
You know, right?

549
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:27,480
Chun Hee, thank you.

550
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:32,420
For growing up prettily, thank you.

551
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:38,900
Thanks for protecting Byeol in my place.

552
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,910
And this lacking father... Thanks for forgiving me.

553
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:48,660
Aiyo, don't say that.

554
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:52,670
I am thankful because you came back.

555
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:57,230
Okay.

556
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:00,700
Seeing your faces so close,

557
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,310
like that guy said, I wonder why I didn't come back sooner.

558
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:09,180
That guy?

559
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:18,830
Actually, your friend Jang Joon Hyeon came looking for me.

560
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:20,870
Jang Joon Hyeon?

561
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:23,290
Why would he?

562
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:28,600
If it weren't for him, I probably wouldn't have had the courage.

563
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,720
He said this. That until he comes back,

564
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,570
he wanted me to stay beside you and protect you, in his place.

565
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,870
He seemed like a good person.

566
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:47,570
Seeing him, I feel at ease.

567
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:05,750
Why did you call me?

568
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,330
You came?

569
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:12,630
Ah,  to say thanks for finding your father?

570
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:15,610
"Jang Joon Hyeon, you're great. You're the best".

571
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:21,790
"This is why I can't help but love you." Things like this?

572
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:23,510
I know it too. Why am I so awesome?

573
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,650
Why does everything I touch become solved?

574
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:31,410
I was going to forgive you for not remembering me.

575
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:35,930
But you're really a jerk.

576
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,090
Ah, this is the problem with Korean people.

577
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,290
If you're thankful, say thank you. If they're awesome, say they're awesome!

578
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:44,680
Why can't they say it?

579
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,010
Thanks.

580
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:49,130
- What?
- Thank you.

581
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:53,050
Yes.

582
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,670
Ah, Oppa.

583
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:02,540
What's wrong? You came all the way here.

584
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:04,950
How have you been?

585
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,580
This...

586
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,410
But, Oppa what's wrong with your face?

587
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:16,120
You look worse than the last time I saw you.

588
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,340
Oh.

589
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,800
The thing is...

590
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:28,320
Ju Hee, can't you let me meet CEOJo Hee Mun?

591
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,850
CEO Jo?

592
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:32,750
Why CEO Jo?

593
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:38,340
Oh. I feel like CEO Jo would know where Hwa Soon is.

594
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:46,360
She said that we're going to see houses, 
but why isn't she answering my call?

595
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:50,230
Should the future mother-in-law personally come here to look for her like this?

596
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,390
Ju Hee.

597
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:57,250
I really need to find Hwa Soon.

598
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,950
I need to solve that incident with Seong Ju

599
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:03,720
in order for me to be able to close my eyes (die).

600
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,390
 Hwa Soon. 

601
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:17,160
I'm sorry. Answer it.

602
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:21,500
No, it's not important.

603
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:25,410
But, Oppa what do we do?

604
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:29,390
CEO Jo Hee Mun left Shine Star.

605
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:33,440
What? Really?

606
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:38,460
When did CEO Jo leave?

607
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,770
Don't be too disappointed.

608
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:44,760
I'll definitely find out Hwa Soon's contact number.

609
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,000
Ah, okay.

610
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:51,520
 I am in the lobby. I'm coming up.   

611
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:56,250
Oppa, I'm sorry.

612
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,220
I have an important meeting.

613
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,690
Ah, really?

614
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:05,880
If you have a meeting, go on in.

615
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,500
No, it's ok, Oppa.

616
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:17,760
Oppa. They're inspecting the elevators today.

617
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,440
I rode the elevator up here though.

618
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:39,390
Since I came here, I want to see Chun Hee before I go.

619
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:41,240
Because of Chun Hee's schedule, she's not there.

620
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,760
Oppa, hurry and go.

621
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,020
Oppa, I will call you. Hurry.

622
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,630
Thank you. I'll believe you.

623
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:49,980
Oppa, go.

624
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,380
Where did you go that you just came?

625
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,150
A guest came.

626
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,430
Do you still eat these? Like a child?

627
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:12,770
By chance... Do you have any news on Oppa Myeong Sik?

628
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:18,700
- Why all of the sudden?
- Seeing this made me think of the old times.

629
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:22,950
Myeong Sik oppa used to buy it for us every day.

630
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:28,600
If it weren't for that accident, we...

631
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:37,160
Stop with that talk, if you want to get a house, at least.

632
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,690
This talk is not comfortable for both you and me.

633
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:53,840
Oh, Chun Hee! Where are you?

634
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:57,220
You're at Shine Star?

635
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,600
I just came out of there.

636
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:05,830
They said you weren't there, so I was on my way back.

637
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:13,140
Excuse me. I'm sorry, but please go back to Shine Star. I'm sorry.

638
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,250
Hwa Soon...?

639
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:40,650
Hwa Soon!

640
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:57,890
Hwa Soon! Hwa Soon!

641
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:18,450
Father, shouldn't you quickly get a surgery date?

642
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:21,520
That's not the problem right now.

643
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,050
Today, I saw the enemy I've been searching for all my life.

644
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:28,040
Who is that?

645
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:32,140
The person who made Chun Hee's mom lose her voice.

646
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:39,480
Made her lose her voice? Was there some kind of accident?

647
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,840
At that time, because Seong Ju wanted t, 
I just let it slide, but...

648
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:49,330
Before I leave, I think I need to solve this problem.

649
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:53,300
Then you know who the culprit is?

650
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,080
I know. I know it well.

651
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,930
It's someone who used to sing together with Chun Hee's mom before.

652
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:05,730
When I meet the person, I really want to ask.

653
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:08,380
How a person can do such a thing?

654
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:13,850
Why ...  didn't  the person take her to the hospital right away.

655
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,810
Tae Song.

656
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:30,620
Why did he call me over to his house?

657
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:36,050
He's not thinking of anything naughty, right?

658
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,090
Well, that's fine with me. Omo, I must be crazy. Am I possessed by the lustful demon?

659
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:47,340
Go away! Lustful demon, go away. Go away.

660
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:51,930
Tae Song.

661

 Incident 119
#1 Searched: Jang Joon Hyeon 

675
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:41,770
 The CCTV of the scene of the incident that day disappeared. And my cell phone also disappeared. 

676
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:46,100
 If it's not a simple accident, but rather a crime committed by someone, 

677
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:50,630
 I'll take action myself to reveal the culprit. 

678
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,490
- Yes?
-  Ju Hee! 

679
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,280
 I saw Hwa Soon! 

680
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,870
- What?
- Hwa Soon is in Seoul!

681
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:14,760
You must have seen wrong.

682
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,840
Hwa Soon lives in LA. How can you see her here?

683
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,540
No, it's definitely Hwa Soon.

684
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:22,770
It's the face I've ingrained in my heart for a long time.

685
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:25,870
How can I not recognize her?

686
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:30,830
Mom, what happened? You said you blocked all the broadcasts.

687
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:33,620
You said you'd take care of everything!

688
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:38,110
Oppa, I'm sorry. I'll call you back later. Sorry, Oppa.

689
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:40,910
Oppa Joon Hyeon  interviewed with "Incident 119."

690
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:44,430
The internet is in a uproar about how there's a separate culprit.

691
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:45,500
I'll check.

692
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:48,700
Forget about checking! There's another episode of this continuing on next week!

693
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,660
I think police investigation will start soon also.

694
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:57,180
This sly jerk.

695
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,400
Really. Since I started listening to you, nothing is working out for me.

696
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,950
No. It's because I'm doing what you say.

697
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:10,110
That's why my life has become ruined like this.

698
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,520
What are you talking about? What's wrong with your life?

699
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:19,070
Mom will take care of this. I'll take care of it so...

700
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:22,560
Let go! I won't believe you anymore.

701
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,810
I'll take care of my own business now.

702
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:35,420
CEO Jo did?

703
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,260
Why would he do such thing?

704
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:42,300
At the time, Shine Star was in a difficult situation.

705
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:46,080
But if people found 
about the hit-and-run accident

706
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:51,640
which was caused by the conflicts among its singers, 
our company would have probably closed down.

707
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,960
That's why CEO Jo blocked everything.

708
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:58,800
- That doesn't make sense. How could CEO Jo...
- Oppa.

709
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,340
CEO Jo is a businessman.

710
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:04,790
Look at how he discarded Seong Ju because the company no longer needed her.

711
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:09,080
Don't trust CEO Jo. No, don't trust anyone.

712
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,190
Oppa. You've already gone through everything 
with Seong Ju's incident.

713
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,500
Truthfully, the scandal with Assemblyman  Pyo

714
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,250
occurred because Chun Hee is in this line of work.

715
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:25,520
If you want to protect Chun Hee, take her and leave now.

716
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,050
That's the way your family will survive.

717
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:32,250
I'll look for a place you can stay, just like last time.

718
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:35,950
That... I can't do that.

719
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:37,910
Seong Ju...

720
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:42,060
I saw how she lived after she stopped singing.

721
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,500
She had such a difficult time.

722
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,610
My Chun Hee really likes singing.

723
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:55,340
I've done nothing for Chun Hee so far.

724
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:58,050
I can't stop her from singing too.

725
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:00,790
As a father, I can't do that.

726
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:03,090
Then it can't be helped.

727
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:10,610
I wasn't going to tell you this because it may shock you.

728
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:16,350
The stage incident last time... Chun Hee is the one who did that.

729
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,570
What...?!

730
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:23,740
While trying to harm Soo In, Jang Joon Hyeon got hurt instead. That incident.

731
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:28,040
Your daughter Chun Hee did that because she was blinded by jealousy.

732
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:34,320
That doesn't make sense. There's no way. You're mistaken.

733
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,290
I saw the CCTV that day.

734
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:43,650
But because she was your daughter, thinking of you and Seong Ju,

735
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:46,240
I told them to just get rid of it.

736
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:52,470
But if you want to see it, it can be recovered.

737
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:55,320
It's not as hard as we think to do that.

738
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,530
Dad!

739
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:08,690
It's so early, why are you spreading out the blankets already?

740
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,930
Because I want to do it for you.

741
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:16,560
Dad. It still feels like a dream.

742
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:19,470
That I'm laying down the blankets for you.
