00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,880
 Episode 6 

2
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:30,900


3
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,970
Ah, what happened to you?

4
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,320
Are you alright?

5
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,710
Why didn't you call me that you were sick?

6
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,420
Ahjussi, you didn't pick up, though.

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,330
Thanks to you, I came here.

8
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,980
With Choi Chun Hee.

9
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,750
President brought Unni to the hospital.

10
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,360
Ah, are you alright?

11
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,690
Ah, I'm fine. It's not that serious, 
so don't worry too much.

12
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,350
Choi Chun Hee's guardian?

13
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,240
- Yes!
- Yes.

14
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,490
I'm Choi Chun Hee's manager, no, I mean, producer-

15
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,370
- What is it?
- But that person is her President.

16
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,310
It's a relief that the test results were fine.

17
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,720
You make others worry for nothing.

18
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,860
What is this? It doesn't suit you.

19
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,130
Fainting all of the sudden so helplessly is what pretty girls do.

20
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,810
- You should just get going now.
- What?

21
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,400
I'll leave after dropping off these two.

22
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,220
Let's go, little lady.

23
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,950
Ahjusshi, you should just go together.

24
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,170
Let's go.

25
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,310
Byeol.

26
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,930
We're here. Wake up.

27
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,600
Byeol! We're here, you have to get up. Hurry!

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,310
Byeol! Huh? Why can't you get up?

29
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,240
Little lady!

30
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,970
You don't have to do this.

31
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,980
Open the door!

32
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,520
What should I do, seriously.

33
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,230
Even if he drives a nice car, it's not even fast.

34
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,630
Why is there nothing to eat in this house?

35
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,760
But how long has it been?  Why aren't they here yet?

36
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,850
Oh wait!

37
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:05,620
I... have something to clean in there.

38
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,490
Please come in after 3 minutes.

39
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,920
It's fine though.

40
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,570
Hey, right now...

41
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,670
Hey! Why did you come in so early?

42
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,880
What the hell are you talking about?

43
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,350
Hey, hey, the President is going to come in, so hurry up and hide.

44
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,510
Why is the President coming inside?

45
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,570
I told you to keep things clean!

46
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,860
- Aish.
- Ah, seriously. Seriously!

47
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,480
- Hurry up and go inside.
- Hey.

48
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,240
- Quickly get in!
- I asked why the President is coming inside!

49
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,020
Be quiet and go in first.

50
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,170
Let's go.

51
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,900
Don't move and just stay here. Okay?

52
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,050
- Why do I have to do that?
- Please just do as you're told.

53
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,540
Ms. Choi Chun Hee. The three minutes are up.

54
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,950
Hey, you go in there.

55
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,330
Get in.

56
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,240
Don't come out.

57
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,850
Where are you Choi Chun Hee?

58
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,410
Yes!

59
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,310
Oh!

60
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,890
- Where should I put her down? 
 - Here.

61
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,560
Right there?

62
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,340
She's sleeping really well.

63
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,360
Carefully.

64
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,470
Thank you.

65
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,090
President, there's nothing I can give you right now. What should I do?

66
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,730
Just give me a cup of water then.

67
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,670
Yes.

68
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,790
You...

69
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,800
Why does this  keep opening?

70
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,920
Why is that jerk coming into a girl's house this late at night?

71
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,170
And why are you sleeping?

72
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,320
You can drink it standing up. Why seat yourself to drink water?

73
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,230
I wanted to tell you.

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,820
Regardless of today's results,

75
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,870
that you did really well.

76
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,950
The audience fell for you when you were on stage.

77
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,110
And the same thing for me as well.

78
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,530
Thank you.

79
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:44,800
 Hurry up and send him away. I have to go to the bathroom. 

80
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,820
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

81
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,990
You keep getting messages.

82
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,440
It's nothing. It's just spam.

83
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,350
You're joking.

84
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,140
What? That's my personal mug! How dare he?

85
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,340
But do you just live with your younger sister?

86
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,600
Are you still not able to contact your father?

87
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,850
Yes...

88
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,330
 That's my cup. 

89
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,620
 Are you trying to piss me off? 

90
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,910
 Change the cup immediately. 

91
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,110
 I'm going to take care of my business here then! 

92
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,200
There must really be something urgent.

93
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,500
I think I have to change your cup.

94
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,090
There's a crack right there.

95
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,520
- It's ok.
- No I'll change...

96
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,460
I will... change the cup... for you.

97
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,270
It's ok though.

98
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,320
The cup is...

99
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,770
Take it out.

100
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,080
Ah yes.

101
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,460
You should be careful.

102
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,410
Yes.

103
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,910
Those two really.

104
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,190
What is this?

105
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,210
It'll be better if you didn't go out.

106
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,980
Huh? I think there was some kind of sound.

107
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,780
What sound?

108
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,880
Ah. Byeol must be awake. Don't mind it.

109
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,630
Move.

110
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:35,280
- Hurry up and move
- If he sees that you're here,

111
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,010
the President might think strangely about it.

112
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,060
So what if he thinks about it strangely?

113
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,640
That can't be.

114
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,850
President and Unni look cute together.

115
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,940
What are you talking about? What are you saying?

116
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,700
You're part of our family now, Ahjussi.

117
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,970
So you better help.

118
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,580
I'm going.

119
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,670
Are you leaving?

120
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,540
Please return safely.

121
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,060
And watch your health.

122
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,240
Good night!

123
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,710
♬ You have to leave with only one ticket. ♬

124
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,380
Ah but...

125
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,540
What is he doing here?

126
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,590
Hey. Why are you hammering at night?

127
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,440
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo. Why don't you just break it? Will it break that way? You have to hit harder to break it.

128
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,070
- What's with this?
- Aish.

129
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,460
You're destroying it, really.

130
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,460
Right, of course things you do turn out like this.

131
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,380
Then about the things you do?

132
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,500
- Bringing a guy home in the middle of the night.
- What did you say?

133
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,650
And why do you thoughtlessly use my personal mug?

134
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,070
Why would you serve that to that jerk?

135
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,780
And that President guy. Why would he come to a woman's house after she came out of the emergency room?

136
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,420
Byeol fell asleep, so he came to drop her off.

137
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,660
- What a nice excuse.
- Hey.

138
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,660
Try tell me the truth. You're being like this now because you're angry at me, right?

139
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,680
That's why you're taking it out on someone else.

140
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,420
- What?
- Fine. For disappointing you today...

141
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,410
I'm sorry.

142
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,560
You put in a lot of effort all this time, so seeing you disappointed made me feel bad too.

143
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,920
It's not because I was disappointed in you. You don't even know.

144
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,100
The reason why I was angry earlier...

145
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,650
The thing is... there is something.

146
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:38,480
The PD and the director were all in it together.

147
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,080
And they did something weird.

148
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,410
No way!

149
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,050
What do you mean no way?

150
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,940
You had an overwhelming victory for the audience votes.

151
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,380
Does it make sense that it got overturned with the Internet votes?

152
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,760
- You definitely won! You won, but...
- Hey!

153
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,340
Don't get stressed about those things.

154
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,720
For me, appearing on a broadcast,

155
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,780
and being able to talk about dad, I'm satisfied with that.

156
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,380
Really.

157
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,870
What a saint you are.

158
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,810
- Look at you pretending to be nice.
- It's because I really am nice.

159
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,590
She's young, but she sings very well.

160
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,740
I know, right?

161
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,480
 Dad. 

162
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,050
 I don't know where you are now, 

163
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,170
 but I believe that you're watching this. 

164
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:50,150
 I'm living really well with Byeol. 

165
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,440
 So if you see this broadcast, you have to give us a call. 

166
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,710
 Okay? Thank you. 

167
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,590
 It's time for Entertainment Weekly's Meet the Stars. 

168
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,430
 Today, we're out at a place of childhood memories, the amusement park.
 - Wow.

169
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,550
It feels hot just looking at it.

170
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,450
Why would they film there in this midsummer heat?

171
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,760
Why? It's nice.

172
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,790
For me, after I turned fourteen,

173
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,830
I've never gone to places like that.

174
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,740
It must've been nicer when you were young. Those things weren't fun for me at all.

175
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,320
- President.
- You know you have a meal appointment later with the Director, right?

176
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,670
Yes.

177
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:40,240
 The next news. Singer Lee Eun Ha's post on SNS is becoming a hot issue. 

178
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,070
 In last week's Survival Immortal Classics, Rookies Episode, 

179
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,520
 Park Soo In took the final win. 

180
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,550
 However, the original singer of the song, Lee Eun Ha, posted on her SNS 

181
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,350
 that she supports Choi Chun Hee, the person who was eliminated in the first round. 

182
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,160
 Many followers are agreeing, and it's causing a big controversy online. 

183
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,810
 The following is the content of Lee Eun Ha's SNS. 

184
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,840
You know that this occasion is to celebrate your win, right?

185
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,300
Be good to the director and the PD.

186
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,140
I know, Mom. This is not my first time attending these things.

187
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,800
But... what's with your voice?

188
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,080
It didn't heal yet?

189
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,720
It's almost healed.

190
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,550
You need to take good care of your throat. You know that health management is also a talent, right?

191
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,320
You were almost beaten by that newbie.

192
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,930
What would you have done if Executive Director Wang didn't take action?

193
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,960
What do you mean by that, Mom? He took action?

194
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,280
It's nothing.

195
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,160
No way. You had a hand in this, so I...

196
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,700
No, right? It's not like that, right, Mom?

197
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,400
That's why you should've taken better care of your throat.

198
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,840
Mom! Whether my throat hurt or not, I could have won with my own talent.

199
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,690
But why did you get in the middle, making me look weird! Why?

200
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,160
Right. You were supposed to be the winner anyway.

201
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,160
You don't need to get worked up over nothing. Quickly come in.

202
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,740
Why isn't she coming?

203
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,850
 I'm going to get some air, Mom. 

204
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,590
Gosh, she's so weak. This is not even a big deal, why make a fuss?

205
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,810
She's not picking up.

206
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,830
This kid, seriously!

207
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,200
What's the matter? Where's Park Soo In?

208
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,310
We can't contact Soo In.

209
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:55,030
I'll look for her. You two should go continue with the meal.

210
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:08,920


211
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,840
 - Wow, it's Park Soo In! Daebak! 
- It's Park Soo In! 

212
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,050
 Noona, you're so pretty. 

213
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,340
 She's no joke. 

214
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,880
 It's really Park Soo In! 

215
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,430
 She's really pretty. Oh, what to do? 

216
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,590
I'm sorry.

217
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:50,770
Soo In wasn't feeling well all of the sudden, and ended up being discourteous.

218
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,660
Please continue with your meals.

219
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,810
 President, please help me. 

220
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,620
 Wow, it's Soo In! 

221
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,380
It's her! She's pretty.

222
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,850
She's prettier in person!

223
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,250
I came late, right?

224
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,460
There are so many people, let's go quickly.

225
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,130
President. I have a favor to ask you.

226
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,610
Ah.

227
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,650
This is all fake.

228
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,850
It seems real though.

229
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,670
Are you going to do this all night?

230
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,430
Ah, that startled me.

231
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,920
Did you relieve a bit of your stress?

232
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,220
Thank you for today.

233
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,530
I didn't want to contact anyone else.

234
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,120
Did you also know?

235
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,770
That my victory was already decided.

236
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,420
I'm hearing that for the first time.

237
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,210
Then without even telling you, my mom...

238
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,140
Not being aware of that, I was all happy that I won.

239
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,320
I'm embarrassed to see you.

240
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,650
Everyone said that your performance was flawless.

241
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,530
Really?

242
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,850
Your mom and Executive Director Wang just overreacted.

243
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,040
When I'm with you, difficult problems seem so easy.

244
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,860
That's a relief. Let's go.

245
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:38,330
You suffered today because of me. Let's go for a simple dinner.

246
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,600
I'll buy.

247
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,210
Let's do that then.

248
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:47,640
Oh, yeah. I didn't express my gratitude, but thank you for last time.

249
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,510
For saying that I did well on my interview.

250
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,560
What about that? It was the truth.

251
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,060
Honestly. I've never been praised for anything else

252
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,080
besides singing.

253
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,380
It was the first time being praised for something else.

254
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,520
In your eyes, someone like me...

255
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,110
would look pathetic.

256
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,310
What are you saying? Not at all.

257
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,010
You grew up well 
despite being under a strict mother.

258
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:22,240
If it were me, I would've already been doing other things.

259
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,920
What other things?

260
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,280
For example, pretending to be good in front of mom,

261
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,460
but doing everything I want elsewhere.

262
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,020
When you say "I grew up well",

263
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,300
you mean I'm a decent person, right?

264
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,690
Ah... sure.

265
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,110
Then...

266
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,380
How am I as a woman?

267
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,500
Am I decent as a woman as well?

268
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,390
Anyone like you should be considered fine.

269
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59,290
All seem to have a lovable side to them,

270
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,060
the women do.

271
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,440
Please take your time eating.  No one's going to take it.

272
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,160
I get hungry after practicing.

273
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,960
No matter how hungry you become...

274
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,680
Eh, lookie.  Look at the way she goes at it.  What kind of girl...

275
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,810
Wah?  Ms. Choi Chun Hee!

276
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,660
 Why that guy again! 

277
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,130
I'm glad.

278
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,070
Let's share a table amongst people from the same company, shall we?

279
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,940
What kind of Naengmyeon will you have?
 (Naeng = cold, myeon = noodle, Casual Korean summer dish)

280
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,890
I'll take the Water Naengmyeon.

281
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,680
Ah, Water Naengmyeon?

282
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,340
- Excuse me, Miss!
- Yes?

283
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,570
2 Water Naengmyeon please.

284
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,610
Miss my butt...

285
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,350
Have you come to work to practice even today?

286
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,760
Is your condition any better?

287
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,660
Yes, I'm fine.

288
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,890
I bet you're tired because of me.

289
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:58,640
Nah... well I almost broke my back running with you on my back.

290
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,320
You  made a definite impact.

291
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,310
Ah... well...

292
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,710
What on earth?

293
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:15,770
Hey, why are you putting on a new act?  
Eat by the scoopful like earlier!

294
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,980
Ah, by the way, what happened with the cabinet door
above the sink?  It seemed dangerous.

295
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,150
A cabinet door above the sink?

296
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:24,740
Well I stopped by Ms. Choi Chun Hee's house for a moment.

297
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:29,390
That's just fine now.

298
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,660
Gee, why all the interest in other people's housekeeping?!

299
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,110
That  , I fi... OUCH!

300
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,790
I fixed it.

301
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,690
Oh, thank you.

302
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,620
Are you okay?

303
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,760
Yes, I'm fine.

304
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,610
I can just as easily take a cab...

305
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,580
I'll have to take responsibility for you today.

306
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,120
What is that?

307
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,350
A present for the little Miss.

308
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,810
Gosh, thank you...

309
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,980
What is this childish thing?

310
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,510
Byeol's standard has been raised

311
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,740
while living with me these day.  Don't bother.

312
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,830
Why?  It looks pretty to me.

313
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,110
It doesn't suit you.  Don't wear it!

314
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,530
What are you doing?

315
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,190
Did you hurt yourself?

316
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,150
You spilled my Nang Myeon soup earlier.

317
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:01,560
Not a day goes by without an incident.  Let me have a look.

318
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,790
Does it hurt a lot?

319
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,720
By the way, did you wash your hands after using the restroom?

320
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,500
You... unbelievable.

321
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,480
Why?

322
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,810
Are you doubting if my hands are clean?

323
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,600
Did I say they were dirty?

324
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,290
What kind of person gets so extreme?

325
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,260
How is that extreme?  What you said is what I said.

326
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,110
Come to think of it

327
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,250
that's why you didn't take the napkin I offered, isn't it?

328
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,710
Because my hands were dirty, you took the one
 the President offered.  Isn't that right?

329
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,660
Talk some sense, shall we?

330
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,440
And you were shoving food in your mouth before the President
arrived, then once he came,

331
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,060
you started to eat like this.

332
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:37,890
Do you maybe... like... the President?

333
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,210
Listen to you!

334
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,090
You're talking nonsense for a while now.

335
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,460
Wake up.  Do you think the President is interested in you?

336
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,360
Can't you tell at a glance?

337
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,800
That guy's montage (profile) is a total psychopath.

338
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,390
Look at the way his eyes are so shifty.

339
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,810
It seemed fine to me.

340
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,730
Hey you all!

341
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,850
Doing alright?

342
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,650
 What are they doing here again... 

343
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,110
First, a round of applause.

344
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,600
Invitation to the fan-club inaugural ceremony

345
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,670
for our superstar Ms. Choi Chun Hee!

346
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,930
 Oh my god. 

347
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,550
Congratulations.

348
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,270
Congratulations.

349
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,960
So what if it's being held at a blood sausage soup restaurant?

350
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,150
Hey, even if the number is miniscule, it's still called a fan-club.

351
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,570
I've never heard anyone having a fan-club meeting
 at a blood sausage soup restaurant.

352
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,580
Will there be a fan-club inaugural party for Ms. Choi Chun Hee?

353
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,350
Oh hello, President.

354
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,740
Uh, it's today.

355
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,690
Why didn't you mention when you had such a good news as this?

356
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,690
Why?  If she said something the company would fund it or something?

357
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,980
Of course.

358
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,810
The meals will be funded by the company.

359
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:43,920
As a reward for such a deed, I can come too?

360
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,890
- You would?
- I'll see you later.

361
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,140
Okay.

362
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,490
That President  ... doesn't know 
when to join and when to bow out.

363
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,930
 Park Soo In, you better give Choi Chun Hee's trophy back soon! 

364
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:06,070
 Park Soo In, your house looked luxurious.  
Did you buy the trophy with your money? 

365
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,560
How can they even come to my house?

366
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,050
Hello?

367
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,910
President, please help me.

368
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,500
I think there's someone at my house.

369
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,780
What?

370
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,120
 I can't get in touch with my manager or Mom. 

371
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,530
I'm really afraid.

372
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,010
- Goodness.  Welcome!
 Choi Chun Hee Fan Club Inauguration Ceremony. 

373
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,430
Madam, it's right this way.

374
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,730
Go right on ahead inside.

375
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,510
I'm going crazy.

376
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,220
Since today's the Choi Chun Hee's inauguration day
Joon Hyeon will be here too, right?

377
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,470
That's right.  That's right.  On a day like today,
he would take it easy.

378
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,450
Looking at Joon Hyeon, "Hey, Joon Hyeon,
until your anger melts away, beat me."

379
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:02,590
No, no wait a minute.  I think he might really take a swing at me.
What do I do?!

380
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,820
Shall I come tomorrow?  
Shall I come next time?

381
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,650
Oh my gosh, you scared me.  Who ... Who ... Who are you?

382
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,870
You are Ms. Choi Chun Hee's fan, right?

383
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,560
Come in and have a meal, okay?

384
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,700
Here, come in here 
and eat some soondae soup, double portion!

385
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,230
Well... that's not what I...

386
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:21,520
What's not it.  Once you come in, you become a fan, of course.

387
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,060
It is so, isn't it, friend?

388
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,790
Yes, it is.

389
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,750
Eat up.

390
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,490
Uh, we have a young one.

391
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,550
I'm so glad she is getting a broad range of fans.

392
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,250
Nice to meet you.

393
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:38,460
Work hard for the fan club as a young man.  Okay?

394
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,920
Let's have a good looking person hold this.

395
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,570
You look good.

396
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:46,500
Are these balloons going to be enough? 
Give me that for a moment.

397
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:04,700
♫ It's hotter than a pepper, hotter. ♫

398
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:10,870
Hello, I'm a newly debuted singer Choi Chun Hee.
Nice to meet everyone!

399
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,380
 Choi Chun Hee! 

400
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,430
Ms. Park Soo In.

401
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,660
Ms. Park Soo In.

402
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,710
President!

403
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,320
It's okay.  Calm down.

404
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,760
What happened?

405
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,490
I'm not sure.

406
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,300
I came home after my practice session.

407
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,800
There's been some scary comments to my site
for the past few days.

408
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,560
What do I do now?

409
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,030
I'm so scared.

410
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,510
I can't even sing because I'm scared.

411
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,380
Don't worry.

412
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,620
Yes.

413
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,720
I would like to submit an incident report.

414
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,320
Thank you.  Take care.

415
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,660
- Receive Daebak!  (I hope you hit it big time!)
- Thank you!

416
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,770
Thank you.  Take care.

417
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,040
The President isn't coming.

418
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,280
What?

419
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,200
They just say that.

420
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,730
Why would he come here? What's so special about you?

421
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,620
I'm not waiting for the President.

422
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,950
Tae Song?

423
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,290
Is it Tae Song?

424
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,970
- Joon Hyeon.
 - It is you.

425
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,300
Yes. It is me, Tae Song.

426
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,060
Joon Hyeon, I missed you.

427
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,710
You missed me too, right?

428
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:11,190
Sure you did, you son of a b*tch.

429
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:14,310
Hey!

430
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,930
I'm going to kill that betrayer.

431
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,520
Let me go!

432
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,430
Let me go!

433
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,400
Right.

434
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,650
What would I do after hitting you?

435
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:29,800
My hands would get dirty. Don't ever get onto my sight, you betrayer.

436
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,570
Why is he like this?

437
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,420
Joon Hyeon...

438
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:38,440
- Why is he like that? 
 - Joon Hyeon...

439
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,390
Don't be upset,

440
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,450
And take this.

441
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,780
I will take care of it, so feel better.

442
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,570
Don't be upset!

443
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,820
Can you stay with me for a little longer?

444
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,300
I will.

445
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,600
Soo In, Mom is here.

446
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,000
What is all this?

447
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,830
What happened?

448
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:29,630
- Soo In, are you okay? 
- I'm okay.

449
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,990
I think that this was done by some online haters.

450
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,490
The police just left, so they will be caught soon.

451
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,820
Online haters even came to the house?

452
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:43,190
But how are you here?

453
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,120
I contacted him.

454
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,310
I couldn't contact you.

455
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,790
Since you came, I'll leave now.

456
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,320
Because of me, you had to...

457
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,610
Don't think about anything today, and just sleep.

458
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,320
Then,

459
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:10,610
 Choi Chun Hee's fan club - La Traviata Chun Hee Love 

460
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,780
Be careful.

461
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,900
Oh, you came?

462
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,050
I am too late, right?

463
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,550
No, it's fine.

464
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,590
I told you to be careful.

465
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,420
Hey, do it right.

466
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,220
I have nothing to give to you,

467
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,190
Do you want a cup of coffee?

468
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,300
Hey, where are you going? You should leave after finishing this.

469
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,540
President,

470
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,210
you must be not very busy. You even came to places like this.

471
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:06,960
If you wanted to come, you should have come on time. What's with coming after it's over?

472
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,450
Jang Joon Hyeon,

473
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,320
do you like Choi Chun Hee?

474
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,740
What?

475
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,350
What nonsense are you speaking?

476
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:28,120
Of all the women, you are trying to match me with that kind of girl! Excuse me!

477
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,570
Once upon a time, I was 
" the boyfriend of 40 million girls ".

478
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:33,050
If that's not the case, it's better for me.

479
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,710
What?

480
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:37,310
"If that's not true, it's better for me?"

481
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,000
What kind of crazy man is he?

482
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:56,850


483
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,020
 Congratulations on Choi Chun Hee Fan Club's Inauguration Ceremony  

484
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,100
Have some coffee.

485
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,880
Hot and spicy, her rich voice!

486
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,680
You are quite popular.

487
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,870
What popularity?

488
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,420
Wow, presents and fan letters,

489
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,630
Wow.

490
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,080
She is popular.

491
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,420
There were a lot of people. But who are you?

492
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,250
This is the President of my company.

493
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,340
Hello.

494
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,210
Hello.

495
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,250
Hello?

496
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,280
He's sexy.

497
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,120
Really... You're silly.

498
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,960
Where are you staying nowadays?

499
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,080
Are you living together with your first love?

500
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,790
You don't have to know that.

501
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,160
Finally, it's time.

502
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,660
What?

503
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,160
Let Choi Chun Hee release an album.

504
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,950
Already?

505
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,780
If we were to make a trot album, we need new staff.

506
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,690
Jang Joon Hyeon has no trot experience.

507
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:07,360
Obviously, it can't be done with only Jang Joon Hyeon.

508
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,390
Album?

509
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:14,110
So I'm going to make a remake album?

510
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:17,260
But there is a condition. 
The arrangement of the songs

511
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,890
must be done by Composer Go Eun Tae.

512
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,930
We can do that. Is that hard?

513
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,340
You are being overconfident. Again! Again! Again!

514
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,600
Here, here. You two should go meet Go Eun Tae now.

515
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,680
Thank you.

516
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:41,330
You should get your guitar back when your album is successful.

517
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,950
I will get it back soon.

518
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:46,020
Hey, isn't that your guitar?

519
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,010
Why is that there?

520
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,920
You didn't know?

521
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,790
When we were making the contract with you, Jang Joon Hyeon put that in my care.

522
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:01,760
Jang Joon Hyeon acted all cool.  He didn't even tell you.

523
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,760
Work hard.

524
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,150
Hey, what is he talking about? Why would you put your guitar under  the President's care?

525
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,660
You cherished that.

526
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,220
What can I do? We needed money for you to sign a contract.

527
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,630
I didn't sell it completely. I will get it back soon.

528
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:29,010
Young lady, why do you sing trot?

529
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:35,790
In the beginning, I started because of my family.

530
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:40,880
But now, I'm doing it because people said that they feel better after listening to me.

531
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,740
Since people like it, I like it too.

532
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:48,630
You sing trot for other people's happiness?

533
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,730
Then after listening to your song,

534
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:55,140
my wife would become happy too.

535
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,560
What?

536
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:06,880
My wife never smiled after getting dementia.

537
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,110
My wife really liked trot.

538
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,870
Well then.

539
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:17,800
If your singing trot can make my wife smile,

540
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,440
I will do what you ask.

541
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,130
I will give you 24 hours.

542
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,430
Do you want to give it a try?

543
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,790
If I just do that, are you really going to remake the songs?

544
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:33,880
♬  You will become my tree. ♬

545
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,790
♬  Nila, illa illa illaya ♬

546
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:42,400
♬  I will become your flower. ♬

547
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,100
Mother, you don't like this song?

548
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,050
♬  Katoori (hen pheasant)! ♬

549
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:52,320
♬  Katoori, katoori, katoori, katoori, We are going to hunt katoori. ♬

550
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,900
♬ We're going out for pheasant hunting in Jiri mountain or Jeolla-do. ♬

551
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,180
♬ A katoori fluttered and the bell on the hawk's tail rang. ♬

552
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:06,070
♬  Hu-yuh hu-yuh uh-huh
 We are going to hunt Katoori. Hu-yuh! ♬

553
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:12,480
Mother, you don't like the songs which I am singing?

554
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,130
What song should I sing?

555
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:22,690
Hey, what if I can't succeed even tomorrow?

556
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:26,160
The album and everything else is going to go away.

557
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,830
But isn't that guy a pervert?

558
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,590
Make his wife laugh?

559
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:32,180
What kind of a ridiculous wish is that?

560
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:36,270
Why? I think that I understand Composer Go Eun Tae.

561
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,270
What?

562
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:42,500
If my family member is sick like that,

563
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,090
I will feel sad.

564
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:49,320
He would miss looking at his wife laugh.

565
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:58,520
But you don't have a family?

566
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,090
My mom is in America,

567
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,860
but I don't usually talk to her.

568
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:11,720
Hey, you should call her often.

569
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,430
I can't even call my mom even if I want to.

570
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:19,800
 This is the story that number 3852 sent.  

571
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,390
 I have two daughters.  

572
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:26,270
 I saw my daughter sing on the tv.  

573
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:30,050
 I have something to say to my daughters as a father,  

574
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,990
 So I sent this story.  

575
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,730
 Daughters, I'm living well,  

576
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:37,600
 so don't worry and live well.  

577
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,740
 I love you, my daughters.  

578
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,690
  Number 3852 requested this song.  

579
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:46,620
 Oh Seong Ju's Red Pepper.  

580
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,470
Red pepper?

581
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,820
Why are you like this?

582
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,520
This is my mother's song.

583
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,250
This?

584
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:16,460
My father must have seen me on tv.

585
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,000
That's a relief.

586
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,270
 ♬ If I'm with you, whom I love, ♬  

587
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:31,670
 ♬ A hundred years, or a thousand years, ♬  

588
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:37,040
 ♬  I would live with you. ♬  

589
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,540
 ♬  Living in this world, living my life, ♬  

590
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:47,830
 ♬  is hotter than red pepper. ♬   

591
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:52,660
Really? Dad sent a story to the radio?

592
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,710
Yes, he said that he saw me sing on tv.

593
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:01,180
Unni, I miss Dad.

594
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,200
Me too.

595
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,880
Aigoo, Byeol.

596
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,760
Since dad is watching us, let's just work hard a little longer.

597
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,830
You should sing on TV often.

598
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,890
That's the only way dad can see you.

599
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,940
I will try harder,

600
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,490
So for now, let's sleep.

601
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,000
Do you want me to sing to you?

602
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,730
♬ On a green meadow ♬

603
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:41,030
♬ with you, whom I love, ♬

604
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:55,470
 The person you called can't be reached... 

605
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:59,310
That's right. My mother...

606
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,690
- Mom? 
 - Hi, son! 

607
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:13,210
I'm here to eat brunch.

608
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,870
Okay.

609
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:18,850
California has an amazing weather.

610
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:21,420
I want to show it to you.

611
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,740
Honey.

612
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,840
Son, I am going to try to have a kid.

613
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,420
I want a baby that just looks like my David.

614
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,860
I must be getting old.

615
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:39,610
What do you think? Isn't it a good idea?

616
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:44,560
You didn't call me to tell me something, right?

617
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,390
You called because you were worried about me, right?

618
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:50,890
- Yes. 
 - Son, thank you. 

619
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:52,700
Son.

620
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,880
I only trust you. You know that, right?

621
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,950
Yes, Mother.

622
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:10,230
♬ In spring we plant. ♬

623
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:14,040
♬ In summer, the flowers bloom. ♬

624
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:20,260
♬ In fall we harvest. ♬

625
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,010
 ♬ In winter we're happy. ♬ 

626
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:30,520
♬ Although one brags about a trendy high-rise ♬

627
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,560
♬ Although following the trend in living too may be one's ♬

628
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:40,180
♬ If I live in a glowing thatched cottage together with my darling. ♬

629
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:57,270
Good night, Byeol.

630
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:15,550
Hello, Mother.

631
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:17,770
Did something good happen?

632
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:20,270
Your skin looks whiter today.

633
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,350
You look pretty.

634
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:26,960
Something good happened to me.

635
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,060
My father said that he saw me sing on tv.

636
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:37,000
By thinking that my father is watching over me somewhere,

637
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,330
I feel stronger.

638
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,140
Aigoo.

639
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:51,410
Mother, the song that I'm going to sing to you today,

640
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:56,030
makes me think about my parents.

641
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:00,590
I hope that you smile with your heart after listening to this.

642
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,670
♬ I remember. ♬

643
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:11,010
♬ When the persimmon grows, ♬

644
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:16,200
♬ I remember my mother. ♬

645
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:24,300
♬ Instead of a lullaby, my mother, who breastfed me, ♬

646
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:29,280
♬ I remember my mother. ♬

647
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:36,200
 ♬ When it snowed, she was careful to not let me get snow. ♬ 

648
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:42,220
 ♬ When it rained, she was careful to not get me wet, ♬ 

649
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,750
 ♬ Worrying about me if I tumble in this hard world. ♬ 

650
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:54,950
♬ Worrying about me if I'm in pain because of love. ♬

651
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,810
♬ I miss her. ♬

652
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:03,140
♬ When persimmon grows. ♬

653
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:08,470
♬ I miss my mother. ♬

654
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:13,190
♬ Even if she put me in her eyes, ♬

655
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:16,500
♬ She said that it wouldn't hurt. ♬ 
 (A Korean expression for loving one's own child)  

656
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:21,820
♬ I miss my mother. ♬

657
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:31,010
Then we'll leave now.

658
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,440
I couldn't do what you wanted,

659
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,000
but I think that I learned a lot.

660
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,180
Thank you, Teacher.

661
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:44,420
And also,

662
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:47,070
what you asked me before,

663
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,780
can I answer that again?

664
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,710
I said that I sang trot to make others happy before,

665
00:46:55,710 --> 00:47:00,800
but I think that I'm singing trot to make myself happy.

666
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:06,000
People who are listening to my songs will become happy only if I'm happy.

667
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:09,580
Then I'll be really leaving now.

668
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,880
Bye.

669
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,280
The album or anything else  already passed by.

670
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,430
There will be  another opportunity.

671
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:36,900
Honey, let's go in now.

672
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,910
♬ I remember. ♬

673
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:44,290
♬ When persimmon grows... ♬

674
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:47,540
♬ I remember my mother. ♬

675
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,140
Honey,

676
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,210
I remember my mother, who passed away.

677
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:16,980
It wasn't as easy as you thought, right?

678
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,560
Yes. I tried my best

679
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,030
but it wasn't easy.

680
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:23,140
Didn't you ask us even if you knew that it wouldn't be possible?

681
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,930
Hey!

682
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:27,490
Let's get ready for the album.

683
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,700
Composer Go Eun Tae called me.

684
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,210
He said that he will remake the songs as quickly as possible.

685
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,100
What?

686
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,720
The kids nowadays are fast.

687
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,210
She found out the answer that took me my whole life to find out in two days.

688
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:49,000
She is Seong Ju's daughter.

689
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:56,550
♬ The eyes that are looking at each other. ♬

690
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:59,680
♬ What do they tell me? ♬

691
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,650
Stop!

692
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,410
Stop using techniques.

693
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:07,460
Sing honestly with your voice.

694
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:12,250
♬ That you love me, that you like me ♬

695
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,860
-  ♬ Can you tell... ♬ 
- Stop.

696
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:17,470
Sing the "That you love me, that you like me" part differently.

697
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:23,010
♬ That you love me, that you like me, ♬

698
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:38,100
She worked hard.

699
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:41,150
 Jang Joon Hyeon, you as*hole. 

700
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,590
 Bah! It is! 

701
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:44,820
 Aioh, I just... 

702
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,530
The CD came out.

703
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,190
Is this really my CD?

704
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,770
Daebak! This is really mine?

705
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:15,460
How can you be happy with just a single album?

706
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,920
This is daebak!

707
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,450
Aren't you happy?

708
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,630
Look at this. It went up.

709
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:53,560
In the end, you went there.

710
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,320
Are you alright?

711
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:12,170
Yes.

712
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:15,020
Ah you, you're that young pretty fan of Chun Hee?

713
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,390
Yes.

714
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:22,240
The truth is, I did something unforgivable 
to Joon Hyeon.

715
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,140
You did apologize, but your apology was not accepted?

716
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,440
It's not just that it wasn't accepted, 
but he didn't even want to meet me.

717
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,090
I'm really getting crazy, really.

718
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:29,450
What do you need in times like this?

719
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:30,780
Speed?
(Ref: XPEED advertisement)

720
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,020
Patience.

721
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:36,410
Apologize, apologize, and then apologize again.
Until you're forgiven.

722
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:42,590
Well... that's why I'm saying

723
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:44,920
I looked over there, and it looked like you're hiring a part-time worker.

724
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,660
If I work part-time right here,

725
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,110
I can apologize, apologize and apologize again 
whenever Joon Hyeon comes.

726
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:51,790
Can't I try that?

727
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,480
 This is the address of that 

728
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,110
 Choi Myeong Sik you talked about. 

729
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,110
Isn't that Choi Chun Hee?

730
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:23,780
But why does she come out of Myeong Sik Oppa's place?

731
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,140
- Hello, Executive Director.
- Where are you right now?

732
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,620
Have you perhaps gone to Choi Myeong Siks house?

733
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,870
Yes, I am in front of his house now.

734
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:35,280
Please don't go in.

735
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,840
Huh? Why?

736
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,310
Is there some issue?

737
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:42,750
Choi Myeong Sik's daughter is Choi Chun Hee.

738
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,800
Choi Chun Hee.

739
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,930
You are Seong Ju's daughter?

740
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,410
What are you doing right now?

741
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:18,140
I know you feel bad and have a hard time because of online haters, but just ignore their malicious comments!

742
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:21,970
There's no way you'll succeed as a singer 
if you mind such things.

743
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:24,370
Choi Chun Hee, that girl,

744
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,400
I hate her so much, Mom!

745
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,550
Are you crying?

746
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:36,460
Are you crying because of that kid right now?

747
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:41,510
During the time I took to come until here, 
I've seen so many girls like Choi Chun Hee.

748
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,280
But now,

749
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,540
I, Yang Ju Hee, survived alone.

750
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:50,240
Get yourself together Park Soo In! 
If you are innocent like this,

751
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,150
you won't be able to survive in a venue like this!

752
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:02,260
Director Yang, what is the issue?

753
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,280
I dropped by on my way.

754
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,290
Kim P.D., can I ask you for a favor?

755
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:13,950
Let's go there.

756
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,350
Yes.

757
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:18,320
Hello. She is a new singer, Choi Chun Hee.

758
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,390
My service to you.

759
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,740
 Choi Chun Hee - Trot Remade
single album 

760
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,250
- Hello.
- Hello. I'm a new singer, Choi Chun Hee.

761
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:27,380
My service to you.

762
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:28,730
Thank you for listening to the music.

763
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:30,980
Please listen a lot.

764
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:34,490
We are White Capital, working together with the trot singer Choi Chun Hee.

765
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:37,950
No!

766
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:43,260
- Hello. 
 - Hello. I'm a new singer, Choi Chun Hee.

767
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:44,530
My service to you.

768
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:46,560
My service to you.

769
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:56,180
Isn't it fascinating to see your own album?

770
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:58,320
Yes.

771
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,730
Are you the singer from this CD?

772
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:05,750
- Yes.
- Oh? You are!

773
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:08,230
Wow!

774
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:09,450
You are a singer?

775
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,560
Then sing us a song.

776
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,400
If it's good who knows, we might buy a CD.

777
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,650
Yes, great! Sing a song for us.

778
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:23,900
Then I will pick one song.

779
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,540
♬ Our eyes that met each other ♬

780
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:31,890
♬ Could it have been a coincidence? ♬

781
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:35,870
♬ I don't know yet. I really don't know. ♬

782
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:38,740
♬ My heart is fluttering. ♬

783
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:44,210
♬ This is what love must be ♬

784
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,540
Thank you.

785
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,120
Ahjussi, please give me a CD.

786
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,160
Yes.

787
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,290
Me too.

788
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:53,930
Me too. 
 - Boss, 5 CDs here! Give me five!

789
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:55,760
Hello.

790
00:55:57,310 --> 00:56:01,200
Ah, Kim P.D., what's the issue?

791
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:03,840
Yes.

792
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,610
Hello, Director.

793
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:12,010
What brings you here, Choi Chun Hee?

794
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:15,430
I heard that you recommended me 
to a music broadcasting show.

795
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:17,700
I came here to thank you.

796
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,120
Thank you Director.

797
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,730
Why thank you.

798
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:25,290
This is something I should do as someone from Shine Star.

799
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:28,030
In any case, it's a good opportunity for you.

800
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:29,760
Please make sure to use it.

801
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,880
As it's a live broadcast, 
please be on time.

802
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,130
Yes, I will pay attention.

803
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:36,350
Then I will leave now.

804
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:38,520
Work hard.

805
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,320
Yes, this is from a new singer, Choi Chun Hee.

806
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,370
Yes.

807
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:50,540

You were the new trot singer

Aigoo, look at this CD.

You must have a lot of spare money these days. 
Anybody who wants is releasing albums.

00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:34,440
A sunbae is calling.

821
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,230
Where did you learn those manners, huh?

822
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,720
I'll go.

823
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:51,710
Get a scolding. Right.

824
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:53,930
I'm sorry, Sunbae.

825
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:12,940
Oh my, I spilled it.  Hoobae, clean it.

826
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:32,400
Don't. Prepare for the stage.

827
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:45,890
Right, this is something a manager should do, very good.

828
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:49,520
Aigoo, really. Here as well. Here.

829
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,440
Here, clean it.

830
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,250
This guy, really.

00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,740
Jang Joon Hyeon.

832
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:02,740
Hey, why are you hesitating? Hit me Jang Joon Hyeon.

833
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:06,730

You will stand there as a singer.

841
00:59:56,010 --> 01:00:00,090
Your song, nobody can sing it well like you.

842
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:05,580
Let's go up and kill them all.

843
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,690
Choi Chun Hee's manager, come here for a moment please.

844
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:14,610
Yes. One moment please.

845
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:29,830
 Your father is with us right now. Know that if you don't come right now, you might never see your fathers face again! 

846
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:33,950

848
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:56,500
 ♬ Why did you just make me leave ♬ 

849
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:02,550
 ♬ If I knew that I'd regret it like this ♬ 

850
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:06,520
 ♬ In a painful hardship ♬ 

851
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:12,000
 ♬ I wouldn't have wandered ♬
