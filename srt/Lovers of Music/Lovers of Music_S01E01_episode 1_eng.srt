 Episode 1 
Choi Chun Hee! Choi Chun Hee!

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,890
Choi Chun Hee! Choi Chun Hee!

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,400
Athlete Choi Chun Hee has turned the game around!

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,400
Stop! Choi Chun Hee, stop right there!

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,300


7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,800
 ♬ On a green meadow ♬ 

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,100
 ♬ in a house we build pretty as a picture ♬ 

9
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,500
 ♬ I want us to be loving ♬ 

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,800
♬ and living. ♬

11
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,890
Didn't you hear me say to empty your locker?

12
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,600
Why are you ignoring other people to such an extent?

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,400
Coach.

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,890
Now go, if you don't want to be embarassed in front of your juniors.

15
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,300
I know I'm lacking. That's why I'm going to work even harder.

16
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,900
You said that there is no failure if you work hard.

17
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,300
So I'll give it my all.

18
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,800
Don't try. Don't give it your all!

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,500
You still don't know what your problem is?

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,700
You don't know how to stop when you need to. People like you shouldn't run a marathon.

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,300
Giving up also takes courage. Stop being a nuisance to others, and...

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,600
Go.

23
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,600
 Choi Chun Hee 

24
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:22,000
 4 years later
Seoul Half-Marathon Day 

25
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,220
Yes, don't overexert yourself.

26
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,370
Coming in first doesn't mean you become a member of the national team, so pace yourself well.

27
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,720
And the salt I'm passing out now,

28
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,380
when you feel like your strength has decreased,

29
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,720
consume it little by little.

30
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,000
And the most important thing is safety. Second most important thing is also safety. Everyone understand?

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,470
-Yes. 
- Ok everyone, fighting!

32
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,030
No, I don't want to. I'd rather die.

33
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,970
Why why can't you do it? Because of what?

34
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,870
I'm an artist.

35
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,790
I told you an artist is supposed to express himself through music.

36
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,440
Appearing in variety shows and doing other stuff 
than music itself,

37
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,230
aren't those guys lacking in confidence in music?

38
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,190
Yea. You're right. But isn't it a waste to see your macho image by ourselves?

39
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,600
That's why I scheduled the marathon.

40
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,030
- Macho image?
- Yeah, that's right.

41
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,230
Hey, think about it. When girls see you run, they'll die. It'll all be over.

42
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,060
Ah, the weather is so hot. I really hate running.

43
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,520
He's here!

44
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,170
Gum.

45
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,650
Hey Joon Hyeon, relax your face muscles.

46
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,440
Smile!

47
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,050
Aigoo, run slowly! Aiyoo.

48
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,850
I need to get that medal.

49
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,750
Aiyoo, what's so important about the medal you get when you complete the marathon?

50
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,530
I promised my kid though.

51
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,890
Wait a minute, I need to get that medal.

52
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,140
I need to get it though...

53
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,320
Please take good care of him.

54
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,720
Ah, don't.

55
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,340
Ah, really.

56
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,010
Uh huh.

57
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,530
That's why you should've paced yourself well. Why did you overdo it?

58
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,730
I should be giving my child a medal.

59
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,180
Oh, what to do?

60
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,920
Jang Joon Hyeon, how does it feel to complete the marathon?

61
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,650
Really, I wanted to give up multiple times,

62
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,460
but,

63
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,370
because my fans were here, I was able to do it.

64
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,320
Whether it's the medal or the music,

65
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,030
it's bursting with cheapness.

66
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,490
♬ That girl I know  ♬

67
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,980
♬  She's whimsical and clumsy  ♬

68
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,070
You came fast.

69
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,840
 

70
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,020
Ah, these sasaengs (stalker fans who invade privacy).

71
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,190
Hello. Give me your pen.

72
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,720
Oh, well.

73
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,450
You don't have paper either?

74
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,180
Oppa will sign with Oppa's pen.

75
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,550
Where should we put it?

76
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,350
Here.

77
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,940
What?

78
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,460
What are you?

79
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,160
Please return the medal. The medal that you received for finishing the marathon.

80
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,740
I saw everything, how you came out of the car.

81
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,830
And how you changed with someone with the exact same clothes as you.

82
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,830
No, that...

83
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,250
It's already all finished.

84
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,090
So what I'm trying to say is that I don't understand a word you're saying right now, but

85
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,720
since you're insisting like this, say that I concede that it's true.

86
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,070
Even so,

87
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,860
in the end, you are doing this because of the medal for finishing.

88
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,240
I don't think receiving a medal when you didn't even run is fair.

89
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,380
That why you need to give it to me, I'll return it.

90
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,050
Stop, stop here.

91
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,710
You seem to have misunderstood some things.

92
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,360
It's just a medal for finishing.

93
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,260
It's neither a gold nor a bronze medal.

94
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,940
Good luck.

95
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,020
That's why, please return the medal that is neither a gold nor a bronze medal.

96
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,200
Ah, seriously, you make me repeat the same thing over and over.

97
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,780
Give it to me, now.

98
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,100
Give it to me while I'm asking nicely, and leave.

99
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,450
You're really funny.

100
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,190
It's just a piece of metal. Fine, I'll give it to you.

101
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,430
This, right?

102
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,370
What? Is she crazy?

103
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,720
Uhh? What the heck?

104
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,000
You're dead now.

105
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,380
Hey!

106
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,240
Oh, where are you going?

107
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,610
Joon Hyeon-ah, why are you doing this?

108
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,480
Aish!

109
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,380
If you can, try and follow me.

110
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,640
Oh!

111
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,010
 You're dead. 

112
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,990
She's really crazy.

113
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,560
Okay.

114
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,280
You can have it, here. I was going to throw it away anyway because it was so tacky.

115
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,860
- Over this crappy marathon medal...
- Hey!

116
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,790
Do you think a marathon is a joke? 
 (in informal speech) 

117
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,700
 "Hey, you"? 

118
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,350
Did you just speak informally to me?

119
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,990
Yes, you. Do you know what finishing a marathon means?

120
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,150
Finishing a marathon

121
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,960
is overcoming the 'dead point'. And overcoming the dead point

122
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,160
means you're overcoming death.

123
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,150
Only the people who have endured the torturous pains of death

124
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,430
can hang that completion medal around their neck. But what?

125
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,380
This crappy marathon medal?

126
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,700
 What is she talking about? 

127
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,600
Hey!

128
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,970
Hey!

129
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,610
If you leave me behind, what am I supposed to do?

130
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,230
I saw everything while I was helping one of my gym members get in the ambulance.

131
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,250
That guy got off the car with his hat on.

132
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,100
He even got the water sprayed on his face to pretend he was sweating.

133
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,070
Oh, That's right. You sprayed it, right?

134
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,470
Ah, I told you not to spray the water.

135
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,680
Ah...

136
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,890
 Window, window. 

137
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,750
Well, I know very well what you are saying.

138
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,480
Today's event has a good meaning and we came with a good will.

139
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,250
We're sorry. It's 100% our fault, 100%. Can you please overlook it just this once?

140
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,640
It's not for our sake,

141
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,270
but for those children of families without parents.

142
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,320
This is

143
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,220
my business card.

144
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,280
We've worked hard. Cheers!

145
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,530
 Lax Sports Center Marathon Club 

146
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,160
Ah, I thought I was going to die.

147
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,520
I heard you were once a marathon runner.

148
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,750
But why did you quit (running) marathons?

149
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,330
Do you have a story behind it?

150
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,520
I, Choi Chun Hee, will sing a song.

151
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,990
♬ In a green meadow ♬

152
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,510
♬ In a house we will build as pretty as a picture ♬

153
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:10,380
♬ I want to love  and live. ♬

154
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,580
♬ In the green meadow ♬

155
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,680
♬ I want to love ♬

156
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,950
♬ and live. ♬

157
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:29,030
♬ Although one brags about a trendy high-rise ♬

158
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:34,390
♬ Although following the trend in living too may be one's style ♬

159
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:39,030
♬ I like it, I like it, if it's together with my darling. ♬

160
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,760
♬ If I live together with my darling. ♬

161
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,860
Choi Chun Hee, you have worked hard again today.

162
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,070
It's me.

163
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,410
Unni!

164
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,460
Oh, you're here.

165
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,930
Have you had dinner?

166
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,280
I ate.

167
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,650
Hey, hey, hey... Wait, wait!

168
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,890
Eat it without the spinach.

169
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,210
Just in case.

170
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,540
Hey, Chun Hee. Since you're here, watch the store.

171
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,320
Just close the store and do whatever you need to do.

172
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,670
Hey.

173
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,450
- We might have to shut it down permanently then.
- We'll shut it down then.

174
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,980
You! Do you have 40 million won? 
 (about US$40,000) 

175
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,060
If I had the money for the penalty,

176
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,190
I'd quit this right away!

177
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,820
Aigoo.

178
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,210
I can't even sleep with my back stretched out.

179
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,540
- Does it hurt a lot?
- Yes...

180
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,720
Since the weather's been humid,

181
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,060
I feel pains in the sinews and joints.

182
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,450
If I go to the sauna once, I feel like my body will be cured.

183
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,520
What do you want me to do? I have to work at the gym today.

184
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,560
It's a night shift.

185
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,590
What did I tell you?

186
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,190
I told you not to apply to the places open for 24 hours.

187
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,850
In any case, you always do whatever you want.

188
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,750
If I do whatever I want, then what about you?

189
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,540
Have you once consulted with me before you got yourself in debt?

190
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,770
Every time you had a false hope, Mom and I had to clean up the mess you made.

191
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,850
- Am I not right? 
-That, that, that temper of yours.

192
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,790
You look exactly alike, but how can your personalities be so different?

193
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,860
What if I take after Mom? I'll end up meeting someone like you, Dad?

194
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,270
We're leaving.

195
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,400
You're leaving?

196
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,840
Give me that. I will wash it.

197
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,420
It's still fine, though.

198
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,230
You're in sales, what is it with an apron in that condition?

199
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,450
Hurry and give it.

200
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,060
And what's with your clothes?

201
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,050
We're leaving.

202
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,260
Daddy, bye.

203
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,420
Okay, go.

204
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:14,090

209
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,590
- Up to here.
- Wow.

210
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,150
Our Joon Hyeon really must be a genius.

211
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,620
How can you write such a beautiful song like this so fast?

212
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,330
Ah, what do you mean a genius? I'm a god of music.

213
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,170
He's very honest.

214
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:57,900
Truthfully, being exceptional and superior and such, we need to acknowledge it. People in our country can't do that well.

215
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,460
Whenever they get the chance, they just bite and find faults. Right?

216
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,310
Isn't he taking it too far?

217
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,190
We're in trouble, our Joon Hyeon is so honest. Right.

218
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,480
Okay, this is a realtime story. Why don't we listen to it?

219
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,360
 Not long ago, I participated in the half marathon for young children who are the head of households. 

220
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,160
Joon Hyeon, you also participated in that, right?

221
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,050
Yes, I also completed the run.

222
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,000
 Everyone was running with all their might, 

223
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,160
 but wow, there were also people who cheated. 

224
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,540
Cheat? Can you cheat in a marathon?

225
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,220
 While other people were running, that person alone took a break in the car, 

226
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,000
 and then came out right before the finish line. 

227
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,990
 The person even received the medal as if he finished the marathon. 

228
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,950
Wow, a shameless person like that exists?

229
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,690
 On top of that, when I told him to return the medal, 

230
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,130
 he refused, and instead became angry with me. 

231
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,260
 There are always people like this. 

232
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,330
 But, this despicable man 

233
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:58,450
 is someone you all know.
 - Really? Who  is it?

234
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,830
 In any case, we're getting curious. 

235
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,360
What is this? Are there no more updates on the story?

236
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,450
Well, it looks like this person is busy right now. They have their reasons.

237
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,330
Ah, that's not it. The realtime story seemed to have ended here.

238
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:21,640
Okay. This person... We'll try connecting the call again.

239
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,550
Piano, piano.

240
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,450
- What?
- Tell them you're going to play the piano and sing.

241
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,550
 What? 

242
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,520
Tell them you're going to play the piano and sing.

243
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,000
Ah, what do you want me to do?!

244
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,190
- What's with him?
- We're broadcasting live, it's live.
- Yes, yes.

245
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,720
Okay. Joon Hyeon is really an artist.

246
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,740
He is a free spirited person. Right, everyone?

247
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,580
- YES!
- I had to clear my throat.

248
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,620
Okay. Umm.

249
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,930
Right, the person is not picking up.

250
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,040
Well, I guess this is the charm of a live broadcast.

251
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,260
That's right.

252
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,550
Okay, okay.

253
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,290
I've been notified by the producers.

254
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,080
Next week. Next week,

255
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,400
it will be revealed.

256
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,900
That's a shame.

257
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,580
Right.

258
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,580
This is all her doing, that troublemaker medal girl.

259
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,060
Find that girl right now!

260
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,410
Oh... I got it.

- Excuse me, Instructor Choi?
- Yes?

263
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,750
My key is missing.

264
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,420
Where did you lose it?

265
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,990
Member-nim, can I help you with something?

266
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:57,090
That doesn't seem to fit. The key is #9. This locker is #6.

267
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,860
Thank you.

268
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,200
Oh! Here's my key.

269
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,640
Oh.

270
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,340
I found it for you. You're thankful, right?

271
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,190
I think this person was mistaken.

272
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,210
Yes, this is Lax Sports.

273
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,690
Yes, that's me. I went with them as the leader.

274
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,220
What are you doing not picking up your phone?

275
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,940
That's not my ringtone.

276
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,740
It's not my ringtone.

277
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,380
Why is this with me?

278
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,650
I must have accidentally taken it from the locker room.

279
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,240
Right?

280
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,270
Are you kidding me?

281
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,330
No.

282
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,530
Then I'm sorry to have to say this, but it might be a case of kleptomania of some sort...

283
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,240
Something this minor can't possibly be the cause of that.

284
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:18,980
- Excuse me, but can you find the owner of this phone? 
- What?

285
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,980
- Excuse me, but this is- 
 - Aren't you going to go up again?

286
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,320
I think the owner of this phone will be up there.

287
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,440
Thank you.

288
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,690
- How can you make a promise and then be like this? 
 - Excuse me?

289
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,740
No, you said you would look over it once.

290
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,760
But if you send a story to the broadcasting station it puts us in an awkward situation. Sending one in is not a joke.

291
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,800
A story? What are you talking about?

292
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,990
Why can't I see anything? It's so frustrating.

293
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,190
Just a moment.

294
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,530
Yes.

295
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,790
What is she saying?

296
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,720
She said she doesn't know about it.

297
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,470
You frustrate me! Would she say she did it?

298
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,270
Got it.

299
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,610
Anyway, I didn't come here to argue about that.

300
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,710
But let's be on good terms with each other.

301
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,430
You're not going to send in another story next week to the broadcasting station, right? You were just joking around, right?

302
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,600
What are you talking about right now?

303
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,650
I don't know about everything else but I keep match rules and promises.

304
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:44,630
If I said I would shut my mouth then I'm going to keep my mouth shut. If I promised something, I'm going to keep it.

305
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,850
I was in the middle of working and came here.

306
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,790
I'm going to go now.

307
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,590
Excuse me.

308
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,260
Excuse me...

309
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,550
She's a funny kid.

310
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,960
Hey!

311
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,000
If it wasn't you then who else would it be?

312
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,820
How dare you tell lies?

313
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,240
Oh, yeah.

314
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,780
Did you bring a recorder with you right now, by any chance?

315
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,390
You, search her body?

316
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,250
That's a bit...

♬ Yet there's one more hill  ♬

♬ living a life, living a life ♬

319
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:40,000
You're really funny. The things you do and the level of your ringtone.

320
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,660
Hello?

321
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,930
Yes, I'll be there soon.

322
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:51,170
How can a young child like her listen to some song like that?

323
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,820
What did you just say?

324
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,300
Some song like that?

325
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,110
Can a young person not listen to a song like this?

326
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,920
Oh, that's right.

327
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,130
It's not like you can't.

328
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:09,220
Oh, you're right. It matches you perfectly. It's really high in level and class.

329
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,530
Okay.

330
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:15,060
Let's say that's my level. Then is your music classy?

331
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:19,090
Is your level that high that you followed me here and are making a fuss right now?

332
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,360
Do your fans know that you're this type of level?

333
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,040
What?

334
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,170
The story or letter, I don't know who sent it but it's perfect timing.

335
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,300
If you keep on being like this, I can still go now and reveal everything.

336
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,680
I am going to reveal everything!

337
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,250
What?

338
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,680
Aigoo, you, I should just...!

339
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,270
Do you think you can just talk like that?

340
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,300
Okay, go on then, reveal everything, see if they'll believe you or me?

341
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,460
If you're going to, go try it!

342
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,400
Be quiet!

343
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,800
You really shouldn't live like this.

344
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,400
In my eyes, you're the one that doesn't have the qualifications to be in the music industry.

345
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,750
God of music, my ass. 
Your level is really low. It's so low.

346
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:05,030
 ♬ The wind is blowing. ♬ 

347
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:09,600
♬ cheap bar on the roadside ♬

348
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,870
I, was in the middle of working and came here. I'm leaving.

349
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,890
You, you, you, you...

350
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,490
Come here!

351
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:27,190
Be patient. Be patient, Joon Hyeon. Be patient.

352
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,090
How dare you try to teach me?

353
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,430
What did you say? I don't have the qualifications to be in the music industry?

354
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,630
That I'm a low level person? That I'm really low?

355
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:54,840
How dare you lift your chin up so proudly and act so arrogantly.

356
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,710
Hey! Do you think you'll be safe even after being like this?

357
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,220
I'm swearing right now that I won't leave you alone.

358
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,610
I'm going to chase you to the ends of the earth and crush you!

359
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,660
Enough!

360
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,670
Right now?

361
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,840
I am in vacation in Hawaii right now.

362
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,250
There are a lot of beauties at the beach.

363
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,650
Then again, there are ugly women as well.

364
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,490
Aloha!

365
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,290
Crazy boy! You don't think I know that you're deceiving me?

366
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,640
Come home immediately!

367
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,540
I paid for your school and gave you food, a place to stay, and a car.

368
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:05,120
You lived a good life so far, so take care of your mother from now on.

369
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,350
They say that if you retire, you age quickly.

370
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:11,580
Why don't you just keep acting like before? Why are you being like this suddenly?

371
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,860
Did you find that first love you really wanted to find?

372
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:19,260
When I'm talking to you, 
my head feels like it's going to explode.

373
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,150
Hang up!

374
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:23,060
Why, it hasn't even been an hour.

375
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,480
I don't dislike talking to you on the phone.

376
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,150
You pay for the expensive school fee, feed me, give me a place to sleep, and give me a car.

377
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,650
At the least I have to listen to your nagging. Hello?

378
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,580
Hello?

379
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,660
Here.

380
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,740
Dad, you eat it.

381
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,280
You! If I give it to you, you just eat it.

382
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,460
Eat a lot, Byeol.

383
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,830
You should have eaten this all the way.

384
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,210
Hey, hey. It's fine.

385
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,540
Who is it?

386
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,010
Choi Myeong Sik?

387
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,030
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

388
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,620
You've got a registered letter.

389
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,870

Claim amount: 30 million won

390
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,450
Sign here.

391
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,660
Have a nice day.

392
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,100
What is that?

393
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,550
Ah, nothing, nothing much.

394
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,570
What is it? Let me see.

395
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,780
I said it's nothing.

396
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,650
Since it's nothing, let me see.

397
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,290
Aah, you're at it again.

398
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,490
Can we eat dinner first? Huh?

399
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,690
Oh, we're not fighting, Byeol.

400
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,090
We weren't arguing, just joking.

401
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,010
Let's eat.

402
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,820
Let's eat.

403
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,220
Hi, Manager.

404
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,590
What happened to that cell phone yesterday?

405
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,310
Cell phone?

406
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,740
Oh, that. The customer took the wrong phone.

407
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,740
Why would you bring it?

408
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,730
Well... He gave it to me in the elevator.

409
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,460
Choi Chun Hee, is there a problem within your household?

410
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,070
I heard that you wanted your payment in advance.

411
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:22,560
I placed thirty Tablet PC's out, but several of them are missing.

412
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,620
After you came,  a lot of theft occurred.

413
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,080
That's why I shouldn't have used a person with debt.

414
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,350
Manager, I've never done anything that would prick  my conscience. I can swear by it.

415
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,730
That's enough. Look for another job.

416
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,090
Here. This week's pay.

417
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,660
Get your mind together, Choi Chun Hee.

418
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,760
Just because you got fired doesn't mean your life is over.

419
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,070
Hello?

420
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:18,850
Excuse me? Our convenience store?

421
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,440
Ahjussi!

422
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,960
Chun Hee, your dad isn't answering the phone and why are people taking...

423
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,100
- How do we run the business if you do this?
- Let go!

424
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,510
You can't do that!

425
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:37,550
No! Not this one! No!

426
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,990
♬ living a life, living a life ♬

427
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,790
♬ It's hotter than the hot peppers ♬

428
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:31,790


429
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,430
Mom...

430
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:48,920
 Oh Seong Ju 

431
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,370
The person you were looking for passed away, but her husband was alive.

432
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,690
These are pictures of the daughters and their address.

433
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,720
Ah, really?

434
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:11,390
Then, I'll be leaving.

435
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,370
Hello, Mr. CEO.

436
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,780
Aigoo, Joon Hyeon, welcome!

437
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,520
- Is your mother doing well? 
- Yes!

438
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,730
This way.

439
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:38,920
Hello, Sunbaenim. Are you here to make a contract?

440
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,870
Our company was so excited that a superstar was coming.

441
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,030
I'll see you often now.

442
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,390
Yes, I'll see you around.

443
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,030
This is your private practice room.

444
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,650
This is as small as a booger.

445
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:00,990
This is your private recording room.

446
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:04,010
You said you were going to give me your best. Is this your best?

447
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,570
And this is your private break room.

448
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:09,060
Ugh, look at the color.

449
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:12,640
This is a recliner.

450
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,270
And this is the refrigerator that you were the advertisement model for.

451
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,230
Inside, there are your drinks.

452
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,870
This is the best.

453
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,400
Then please rest.

454
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,390
Where are you?

455
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,630
Where do you think I am?

456
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,390
Here.

457
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:45,400
Superstar, Jang Joon Hyeon, I welcome your entrance to Shine Star.

458
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:51,290
There's some benefits in coming to this company. 
I can see your face like this.

459
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,970
Ah, right. I have a gift.

460
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,480
Gift?

461
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,260
Do you like it?

462
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,510
What do you think?

463
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,480
Oh... For me...

464
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:50,780
Byeol, why are you outside?

465
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,450
Unni.

466
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:58,790
Nobody's home, and I was scared.

467
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,750
Why are you coming now?

468
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:06,860
Did you wait for me a long time?

469
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,820
A bit long...

470
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:15,240
I'm sorry.

471
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,950
I'm sorry.

472
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:33,070
Come on...

473
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:40,500
Byeol, should I sing you a song?

474
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,190
Really? I'm really going to sing!

475
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:46,750
You're serious, right?

00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,750
You want to go?

495
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,310
Let's go, let's go!

496
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:37,660
Aigoo.

497
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,480
 Shine Star and Jang Joon Hyeon hold hands!
Counting down till his debut in the U.S.! 

498
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,120
I see you're reading that.

499
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:10,460
I watched you when you were this little. It's a bit sad to see you leave this way.

500
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,260
You earned a lot of money because of me.

501
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,830
I should do the kind of music that I want to do now.

502
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,370
All right. Did you read through the contract carefully?

503
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:25,750
Shine Star is the best entertainment company in Korea.

504
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,130
Yes,  you thought well.

505
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,460
I'm sorry, but what do I do?

506
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,680
I won't be able to attend your farewell party. 
I have something to do.

507
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,960
 Superstar Jang Joon Hyeon 

508
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,170

- Oppa, you want to have the third shot too?

512
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,990
♬ This is the time for us to break up. ♬

513

514
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:18,430

515
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,880
One shot!

516
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,900
Let's meet at the summit.

517
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:43,990
 The caller cannot answer your call, so you will be reconnected to the voicemail. 

518
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:47,560
Dad, where are you?

519
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:51,430
Why can't I contact you? Come back home!

520
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,030
I'm getting worried.

521
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,870
Hurry back, all right?

522
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:22,990
Come to your senses, Choi Chun Hee. 
You have Byeol (whom you have to take care of).

523
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:34,980
Excuse me, Manager, in the last two years, I have never been late.

524
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:38,430
If you let me work again, I'll work 100 times harder than before.

525
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,200
Ms. Choi Chun Hee,

526
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,920
this is very pathetic. Why are you doing this?!

527
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,550
Manager! You know my situation!

528
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,390
- This person, seriously. 
- Where should we hang this?

529
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,480
Hold it.

530
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:04,300
 Hey! Do you think you'll be safe after doing this?  

531
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:08,030
 I'm swearing right now. 

532
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,180
 I will not leave you alone. 

533
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:14,740
 I am going to chase you to the ends of the earth and crush you! 

534
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,130
Hello?

535
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,960
What did you do at the Sports Center?

536
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,850
You guys are the ones who told him 
to fire me, aren't you?

537
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:34,880
- Make it like it was before!

538
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,640
Ah, that's...

539
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,350
It's not something I can take care of.

540
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,980
Then who can?

541
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:54,800
 This person cannot take your call, so you will be connected to voicemail. 

542
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,460
Hey, Jang Joon Hyeon.

543
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,260
Why aren't you answering your phone?

544
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,420
Answer your phone quickly, understand?!

545
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,550
Answer quickly, okay?!

546
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:22,230

 22 missed calls   

549
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:40,500
 This is the first message. 

550
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,090
 Jang Joon Hyeon, you jerk. 

551
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,330
 Where are you? WHERE ARE YOU?! 

552
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:47,730
This is...  Korean Hotel 

553
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:53,970
I have to meet Jang Joon Hyeon!

554
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:56,030
I have to meet him! Just once!

555
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,990
You can't!

556
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,500
Just once!

557
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,570
Go!

558
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,870
 I'm in a suite in Korean Hotel. Come if you want to see. 

559
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:15,110
You're dead.

560
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:28,840
Hello?

561
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:33,090
 Hey! Where are you? What are you doing that you answer now?! 

562
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:34,660
Why?

563
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,000
 You shouldn't ask why. There's a big problem! 

564
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,250
 Come to your senses! 

565
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,380
 Wake up now! 

566
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,190
 Hello? 

567
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,600
Hyung, what kind of person are you?!

568
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,180
What were you doing until things got this bad?

569
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,810
 You made me dead drunk, 
and you guys left! 

570
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:03,060
 I couldn't sleep at all because I was looking for you guys. 

571
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,540
Me?

572
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,990
Did I really?

573
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:08,290
 You really don't remember? 

574
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:09,440
No, I don't.

575
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,340
I don't remember anything.

576
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,120
If I remembered, I would say so!

577
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,360
 I got it, I got it. 

578
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,500
 Just calm down, and get out of there quickly! The reporters are going there right now.  

579
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,400
 Move quickly! 

580
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,900
 Hurry! 

581
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,960
 Are you getting dressed? 

582
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,350
Hey, Jang Joon Hyeon!

583
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,850
 She's here!   

584
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,140
Oh my, what are you doing right now?

585
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,670
Get dressed right now! Are you not getting dressed?

586
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,560
Hey, how did you...

587
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,530
You told me to come!

588
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:39,500
What... Aish.

589
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,840
- Why are you here? 
 - What are you doing? Get dressed and get out quickly! 

590
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,950
 - You don't have time to do that! 
- Okay!

591
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,130
Hey, get out.

592
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:46,780
- Get out now! 
- What are you doing right now?!

593
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,010
- Hey! 
- Do you want to get your picture taken with me?

594
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,810
- Get out! 
- Hey!

595
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:53,750
- Wow, you're really...
- Oh, shoot.

596
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,390
The reporters are here.

597
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:59,610
It's here!

598
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,110
It's this way. This way!

599
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,930
He's not there?

600
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:10,720
What are you doing right now?

601
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,100
Gosh!

602
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,410
Hold on.

603
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:42,510
This isn't the time to be doing this.

604
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:57,170
Let go of me! What are you doing?

605
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,400
This isn't it, right?

606
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,530
 Oh! He's over there! 

607
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:03,040
-  Where?! 
 - Where?

608
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:09,550
This is it!

609
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:14,900
What are you doing right now?!

610
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,770
Why do I have to run away with you?!

611
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:19,490
Hey! You were the one who got me fired from the Sports Center, aren't you?!

612
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:20,400
You did it, didn't you?!

613
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,050
If you don't want your face on the newspaper, then be quiet!

614
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:26,260
I told you not to touch me!

615
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,630
Run!

616
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,590
Hyung, where are you?

617
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:37,690
Where are you?

618
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:39,650
I can't see you!

619
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:42,870
What? L?

620
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,860
Hey, go on your own way.

621
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,570
Keep your mouth shut about what happened today.

622
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:54,220
I would even if you didn't tell me so.

623
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,440
But you have to answer...!

624
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,780
Hey! Answer me before you go!

00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,570
Oh my gosh!

643
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,700
 Recently, the person who has been going through a lot of scandals, 

644
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,230
 I'm here in front of his, Jang Joon Hyeon's, house. 

645
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:34,200
  According to the interested party, Jang Joon Hyeon 

646
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,280
  hired a substitute runner at a half marathon tournament... 

647
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,950
I don't know. It's his own fault.

648
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,570
Byeol, go sit down over there. I'll finish making it soon and bring it to you.

649
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:50,170
It would be good if Dad could eat with us.

650
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:54,530
When is Dad coming?

651
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:57,000
He's going to contact us soon.

652
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:00,420
Aigoo.

653
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,590
 I'm sorry. 

654
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,370
Is it Dad?

655
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:10,410
Unnie?

656
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:13,330
Yeah... Yeah...

657
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,310
Dad...

658
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:19,590
He says he's sorry.

659
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:26,060
It's the first time that Dad has said that he's sorry.

660
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:43,540
Rise up, Jang Joon Hyeon!

661
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,310
Oppa! I love you!

662
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:53,320
Rise up, Jang Joon Hyeon!

663
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,980
That's right.

664
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:58,550
I have those kids.

665
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:02,360
Those kids will protect me.

666
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,900
Rise up, Jang Joon Hyeon!

667
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:15,580
Angelic smile, Jang Joon Hyeon!

668
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,530
Oppa! I love you.

669
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:20,050
Oppa! I really love you, oppa!

670
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,450
Stay strong, oppa! I trust you, oppa!

671
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,930
 3 months later  
Don't worry too much.

672
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:38,990
Your dad loves you guys so much, so he will call you soon.

673
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:42,930
Thank you. Please call me if you get in touch with him.

674
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:45,510
Ah, okay. Get going.

675
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:53,960
Hello?

676
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:59,600
Yes, I'm Choi Chun Hee who applied.

677
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,850
Ah, you already hired someone?

678
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:07,060
Ah, then call me when you need someone.

679
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,080
Thank you.

680
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:20,270
Ula ula 
(Noise for Crayon Shin-chan's alien dance)

681
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:25,650
Why are you here now? I'm not eating properly!

682
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,680
I just went to Shine Star!

683
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,590
I think the agency isn't doing what it's supposed to do these days.

684
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:34,620
I think I'm going to pick another agency that is good.

685
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,370
Shine Star has been going crazy.

686
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:38,560
The advertisers won't sit still, either.

687
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,030
The contract has been cancelled...

688
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:43,490
Soon, there will be a lawsuit, and I will get fired.

689
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:47,340
Yes, I can accept you and your behavior but

690
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:51,030
I don't want to do it any more.

691
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:53,730
That troublemaker medal girl.

692
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:56,440
Because of that crazy girl... What kind of situation...

693
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,690
Why is that so important?

694
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:01,120
You will have to move immediately.

695
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,540
What?

696
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,200
Why are you telling me that now?

697
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,220
You didn't know that?

698
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,220
What is your job?

699
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,190
You should have taken care of that kind of stuff already!

700
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:12,980
Look, there should be something to sell off to...

701
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,680
Quiet, quiet. Mute!

702
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:20,600
Hey, Soo In. How come I couldn't contact you for a while?

703
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:25,350
You believe in me, right? You know it wasn't me, right?

704
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:29,430
Someone must have planned and put me in the trap.

705
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:34,140
Even if no one believes, 
I'm fine as long as you believe in me.

706
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,760
If only you believe in me...

707
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:43,540
Oppa, Stop talking about it now.

708
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:49,880
What is it?

709
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,860
The song, you wrote me, my debut song.

710
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:56,720
- Soo In!
- Oppa.

711
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,880
I heard you are really struggling lately.

712
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,600
What? Says who?

713
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,370
I'm busy preparing my album.

714
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:07,910
Take care, Oppa.

715
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:24,060
Hello, Director!

716
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:27,250
What? How did Jang Joon Hyeon come here?

717
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:30,190
It's for you.

718
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:31,570
Last time,

719
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:35,110
you know how you asked me to be on the Night restaurant and I refused it.

720
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:37,570
I had a strong image of an artist.

721
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:40,120
I have thought about it carefully,

722
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,760
and it might be good to be on it once.

723
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,300
Jang Joon Hyeon, stand up (informally)

724
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,760
and talk to me (then adds honorifics).

725
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:56,430
Thank you for the offer but,

726
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,980
what should I do?

727
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,880
Joon Hyeon, you have an intrinsic

728
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,110
difficulty in making an appearance on the broadcasting station.

729
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:09,840
Later, we'll talk again.

730
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:14,260
Ah! Joon Hyeon!

731
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:17,820
Take that back.

732
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:20,650
Drink it. Looks like you need to practice a lot.

733
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:23,760
It's must be hard for you. So you drink.

734
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:28,070
Figh-ting!

735
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:37,290
We are here.

736
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:38,800
Tae Song Hyung.

737
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,430
What?

738
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:44,800
What's the matter? You just called my name unlike other times.

739
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,230
It's strange.

740
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:48,580
What is strange?

741
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,460
I'm calling Tae Song Hyung as Tae Song Hyung.

742
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,910
Yes, that's right. I am a hyung.

743
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:55,150
But somehow...

744
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:56,540
Thank you for the hard work.

745
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,860
What? What do you mean?

746
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,250
Don't come to work any more.

747
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:02,850
What?

748
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:07,320
Hurry and leave. You've wanted to escape from me.

749
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:13,470
No, no. It wasn't that bad.

750
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:16,780
By the way, Joon Hyeon.

751
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,410
Leave now. I don't want to see you any more.

752
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:21,050
I mean, it's not...

753
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:23,690
Why aren't you leaving? My heart is getting weak!

754
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,590
And stop wearing those training outfits!

755
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:27,430
- No, It's not that...
- I said, leave!

756
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:28,760
No, it's not that!

757
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,380
The agency told me to return the van today!

758
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:36,810
I think you need to get off now...

759
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:40,490
What?

760
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,630
I'm sorry.

761
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:08,110
 You filed the missing report, so wait for a bit. 

762
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:33,160
Where is the President?

763
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,300
- What are you doing now?
- He's not here now.

764
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,700
I want to have a face to face talk.

765
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,380
Hey, hey.

766
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,010
Uh?

767
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:41,560
My sunglasses!

768
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,440
Release me, what are you doing?

769
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,080
What are you guys doing now?

770
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:51,170
Come in.

771
00:56:55,780 --> 00:57:00,180
So, you want to continue your music?

772
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,130
Yes, President.

773
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:05,510
You know your current situation, right?

774
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:12,370
If I accept you now, what will you do for me?

775
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,260
 Try and meet this girl. 

776
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:24,010
 She's a new face that you will have to train. 

777
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,130
Is there a person named Choi Chun Hee...

778
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,650
Why did you come to my house?

779
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,360
Choi Chun Hee

780
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:52,030
was you?

781
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:58,810
So it was you again?

782
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:03,300
How do you know my name?

783
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,470
It was you, and not any other person.

784
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:10,560
It's a different story if it's you. Who put me in this situation, huh?

785
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,100
Who... Because of me?

786
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,260
Then, you're saying it's not?

787
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,530
You made me like this.

788
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:21,770
Jang Joon Hyeon, the god of music on a roll,

789
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:23,710
was ruined by you intentionally.

790
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:24,410
What?

791
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:27,040
If only you didn't make a big deal with the medal,

792
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,840
and followed me to the hotel and made trouble!

793
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,050
The reason that I, who was innocently mixed up in a scandal and now

794
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:37,380
looking at your dirty face!

795
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:40,790
The Net is full of false accusations and personal attacks,

796
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:43,320
and the world is filled with lies and distrust,

797
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,920
and the world became driven by evil force,

798
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,820
and all, all of these are because of you!

799
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:54,390
You, troublemaker medal girl!

800
00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:02,820


801
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:06,290
♬ You are my Mr. Lee Lee  ♬

802
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:09,530

803
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:13,850
