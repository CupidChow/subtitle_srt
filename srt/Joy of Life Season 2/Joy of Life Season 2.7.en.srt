00:01:25,082 --> 00:01:31,082
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,163 --> 00:01:34,122
(Episode 7)

3
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,199
I was free.

4
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,078
I was drawing as a form of entertainment.

5
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,842
Is it entertaining to not draw the face?

6
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,322
Do you need me to ask you who you drew?

7
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,350
You are the crown prince!

8
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,759
I'm wrong.

9
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,789
I will remember Mother's teachings.

10
00:01:53,703 --> 00:01:55,103
I will never draw again.

11
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,562
What's the matter with Shijia Town?

12
00:02:50,957 --> 00:02:52,357
Cheng Ze reacted in time.

13
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,922
His men already left the place

14
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,669
when my men reached there.

15
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,392
He didn't leave any evidence behind.

16
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,030
If so, why did you set fire to the town?

17
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,750
It's because Fan Xian is a good guy.

18
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:08,362
He'll only turn on Cheng Ze

19
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:11,591
if I burn down the town.

20
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,402
Only then will he side with me forever.

21
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,402
If so, you mustn't let him find out the truth.

22
00:03:19,703 --> 00:03:21,103
Mother, please don't worry.

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,030
Only lunatics would attempt

24
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:28,027
such terrible acts

25
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,319
out of the blue.

26
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,870
There's only one truth.

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,602
Cheng Ze massacred the town.

28
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,669
Do you regard Fan Xian that highly?

29
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,922
Everyone loves good guys.

30
00:04:09,798 --> 00:04:11,001
My Lord.

31
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,270
I'm waiting for you.

32
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:21,398
Didn't I tell you to go back and think about it?

33
00:04:21,422 --> 00:04:23,342
Following me means you'll be in constant danger.

34
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:25,696
- I've already made up my mind. - That quickly?

35
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,198
There's nothing to think about.

36
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,534
My wife said there's no way I could earn this much per month

37
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,322
elsewhere.

38
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,110
And,

39
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,640
My Lord,

40
00:04:36,886 --> 00:04:38,286
you're a good guy.

41
00:04:53,568 --> 00:04:55,238
What's the use of being a good guy?

42
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:56,922
I place everyone around me in danger.

43
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,870
My Lord,

44
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,390
the world is filled with dangers.

45
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,749
However, there are too few good guys.

46
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,560
Speaking of which,

47
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:08,020
how am I a good guy?

48
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,109
I have plenty of flaws.

49
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,030
I'm timid,

50
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,269
selfish,

51
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,148
greedy, and arrogant.

52
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,318
Sometimes, I'm content with my current state.

53
00:05:17,438 --> 00:05:19,189
Sometimes, I'm too hesitant.

54
00:05:20,532 --> 00:05:22,042
To put it simply,

55
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,030
I'm just an ordinary person.

56
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,590
If ordinary people were in my shoes,

57
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,396
what do you think they will do?

58
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,602
What would they do?

59
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,390
They'll quit.

60
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,039
I lost my post. And, I've lost all leads too.

61
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,838
How can I continue with my investigation?

62
00:05:37,862 --> 00:05:39,452
What gives me the right to continue it?

63
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,202
What has it got to do with me?

64
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,922
As humans,

65
00:05:44,286 --> 00:05:47,036
we should only be concerned with our own well-being.

66
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:50,420
My Lord, you mustn't say that.

67
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:52,082
Your words and actions

68
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:54,764
have changed many people.

69
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,590
- Who? - At least you changed me.

70
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,642
Wang Qi Nian.

71
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:12,268
Seems like you haven't understood His Majesty's intention yet.

72
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,962
I understand.

73
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:21,602
He took away my post as Chief Inspector.

74
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,807
And he granted a marriage between Li Cheng Ze and the Ye family.

75
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:27,191
Everyone knows that there's a grandmaster in the Ye family.

76
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:28,836
Once the marriage is completed,

77
00:06:28,957 --> 00:06:32,002
Li Cheng Ze will have a bright future ahead.

78
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:36,856
His Majesty is just protecting him.

79
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:43,828
He feels aggrieved.

80
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:45,238
I dare not feel so.

81
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,581
The difference between our identities is too vast.

82
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,293
It's logical for His Majesty to side with his son.

83
00:06:51,406 --> 00:06:53,766
Is that why you don't intend to continue the investigation?

84
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,590
President, I don't have the right to do so.

85
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,110
The prince committed a crime. I risked my life to admonish him.

86
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,482
He didn't listen to me.

87
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,729
Fine. I listened to him instead.

88
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,390
Now that I've returned from the dead, I tried to admonish him again.

89
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:09,285
He's still covering up for him.

90
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:11,895
My words are pointless.

91
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,910
Is there anyone I can trust in this world?

92
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,950
Can I trust him?

93
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:18,877
Can I trust you?

94
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:22,316
It doesn't matter if you trust me or not.

95
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,309
I scooped this up for you.

96
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,922
His Majesty did toss it into the water,

97
00:07:39,557 --> 00:07:41,877
but did he say that he wanted to remove you from position?

98
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,629
Everyone could tell that His Majesty was being protective of Li Cheng Zi.

99
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,270
Therefore, from now on,

100
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,470
this matter is over.

101
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,550
To turn to the dark side, huh?

102
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,989
Is he telling me to find the undercurrent within the vortex?

103
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,776
No wonder he tossed it into the water.

104
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,030
You're overthinking it.

105
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,560
You're definitely overthinking it.

106
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,390
But that's what he means.

107
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,189
But Shijia Town is gone.

108
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,789
If you don't calm down, there will be many cases as such.

109
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:14,772
The most important thing is this. Do you know your enemy well?

110
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,270
Have you thought about

111
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,309
what you'll do from now on?

112
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,239
My enemies are

113
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,719
Li Cheng Ze

114
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,470
and people like him.

115
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,439
I'm not my mother.

116
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:47,029
I can't live solely for the sake of changing the world.

117
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,109
However,

118
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,079
at least I want

119
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,989
to be a good guy on my own terms

120
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,120
so that I can have

121
00:08:58,464 --> 00:08:59,998
a clear conscience.

122
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,549
I don't want to see another case like Teng Zi Jing's death.

123
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,830
I don't want to see pitiful people like Old Man Jin again.

124
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,120
I want to speak on their behalf.

125
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,430
I want to uphold justice

126
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,479
for those who suffered wrongful deaths.

127
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,149
That's why you have to calm down,

128
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,429
conceal your brilliance,

129
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,959
and start from scratch.

130
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,460
Although Chief Inspector

131
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:30,029
is a high position, you're still alone.

132
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:31,750
You've been in the capital for a long time.

133
00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:33,804
You should have your own subordinates by now.

134
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,149
- I have Wang Qi Nian. - That's not enough.

135
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,495
- Do you still remember Zhu Ge? - I dare not forget about him.

136
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,109
No one took over the First Bureau after Zhu Ge's death.

137
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,350
I suggest you

138
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,350
take over the First Bureau as the chief inspector.

139
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:51,532
The First Bureau is in charge of supervising the officials.

140
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,177
It involves plenty of connections.

141
00:09:53,265 --> 00:09:56,410
It's a hotbed of rumors and a battleground.

142
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,190
Just now, you said you wish

143
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,190
to speak for the people

144
00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:02,333
and topple Li Cheng Ze, right?

145
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,480
This position

146
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,919
is the best for you.

147
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,002
President Chen,

148
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,436
I've heard about many things

149
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,120
after my trip to Northern Qi.

150
00:10:25,122 --> 00:10:26,522
That's great.

151
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,682
At least you broadened your horizons.

152
00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:32,884
Is my entire life under your control?

153
00:10:33,085 --> 00:10:35,195
Would you believe me if I said

154
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,720
I was helping you out?

155
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,436
I don't dare to believe it.

156
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,310
You're her son after all.

157
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,749
I have something I want to ask you long ago.

158
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,357
Ask away.

159
00:10:58,335 --> 00:10:59,735
If, one day,

160
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,096
I chose to walk a different path compared to my mother,

161
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,615
- who would you choose? - Impossible.

162
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,789
What if that happens?

163
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,599
If so, I'll definitely choose your mother.

164
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,830
So, in the end, you guys are helping me out

165
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,710
because I'm her son, huh?

166
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,000
You're right.

167
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:22,700
If so, you guys will be disappointed.

168
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,790
My mother and I are different.

169
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:28,319
You need to know that no one in the world in the same.

170
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,540
However, your nature

171
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,229
is the same as your mother.

172
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,870
I dare not guarantee that.

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,909
That doesn't matter.

174
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,559
This is what I want to tell you.

175
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,040
You'll definitely follow your mother's path in the future.

176
00:11:43,351 --> 00:11:45,791
And, what I'm doing right now is to make sure

177
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,629
you can take the path you want.

178
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:52,050
I was under your control all my life,

179
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,550
yet you need to make sure I can take the path I want?

180
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,360
Isn't that ridiculous?

181
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,160
One must give in order to gain. It might not be that ridiculous.

182
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,519
So, you made up your mind long ago, huh?

183
00:12:09,776 --> 00:12:11,486
I once told you this.

184
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:14,546
I would be here for you no matter what you did.

185
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,190
Although I lied to you before,

186
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,950
that was true.

187
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:19,855
If so, are you still hiding something from me?

188
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:20,909
Of course.

189
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,389
But I need to keep them a secret.

190
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,629
Can I still trust you?

191
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:24,882
You can.

192
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,122
But not entirely.

193
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,989
Humans are unpredictable after all.

194
00:12:38,313 --> 00:12:39,713
If so,

195
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,840
I'll trust you halfheartedly, then.

196
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,322
That's too much trust.

197
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,470
Is this even the same pass?

198
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,879
The person who desires to see you more than me is here.

199
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:17,305
Tie up all loose ends related to Moon Embracing Pavilion.

200
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,978
Understood.

201
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,919
What are you doing here?

202
00:13:28,913 --> 00:13:30,126
This is Fan Xian.

203
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:32,437
His surname is Fan. He's my son.

204
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,310
I know. No one is stealing him from you.

205
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,670
What does the Qing Kingdom emphasize the most?

206
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,400
Isn't it filial piety?

207
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,039
Isn't there such a thing as a filial son and a happy father?

208
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
There is.

209
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,007
He traveled a long way to return to the capital.

210
00:13:46,031 --> 00:13:48,042
When he's not seeing His Majesty, he's seeing you.

211
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:49,533
Isn't that ridiculous?

212
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,710
What is he angry at?

213
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,240
I'm not angry.

214
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,000
Why should I be angry?

215
00:13:58,257 --> 00:13:59,930
I'm trying to reason with you here.

216
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:02,649
Let me ask you this. Fan Xian traveled a long way to come back.

217
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:04,286
Isn't he being unfilial by not coming home

218
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,700
to greet his father first?

219
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,110
If things get out of hand,

220
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,109
can the Department of Rites condemn him?

221
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:12,682
You're totally right.

222
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:17,309
So, there are moments when you admit your mistake too, huh?

223
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,550
But I didn't ask him to be here.

224
00:14:22,806 --> 00:14:23,997
It wasn't you?

225
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:27,397
Actually, I wanted to come here of my own accord.

226
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,430
I wanted to clean the stone monument.

227
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,362
Let's go home.

228
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,600
We shall take the same carriage.

229
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,802
Please have some tea.

230
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,541
You shouldn't take the palace affairs to heart.

231
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,940
Although His Majesty discarded your pass, he didn't issue an edict.

232
00:15:27,055 --> 00:15:29,005
He didn't remove me from my post officially.

233
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,560
President Chen told me that.

234
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,909
This is the capital,

235
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,590
not a battleground.

236
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,669
If you wish to go against Prince Cheng Ze,

237
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:38,367
you can't just rely on yourself.

238
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:40,198
I have to get subordinates as well.

239
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,269
President Chen told me that as well.

240
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:44,056
I'll take over the First Bureau after this.

241
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,269
President Chen is helping you out,

242
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,002
but this is the capital.

243
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:49,861
You have to be wary of everyone.

244
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,520
I can trust President Chen, but not entirely.

245
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,120
Humans are unpredictable after all.

246
00:15:54,191 --> 00:15:55,865
He said that as well.

247
00:15:56,975 --> 00:15:58,924
He said everything I wanted to say.

248
00:15:59,598 --> 00:16:01,096
However, I don't agree with one of his statements.

249
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,520
What statement?

250
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,842
Although humans are unpredictable,

251
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,109
and we shouldn't trust people entirely,

252
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:12,893
we can trust our family entirely.

253
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:24,722
Those fools from the Department of Rites

254
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,501
always use filial piety as their excuse to create issues.

255
00:16:27,637 --> 00:16:30,149
I didn't rush here because I wanted you to greet me.

256
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,375
I was worried that someone might get the goods on you

257
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,470
in the officialdom.

258
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:36,576
Father, your words are enlightening indeed.

259
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,122
I was enlightened after hearing what you said.

260
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,629
I'm glad that you figured it out.

261
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,101
I haven't visited Wan Er after my return.

262
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,159
Why don't I...

263
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,470
Why don't I stay at home for the next few days?

264
00:16:57,846 --> 00:16:59,602
I can visit her after that.

265
00:17:00,881 --> 00:17:03,162
You do have to visit Ruo Ruo.

266
00:17:03,407 --> 00:17:05,962
Your sister does miss you a lot.

267
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:24,242
(Fan Residence)

268
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,793
Ruo Ruo?

269
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,042
Ruo Ruo?

270
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,895
Ruo Ruo?

271
00:18:00,423 --> 00:18:01,598
Ruo Ruo.

272
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,870
Xian? You're finally back!

273
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,400
Where did you go?

274
00:18:07,078 --> 00:18:08,242
I...

275
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,200
I traveled the world.

276
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,830
You traveled the world?

277
00:18:14,646 --> 00:18:15,842
How long were you away?

278
00:18:16,585 --> 00:18:19,202
Around half an hour.

279
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,322
You do travel at a fast pace, huh?

280
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,943
Actually, I did more than just travel the world.

281
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:27,567
Mainly, I was escaping from my marriage.

282
00:18:27,657 --> 00:18:29,225
I heard about the marriage His Majesty granted me.

283
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:30,442
I was unhappy with it.

284
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,482
That's why I ran away from home.

285
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,079
If so, why did you come back?

286
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,280
I left in a hurry.

287
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,590
I calmed down during my journey.

288
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,482
I realized something.

289
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:43,372
Xian,

290
00:18:43,597 --> 00:18:45,471
who do you think I trust the most in this world?

291
00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:47,842
- Who is it? - Of course it's you.

292
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:50,020
That's why I should ask you for your opinion

293
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:51,782
before I decide whether to leave or stay.

294
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:56,122
What if I want you to stay?

295
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,110
- What are you doing? - Since I'm not leaving,

296
00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:06,764
I should unpack my clothes.

297
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,224
Aren't you worried that I might tell you to proceed with the marriage?

298
00:19:10,248 --> 00:19:11,642
Not at all, Xian.

299
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:14,362
I told you already. You're the person I trust the most.

300
00:19:15,711 --> 00:19:18,122
Ruo Ruo, you don't want to get married?

301
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,482
No.

302
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,469
I understand.

303
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,122
Don't worry. I'll think of a solution.

304
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,480
If you don't want to get married, you don't have to.

305
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:29,882
Okay.

306
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,162
If it doesn't work out,

307
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,550
I'll take you with me.

308
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,882
Okay.

309
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,282
Don't do that. You'll mess up my hair.

310
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,640
All right. You can continue. I'll go and deal with Fan Si Zhe.

311
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,562
Xian, I thought you just came back.

312
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:47,082
What's wrong with Fan Si Zhe? Did he get into huge trouble?

313
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:49,882
Let me put it this way. I almost wanted to kill him.

314
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:52,039
That's what I think about all the time.

315
00:19:52,063 --> 00:19:53,242
Let me help you out.

316
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,962
It's a misunderstanding.

317
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:57,959
I guess I have to wait for next time, then.

318
00:19:57,983 --> 00:19:59,179
Tell me when you're going to kill him, okay?

319
00:19:59,203 --> 00:20:00,559
He's your brother, you know?

320
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,722
You're my brother too.

321
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,442
Can't you treat him as an equal?

322
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:04,802
No.

323
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:07,215
I might have plenty of younger brothers in the future.

324
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,242
But you're my only elder brother.

325
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,002
You do have a point.

326
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,962
Ruo Ruo,

327
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:18,310
don't worry. I won't let down your trust.

328
00:20:18,648 --> 00:20:19,922
Of course.

329
00:20:36,808 --> 00:20:38,168
Did you say Fan Xian has returned?

330
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,284
Yes, Young Master.

331
00:20:39,365 --> 00:20:40,602
Father is happy, right?

332
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:54,244
Father, did you call for me?

333
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,629
Mother, you're here too?

334
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,442
Xian, you're finally back.

335
00:20:58,782 --> 00:21:01,082
You're kneeling before we ask you any questions?

336
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:04,802
I know this atmosphere all too well.

337
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,230
Do you know about Moon Embracing Pavilion?

338
00:21:10,294 --> 00:21:12,654
- I know. - Who's the owner?

339
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,802
- Me. - That's nonsense!

340
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,802
How could you do something like that?

341
00:21:17,495 --> 00:21:20,442
Mother, I was just trying to make some money.

342
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:24,316
Does that mean you can do inhumane deeds?

343
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:27,333
Dear, please spare him.

344
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:29,562
Run away!

345
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,519
- Bring me the rod! - No need for that.

346
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:34,669
Actually, he was duped too.

347
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,002
That's right. Si Zhe isn't smart.

348
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,379
I'm sure he was duped.

349
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,718
Mother, didn't you always say that I was smart?

350
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,199
You should shut up for now.

351
00:21:42,711 --> 00:21:44,420
No matter if you were duped or not,

352
00:21:44,606 --> 00:21:46,642
you need to be punished for your mistake.

353
00:21:46,877 --> 00:21:49,507
He won't be able to escape from his punishment.

354
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,081
Actually, I've already punished him.

355
00:21:51,162 --> 00:21:53,082
That's right. Fan Xian already...

356
00:21:54,983 --> 00:21:56,383
You already punished him?

357
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,679
Have you two met before this?

358
00:22:00,023 --> 00:22:02,322
Yes. He almost beat me to death.

359
00:22:02,966 --> 00:22:04,475
Why didn't you tell me about it?

360
00:22:04,608 --> 00:22:06,159
Xian told me to keep it a secret.

361
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:07,605
He told me to stay inside my room.

362
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:10,269
So, you didn't leave your room because of Fan Xian's instructions?

363
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,656
Doesn't that mean he returned to the capital before this?

364
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,002
Indeed.

365
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,640
What exactly is going on?

366
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,310
Father, it's a long story.

367
00:22:31,471 --> 00:22:33,111
You shouldn't make him kneel all the way.

368
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,482
Stand over there.

369
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,359
Speaking of which,

370
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,322
this was all a trap set by Prince Cheng Ze.

371
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,602
(Fan Residence)

372
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:50,488
Anyway, that's the general situation.

373
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:52,317
He didn't know that Moon Embracing Pavilion

374
00:22:52,341 --> 00:22:53,781
was forcing people to be courtesans.

375
00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:56,478
Father, you heard him, didn't you? I had no idea at all.

376
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,007
Once someone reports it to the authorities,

377
00:22:59,088 --> 00:23:00,688
you'll be the first person they capture.

378
00:23:00,725 --> 00:23:01,727
Father, don't say that.

379
00:23:01,808 --> 00:23:03,255
They didn't tell me that it was a brothel.

380
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,042
They said it was a nice place where people could enjoy songs. I...

381
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:08,322
What should we do, then?

382
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:14,602
Actually,

383
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:18,709
we can get through this as long as I yield and compromise with him.

384
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,302
- That's impossible. - Aunt, do you have that much faith in me?

385
00:23:21,326 --> 00:23:23,366
Since when have you ever yielded to someone before?

386
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,285
So, do you have any arrangements for Si Zhe?

387
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,040
It's unrealistic to think

388
00:23:28,128 --> 00:23:31,048
that we can deny his association with the brothel in such a short period.

389
00:23:31,302 --> 00:23:32,773
If we wish to protect him,

390
00:23:33,303 --> 00:23:35,303
our only choice is to send him out of the capital.

391
00:23:39,646 --> 00:23:41,046
You do have a point.

392
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,542
If so, I shall go into hiding in Danzhou with Si Zhe for the time being.

393
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:45,326
He cannot remain in the Qing Kingdom either.

394
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,270
Where can he go, then?

395
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,480
He needs to head northward.

396
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:50,879
He needs to head to Northern Qi.

397
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,762
Isn't that too far away?

398
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,962
That'll work.

399
00:23:55,446 --> 00:23:57,155
I'll head northward together with him.

400
00:23:57,568 --> 00:23:59,416
Aunt, you cannot join him. He must head there alone.

401
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,070
- But why? - Yeah.

402
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,880
He's traveling to another state in secret.

403
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,492
This isn't a trip.

404
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,860
You're the duke's daughter.

405
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,830
Everyone will recognize you if you join him.

406
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:11,351
Even so, we can't just let Si Zhe head to Northern Qi alone.

407
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,055
He has never left the capital in his life.

408
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:21,762
Fan Si Zhe,

409
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,602
are you afraid?

410
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,122
A little.

411
00:24:27,597 --> 00:24:28,667
I know.

412
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,189
This is very difficult for you.

413
00:24:31,031 --> 00:24:32,831
All of a sudden, you have to leave your home.

414
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:35,417
From a life of luxury to one without support, your future is uncertain.

415
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:36,750
You should stop.

416
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,384
The more you describe it, the more afraid I get.

417
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:40,082
But to you, this is also an opportunity.

418
00:24:40,184 --> 00:24:42,054
How can you consider this an opportunity?

419
00:24:42,557 --> 00:24:44,682
One will never grow up unless they leave their home.

420
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,322
Have you ever thought of proving yourself to someone?

421
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,440
Have you ever thought of proving that you're no longer a child?

422
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,122
Have you ever thought of

423
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,869
proving that not everything you did was a mistake?

424
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,680
Have you ever thought of proving that we can expect great things from you?

425
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,599
I wish to prove myself.

426
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:08,221
If so, head northward

427
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,869
and find your own path.

428
00:25:10,263 --> 00:25:11,663
He can't do it.

429
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,722
All right.

430
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,362
Louder.

431
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:21,531
- All right. - I can't hear you.

432
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:22,922
I can do this!

433
00:25:25,498 --> 00:25:26,807
I committed the mistake.

434
00:25:26,888 --> 00:25:28,048
I will bear the consequences.

435
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,871
Father, I'm willing to head to Northern Qi.

436
00:25:32,294 --> 00:25:34,164
But you're obviously terrified.

437
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:35,922
Mother,

438
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,759
I'm terrified.

439
00:25:38,643 --> 00:25:40,874
However, I can't just keep hiding behind you.

440
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,120
I've already grown up.

441
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,280
When will he depart?

442
00:25:46,935 --> 00:25:48,724
- Tonight. - That fast?

443
00:25:48,888 --> 00:25:50,222
Mother, the faster I depart the better.

444
00:25:50,246 --> 00:25:52,596
I'm worried that I might change my mind later.

445
00:25:52,858 --> 00:25:55,128
Xian, is Northern Qi very cold?

446
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:58,673
- It's quite cold. - I'll get some thicker clothing now.

447
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:00,174
I might not have time later.

448
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:10,626
Why did he change all of a sudden?

449
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,030
Aunt,

450
00:26:12,183 --> 00:26:15,002
sometimes, it only takes a moment for a man to grow.

451
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:19,709
No. I need to tell him what to do.

452
00:26:29,846 --> 00:26:31,516
This is pretty sudden indeed.

453
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,540
In the end, I was the one who implicated him.

454
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:37,436
You were right about one thing.

455
00:26:38,777 --> 00:26:39,799
What is it?

456
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,762
Sometimes, it only takes a moment for a man to grow.

457
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,581
Fate always comes at us unexpectedly.

458
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,790
That kid didn't disappoint me.

459
00:26:54,165 --> 00:26:55,755
He's my son indeed.

460
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,880
You should've said that

461
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:06,476
in front of him.

462
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,976
Remember to wear extra clothing during cold weather.

463
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,882
You must eat well every day.

464
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:20,002
Yes, Mother. You should stop here.

465
00:27:20,093 --> 00:27:21,456
If not, I can't bear to part with you later.

466
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,762
Okay, then.

467
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,828
All right. Stop crying.

468
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,618
If not, your wrinkles will grow.

469
00:27:27,094 --> 00:27:28,605
Speak for yourself.

470
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,400
See you, Mother.

471
00:27:52,776 --> 00:27:54,019
Father.

472
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,669
Fan Xian told me

473
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:02,676
that there are certain things I should say in front of you.

474
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,429
The carriage is ready.

475
00:28:12,396 --> 00:28:13,796
Thank you, Father.

476
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,242
And,

477
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:22,179
you didn't disappoint me.

478
00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:24,484
Fan Si Zhe,

479
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,709
you're my son indeed.

480
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,040
Take care.

481
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:31,919
Your mother and I

482
00:28:33,527 --> 00:28:34,927
will wait for your return.

483
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,682
What are you looking at?

484
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,882
The rain.

485
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,030
I grew up in the capital since young.

486
00:29:43,471 --> 00:29:45,261
I've seen all kinds of rain.

487
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,159
I got tired of it long ago.

488
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,070
But why does it feel like

489
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,629
I'm reluctant to part with the rain today?

490
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:58,949
You can treat it as a farewell gift from the capital.

491
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,920
The heavens were so touched that they cried.

492
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,880
Why don't you cry as well?

493
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,762
I won't.

494
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,429
I'm an adult now.

495
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,860
Adults don't cry.

496
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,389
Adults do cry too.

497
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,167
Sometimes, we feel like crying more often

498
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:23,780
when we're adults.

499
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,590
Xian, why don't you cry together with me, then?

500
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:32,612
I'm not the one traveling northward. Why should I cry?

501
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:36,350
Can't you say something nice for once?

502
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,882
What is this?

503
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,199
Are these banknotes?

504
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,021
Are all of these for me?

505
00:30:50,858 --> 00:30:51,895
That's your capital.

506
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,965
When you reach Northern Qi, your first mission is to make money.

507
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,535
You can decide on the business you want to do.

508
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:59,216
You'll bear the consequences of your actions.

509
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,640
Don't forget, you need to prove it to yourself and Father...

510
00:31:01,712 --> 00:31:03,312
All right. You can stay out of this now.

511
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,040
You need to return the money to me.

512
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,802
This is an investment.

513
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,830
I have to get my dividend when you make a profit.

514
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,429
We're brothers, you know? Why are you so calculative?

515
00:31:11,527 --> 00:31:12,989
- Give it back, then. - No.

516
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,430
Don't worry. I'll make sure you won't lose your investment.

517
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:20,149
My first mission is to make money, right?

518
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:22,042
If so, what's my second mission?

519
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,162
Do you still remember Guo Bao Kun?

520
00:31:25,397 --> 00:31:26,797
He's in Northern Qi too.

521
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,842
- Forget it. - What do you mean?

522
00:31:30,911 --> 00:31:32,581
You already gave him a harsh beating.

523
00:31:32,662 --> 00:31:34,202
You want me to silence him now?

524
00:31:34,294 --> 00:31:35,884
He's working for me right now.

525
00:31:36,648 --> 00:31:38,318
He's actually working for you?

526
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,562
Once you reach Northern Qi, your priority is to find Guo Bao Kun.

527
00:31:41,646 --> 00:31:45,277
- After that? - Now, you must remember what I'm going to tell you.

528
00:31:45,648 --> 00:31:47,078
Do not tell anyone else.

529
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,119
If so, can I tell Guo Bao Kun about it?

530
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,122
Do not tell a single soul.

531
00:31:55,796 --> 00:31:57,802
- We have to be cautious, huh? - Shut up.

532
00:32:21,142 --> 00:32:22,366
Sorry for the trouble, my brothers.

533
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,710
Chief Inspector, you're too kind.

534
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,270
They will escort you to Northern Qi.

535
00:32:28,384 --> 00:32:29,824
They'll look after you during your journey.

536
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:31,198
Who are they?

537
00:32:31,302 --> 00:32:32,692
Don't forget what I told you.

538
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,482
Take care. Go now.

539
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,522
Look after my mother on my behalf, then.

540
00:32:39,703 --> 00:32:41,732
Don't worry. I'll take care of the family.

541
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,400
Thank you, Xian.

542
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,882
I'll remember the money you gave me.

543
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:59,082
Don't worry! You won't lose your investment!

544
00:33:20,063 --> 00:33:21,306
Don't worry.

545
00:33:22,703 --> 00:33:24,722
They're experts from the Fourth Bureau.

546
00:33:25,008 --> 00:33:26,477
Your brother will be fine.

547
00:33:26,846 --> 00:33:27,956
Thank you.

548
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,479
You don't need to thank me.

549
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,510
I wouldn't even bother with you

550
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,869
had President Chen not told me to help you out.

551
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,407
I'll assume my position at the First Bureau tomorrow.

552
00:33:42,431 --> 00:33:43,911
Do you want to come and check it out?

553
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:55,362
(Lin Wan Er's Residence, Imperial Retreat)

554
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,319
Fan Xian, is that you?

555
00:34:04,423 --> 00:34:05,545
Ye Ling Er?

556
00:34:06,031 --> 00:34:07,740
Seems like my Qinggong isn't good enough.

557
00:34:07,888 --> 00:34:09,575
- Come. I need to tell you something. - Where's Wan Er?

558
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,686
- Tell me what? Where's Wan Er? - Stop interrupting me.

559
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,882
I'm forgetful.

560
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:16,055
Wan Er went into hiding as she knew that you would come here.

561
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,750
Wan Er is hiding from me? Why?

562
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:23,233
This is her message for you.

563
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:27,677
Firstly, Wan Er knows you love her. She loves you too.

564
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:29,719
Secondly, due to the first point,

565
00:34:29,831 --> 00:34:33,821
she's worried that you might be in danger after your return.

566
00:34:33,935 --> 00:34:37,044
She hopes that you can focus on your efforts in dealing with them.

567
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,958
Thirdly, due to the previous two points,

568
00:34:40,054 --> 00:34:41,805
you shouldn't find her lately.

569
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,630
She won't see you.

570
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,029
Did Wan Er actually say that?

571
00:34:47,977 --> 00:34:49,927
That's what I understood from her message.

572
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,842
She said

573
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,639
you would understand her.

574
00:35:03,544 --> 00:35:04,944
One more thing.

575
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:07,944
What was it again?

576
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:12,999
She said she would always be here for you.

577
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,007
I understand.

578
00:35:25,254 --> 00:35:27,802
If so, please relay my message to her too.

579
00:35:29,303 --> 00:35:30,703
All right. Go ahead.

580
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,682
Firstly,

581
00:35:36,383 --> 00:35:37,522
I miss you.

582
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:39,633
Secondly,

583
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,522
don't worry.

584
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:43,575
Why are you not jotting down my message?

585
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,416
There are only two phrases. Why should I jot them down?

586
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,642
You do have a point.

587
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,802
You should leave now.

588
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,509
I don't understand you at all.

589
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,509
You should see him if you desire to do so.

590
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,020
Why must you make yourself this pitiful?

591
00:36:22,162 --> 00:36:23,562
Right now,

592
00:36:24,285 --> 00:36:26,242
he should focus on his affairs.

593
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,400
I'm afraid I might try to make him stay

594
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:33,362
when I see him.

595
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:35,762
(Lin Wan Er, Daughter of Lin Ruo Fu, the Chancellor)

596
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,630
I'm so envious of you two.

597
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,910
I don't think I'll get such a relationship

598
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:44,562
in this lifetime.

599
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:49,589
Ling Er, if you're unhappy about the marriage His Majesty granted you,

600
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:52,029
let's head to the palace and see His Majesty tomorrow.

601
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,549
We can try to cancel the marriage.

602
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,350
My father will never agree to that.

603
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,759
I've already made up my mind.

604
00:36:56,783 --> 00:36:58,015
At most, I'll take my own life.

605
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:59,989
You mustn't think of something like that.

606
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:04,509
My family is already dealing with the engagement.

607
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:06,230
It's so frustrating to see.

608
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:08,842
Can I live with you

609
00:37:09,087 --> 00:37:10,487
for a few more days?

610
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:15,157
You can stay here for as long as you like.

611
00:37:45,447 --> 00:37:46,569
Father,

612
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,242
I'm back.

613
00:37:57,933 --> 00:37:59,360
Which cell are you in?

614
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,628
I'm fine now.

615
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:05,509
I'm here to take you home.

616
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,160
I'm glad that you're fine.

617
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,962
Go back now.

618
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,999
I'm doing well here.

619
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,082
I won't leave with you.

620
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:56,676
Have you ever considered

621
00:38:57,229 --> 00:39:00,180
the consequences of helping Fan Xian to fake his death?

622
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:05,238
Fan Xian entered the palace.

623
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,479
He bore the responsibility alone for his crime of deceiving His Majesty.

624
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,520
You actually knew that he deceived His Majesty, huh?

625
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,039
That phrase is often associated with

626
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,150
the annihilation of one's entire clan.

627
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,680
Blood will be shed!

628
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,750
Why did you think I remained in the cell?

629
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,750
Did you think it was just an act?

630
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:30,670
I'm prepared to lay my life down for your sake!

631
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,980
I've done my calculations.

632
00:39:32,061 --> 00:39:34,261
At most, I'll die alone. My family won't be implicated.

633
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:36,282
You've done your calculations?

634
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,305
Did you calculate the laws of Qing Kingdom

635
00:39:40,329 --> 00:39:42,759
as well as His Majesty's authority?

636
00:39:42,853 --> 00:39:44,973
I'll bear the consequences alone if anything happens.

637
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,989
You still think you did the right thing?

638
00:39:47,357 --> 00:39:48,827
Your life is worthless to you, huh?

639
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:50,345
You think death can resolve all issues?

640
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:51,759
I did it because I had no choice.

641
00:39:51,886 --> 00:39:53,115
What do you mean by that?

642
00:39:53,261 --> 00:39:55,542
What was so dire that you had to ignore the consequences?

643
00:39:56,589 --> 00:39:58,499
This incident concerns the treason of a prince.

644
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:00,534
If so, you should've discussed it with me after returning here!

645
00:40:00,558 --> 00:40:03,198
This concerns the Qing Kingdom! I can't afford to wait any longer!

646
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,322
So,

647
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:08,270
you're doing this for the Qing Kingdom?

648
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,840
Everything I did

649
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,215
was for the sake of Qing Kingdom.

650
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,559
So, you would deceive His Majesty

651
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:13,741
for the sake of Qing Kingdom?

652
00:40:13,765 --> 00:40:15,854
- The Qing Kingdom is above all else! - What about His Majesty, then?

653
00:40:15,878 --> 00:40:18,639
Of course His Majesty is as important as the world itself! However...

654
00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:24,279
But the people

655
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,056
aren't as important as the kingdom itself.

656
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,613
Yan Bing Yun, how dare you?

657
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:31,242
You taught me that we should place our kingdom above all else!

658
00:41:10,726 --> 00:41:12,317
At least you know

659
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,412
the right situation

660
00:41:14,693 --> 00:41:16,093
to utter such words.

661
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,240
I'm not that foolish.

662
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,282
Come.

663
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:41,989
It's hard to say.

664
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,282
Why are you helping him out?

665
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,479
I'm not helping him out.

666
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,759
I'm doing it for the sake of Qing Kingdom.

667
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,750
But you were cooperating with him too.

668
00:41:54,423 --> 00:41:55,522
Yes.

669
00:41:56,101 --> 00:41:58,962
Although he does ridiculous things,

670
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:02,042
he's gutsy.

671
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:04,882
So,

672
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:06,879
does that mean you're willing to aid him?

673
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,362
Why should I aid him?

674
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:16,270
He might be taking over

675
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,962
the Overwatch Council in the future.

676
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,830
President Chen is irreplaceable.

677
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,880
We're getting old now.

678
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:32,217
Does President Chen intend to retire?

679
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,079
It's not just Chen Ping Ping.

680
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:41,002
I wish to retire too.

681
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,639
It's time to hand the Overwatch Council

682
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,642
to youngsters like you all.

683
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,310
Your retirement doesn't matter.

684
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:52,429
However, President Chen cannot retire.

685
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,750
What are you saying?

686
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,682
No one in the Overwatch Council is as important as President Chen.
