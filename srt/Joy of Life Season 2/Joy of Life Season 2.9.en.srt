00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:30,997
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:34,027
(Episode 9)

3
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:36,660
Didn't he want to promote clean governance

4
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,122
and prohibit bribery?

5
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,722
But he still accepted it in the end.

6
00:01:40,213 --> 00:01:41,602
Can you say that here?

7
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,439
Shut up.

8
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:47,727
They are cleaning the streets!

9
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:51,002
- They are cleaning the streets!   - Let's go.

10
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,082
Hurry!

11
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,116
Your Highness.

12
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:17,511
Fan Xian is accepting a bribe in public.

13
00:02:17,592 --> 00:02:18,592
Indeed.

14
00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:21,639
Isn't he willingly let you hold power over him?

15
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:23,735
If Your Highness uses this opportunity to make a complaint,

16
00:02:23,886 --> 00:02:25,285
he might be chased away.

17
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,950
Ignore it.

18
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:28,031
Are you not going to complain?

19
00:02:36,503 --> 00:02:38,482
He took money from the Vegetable Inspection Office.

20
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,242
Why did he call me as well?

21
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,169
Your Highness, are you saying

22
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,762
that he did it purposely?

23
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,958
Has he surrendered

24
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,522
and wants to swear loyalty to you?

25
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,642
That's true for other people.

26
00:03:01,983 --> 00:03:03,322
But since this is Fan Xian,

27
00:03:04,086 --> 00:03:05,406
I really don't know

28
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:07,094
what he is trying to do.

29
00:03:08,558 --> 00:03:09,762
Not knowing

30
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,682
is where the fun is.

31
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:20,566
(Gear)

32
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:33,710
Your Majesty, a few censors from the Censorate

33
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:36,282
made a joint complaint about Lord Fan, Fan Xian.

34
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:44,885
- On what crimes?   - They are complaining Lord Fan of fraud,

35
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:46,253
taking bribes,

36
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:48,002
and being arrogant.

37
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,762
Give this to the Ministry of Construction.

38
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:54,537
Wait.

39
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,199
Give this booklet to Fan Xian.

40
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,119
Do you need Lord Fan's reply?

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,240
No.

42
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,802
Show it to him.

43
00:04:02,887 --> 00:04:03,887
Yes, Your Majesty.

44
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,802
A complaint?

45
00:04:15,215 --> 00:04:16,310
(Fan Residence)

46
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,522
(Chief Inspector of the Overwatch Council, Fan Xian,)

47
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,762
(accepted 3,000 taels of silver in public)

48
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,802
(and disregarded the law.)

49
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,840
(He carried out a daring act of)

50
00:04:25,943 --> 00:04:27,362
(accepting money in public.)

51
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,602
(He disregarded the Qing Kingdom's law and was detrimental to the kingdom.)

52
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,480
(We are against him)

53
00:04:34,623 --> 00:04:36,762
(and swear to get rid of him for the sake of the kingdom!)

54
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,959
"Domineering

55
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,519
and arrogant."

56
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,440
I'm really a jerk.

57
00:04:55,438 --> 00:04:57,079
I've read it. You've worked hard, Eunuch Hou.

58
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,082
Not at all. It's what I should do.

59
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,351
I'll be going back first.

60
00:05:02,818 --> 00:05:04,962
Come here. Send Eunuch Hou off.

61
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:13,769
Lord Fan,

62
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:19,531
forgive me for asking one more thing.

63
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,200
How do you plan to deal with this?

64
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,960
- Did His Majesty ask you to ask me that?   - No.

65
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,280
I'm just curious.

66
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,030
Normally, how should I deal with it?

67
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,162
The officials and censors have made complaints.

68
00:05:34,815 --> 00:05:37,494
This is serious.

69
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,960
No matter what, you need to

70
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:42,542
write a booklet to defend yourself, Lord Fan.

71
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,519
Later, you'll need to wait for His Majesty's judgment.

72
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,802
What if I don't reply to it?

73
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,560
That's not right.

74
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,239
The Censorate has made a complaint.

75
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:54,749
If you don't reply,

76
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:58,278
it's as if you are slapping the censors' mouths.

77
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,002
Not giving a reply is to slap their mouths?

78
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,440
I don't think that's enough.

79
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:08,007
Lord Fan,

80
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,880
I misspoke.

81
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:14,255
You mustn't act recklessly.

82
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,889
Did you hear?

83
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,879
Fan Xian did not submit his defense booklet

84
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,879
against our complaint.

85
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:24,382
How absurd!

86
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,120
He is so arrogant

87
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,442
and disregards the law of the Qing Kingdom.

88
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,722
He ignores the complaint.

89
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,719
He is so daring.

90
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,922
Indeed.

91
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:36,889
Also...

92
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:39,596
Who are you?

93
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,562
I am Wang Qi Nian.

94
00:06:44,782 --> 00:06:48,522
I'm here on the order of Fan Xian, the Overwatch Council's Chief Inspector,

95
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,368
to send deliver a scroll

96
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,922
to the Censorate.

97
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,601
- What scroll?   - For whom?

98
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,082
Those who complain about Lord Fan

99
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,882
can take a look.

100
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Wait.

101
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,602
Read it after I leave.

102
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,410
Who is he?

103
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,480
- Fan Xian sent him here?   - Let's read it.

104
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,160
- Fan Xian?   - Quick. Open it.

105
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,442
What did he write?

106
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,322
What is this?

107
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,562
Open it.

108
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
This...

109
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:26,334
This is...

110
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:30,548
The censors of the Censorate made a complaint about Fan Xian?

111
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:31,629
Exactly.

112
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:34,521
They are complaining about the 3,000 taels of silver

113
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:36,377
paid by the Vegetable Inspection Office's Eunuch Dai.

114
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,682
Who led them to do it?

115
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,122
I think they did it themselves.

116
00:07:43,151 --> 00:07:45,231
Fan Xian accepted the money.

117
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,722
It's reasonable for the censors to receive news.

118
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,368
3,000 taels of silver.

119
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,442
It's not something serious.

120
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,150
If Fan Xian submits a self-defense booklet,

121
00:08:04,263 --> 00:08:06,842
the Censorate will let him off.

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,402
Fan Xian didn't defend himself.

123
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,558
He sent Wang Qi Nian to the Censorate

124
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:15,282
to send a scroll to the censors who complain about him.

125
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,722
What did he write?

126
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,762
"All bark and no bite."

127
00:08:19,886 --> 00:08:21,402
Isn't he scolding us?

128
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:23,771
- How dare he say that?   - He's too daring.

129
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:25,269
He is obviously disregarding us.

130
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,190
Ridiculous!

131
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:28,555
How presumptuous.

132
00:08:28,636 --> 00:08:30,002
He's arrogant.

133
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,399
- He's too presumptuous!   - How arrogant!

134
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,314
- Complain about him!   - Yes, complain about him!

135
00:08:34,427 --> 00:08:36,024
- We must complain about him!   - Yes! Of course!

136
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,802
Complain! We must make a complaint!

137
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,802
He's calling them dogs.

138
00:08:40,973 --> 00:08:42,722
That's totally trying to offend them.

139
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,722
He's too young and acts recklessly.

140
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,922
He has completely offended the Censorate now.

141
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:51,402
I don't think this will be over soon.

142
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,282
Your Highness,

143
00:08:53,463 --> 00:08:56,042
why don't we make a complaint as well?

144
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,242
Why are we meddling in this?

145
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,042
It's a good chance to add insult to injury.

146
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,402
We still don't know if it's an injury yet.

147
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,762
We won't join in

148
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,962
and only watch the play unfold.

149
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:16,119
Are all the censors complaining?

150
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,682
Yes. There were only a few initially

151
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,642
but the Censorate shared the same hatred.

152
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:25,282
All of them are complaining about Fan Xian and you.

153
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:28,240
What does it have to do with me?

154
00:09:28,342 --> 00:09:30,822
After all, you were the one who gave the 3,000 taels of silver.

155
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:35,160
3,000 taels of silver means nothing in the capital.

156
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,880
It's a small matter.

157
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,276
You even called them dogs.

158
00:09:38,357 --> 00:09:39,639
I didn't do that.

159
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,200
From the Censorate's point of view,

160
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,479
Fan Xian and you are on the same side.

161
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:46,531
I only met him once.

162
00:09:46,612 --> 00:09:48,764
How am I on his side?

163
00:09:48,845 --> 00:09:50,165
They say

164
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,160
there was only one known meeting

165
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,439
but there might be many meetings

166
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,161
that were unreported.

167
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:57,082
The Censorate said

168
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:59,839
they already suspected you of colluding with Fan Xian.

169
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,959
They even assumed that he had become your godfather.

170
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,359
Nonsense!

171
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,199
How old am I?

172
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,439
How did he become a godfather?

173
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,120
Eunuch Dai, age is not an issue now.

174
00:10:11,215 --> 00:10:12,974
I...

175
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,049
I'm telling you...

176
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,602
Fan Xian is crazy!

177
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,384
The stubborn people at the Censorate are not afraid of death

178
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:28,920
but they are afraid of being humiliated.

179
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,719
However, he went and called them dogs.

180
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,520
He called them dogs.

181
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:53,922
Eunuch Hong,

182
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:56,522
what should I do now?

183
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,922
Eunuch Dai,

184
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,842
now that it has come to this,

185
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:01,924
it is none of your business.

186
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,718
How is it none of my business?

187
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:08,286
They are complaining about me!

188
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,882
What even is this?

189
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:38,962
You left so early.

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,301
You left earlier than me.

191
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,160
I was waiting for you.

192
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,889
Eat. You shouldn't starve in the morning.

193
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:53,442
The Vegetable Inspection Office issue is blowing up.

194
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,162
What do you want?

195
00:11:58,099 --> 00:12:00,442
The clues of Prince Cheng Ze and Northern Qi's smuggling are gone.

196
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,882
But it's all right.

197
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,362
Someone reminded me

198
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,442
that I'm not facing an issue

199
00:12:06,598 --> 00:12:07,841
but the people instead.

200
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:13,242
Don't worry. There's no one else here.

201
00:12:17,092 --> 00:12:19,136
What does this have to do with the Vegetable Inspection Office?

202
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,879
Prince Cheng Ze smuggled to get more silver.

203
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:23,718
Unspent silver is nothing but useless metal.

204
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,762
Where do you think he can spend

205
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,682
the silver he made?

206
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,570
Raising an army in secret.

207
00:12:30,736 --> 00:12:31,736
What else?

208
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,320
Bribing the officials and raising his own lineage.

209
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,040
You used the Vegetable Inspection Office

210
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,202
to investigate corruption.

211
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,602
I can investigate myself if it's within the capital

212
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:48,202
but Prince Cheng Ze

213
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,762
doesn't only have officials in the capital.

214
00:12:49,891 --> 00:12:51,960
Your Fourth Bureau is better than mine

215
00:12:52,494 --> 00:12:54,122
when it comes to investigating outside the capital.

216
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:01,607
Sure.

217
00:13:03,174 --> 00:13:04,893
I'll investigate outside the capital.

218
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:09,798
- You've agreed to help me so easily?   - I'm not doing it to help you.

219
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:10,879
I know.

220
00:13:10,975 --> 00:13:12,402
You do it for the Qing Kingdom.

221
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:16,223
Do you have any useful men?

222
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,399
Lend them to me.

223
00:13:17,558 --> 00:13:19,639
Do you need more men when you manage the Fourth Bureau?

224
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,349
The leader of the Fourth Bureau is my father, not me.

225
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,594
What's the difference?

226
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,485
I don't want the Overwatch Council to be inherited by a son.

227
00:13:30,016 --> 00:13:31,042
How can I not distinguish public and private matters

228
00:13:31,123 --> 00:13:32,602
when serving loyalty to the kingdom?

229
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,679
Lord Fan. Young Master Yan.

230
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,202
Qi Nian.

231
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,642
Gao Da.

232
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:47,722
Help Young Master Yan do something recently.

233
00:13:47,803 --> 00:13:48,803
Yes.

234
00:13:51,022 --> 00:13:52,442
I'll obey Young Master Yan's orders.

235
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,199
Gao Da, I remember you belong to the Tiger Guards.

236
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,000
Yes. But from today onward,

237
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,329
our group

238
00:13:58,446 --> 00:14:00,447
will work under Lord Fan.

239
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:05,379
The Tiger Guards are a part of the imperial army.

240
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,922
They only obey His Majesty.

241
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,231
Yes. He sent me Gao Da when I needed someone.

242
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,559
Sometimes, I'm not sure

243
00:14:12,662 --> 00:14:14,782
what His Majesty is thinking about.

244
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,317
- The emperor's intent is hard to guess.   - Indeed.

245
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:21,402
Are you leaving just like that?

246
00:14:26,662 --> 00:14:27,805
Why aren't you leaving?

247
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,722
You haven't paid.

248
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,129
Do I need to pay for this?

249
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,642
Before you came here,

250
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:35,119
Lord Fan said

251
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,119
he would reserve the whole place.

252
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:40,282
I don't know what that means

253
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,920
but I think the filling,

254
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,000
the dough, the firewood, and the water

255
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:47,494
are all calculated as costs.

256
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,759
Gao Da,

257
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:49,962
ask the soldiers

258
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,962
to wrap the remaining meat buns.

259
00:14:52,253 --> 00:14:55,173
- Sure.   - As for the filling, I'll take it home

260
00:14:55,254 --> 00:14:58,094
and make some meatballs for Ba Ba.

261
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:04,847
The filling smells nice.

262
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:11,494
This meat is delicious.

263
00:15:37,662 --> 00:15:38,662
Master,

264
00:15:38,786 --> 00:15:39,955
I heard there have been

265
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:41,725
more booklets complaining about Fan Xian

266
00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:43,017
from the Censorate recently.

267
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,490
Is it?

268
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,719
You're still not anxious at a time like this?

269
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,827
The censors at the Censorate are scolding your mother.

270
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,909
Not only that.

271
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,389
They are even scolding about ancestors.

272
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,562
Aren't the censors all scholars?

273
00:15:56,825 --> 00:15:58,630
Scholars are human too.

274
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,159
They are rude when they are backed into a corner.

275
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,550
That's a little sarcastic.

276
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:05,042
What should we do now?

277
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,202
Why not send them some gifts?

278
00:16:07,638 --> 00:16:08,882
There's no use.

279
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,999
The censors of the Censorate care about reputation.

280
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:14,917
Forget about the "All Bark and No Bite" scroll.

281
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:17,079
After countless complaints,

282
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,423
the act of Fan Xian not writing a booklet to defend himself

283
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,522
and only enjoying himself

284
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,962
without any regard for the Censorate.

285
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:26,762
How can the Censorate endure

286
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,322
such a great humiliation?

287
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,440
Are all scholars so petty?

288
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,322
You aren't one of them.

289
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,442
Seriously. Why did you offend them for no reason?

290
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,922
Why don't I enter the palace

291
00:16:41,114 --> 00:16:42,589
and ask Her Majesty

292
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,948
to see if you can have an opportunity to apologize to the Censorate?

293
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,559
No.

294
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:50,402
You are not Aunt Liu.

295
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,719
Aunt Liu doesn't care about this.

296
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,922
Cut it out.

297
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,842
I'm shocked by how well you treat me.

298
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,442
Si Zhe is...

299
00:16:59,774 --> 00:17:01,202
Si Zhe is fine.

300
00:18:09,943 --> 00:18:11,202
What's the situation?

301
00:18:11,294 --> 00:18:14,242
I had a look. There are no movements to the Northern Qi troops.

302
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,882
I think they only have these men left.

303
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,522
Prepare to attack.

304
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,999
Apart from Fan Si Zhe,

305
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,562
no one must be kept alive.

306
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:26,903
Remember. We are the imperial army of Northern Qi.

307
00:18:28,283 --> 00:18:29,723
This is not related to the Qing Kingdom.

308
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,442
Weren't you being rational

309
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,842
when you advised Si Zhe to leave the capital?

310
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,697
Why did you become willful all of a sudden?

311
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,156
There are so many booklets of complaint.

312
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:14,802
You should write a self-defense booklet at least.

313
00:19:14,883 --> 00:19:16,122
You can't them do as they wish.

314
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:17,278
Enough.

315
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,842
Fan Xian is not Si Zhe.

316
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:20,602
He knows what to do.

317
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:23,602
How can you complain about Si Zhe?

318
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,842
Aunt is right.

319
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,719
There should be a reply

320
00:19:30,854 --> 00:19:32,682
to the Censorate's complaint.

321
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,202
How will you do it?

322
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,642
You'll know later.

323
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,802
- There's a lot of meat today.   - Yes. It's delicious.

324
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,960
Not bad.

325
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,762
Eat more.

326
00:19:46,037 --> 00:19:47,242
Eat more.

327
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,162
It's so delicious.

328
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:51,162
Not bad.

329
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,079
- Delicious.   - Yes.

330
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,880
Lord Fan.

331
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Lord Fan.

332
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,279
No one gave us the meat.

333
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:05,519
The First Bureau of the Overwatch Council

334
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:07,442
bought it with its own money.

335
00:20:07,632 --> 00:20:08,842
It's justifiable.

336
00:20:08,964 --> 00:20:10,080
Do you want some?

337
00:20:10,214 --> 00:20:11,214
No need.

338
00:20:11,682 --> 00:20:12,802
Eat well.

339
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:14,482
You can only do your job well when you're full.

340
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,769
What?

341
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,962
Yes. What's so great about you?

342
00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:53,865
There's no need to kneel. Stand firm.

343
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
Yes.

344
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:00,722
I haven't been here for days. Is the First Bureau doing well?

345
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:02,762
Thanks to you, Chief Inspector.

346
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,959
Everything is normal

347
00:21:05,085 --> 00:21:06,525
and in order.

348
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:08,231
How do they describe me in private?

349
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:10,722
Naturally...

350
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:14,278
Naturally, they respect you a lot.

351
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,359
Is it true?

352
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:17,602
- Yes.   - Let me take a guess.

353
00:21:20,168 --> 00:21:22,122
"On his first day at the First Bureau,

354
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,640
he talked big

355
00:21:23,737 --> 00:21:26,440
but he accepted 3,000 taels of silver from Eunuch Dai on that day.

356
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:29,206
He says one thing and does another. He's shameless when it comes to money."

357
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:30,665
Is that what they say?

358
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,440
Not at all.

359
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,362
Are you only eating this?

360
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,999
Sorry that you have to see this.

361
00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:42,842
Isn't the First Bureau having meat stew today?

362
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:46,800
I'm just simply eating

363
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,247
because I have a lot of work to do.

364
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,320
I heard the meat stew was paid

365
00:21:52,423 --> 00:21:54,042
from the official accounts.

366
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:56,016
Of course. After your admonition,

367
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:58,239
none of us dare to take any more gifts.

368
00:21:58,334 --> 00:22:00,054
Where did you get the money for the meat then?

369
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:03,322
Didn't you say it's from the official accounts?

370
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,242
I've seen the accounts.

371
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:11,996
There's a difference in the last few days.

372
00:22:12,342 --> 00:22:13,592
There are 50 taels more.

373
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:17,919
So using some silver to buy meat

374
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:19,886
is a way of thanking the others.

375
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:21,122
Of course, you know that.

376
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,482
I know.

377
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,640
Where did the extra 50 taels come from?

378
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:29,162
There are a lot of miscellaneous tasks.

379
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,558
Having 50 taels extra won't hurt.

380
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:35,216
Back at the Vegetable Inspection Office that day,

381
00:22:35,695 --> 00:22:37,615
how much did Wang Qi Nian

382
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,890
gave you?

383
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,002
Lord Fan,

384
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,442
it was 50 taels of silver.

385
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,719
You recorded the money in the official accounts?

386
00:22:52,349 --> 00:22:56,362
I owed the bureau money

387
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,719
so I returned it.

388
00:22:57,822 --> 00:22:58,882
You owed money?

389
00:22:59,047 --> 00:23:00,202
Is there proof?

390
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:08,322
I've read your file recently.

391
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,070
Deng Zi Yue,

392
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,039
you've never taken any Yunmeng Fish

393
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,922
sent here by the Vegetable Inspection Office.

394
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:22,962
Lord Fan, I don't like to eat fish.

395
00:23:25,062 --> 00:23:28,463
You don't like to eat fish and meat, right?

396
00:23:30,782 --> 00:23:32,282
You said you used your own money

397
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:34,566
when the First Bureau is having meat today.

398
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:37,562
However, you are eating this yourself.

399
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,390
What?

400
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:42,762
Do you think this is dirty money?

401
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:45,239
- I dare not.   - Why not?

402
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,042
You've been doing it many times.

403
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:48,429
The Vegetable Inspection Office

404
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:51,639
not only sent fish but also various delicacies every day over the years.

405
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,359
Everyone from the bureau got them.

406
00:23:53,455 --> 00:23:55,242
You were the only one who didn't want it.

407
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:56,922
Besides,

408
00:23:57,057 --> 00:23:59,414
you didn't accept any of the lavish gifts

409
00:23:59,502 --> 00:24:01,365
from various departments in the capital

410
00:24:01,446 --> 00:24:03,282
including agate mahjong tiles and white jade dice.

411
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,562
Deng Zi Yue, you are a man of integrity.

412
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,671
You are amazing!

413
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,242
But I don't get it.

414
00:24:13,663 --> 00:24:15,442
Since you are a man of integrity,

415
00:24:15,805 --> 00:24:17,522
why didn't you report it?

416
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:19,482
I know my crime!

417
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,399
Don't be in a rush to kneel.

418
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:22,759
Am I accusing you?

419
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:24,829
I'm asking you why didn't you report it!

420
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,559
Lord Fan,

421
00:24:27,663 --> 00:24:30,082
relationships are important in politics.

422
00:24:30,744 --> 00:24:33,545
There's no need to offend people. Right?

423
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
Is that so?

424
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,282
This is how you behave now.

425
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,038
This wasn't how Deng Zi Yue behaved in the past.

426
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:42,642
Back then, Deng Zi Yue was generous.

427
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:45,431
You scolded anyone from the bureau

428
00:24:45,512 --> 00:24:46,992
who lied and gained profit

429
00:24:47,073 --> 00:24:49,442
including your direct superior.

430
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,402
I'm ashamed.

431
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,600
I was foolish back then.

432
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,880
When did you stop scolding

433
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,242
and start kneeling?

434
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,569
Lord Fan, I...

435
00:25:08,928 --> 00:25:11,162
I didn't know how the world works

436
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,842
and acted arrogantly.

437
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,120
I know better now.

438
00:25:16,201 --> 00:25:17,322
What do you know?

439
00:25:17,406 --> 00:25:18,766
I know...

440
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,682
I know I shouldn't work alone as an official.

441
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,359
I must blend in with the others.

442
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,162
Blend in with the others?

443
00:25:27,243 --> 00:25:29,203
Then, you should take the fish!

444
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,762
If you blend in with the others,

445
00:25:31,728 --> 00:25:33,442
why can't you afford to wear a shirt?

446
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,529
Deng Zi Yue.

447
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:38,941
You were born in Dingzhou to a poor family.

448
00:25:39,043 --> 00:25:40,742
You used to raise horses with the frontier troops.

449
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:44,142
The deputy general of the frontier troops faked the accounts

450
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,792
and embezzled silver with the excuse of buying fodder.

451
00:25:46,942 --> 00:25:48,162
It was you

452
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:51,202
who fought your way out after being surrounded

453
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:53,160
and sent evidence of the crime to the Overwatch Council.

454
00:25:53,247 --> 00:25:56,362
The president permitted you to join the council because you were upright.

455
00:25:56,495 --> 00:25:57,962
Am I wrong?

456
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,679
I didn't expect you to investigate that.

457
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:06,360
You came from a poor background and swore to uphold your dignity

458
00:26:06,456 --> 00:26:08,522
even if you had no money when you were young.

459
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,640
Back in Dingzhou,

460
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:13,318
you rushed into the Overwatch Council covered in blood

461
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,602
and asked to uphold the law of the kingdom.

462
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,802
Do you still remember that?

463
00:26:20,086 --> 00:26:21,246
Lord Fan,

464
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:24,042
I still remember.

465
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,202
Right now,

466
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
do you think you were foolish back then?

467
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,482
The world is unjust.

468
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,292
I attracted fury with my blood.

469
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:50,270
I was foolish so be it, Lord Fan.

470
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,160
You were foolish so be it?

471
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
Deng Zi Yue,

472
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,562
what made you turn into this?

473
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,362
You bow down

474
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,922
and you kneel.

475
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,722
I wonder if you would cry back then

476
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,082
if you knew what Deng Zi Yue has become now.

477
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:17,703
Lord Fan,

478
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:22,706
being an official is all about relationships. Right?

479
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,002
I know.

480
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,759
You had an opportunity to be promoted to deputy supervisor

481
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:29,360
but your righteous words kept getting you demoted.

482
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,549
In the end, you were demoted

483
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,711
into a lowly accountant.

484
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,161
You've conceded

485
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,522
after so many years.

486
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,065
Yes. I've conceded.

487
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,162
Then, you should've conceded completely,

488
00:27:43,238 --> 00:27:44,402
Deng Zi Yue!

489
00:27:45,102 --> 00:27:46,602
Didn't you say you were blending in?

490
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,640
You are already doing this

491
00:27:48,743 --> 00:27:51,143
so why is there a need to report 50 taels of silver?

492
00:27:51,478 --> 00:27:54,442
Why can't you accept the gifts sent to the bureau?

493
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
In that case,

494
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,802
why are you still upholding the law?

495
00:28:00,026 --> 00:28:01,900
Are you trying to save a little dignity for yourself

496
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:05,242
or do you want others to praise your integrity?

497
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,842
I'm asking you!

498
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
Lord Fan.

499
00:28:16,837 --> 00:28:17,837
Lord Fan.

500
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,042
Look at me.

501
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,111
I no longer have any integrity.

502
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:30,922
I, Deng Zi Yue,

503
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:35,002
am only protecting myself.

504
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,882
Protecting myself is good enough.

505
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,122
We are the same.

506
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:56,882
To be honest,

507
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:00,600
I also want to protect myself.

508
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:05,639
If I'm unhappy with something, I can't endure it.

509
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,602
I must take revenge on those who go against me.

510
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,440
With my temper, how did I achieve

511
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,362
my current position?

512
00:29:17,726 --> 00:29:19,008
It's because

513
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,442
your huge ambition is unparalleled.

514
00:29:22,574 --> 00:29:23,824
It's not related.

515
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,322
That means

516
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,840
your literary talent is astonishing.

517
00:29:29,927 --> 00:29:31,242
That's far-fetched.

518
00:29:32,134 --> 00:29:33,134
Lord Fan,

519
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,730
I don't know.

520
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,600
Because I have someone to protect me.

521
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,691
With my temper,

522
00:29:41,886 --> 00:29:43,258
I can't live more than three days in the capital

523
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:45,042
without someone to protect me.

524
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
Right?

525
00:29:48,965 --> 00:29:50,165
To become a good person,

526
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,842
you first need someone to support you.

527
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:53,162
Deng Zi Yue,

528
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,522
do you have one?

529
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,602
- I don't.   - You do now.

530
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:01,642
From now on,

531
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:03,602
I will be your support.

532
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:07,402
Try to find your past self.

533
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,042
Try to raise your bottom line.

534
00:30:10,253 --> 00:30:11,442
Don't be afraid of causing trouble.

535
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:12,819
I will protect you.

536
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:16,160
- Lord Fan.   - I know you can't fully trust me now.

537
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:17,566
There's no rush.

538
00:30:17,974 --> 00:30:19,813
We don't believe in what others say

539
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:22,137
but what others do.

540
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,762
Come. Get to work.

541
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:27,920
Lord Fan, what work?

542
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,199
Help me write a self-defense booklet.

543
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,800
Send it with the First Bureau's name.

544
00:30:31,888 --> 00:30:32,888
Lord Fan,

545
00:30:33,761 --> 00:30:34,780
I shouldn't write it.

546
00:30:34,861 --> 00:30:36,002
I'm bad at handwriting.

547
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,319
Yes.

548
00:30:44,668 --> 00:30:46,188
There's no need to make more ink. Just write.

549
00:30:47,006 --> 00:30:49,966
Lord Fan, this much ink is only enough for a few words.

550
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:51,558
It's enough.

551
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,034
(Self-defense Booklet of Fan Xian)

552
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,082
- Fan Xian's self-defense booklet is sent to the palace?   - Yes.

553
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:11,362
I think he can't stand it anymore.

554
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,562
It's already too late.

555
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,598
The censors are all agitated.

556
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,549
No matter how wonderful he wrote,

557
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,042
they might not be able to forgive him.

558
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,440
It's not wonderful.

559
00:31:22,183 --> 00:31:24,002
There are only eight words.

560
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:26,682
What are they?

561
00:31:40,543 --> 00:31:42,842
Self-Defense Booklet of Fan Xian?

562
00:31:44,101 --> 00:31:46,122
"Treacherous officials are running rampant.

563
00:31:47,868 --> 00:31:49,282
What crimes do I have?"

564
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,848
"Treacherous officials are running rampant.

565
00:31:54,983 --> 00:31:56,602
What crimes do I have?"

566
00:31:57,446 --> 00:31:59,162
Since the establishment of the Qing Kingdom,

567
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,120
there has never been a self-defense booklet like this.

568
00:32:01,256 --> 00:32:02,682
Not just the Qing Kingdom.

569
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:04,679
This should be the first one in history.

570
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,482
I thought "All Bark and No Bite" was the ultimate humiliation.

571
00:32:07,563 --> 00:32:08,682
I was wrong.

572
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,002
This booklet

573
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:12,162
is the pinnacle.

574
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,360
However, isn't it more evil

575
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,829
to call them dogs?

576
00:32:17,087 --> 00:32:18,087
Your Highness.

577
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,680
Calling them dogs

578
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,242
might make them angry

579
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,082
but they are just words of scolding.

580
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,242
The censors care about reputation.

581
00:32:26,406 --> 00:32:28,326
Calling them treacherous officials

582
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,082
is destroying the foundation of the Censorate.

583
00:32:33,664 --> 00:32:36,602
(Censorate of Qing Kingdom)

584
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,802
This is too much!

585
00:32:47,464 --> 00:32:49,202
The handwriting is good.

586
00:32:51,734 --> 00:32:52,984
Did he write it?

587
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:55,770
I think the First Bureau of the Overwatch Council wrote it.

588
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,562
I was wondering.

589
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,690
Poetic Genius,

590
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:03,842
how embarrassing.

591
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,802
The Censorate.

592
00:33:11,302 --> 00:33:12,552
Fan Xian.

593
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,802
Both of them won't give in.

594
00:33:21,361 --> 00:33:23,362
Let them confront each other in the hall then.

595
00:33:28,134 --> 00:33:29,442
At the audience tomorrow,

596
00:33:29,523 --> 00:33:31,522
Fan Xian and the censors will confront each other.

597
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:33,242
The edict has been issued.

598
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,440
Interesting.

599
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,920
I must watch it tomorrow myself.

600
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:39,362
Speaking of which,

601
00:33:39,478 --> 00:33:42,082
Fan Xian has never stepped foot in the hall since he entered the capital.

602
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,762
Tomorrow will be his first.

603
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,479
A duel during his first time at the hall.

604
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:47,122
His future is bright.

605
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,479
Perhaps the censors will beat him.

606
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:51,751
That's hard to say.

607
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,362
We'll just watch and enjoy the duel.

608
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,049
Naturally.

609
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:07,482
- Bi An.   - Yes.

610
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:10,238
Prepare the scroll for the Moon Embracing Pavilion.

611
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,242
I'll bring it to the hall tomorrow.

612
00:34:12,378 --> 00:34:15,319
Your Highness, are you trying to help the Censorate defeat Fan Xian?

613
00:34:17,863 --> 00:34:19,562
It's not wrong to be prepared.

614
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,402
He has been sweeping for a long time.

615
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
He is calming himself.

616
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,242
It's Fan Xian's first morning audience tomorrow.

617
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,200
If he causes a big fuss,

618
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,322
you must take care of him.

619
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,439
I manage the Ministry of Revenue.

620
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:49,680
I shouldn't meddle in his dispute against the Censorate.

621
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,439
Why do you care?

622
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:53,002
You are both from the Fan family.

623
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,639
There are so many people in the Censorate but Fan Xian is alone.

624
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,880
How can he fight them?

625
00:34:56,976 --> 00:34:58,402
You don't understand.

626
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,559
I shouldn't speak tomorrow.

627
00:35:00,685 --> 00:35:03,246
Otherwise, it'll be disadvantageous to him.

628
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:06,839
Whether Si Zhe can come back depends on Fan Xian.

629
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,879
Nothing must happen to him.

630
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,919
Don't worry.

631
00:35:11,262 --> 00:35:13,302
If his life is in danger,

632
00:35:13,835 --> 00:35:16,482
I'll risk my life to protect him.

633
00:35:16,975 --> 00:35:19,202
You are really nice to Fan Xian.

634
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,082
I'm also treating Si Zhe the same.

635
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:25,000
You should treat your own life better as well.

636
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:45,637
Are you going to keep standing on top

637
00:35:45,718 --> 00:35:47,162
if I don't see you?

638
00:35:49,124 --> 00:35:50,322
Why didn't you ask your subordinate to do this?

639
00:35:50,403 --> 00:35:52,602
I have limbs. I don't want to trouble other people.

640
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,042
President Chen wants me to tell you

641
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,922
that the result of Yan Bing Yun's investigation

642
00:35:56,003 --> 00:35:57,482
is already in his hands.

643
00:35:57,582 --> 00:36:00,023
Lord Fan, you may go to the audience with peace of mind.

644
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,762
Thank Bing Yun for me.

645
00:36:02,005 --> 00:36:03,005
Lord Fan,

646
00:36:03,221 --> 00:36:06,941
has Wu Zhu returned to the capital?

647
00:36:08,511 --> 00:36:10,162
Is this a question from President Chen too?

648
00:36:10,511 --> 00:36:11,793
I'm the one who wants to know.

649
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:15,602
I don't know.

650
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,322
Your Highness.

651
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,530
Your Highness.

652
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,289
Your Highness.

653
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,919
Your Highness, why are you standing here?

654
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,162
I'm waiting for you.

655
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,882
You're here to laugh at me.

656
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,322
Why are you doing this?

657
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
I don't understand.

658
00:37:22,662 --> 00:37:25,562
Do you know why no one is opposing the censors?

659
00:37:26,943 --> 00:37:29,960
You gain nothing if you win against these literary officials,

660
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,842
but if you lose, it'll be eternal doom for you.

661
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,031
Why do you need to lower yourself to their level?

662
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:37,362
Perhaps we might make up and become friends later.

663
00:37:37,654 --> 00:37:39,534
If that happens, you can use my head as a ball.

664
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,322
Your Highness, there's no need for that.

665
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,002
Just be careful later.

666
00:37:44,138 --> 00:37:45,562
Take a step back if you can't do it.

667
00:37:45,635 --> 00:37:46,875
I'll plead for you.

668
00:37:47,923 --> 00:37:49,890
There's no need. However,

669
00:37:50,293 --> 00:37:51,937
I do want to request for your help.

670
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:53,639
Tell me about it.

671
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,322
I'm sure you know

672
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:57,242
that this is my first audience.

673
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:02,439
I know nothing about the customs and rules.

674
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:03,672
I need someone to teach me.

675
00:38:03,808 --> 00:38:05,842
Lord Xin, I was looking for you.

676
00:38:05,923 --> 00:38:06,923
Is that so?

677
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,880
Lord Xin.

678
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:11,882
I must talk to you about this.

679
00:38:11,963 --> 00:38:12,963
Xin Qi Wu!

680
00:38:16,214 --> 00:38:17,214
Come here.

681
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,842
Your Highness.

682
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:24,999
Lord Fan.

683
00:38:25,474 --> 00:38:27,518
What was wrong with me?

684
00:38:27,621 --> 00:38:29,542
Why didn't I see both of you?

685
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,642
Accompany Fan Xian to the audience.

686
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:36,162
If he doesn't know about the customs, teach him.

687
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:38,362
Of course.

688
00:38:38,447 --> 00:38:39,447
Of course.

689
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:41,469
Then,

690
00:38:41,661 --> 00:38:42,824
take good care of yourself.

691
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:50,032
Lord Xin!

692
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,522
- Lord Fan.   - Why didn't you ask me out for a drink?

693
00:38:57,431 --> 00:38:58,870
I'm busy with official matters.

694
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,402
Lord Xin, you've worked hard.

695
00:39:02,101 --> 00:39:03,602
If it's too exhausting,

696
00:39:03,863 --> 00:39:06,802
you can claim to be sick and take a few days off.

697
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,880
You are right.

698
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:11,079
However, it's too late.

699
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,482
His Highness left.

700
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:17,442
Why do they keep staring at us?

701
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,919
They are the censors from the Censorate.

702
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,802
I see.

703
00:39:27,831 --> 00:39:30,310
Why do they keep staring at you?

704
00:39:31,307 --> 00:39:32,507
Do you have a grudge against them?

705
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,922
There are two more of them.

706
00:39:41,165 --> 00:39:42,165
Lord Fan,

707
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,322
let me tell you honestly.

708
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:48,202
Right now, anyone who stands with you

709
00:39:48,351 --> 00:39:50,882
will have a grudge against them

710
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,562
which is irreconcilable.

711
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,402
Don't worry, Lord Xin.

712
00:39:57,591 --> 00:39:58,832
You just need to watch

713
00:39:58,958 --> 00:40:00,238
what happens in the hall later.

714
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,082
Don't speak for me.

715
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,962
Control yourself.

716
00:40:05,878 --> 00:40:07,120
I'll do my best.

717
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,480
Well,

718
00:40:08,634 --> 00:40:09,762
Lord Fan.

719
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:11,322
Allow me to say something.

720
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:13,600
The anger inside

721
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,079
the censors of the Censorate...

722
00:40:16,221 --> 00:40:17,362
Must be blown up.

723
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,480
What?

724
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,122
Nothing. Continue.

725
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,242
They will never forgive you.

726
00:40:23,451 --> 00:40:25,119
So, you must

727
00:40:25,229 --> 00:40:26,762
take them on with caution.

728
00:40:26,974 --> 00:40:28,322
What a coincidence.

729
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
What?

730
00:40:31,023 --> 00:40:32,902
I never plan to forgive them as well.

731
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:41,602
Lord Xin, tell me.

732
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,802
How many people came here today

733
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:47,160
just to watch the show unfold?

734
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:54,929
I'm afraid all of them are.

735
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:57,669
What if the ones who came to watch the show

736
00:40:57,757 --> 00:40:59,598
become a part of the show themselves?

737
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,160
Let's go.

738
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:07,605
Lord Fan.

739
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,042
What are you going to do?

740
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,320
- Good morning.   - Good morning.

741
00:41:40,438 --> 00:41:41,642
Good morning.

742
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,199
Good morning.

743
00:41:43,391 --> 00:41:44,922
Good morning.

744
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:46,362
Good morning.

745
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,722
Good morning, everyone.

746
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:50,322
Good morning!

747
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:52,301
Lord Fan.

748
00:41:53,629 --> 00:41:56,282
His Majesty is not here yet. Do you see this?

749
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,042
Do you see this place?

750
00:41:58,199 --> 00:41:59,799
This is where the literary officials stand.

751
00:42:00,054 --> 00:42:02,384
Later, you will stand over there.

752
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:03,639
Stand over there.

753
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,122
As for me,

754
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:06,519
I'll stand over there.

755
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:08,722
I'll head over there first.

756
00:42:09,868 --> 00:42:11,118
His Majesty is not here yet.

757
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:13,442
- Let's talk.   - What's there to talk about?

758
00:42:13,543 --> 00:42:14,922
What did you eat this morning?

759
00:42:15,211 --> 00:42:16,746
The meat patty in the West Market is not bad.

760
00:42:18,544 --> 00:42:20,558
I don't think this is the largest hall.

761
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:22,882
His Majesty needs to judge this.

762
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,489
Indeed.

763
00:42:25,717 --> 00:42:28,520
His Majesty said the Main Hall is too huge.

764
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:31,039
It can't be filled and speeches cannot be heard clearly

765
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,562
so he moved the morning audience here.

766
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,162
I see.

767
00:42:35,246 --> 00:42:37,122
Then, I'll head over there first.

768
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,682
What's this?

769
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,202
A seat granted by His Majesty.

770
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,882
Even the crown prince is standing. Who is he?

771
00:42:57,078 --> 00:42:59,559
The chief councilor, Qin Ye.
