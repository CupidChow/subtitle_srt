00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:30,976
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:34,002
(Episode 13)

3
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,102
My life is on the line.

4
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,930
I haven't been this excited for so long.

5
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,500
Miss Ye,

6
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:14,450
are you busy later?

7
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,020
No.

8
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,761
If so,

9
00:02:25,142 --> 00:02:26,882
please send me home.

10
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:30,530
If I do die on the way back,

11
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:32,177
please collect

12
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,802
my body for me.

13
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,500
Qi Nian,

14
00:03:14,768 --> 00:03:16,538
what did Deng Zi Yue tell you just now?

15
00:03:16,717 --> 00:03:17,717
You guys were acting mysteriously.

16
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:21,110
He said he found leads on the murderer in Moon Embracing Pavilion.

17
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:23,042
He brought his men there to check it out.

18
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:25,482
- What else is there?   - And,

19
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,882
President Chen is concerned about your injury.

20
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:30,394
He wants you to head to his residence.

21
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,160
So, are we heading to his residence now?

22
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,460
That's right.

23
00:03:37,111 --> 00:03:38,602
Have you been there before?

24
00:03:39,532 --> 00:03:42,310
No. I've never been there even since I came to the capital.

25
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,659
What about you?

26
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,802
I heard President Chen was living outside the city or in the mountains.

27
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:50,802
He's so mysterious.

28
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,859
Wan Er,

29
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,677
I was very touched when I heard what you said

30
00:04:01,192 --> 00:04:02,602
in front of Li Cheng Ze.

31
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,722
Actually, the trip to Northern Qi was perilous.

32
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,359
Shen Zhong was tough to deal with.

33
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,200
I confronted him many times.

34
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,639
I was dwelling between life and death all the time.

35
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:17,122
I was lucky that I got to come back alive.

36
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,929
I don't like

37
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:25,778
Northern Qi at all.

38
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,642
I never want to go there again.

39
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,322
Now that Shen Zhong is dead, many of them hate me.

40
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,162
They spread rumors about me to ruin my reputation.

41
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:36,719
- Really?   - Of course.

42
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,020
You can ask Qi Nian if you don't believe me.

43
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:39,212
I'll testify for him.

44
00:04:39,293 --> 00:04:42,362
Lord Fan was speaking the truth.

45
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,700
You see?

46
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:49,162
Last night the rain was light, the wind was fierce,

47
00:04:49,342 --> 00:04:51,682
and deep sleep did not dispel the effects of wine.

48
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:54,322
When I ask the maid rolling up the curtains,

49
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,842
she answers, "The crab-apple blossoms look the same."

50
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,722
I cry, "Can't you see? Can't you see?

51
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,602
The green leaves are fresh but the red flowers are fading."

52
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:11,141
He's done for.

53
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:17,562
What an excellent poem.

54
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:19,362
I heard that you wrote it.

55
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:21,207
That's not true.

56
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,722
You didn't write it?

57
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,282
I copied it from somewhere else.

58
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,002
Oh yeah.

59
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,123
You said you got your poems from your dreams.

60
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,842
You didn't write them yourself.

61
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,639
I won't copy poems again.

62
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,530
It's bad to deceive the world.

63
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:37,121
If so, this poem is your last, then?

64
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,602
What a masterpiece.

65
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,080
Wan Er, the situation was grave back then.

66
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,677
Haitang Duo Duo was there to kill Xiao En.

67
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:44,688
I used that poem to save him.

68
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:46,047
Excellent choice.

69
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,922
The poem suits her perfectly.

70
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,722
Our lives were on the line.

71
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,562
I didn't dare to take it lightly.

72
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,539
You did it out of self-defense?

73
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,900
That's right.

74
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,556
If so, on the birthday banquet of Northern Qi's empress dowager,

75
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:03,256
did you dance together with Haitang Duo Duo to save yourself?

76
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,086
That was a competition.

77
00:06:06,704 --> 00:06:08,326
You promised me that you wouldn't lie to me.

78
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:09,656
It was truly a competition.

79
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:15,802
However, the process wasn't that strict.

80
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,280
Wan Er, to be honest,

81
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,548
Haitang Duo Duo does get along well

82
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,082
with me.

83
00:06:24,198 --> 00:06:25,562
I take her as a friend.

84
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,953
She's only a friend. That's all.

85
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:36,162
I swear. I'm not lying.

86
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:44,922
I'm asking you this because I'm worried about Miss Haitang.

87
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:46,882
Why are you worried about her?

88
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:49,122
She's the disciple of Master Ku He.

89
00:06:49,236 --> 00:06:50,388
She's the Saintess of Northern Qi.

90
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:53,002
How could she be a concubine?

91
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,642
These two matters aren't related at all. That won't happen.

92
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,402
If so, when will you write a poem for me, then?

93
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:08,162
That's quite difficult.

94
00:07:08,724 --> 00:07:10,324
Why is it difficult when it's my turn?

95
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:13,416
That's not it. I can copy poems for other people.

96
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,380
But for you,

97
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,682
I want to write it myself.

98
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:19,322
You have to give me some time.

99
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,739
How long do I have to wait?

100
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:26,223
It's best if you can wait for the rest of your life.

101
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:50,402
(Chen Manor)

102
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:02,428
Don't you think this manor is gigantic?

103
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,362
Why isn't there anyone here?

104
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:20,561
Hurry up!

105
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:21,953
Miss.

106
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,340
Excuse me.

107
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,202
- Do you know where President Chen is?   - Ping Ping? In the backyard.

108
00:08:27,727 --> 00:08:28,947
Thanks.

109
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,602
Ladies, the chilled yogurt is ready.

110
00:08:35,103 --> 00:08:36,323
Give it a try.

111
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,139
- The chilled yogurt is ready.   - The yogurt is ready?

112
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,540
- Ladies, have a try.   - Let's try it.

113
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,024
- Is it nice?   - Yeah.

114
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,340
Push me.

115
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,162
When's my turn?

116
00:08:47,591 --> 00:08:49,162
Wait a little longer.

117
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,602
Push me higher!

118
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,362
Put your back into it!

119
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,682
The wind is here!

120
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,322
I'm losing the kite!

121
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,122
Help me out!

122
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:15,562
This smells so nice.

123
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,439
That's Qin Heng,

124
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,922
the son of Qin Ye.

125
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:16,282
He'll also be a mainstay in the military in the future.

126
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,802
How much do you think it'll cost

127
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,642
to build a giant manor like this?

128
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,682
No one will ask about that.

129
00:10:26,464 --> 00:10:28,682
Is it because he's Chen Ping Ping?

130
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,842
(The wind so swift,)

131
00:10:55,537 --> 00:10:57,402
(the sky so wide,)

132
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:06,642
(apes wail and cry!)

133
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,490
(Water so clear)

134
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:23,729
(and beach so white,)

135
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:33,242
(birds wheel and fly!)

136
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:44,162
- Lord Fan.   - (The boundless forest)

137
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:48,682
(sheds its leaves)

138
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,762
(shower by shower.)

139
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:54,068
Lord Fan,

140
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,802
isn't he reciting your poem?

141
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,479
Lord Fan, I've long heard of you.

142
00:11:58,574 --> 00:12:01,122
It's an honor to see you in person.

143
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,559
I was lucky enough to witness General Qin's flair in person.

144
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,719
The Qin family has been revered by all for generations.

145
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,319
Did you meet him in the court?

146
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:08,627
That's right.

147
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,362
If so, I'm sure you didn't witness his flair.

148
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,729
My father always sleeps when he attends a court session.

149
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,209
I'll be thanking the heavens if he didn't snore.

150
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,599
The court was pretty noisy. I couldn't tell that he was sleeping.

151
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:19,209
Lord Fan, sorry for the embarrassment.

152
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:21,199
My father can't sleep at home.

153
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,682
He can only sleep in the court.

154
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,264
He didn't need to attend every court session.

155
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:26,877
He went there so that he could sleep.

156
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,079
General Qin is an extraordinary individual.

157
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,849
The Qin family have been generals for generations.

158
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,209
I won't say that he's extraordinary.

159
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,119
But he's down-to-earth.

160
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,402
That's a rare quality too.

161
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,082
(A thousand miles from home,)

162
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,282
(I'm grieved at)

163
00:12:44,255 --> 00:12:47,258
(autumn's plight;)

164
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:49,227
President Chen.

165
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,420
I'm here.

166
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,002
(Ill now and then)

167
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,559
- Qin Heng.   - (for years...)

168
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,000
He's the master here.

169
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,621
It's useless to beg me.

170
00:13:02,702 --> 00:13:03,952
You have to talk to him.

171
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,540
Wan Er?

172
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,602
(Living in times so hard,)

173
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:31,170
(at frosted hair I pine...)

174
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:39,665
I'm here to beg for forgiveness.

175
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,682
General Qin, what do you mean

176
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,359
by that?

177
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,209
Lord Fan, ever since you appeared at the court,

178
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,610
the Censorate has been doing their best to eradicate corruption.

179
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:51,067
Of course, this is a good thing for the kingdom.

180
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,282
The Qin family agrees with it wholeheartedly.

181
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,329
(I have to give up wine.)

182
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:03,442
(I have to)

183
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,482
(give up wine!)

184
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,610
One more?

185
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,682
Why is he leaving?

186
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,562
He's no longer in the mood.

187
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,322
The performance depends on his mood?

188
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,522
Music comes from the heart.

189
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:35,969
There's no need to force things.

190
00:14:36,734 --> 00:14:40,202
Wan Er, is this your first visit to the Chen Manor?

191
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,802
I've always wanted to come.

192
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,522
However, I was always ill.

193
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,880
I couldn't leave the residence.

194
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:47,362
Since this is your first time here,

195
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,922
as your elder, I should show you some appreciation.

196
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:52,019
My legs!

197
00:14:52,304 --> 00:14:53,524
My legs!

198
00:15:02,488 --> 00:15:03,771
Wan Er, let's go.

199
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:18,002
You two can enjoy your chat.

200
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,402
Ladies, you all are dismissed.

201
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:25,099
Lord Fan.

202
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,682
Please.

203
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,402
I haven't died yet.

204
00:16:03,534 --> 00:16:05,482
Seems like you don't need to collect my body.

205
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,762
Did you find out that the poison was fake?

206
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,057
I didn't.

207
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,682
- I couldn't tell.   - If so, why did you take it?

208
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:17,922
If one knows everything in life,

209
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:22,002
living would be pointless.

210
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,959
You might die because of it.

211
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:25,289
My death

212
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:29,922
is a good thing.

213
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,042
Our engagement will be canceled, then.

214
00:16:35,673 --> 00:16:37,042
You do have a point.

215
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,482
Was Fan Xian speaking the truth?

216
00:16:44,918 --> 00:16:46,322
Which part were you referring to?

217
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:49,842
Is the murder in Moon Embracing Pavilion related to you?

218
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:53,362
You might not trust me even if I say it's not related to me.

219
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,722
Let's just wait for the culprit to be arrested.

220
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,689
But the culprit is nowhere to be found.

221
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,242
They'll find him.

222
00:17:00,323 --> 00:17:01,642
Are you sure about that?

223
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,520
One cannot escape from their destiny.

224
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:04,821
I think

225
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:08,842
they'll find him soon.

226
00:17:19,278 --> 00:17:21,322
General Qin, what did you mean

227
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:23,306
by that?

228
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,842
Lord Fan, to be honest,

229
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,489
the Qin family only knows warfare.

230
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:31,162
We don't know anything else.

231
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:34,050
However, the capital is a dangerous place.

232
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,002
What should we do when we don't know how to survive here?

233
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,719
We can only beg people.

234
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,019
We establish a bond with everyone.

235
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,410
We don't dare to offend Chancellor Lin, Crown Prince, and the rest.

236
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,320
Does that include Prince Cheng Ze?

237
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,130
Lord Fan, you're frank indeed.

238
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,320
That's right. We send gifts to Prince Cheng Ze on festive occasions

239
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:51,658
and visit him from time to time.

240
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:53,936
Lord Fan, I suppose you can understand us.

241
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,322
I do. You don't want to offend anyone.

242
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:57,739
That's right.

243
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:02,130
However, I need to clarify something. We don't belong to his faction.

244
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,842
It's just a show.

245
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,282
Military officials like us can only be loyal to His Majesty.

246
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,762
If not, we'll be digging our own graves.

247
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,810
General Qin, that's frank of you.

248
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,802
You get along with Prince Cheng Ze, but you're not in his faction.

249
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,039
That's right.

250
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:19,562
Lord Fan, please look after us when you eradicate corruption.

251
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:20,873
Did you embezzle funds?

252
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:22,570
That's not true.

253
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,759
I swear upon my life that it's not true.

254
00:18:24,893 --> 00:18:26,934
If so, General Qin, you didn't need to explain yourself.

255
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:29,200
I'm just afraid we might be caught in the crossfire.

256
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,322
The Censorate is responsible for eradicating corruption.

257
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:33,082
Why are you begging me?

258
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,322
In the end,

259
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,120
they're doing this because of what you did.

260
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,802
General Qin, do you think

261
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,162
that I won't let anyone off as long as

262
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,202
they're affiliated with Prince Cheng Ze?

263
00:18:44,283 --> 00:18:45,640
Complete extermination, am I right?

264
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,642
I'm eradicating corruption to serve justice.

265
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,539
General Qin,

266
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,362
this isn't a faction war.

267
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,959
Of course.

268
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,682
We mustn't name it as such.

269
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,246
My father has always praised you for raising our flags

270
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:00,460
in Northern Qi.

271
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,769
Military officials like us are impressed by such feats.

272
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,460
General Qin,

273
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:12,090
your family will be fine

274
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,646
as long as you guys don't practice corruption.

275
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,929
Lord Fan, the Qin family owes you a favor.

276
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,362
Stop right there!

277
00:19:42,944 --> 00:19:44,642
It's me!

278
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:48,042
Don't alert them to our presence.

279
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,678
- You found them?   - A vegetable seller confirmed our suspicion.

280
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,282
The three suspects resemble the culprits in Moon Embracing Pavilion.

281
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,759
- Have you surrounded them, then?   - We have.

282
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,059
They cannot escape from here.

283
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,362
Wan Er, let me push him.

284
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,122
Has Qin Heng left?

285
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,710
He told me to bid farewell to you on his behalf.

286
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:34,880
Did you two talk it over?

287
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,922
Does everyone in the imperial court think that I'm eradicating corruption

288
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,800
to seek revenge?

289
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:41,162
Isn't it obvious?

290
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,524
Do you wish to tell them that you're doing it for the sake of the kingdom

291
00:20:43,605 --> 00:20:45,442
or justice?

292
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,242
I do have a grudge against Li Cheng Ze.

293
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,842
But if I wanted to pick on him,

294
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:53,842
I wouldn't have let the Censorate proceed with the investigation.

295
00:20:55,605 --> 00:20:57,562
The rumors of a faction war

296
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,482
serve to shake your foundation

297
00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:04,482
and make the officials doubt you.

298
00:21:10,247 --> 00:21:12,242
So, it's pointless no matter how I try to explain myself, huh?

299
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,442
What you say doesn't matter.

300
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,562
What matters is what you do.

301
00:21:16,854 --> 00:21:18,402
If so, what do I have to do

302
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,602
to make them believe that I'm eradicating corruption of my own accord

303
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:22,162
instead of picking on Li Cheng Ze?

304
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:28,602
Solve a case of huge corruption.

305
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:37,642
This is a gift from President Chen.

306
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,642
It's a box of valuable jewelry and accessories.

307
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,282
Chen Manor violated the regulations for its size.

308
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,130
The rare gems and stones in the manor are worth a fortune.

309
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:49,840
And, there are all kinds of courtesans in the manor as well.

310
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,802
Gathering wealth from the world

311
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,760
and disregarding the law of the kingdom,

312
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,762
this is a huge case of corruption.

313
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,282
Who else better to arrest than me?

314
00:22:00,518 --> 00:22:01,958
- President Chen...   - Don't explain yourself.

315
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,600
Next time, impeach me in the court directly.

316
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:07,202
If so, no one will dare to say that you're doing it to seek revenge.

317
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,202
If so, how will you clean up the mess?

318
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:13,042
Just do what you like.

319
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:17,030
I'll handle the consequences.

320
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,660
President Chen.

321
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,019
Don't be too touched yet.

322
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,482
Take a look at this.

323
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,722
The First Bureau delivered it not long ago.

324
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,242
The culprits of the murder in Moon Embracing Pavilion,

325
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,518
- Deng Zi Yue managed to arrest them.   - This is great.

326
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:37,722
This way, the murder will finally be solved.

327
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:39,077
President, do you wish to proceed with the case?

328
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:40,522
I'm a corrupt official.

329
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,729
I shouldn't interfere.

330
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:46,042
You're the inspector and the chief of the First Bureau.

331
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,009
You should be in charge of it.

332
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:58,482
After all, you're gravely ill.

333
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:00,362
You have to sit down.

334
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:06,778
It's pretty exquisite.

335
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,064
Why don't I give you this? You can give me your old wheelchair.

336
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:10,762
This wheelchair is only for me.

337
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,340
What? Are you hiding treasures inside?

338
00:23:12,421 --> 00:23:13,641
Maybe.

339
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,522
You should give it a try first.

340
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,962
This time, you shouldn't throw it at anyone else.

341
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:35,282
What are you looking at?

342
00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:37,042
Based on your relationship with her,

343
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,522
I have to station my men there

344
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,570
to protect her.

345
00:23:46,877 --> 00:23:48,040
Thank you.

346
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,242
Be honest with me.

347
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,320
Did you actually give Li Cheng Ze poison?

348
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,882
- Yes, I did.   - Did he take it?

349
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,299
He did.

350
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:00,082
However, I put the antidote in his drink

351
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:01,451
when we had a toast.

352
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:03,442
- Were you trying to intimidate him?   - No.

353
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:05,105
I truly thought of killing him with poison.

354
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,522
However, that won't do.

355
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:10,600
But why?

356
00:24:10,695 --> 00:24:12,242
Ye Ling Er had a point.

357
00:24:12,822 --> 00:24:14,282
What did Ling Er say?

358
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,482
You don't dare to kill him, huh?

359
00:24:17,911 --> 00:24:18,911
But I can help you out.

360
00:24:19,006 --> 00:24:20,575
Even so, I can't just kill someone because of it.

361
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,861
How deep is the feud between you two?

362
00:24:21,942 --> 00:24:23,791
Why are you trying to kill him with poison?

363
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,170
Li Cheng Ze

364
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:31,642
takes the lives of other people lightly.

365
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:34,042
Because he considers himself noble

366
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,082
and aloof.

367
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,362
Therefore, if I kill him with poison,

368
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,282
I can only kill him.

369
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,842
However, I cannot defeat people like him.

370
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,442
I want to defeat Li Cheng Ze officially

371
00:24:48,597 --> 00:24:50,368
using law

372
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:52,002
in the imperial court.

373
00:24:52,287 --> 00:24:55,442
Only then will I be able to tell the people that status doesn't matter.

374
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,282
There will always be people who will uphold

375
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,362
and comply with the law.

376
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,282
Comply with the law, huh?

377
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,882
It's a statement from the stone monument.

378
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:18,758
That's what my mother said.

379
00:25:18,854 --> 00:25:20,682
I hope that the laws of the kingdom

380
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,562
are established for the benefit of the people.

381
00:25:23,008 --> 00:25:24,802
It won't tolerate the wrongdoings of the noble

382
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,962
or extort from the poor.

383
00:25:27,696 --> 00:25:29,242
No people will be framed

384
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,362
or be convicted of crimes they didn't commit.

385
00:25:31,742 --> 00:25:33,402
Comply with the law,

386
00:25:33,853 --> 00:25:35,402
dispel the illusion, and reveal the truth.

387
00:25:35,565 --> 00:25:36,882
I'm not my mother.

388
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,522
I'm not as capable as her.

389
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,082
I can't realize all of her dreams.

390
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:46,198
However, I can at least realize this dream of hers.

391
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,202
Even if this is the only dream I can realize for her,

392
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:53,602
I hope

393
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,322
that it can come true.

394
00:25:59,085 --> 00:26:00,305
I know.

395
00:26:01,606 --> 00:26:03,042
It'll be extremely difficult.

396
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:07,442
However, my mother's quotes were carved onto the stone monument.

397
00:26:08,822 --> 00:26:10,312
Since I've arrived at this world,

398
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,442
I mustn't let people take the stone monument as a joke.

399
00:26:29,643 --> 00:26:31,175
(First Bureau of the Overwatch Council)

400
00:26:31,294 --> 00:26:32,514
Zi Yue?

401
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:34,642
- Zi Yue?   - Zi Yue?

402
00:26:34,853 --> 00:26:36,922
Zi Yue, why are you here?

403
00:26:37,147 --> 00:26:40,031
- My Lord, I've failed you!   - Even so, you don't need to kneel.

404
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:41,312
My Lord, please don't!

405
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,842
My legs are just numb.

406
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,162
What happened? Did the culprit die?

407
00:26:45,342 --> 00:26:47,042
No.

408
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:48,934
Did he run away?

409
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:50,962
No. There are three culprits.

410
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,610
None of them managed to escape.

411
00:26:53,374 --> 00:26:55,162
If so, why did you say you've failed me?

412
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,759
I was too anxious.

413
00:26:56,868 --> 00:26:57,988
I interrogated them

414
00:26:58,069 --> 00:27:00,200
before you came back.

415
00:27:00,456 --> 00:27:01,676
Did you not get an answer out of them?

416
00:27:02,463 --> 00:27:04,922
I didn't do a good job of interrogating them.

417
00:27:05,935 --> 00:27:07,155
Were they not willing to confess?

418
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,281
They did confess.

419
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:11,590
I guess.

420
00:27:11,703 --> 00:27:12,923
I guess they did confess.

421
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:24,643
Is this your testimony?

422
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,600
Did you confess to this?

423
00:27:26,695 --> 00:27:28,642
You! Is this your testimony?

424
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,420
You!

425
00:27:30,695 --> 00:27:32,122
You better think twice.

426
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,762
Who ordered you guys to do this?

427
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,299
Lord Fan,

428
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,322
we've failed you.

429
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,922
We failed to escape.

430
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,362
How dare you tell such a blatant lie!

431
00:27:42,743 --> 00:27:43,963
Qi Nian!

432
00:27:52,511 --> 00:27:54,000
So, I'm the mastermind, huh?

433
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,882
We wanted to keep it a secret too.

434
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:58,362
But we couldn't endure the harsh torture.

435
00:27:58,614 --> 00:28:00,024
Lord Fan, please forgive us.

436
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,082
Did you torture them?

437
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,800
No. I didn't even touch them.

438
00:28:05,895 --> 00:28:07,651
They confessed of their own accord.

439
00:28:07,732 --> 00:28:08,952
My Lord,

440
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,362
we can't stand the pain.

441
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:14,999
That's a great excuse.

442
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,120
You're pretty smart.

443
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,420
My Lord,

444
00:28:17,524 --> 00:28:18,824
they're framing you here!

445
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,242
You can't say that.

446
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:21,590
I've read their testimonies too.

447
00:28:21,671 --> 00:28:23,562
They were logical and contained clear motives.

448
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:26,823
I thought for a second that I was the mastermind after reading it.

449
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,525
Lord Fan, I still think that we have to torture them.

450
00:28:29,606 --> 00:28:30,936
I didn't do anything to them just now.

451
00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:32,137
They'll confess if we torture them for real.

452
00:28:32,218 --> 00:28:33,218
- Come.   - I didn't touch them just now.

453
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:35,162
Qi Nian, it's pointless to torture them.

454
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,562
The three of you

455
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,803
were waiting for me to arrest you, huh?

456
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:06,686
My Lord, you mustn't say that.

457
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,762
We tried to escape, but we failed.

458
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:12,162
Have you never thought of the consequences?

459
00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:13,475
Lord Fan,

460
00:29:13,734 --> 00:29:15,162
you should admit to your crime.

461
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:18,002
We should face reality in the face of law.

462
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,682
You still stand a chance.

463
00:29:20,188 --> 00:29:21,522
I understand now.

464
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,242
The suicide squad, huh?

465
00:29:30,564 --> 00:29:31,724
Where is the inspector?

466
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:33,202
Where is the inspector?

467
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:36,226
Lord Fan!

468
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,922
The Judicial Bureau is here to take the suspects.

469
00:29:39,163 --> 00:29:40,279
We cannot release them!

470
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:41,631
I'll make them confess right now!

471
00:29:41,712 --> 00:29:43,122
Let them take the suspects.

472
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:44,686
My Lord?

473
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,840
The Judicial Bureau is responsible for murder investigations.

474
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,278
The First Bureau has no reason to keep them.

475
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:50,724
However, if the Judicial Bureau confirms their testimonies,

476
00:29:50,805 --> 00:29:52,442
you'll have no way to explain yourself.

477
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,374
What about this? When we arrested them,

478
00:29:54,455 --> 00:29:56,135
they resisted arrest. And, we killed them by accident.

479
00:29:56,256 --> 00:29:57,277
I'll kill them right now!

480
00:29:57,358 --> 00:29:59,562
I have no way to explain myself either if they die here.

481
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,400
At least it's better than being framed.

482
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,400
- That's right, My Lord.   - Let them take the suspects.

483
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:05,796
As a person, we have to follow the rules too.

484
00:30:05,877 --> 00:30:07,097
Just like an official.

485
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,460
Release them.

486
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,682
He never bothers with the trivial details.

487
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,682
Seems like you're fine. I'll make a move, then.

488
00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:40,049
Don't be impatient.

489
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,962
What if it's a slow-acting poison?

490
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,522
You should wait a little longer.

491
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:45,282
Even if the poison does kill you,

492
00:30:45,363 --> 00:30:47,002
you're already in your residence.

493
00:30:47,102 --> 00:30:48,682
Your servants will collect your body for you.

494
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:51,576
Shouldn't heroines see things through from start to finish?

495
00:30:51,703 --> 00:30:54,802
I can't just wait here until you die, right?

496
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,642
I guess that's fine too.

497
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:03,059
Your Highness,

498
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:05,642
the culprit of the Moon Embracing Pavilion murder was arrested.

499
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,962
Really? He was arrested? Who arrested him?

500
00:31:12,196 --> 00:31:13,356
The First Bureau of the Overwatch Council.

501
00:31:13,437 --> 00:31:14,842
Fan Xian's subordinates arrested him?

502
00:31:15,765 --> 00:31:16,965
The Overwatch Council does live up to its name.

503
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:18,842
The Judicial Bureau went there to arrest the culprits.

504
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,339
The Judicial Bureau?

505
00:31:20,471 --> 00:31:23,242
The Judicial Bureau is responsible for all murder cases.

506
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,039
Have they released the culprits, then?

507
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,422
The First Bureau didn't obstruct them.

508
00:31:26,503 --> 00:31:27,842
They've already arrived at the Judicial Bureau.

509
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,842
The prefect is taking this case seriously.

510
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:31,035
He put them on trial immediately.

511
00:31:31,116 --> 00:31:32,336
He's interrogating them as we speak.

512
00:31:33,222 --> 00:31:35,442
He tortured them brutally. They fainted several times.

513
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:38,242
Even so, they weren't willing to tell him who the mastermind was.

514
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,322
Although they committed a heinous crime,

515
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:42,322
they're loyal indeed.

516
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:45,242
They're loyal indeed.

517
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:48,682
I confess!

518
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,002
It's the inspector of the Overwatch Council!

519
00:31:51,254 --> 00:31:54,042
Lord Fan Xian ordered us to kill her!

520
00:31:54,471 --> 00:31:55,911
I'm speaking the truth!

521
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,559
I dare not lie!

522
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,330
Father, Xian is here!

523
00:32:04,474 --> 00:32:07,279
Father, Xian is here!

524
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:10,322
Father, Xian is here!

525
00:32:12,607 --> 00:32:13,827
Come up.

526
00:32:19,864 --> 00:32:22,059
- Uncle.   - Weren't you gravely ill?

527
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,349
Uncle, I was just pretending to be ill.

528
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,322
Xian, you've recovered already?

529
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,962
Don't tell anyone about it, okay?

530
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,568
I'll tell everyone that you're still sick.

531
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:44,120
Da Bao, great job.

532
00:32:44,207 --> 00:32:45,522
Da Bao.

533
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,519
Father.

534
00:32:48,645 --> 00:32:49,896
Go and play.

535
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,160
Father, don't forget, okay?

536
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,239
You must take Da Bao to the study room later.

537
00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:57,625
Don't let the others bully him, okay?

538
00:32:57,721 --> 00:32:58,941
Okay.

539
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:01,529
Xian, I'll wait for you.

540
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,259
Da Bao?

541
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:16,570
He calls this red fish Da Bao.

542
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:22,282
Your illness no longer matters.

543
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:24,162
Did you know that the Judicial Bureau

544
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:26,602
already solved the case?

545
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,439
The three culprits were sure

546
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,202
that you were their mastermind.

547
00:33:30,357 --> 00:33:32,118
- So you've heard about it.   - Was it you?

548
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:33,322
It wasn't me.

549
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,442
It's Prince Cheng Ze's plot, huh?

550
00:33:36,574 --> 00:33:37,794
Those culprits

551
00:33:38,255 --> 00:33:40,122
belong to the suicide squad under him.

552
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,920
Uncle, you're wise indeed.

553
00:33:42,015 --> 00:33:43,362
You were careless.

554
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,121
You arrested them first.

555
00:33:45,247 --> 00:33:47,122
Everything would've been fine if they died in the First Bureau.

556
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,842
Why did you let the Judicial Bureau take them?

557
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:52,042
Moon Embracing Pavilion is related to the Fan family.

558
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,642
I won't be able to explain myself if they die in the First Bureau.

559
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:58,410
Even so, it's better than letting them convict you of a crime.

560
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,602
Luckily, you did a good job before this.

561
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,482
You implicated Prince Cheng Ze in the case.

562
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,559
After Mei Zhi Li's retirement,

563
00:34:08,662 --> 00:34:11,522
the current Judicial Bureau prefect is close to Prince Cheng Ze as well.

564
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,042
We can only strike from there.

565
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,100
We can say

566
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,562
that the Judicial Bureau tortured them into confessing

567
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,242
for Prince Cheng Ze's sake.

568
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,442
The Judicial Bureau is close to me now.

569
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:27,602
If the prefect tortures them into confessing,

570
00:34:27,784 --> 00:34:29,522
Fan Xian will be in trouble.

571
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,959
That's right.

572
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,200
That might happen.

573
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,400
Therefore,

574
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,889
in order to be open and upright,

575
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,762
they should be transported to the Ministry of Justice.

576
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,682
They were transported to the Ministry of Justice?

577
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,400
When did it happen?

578
00:34:48,535 --> 00:34:50,744
I received that news right before I came here.

579
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,849
Li Cheng Ze is quick, isn't he?

580
00:34:59,405 --> 00:35:00,774
He's always been smart.

581
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:05,545
Even when they're there,

582
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:08,002
the culprits won't change their testimonies.

583
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:10,002
I guess so.

584
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:12,769
Just let them die in the Ministry of Justice, then.

585
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,500
That won't do.

586
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:24,082
The culprits can die,

587
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,922
and the statements can be changed,

588
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:29,209
but it'll be too obvious.

589
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,602
No one in the world will be convinced.

590
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:34,442
His Majesty won't be convinced either.

591
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,209
Fan Xian, after giving it some thought,

592
00:35:39,448 --> 00:35:41,242
if they do arrive at the Ministry of Justice,

593
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,620
you'll be

594
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,042
in a difficult spot.

595
00:35:50,535 --> 00:35:55,842
(Judicial Bureau)

596
00:35:57,874 --> 00:35:59,094
Go now.

597
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,562
There's one last solution.

598
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,580
There's actually a solution to this?

599
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:20,322
Moon Embracing Pavilion

600
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,002
is considered Fan Si Zhe's property after all.

601
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,762
Making him the mastermind

602
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,482
seems more logical.

603
00:36:32,453 --> 00:36:34,402
You want me to push the blame

604
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:36,882
on Fan Si Zhe?

605
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,042
Someone has to be sacrificed

606
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:41,282
if we want to protect you.

607
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,362
Fan Si Zhe is my younger brother.

608
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:48,202
Just like how a gecko cuts off its tail

609
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:50,682
and how a hero breaks his own wrist,

610
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:54,490
being cruel

611
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,282
is better than

612
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,322
dying here.

613
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,500
Uncle,

614
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,962
have you ever considered this, then?

615
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,440
If I can sacrifice Fan Si Zhe today,

616
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,130
I can sacrifice Da Bao in the future.

617
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,242
Are you willing

618
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:22,962
to see me resort to that?

619
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:49,042
That means you're desperate.

620
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:56,202
Actually, there's still one solution.

621
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,209
After the three of them were arrested,

622
00:38:01,383 --> 00:38:04,912
I told my men to investigate their background immediately.

623
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,322
And, I have the result.

624
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:10,562
My Lord, after investigating them,

625
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:12,359
all three of them were convicted of murders before this.

626
00:38:12,462 --> 00:38:14,058
They've committed countless crimes.

627
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:16,202
How will they be penalized according to the law of Qing Kingdom?

628
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,882
They would've been executed long ago

629
00:38:18,982 --> 00:38:21,002
if it weren't for the Moon Embracing Pavilion murder investigation.

630
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,930
Who are those inside the cage?

631
00:38:28,011 --> 00:38:29,079
I don't know.

632
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,379
Let's go.

633
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:48,522
They'll only be members of the suicide squad

634
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:50,882
when there's no way for them to survive.

635
00:38:52,671 --> 00:38:55,242
Therefore, the three of them should've been dead long ago.

636
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,482
If you wish to kill them,

637
00:38:57,598 --> 00:38:59,922
you could've done so when they were still in the First Bureau.

638
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,920
Now, they've already given their testimonies.

639
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,482
If you kill them right now,

640
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,760
it'll confirm

641
00:39:04,879 --> 00:39:06,402
that you're trying to silence them.

642
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,602
You're right about something.

643
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,570
The main point

644
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:14,202
is silencing them.

645
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:14,922
They're trying to kill us! Let me out!

646
00:40:15,022 --> 00:40:16,442
Let me out!

647
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:43,922
- Over there!   - Hurry!

648
00:40:45,934 --> 00:40:47,414
- There's one here.   - Keep an eye on him.

649
00:40:47,526 --> 00:40:48,746
All right.

650
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:51,680
The rest of you, go after them!

651
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,113
Don't let them run away!

652
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,280
Yes, sir!

653
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,482
Hurry!

654
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,680
What's wrong?

655
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:19,424
Your Highness, there were assassins outside the Judicial Bureau.

656
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:21,322
They assassinated the three culprits on the spot.

657
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:23,639
It's that thrilling?

658
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:25,240
- Did all three of them die?   - Yes, Your Highness.

659
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,540
Who killed them?

660
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,610
It depends on who they betrayed.

661
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:32,479
- Fan Xian?   - That can't be.

662
00:41:32,597 --> 00:41:34,562
I was saying that he was framed.

663
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:37,762
Could it truly be Fan Xian?

664
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,999
- Did they manage to arrest the assassins?   - Most of them had escaped.

665
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,610
That means some of them were arrested.

666
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:42,760
Only one of them.

667
00:41:42,855 --> 00:41:44,562
They're pretty careless, huh?

668
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:50,899
Your Highness.

669
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,442
What's with your expression?

670
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:00,722
The identity of the assassin has been confirmed.

671
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,419
It's Fan Wu Jiu.

672
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,079
I know him.

673
00:42:10,189 --> 00:42:11,919
Isn't this Prince Cheng Ze's bodyguard?

674
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,849
Prince Cheng Ze?

675
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,999
So, it seems like

676
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:19,402
Fan Xian wasn't the one trying to silence them.

677
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,882
Fan Wu Jiu is my bodyguard.

678
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,162
But he's not in the capital right now.

679
00:42:25,111 --> 00:42:26,962
This has nothing to do with me.

680
00:42:28,287 --> 00:42:30,656
He's not in the capital? He was arrested, you know?

681
00:42:31,214 --> 00:42:32,465
Why should I silence them?

682
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:34,642
They confessed that Fan Xian was the mastermind.

683
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,322
Because there have been rumors

684
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:42,001
that Li Cheng Ze might be the mastermind.

685
00:42:42,222 --> 00:42:45,153
That's why the Judicial Bureau is siding with Cheng Ze.

686
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,362
The testimonies they gave before this were fake.

687
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,562
Now that they're going to be transported to the Ministry of Justice,

688
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:52,322
they might change their testimonies.

689
00:42:52,889 --> 00:42:55,559
Therefore, Li Cheng Ze silenced them.

690
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,090
Now,

691
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,970
everything makes sense.
