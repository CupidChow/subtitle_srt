00:01:24,973 --> 00:01:30,944
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:33,992
(Episode 12)

3
00:01:35,047 --> 00:01:36,247
He's not pretending.

4
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,762
I've asked the imperial physician.

5
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,850
The diagnosis says it's an internal injury.

6
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,378
You can't fake that.

7
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,362
Did he fight someone?

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,220
Who did it?

9
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,162
There was no news at all.

10
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,282
Who would attack Fan Xian at a time like this?

11
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:56,482
Did he do it to himself?

12
00:01:57,528 --> 00:01:59,908
Your Highness, an internal injury like this

13
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:01,749
will ruin his martial arts if he's careless.

14
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,159
Even if he injured himself,

15
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,962
there was no need to go this far.

16
00:02:05,256 --> 00:02:06,906
That's weird.

17
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,060
How...

18
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,362
How did he get that injury?

19
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,679
Deliver this to Father.

20
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,979
What's this?

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,929
What else? Antidote!

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,020
I almost forgot!

23
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,722
- Taking one is enough. - Got it!

24
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,722
Lord Fan.

25
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,740
It's all right.

26
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,022
I'll be fine after taking a rest.

27
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:39,880
Lord Fan, since coming back from the capital,

28
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,239
your Qi has been out of control.

29
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:44,056
This won't do if the condition continues.

30
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,000
You need to consult someone.

31
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,300
Who can I consult?

32
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:50,209
I don't know who practices the same kind of Qi as me.

33
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,410
Don't simply fight other people in the future.

34
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:56,835
Don't worry.

35
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,769
I'm not someone who causes trouble.

36
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:04,035
If you have anything on your mind, say it.

37
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,421
I have nothing to say.

38
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,740
Everything you say is correct.

39
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,010
Has Deng Zi Yue spread the news?

40
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,416
You're still worried about this?

41
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,571
There's no need to worry about something so minor.

42
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,020
Miss Ye is here.

43
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,900
Ye Ling Er?

44
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,740
Is Wan Er here?

45
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,780
Are you really sick?

46
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,122
No. It was all an act.

47
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,970
I'll tell Wan Er.

48
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,959
Does she have a message for me?

49
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,419
You are not sick so there's no need to deliver her message.

50
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,769
Help me tell her

51
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,340
that I miss her.

52
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,522
Got it.

53
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,580
Lord Fan, you are...

54
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,911
You are a man of disposition.

55
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,802
You should sit down!

56
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:12,107
Lord Fan,

57
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,880
news of Yuan Meng and Prince Hong Cheng...

58
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,569
Yes. It has been spread.

59
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,330
Looking at the results,

60
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:23,689
the people do trust you more.

61
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,160
Why are you still sighing

62
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,562
and feeling troubled?

63
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,861
There have been some nasty rumors

64
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:33,210
among the six ministries.

65
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:36,290
They said Lord Fan abused his power for personal gain.

66
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,299
What do they mean?

67
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:44,381
The investigation of corrupt officials by the Censorate.

68
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,609
Everyone said it was ordered by Lord Fan.

69
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:49,294
The proof is that the corrupt officials

70
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,290
who are being investigated are Prince Cheng Ze's confidants.

71
00:04:53,774 --> 00:04:56,144
Fan Xian's investigation of corruption

72
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,880
is just to compete against their faction.

73
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,439
Upholding justice is just a cover

74
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,520
for going against Li Cheng Ze.

75
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,199
Lord Fan, you heard everything?

76
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,480
I guessed it

77
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,780
after hearing what you said.

78
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,400
What's wrong with the rumor then?

79
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,009
Isn't it the same for all the officials?

80
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,689
It's different for me.

81
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,890
I'm working for the Overwatch Council.

82
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,482
If I can use upholding justice

83
00:05:19,634 --> 00:05:21,002
as a cover once,

84
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:22,602
I can use it again.

85
00:05:22,683 --> 00:05:25,334
If I can use this way to get rid of Li Cheng Ze,

86
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,940
I can use

87
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,970
the same method the next day

88
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,920
to get rid of other officials in the capital.

89
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,260
Here. Have some water.

90
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,850
When the time comes, everyone will think they are in danger.

91
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,129
You will become the public enemy, Lord Fan.

92
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,730
This still can't explain the situation.

93
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,210
Unless I can make them feel I'm not that sinister.

94
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,410
I'm just young and reckless.

95
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:57,977
Great. This idea is amazing.

96
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,802
Lord Fan, what should we do?

97
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,851
Lord Fan, where are you going?

98
00:06:05,143 --> 00:06:06,363
I'm going to see Wan Er.

99
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,640
Lord Fan, it's not right.

100
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,722
Don't forget. You are sick to the outside.

101
00:06:13,817 --> 00:06:15,002
I am sick indeed.

102
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,725
- Do you have a medicine? - No. You are sick.

103
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:18,279
No one goes out to take a stroll.

104
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,400
She is my fiancé.

105
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,715
Isn't that absurd?

106
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:23,402
Is it wrong to make the officials of the capital

107
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,962
think I'm being absurd?

108
00:06:25,442 --> 00:06:27,602
- Amazing. - Zi Yue, go back to the First Bureau.

109
00:06:27,715 --> 00:06:29,795
Keep spreading rumors about Yuan Meng and Prince Hong Cheng.

110
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,039
They want the political scene.

111
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,439
We want the people's support.

112
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,722
Yes.

113
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,002
Lord Fan, you must use this at least.

114
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:40,922
You have a serious illness!

115
00:06:41,082 --> 00:06:42,650
The relationship between Yuan Meng and Prince Hong Cheng

116
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:44,404
has spread all over the place.

117
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,920
As the chief inspector of the Overwatch Council,

118
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:52,385
it is easy for Lord Fan to spread rumors.

119
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,560
Prince Hong Cheng has been close with Your Highness.

120
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,049
Some people are already guessing

121
00:06:57,165 --> 00:06:59,256
that Moon Embracing Pavilion is not as easy as it seems.

122
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,440
It's all right.

123
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,882
There are rumors.

124
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,689
I do share the same opinion with Fan Xian about this.

125
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,960
He is spreading rumors

126
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,362
but so am I.

127
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,762
Your Highness, you've spread rumors?

128
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,049
I haven't heard it on the streets.

129
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:13,735
We can't win over the people.

130
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,299
The people were born to hate corrupt officials.

131
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,122
Fan Xian has taken advantage of this.

132
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,689
My rumors

133
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,799
are only sent to the political scene.

134
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,499
Your Highness,

135
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,530
there aren't many good people in the capital's political scene.

136
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,410
No people might care about other people's lives.

137
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,170
But they all care about themselves.

138
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,402
We can't stay here for good.

139
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,720
Let's visit a relative.

140
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,020
Visit a relative?

141
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,619
At a time like this?

142
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,619
I have

143
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,522
an important quality.

144
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,800
It's called adding insult to injury.

145
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:01,374
(Lin Wan Er's Residence, Imperial Side Courtyard)

146
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,420
- What are you doing? - I'm sharpening the knife.

147
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,040
Why are you here?

148
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,440
Aren't you pretending to be sick?

149
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,019
Is Wan Er in?

150
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,619
She's inside the house.

151
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:44,402
Oh, I have a question.

152
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,762
Why is the gate open

153
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,282
with no guards around?

154
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,560
They are inside the house to guard against assassins.

155
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,327
Is someone going to harm Wan Er?

156
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:54,551
- It's not Wan Er. - Who else are they assassinating?

157
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,482
Cousin Cheng Ze, do I have to eat this meal?

158
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,002
Cousin? Just call me Cheng Ze.

159
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,482
There's no need to address me as your cousin.

160
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,482
At a time like this,

161
00:09:25,996 --> 00:09:27,636
are you sure you want to chase me away

162
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:29,397
when I'm just to visit you and eat a meal?

163
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,849
Which is more important between your life and a meal?

164
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,580
I want them both.

165
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,559
Li Cheng Ze is here?

166
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,120
You said someone wanted to kill him.

167
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,562
Who wants to kill him?

168
00:09:45,465 --> 00:09:46,522
Me.

169
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,674
Don't stop me! I'm going to kill him!

170
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:51,636
- I'm going to kill him! - Li Cheng Ze, run!

171
00:09:56,486 --> 00:09:58,056
You want to kill Li Cheng Ze?

172
00:09:58,586 --> 00:10:00,146
Why would I sharpen my knife otherwise?

173
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:02,598
He is the current prince.

174
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,279
Have you thought about the consequences?

175
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,682
I had.

176
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,042
I'll be dead no matter what.

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,482
Yet you are still going to kill him?

178
00:10:12,814 --> 00:10:14,174
His Majesty granted this marriage.

179
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,679
I don't want it.

180
00:10:15,774 --> 00:10:17,082
I don't want it too.

181
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,880
To be honest, there are many pretty ladies in the capital

182
00:10:19,976 --> 00:10:22,522
but Warrior Ye's temperament doesn't suit me.

183
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,019
Since both of you don't like it,

184
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:26,359
that's easy.

185
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,130
Just cancel the marriage.

186
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,999
Do you think our intention is important?

187
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,361
His Majesty granted the marriage. It must be carried out.

188
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,920
Wan Er, let me ask you.

189
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,679
If you and Fan Xian hated each other

190
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:37,839
when you first met,

191
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,290
would the result be any different?

192
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,929
The result will still be the same.

193
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,096
Both of you are a match made in heaven

194
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,802
because this is His Majesty's order.

195
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:54,002
Actually, our marriage

196
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,862
is none of our business.

197
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,540
Wan Er,

198
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,650
you just got lucky.

199
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,093
What are you doing?

200
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:10,628
His neck is not as tough as the pillar.

201
00:11:10,652 --> 00:11:12,678
This knife is fast enough. It's good enough to kill.

202
00:11:12,702 --> 00:11:14,233
You dare not kill him.

203
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,961
This is just an act to tell how dissatisfied you are.

204
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:20,527
Then, you hope to use this imposing manner to scare him away.

205
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,282
You are only escaping.

206
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,722
Yes!

207
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,922
I dare not kill him!

208
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,569
I don't even dare to escape from the capital

209
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,019
because leaving the capital

210
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,811
means going against the imperial edict.

211
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,915
The Ye family can't afford to bear the consequences.

212
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,602
That is why I can only escape.

213
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,402
If you dare not kill him,

214
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,859
I can help you.

215
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,241
- What is this? - Poison.

216
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,655
After ingesting it for half a day, he will die from bleeding.

217
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:57,400
After half a day, no one will think that we are the ones who did it.

218
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,640
Are you crazy?

219
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,920
Don't you hate the marriage?

220
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,482
You still can't kill him.

221
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:02,939
How big of a grudge do you have against him

222
00:12:02,963 --> 00:12:04,922
to the point of poisoning him to death?

223
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,762
You are right.

224
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,300
I was wrong.

225
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,722
I can't poison him to death.

226
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,922
I'm leaving. I'll take a look inside.

227
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,019
What about you?

228
00:12:21,872 --> 00:12:23,099
Forget it.

229
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,019
I'll go inside as well.

230
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,370
Where can I escape to?

231
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,000
I must still face it.

232
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:30,802
I do need to face it.

233
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,449
Reality is cruel

234
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,322
but there's nowhere to escape.

235
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:38,513
Cheng Ze, there's a hidden meaning in your words.

236
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,329
Why don't you say it directly?

237
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,522
I wanted to hide it from you

238
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,602
but now that I think about it,

239
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,770
I'm sure you've heard about

240
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,830
the Fan family and Moon Embracing Pavilion.

241
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,460
Of course.

242
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,370
I came here to help Fan Xian explain.

243
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:05,000
Moon Embracing Pavilion belongs to Fan Si Zhe.

244
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:06,308
It's unrelated to him.

245
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,220
You shouldn't blame him.

246
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,130
I see.

247
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,280
It's reasonable for him to release Fan Si Zhe.

248
00:13:14,383 --> 00:13:16,072
After all, they are related by blood.

249
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,760
However, this industry is cruel.

250
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,760
There's even a courtesan who was beaten to death

251
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,660
a few days ago.

252
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,569
They should still respect people's lives.

253
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,929
You should advise them

254
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,969
to stay out of this business if possible.

255
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:37,559
Oh.

256
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:41,331
Speaking of which, Fan Xian has returned to the capital for some time now.

257
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,370
Did he come and visit you?

258
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,290
Sorry.

259
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,122
I slipped.

260
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:21,762
It's too fast!

261
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,562
We are here!

262
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:27,201
We went past it!

263
00:14:29,423 --> 00:14:30,882
That's too fast for her?

264
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,540
It's too slow.

265
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:34,922
She even loses control of the horse.

266
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,899
What are you looking at?

267
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,482
I'm talking about you.

268
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,282
Listen well.

269
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,082
You shouldn't learn from it.

270
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,049
You need to be good.

271
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,402
If you are good, you get to eat.

272
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:50,882
Your Highness.

273
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,135
Aren't you the guy beside Fan Xian?

274
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,400
Yes. It's me.

275
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,319
Your Highness has a good memory.

276
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,882
You still remember me.

277
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,530
My warhorse was beaten to death by you outside the city.

278
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:10,490
That wasn't me. That was Gao Da.

279
00:15:10,713 --> 00:15:11,919
The one who stood beside me.

280
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,240
Both of you are together.

281
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,929
Your Highness, don't misunderstand.

282
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,842
I'm more gentle. Gao Da is more hot-tempered.

283
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,379
What is your name?

284
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,890
I am...

285
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,322
Deng Zi Yue.

286
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,820
Deng Zi Yue?

287
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,820
- Was this your name previously? - Indeed.

288
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:32,442
I am Deng Zi Yue, and I don't change my name.

289
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,940
Where is he?

290
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,420
Has he gone inside?

291
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,322
Who?

292
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:43,673
The Elder Princess of Northern Qi?

293
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:46,002
She just passed by.

294
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,540
She left?

295
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,740
- Where did she go? - Over there.

296
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,640
Why didn't you stop her?

297
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,559
I dare not stop the princess.

298
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,978
She is here to see Wan Er.

299
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:57,002
She didn't get to tell me that.

300
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,300
I'll go and find her.

301
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,099
Deng Zi Yue.

302
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,970
I'll remember you.

303
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,959
I'm humbled.

304
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,840
Zi Yue is humbled!

305
00:16:14,111 --> 00:16:16,922
Deng Zi Yue is humbled!

306
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,522
Why have you lost so much weight?

307
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,850
Did you suffer in Northern Qi?

308
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,220
No.

309
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,089
How would I let myself suffer?

310
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,562
I was impressive in Northern Qi.

311
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,569
Besides, I look better after losing weight.

312
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,220
You shouldn't.

313
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:09,042
Don't break your body.

314
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,539
Sorry.

315
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,460
I made you worry

316
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,940
during this time.

317
00:17:40,568 --> 00:17:43,208
I was supposed to meet you as soon as I returned to the capital

318
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:45,410
but His Majesty summoned me.

319
00:17:45,511 --> 00:17:47,979
Later, I was surrounded by many kinds of troubles.

320
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,642
I only have time to visit you now.

321
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,019
It's my fault.

322
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,130
But you shouldn't come here today.

323
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,610
Aren't you sick?

324
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,322
It's fine. I'm only pretending.

325
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,100
You are only pretending?

326
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:06,119
What about your father?

327
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,239
- It's the same. - He's pretending as well?

328
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,539
It's our family tradition.

329
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,442
You shouldn't force yourself.

330
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,779
I guarantee that I won't.

331
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,240
Does the whole family pretending to be sick count as lying to His Majesty?

332
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,976
I still need to help you keep a secret.

333
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,320
Your Highness should talk less.

334
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,616
- Otherwise, I might slip again. - You are so hot-tempered.

335
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,840
Ask Wan Er.

336
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,209
I've been on your side since I came here.

337
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,769
If you think he's annoying, we'll ask him to leave.

338
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,239
How heartless.

339
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,442
There's no need.

340
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,522
Some things are better to be said face to face.

341
00:18:49,636 --> 00:18:52,356
The lady who died a miserable death outside Moon Embracing Pavilion.

342
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,579
Her surname was Jin.

343
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,579
Do you know that?

344
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,660
Am I supposed to know that?

345
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,482
Sounds like you were close to her.

346
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,249
Her father also died outside the Moon Embracing Pavilion.

347
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:07,819
What a coincidence.

348
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,700
How did they die?

349
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,130
How did they die?

350
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,171
Forcing a noble lady to become a prostitute

351
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,722
and destroying a family.

352
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:18,050
You should quickly persuade Fan Si Zhe

353
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,962
and ask him to surrender himself.

354
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,700
Two lives.

355
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,722
Don't you have anything to say?

356
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,979
What a pity.

357
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,682
- That's all? - What else should I say?

358
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:42,456
There are many people in the capital.

359
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,700
People are dying every day.

360
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,650
Do you think I can predict who dies?

361
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,999
What else can I say besides "What a pity"?

362
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,380
Honestly speaking,

363
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,370
I'm impressed with your mentality.

364
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:05,962
Life and death are uncertain.

365
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,282
Don't take it too seriously.

366
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,739
Well said.

367
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:12,621
I'll remember it.

368
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:32,050
To the people who lost their lives innocently.

369
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,402
What if it's hungry?

370
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:50,482
It's only for a while. It'll be fine.

371
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:04,936
There's fodder here. It won't get hungry.

372
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:14,671
We came to see Princess Lin

373
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,263
without informing her.

374
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,810
Is that a little improper?

375
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,489
It's all right. Wan Er is just like my younger sister.

376
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,420
What's wrong?

377
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,620
Your hair is messy.

378
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,100
Is it better?

379
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,059
It is now.

380
00:21:56,008 --> 00:21:57,168
Sorry.

381
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,010
I was used to helping soldiers with their armor at the military camp.

382
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,420
That was rude of me.

383
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,180
Sorry. I apologize.

384
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:11,969
I accept your apology.

385
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,122
Don't do this again.

386
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:22,202
What are you doing?

387
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,242
Why don't I swear with my blood?

388
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,922
This is a habit of Northern Qi.

389
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,410
Am I a brute?

390
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:44,575
I've been in the frontier army for too long.

391
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:46,802
There are some habits that I can't change.

392
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,489
Being sincere is quite nice.

393
00:23:00,256 --> 00:23:01,856
You are going in the opposite direction.

394
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:03,099
This way.

395
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,729
I came here often to eat when I was young.

396
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:37,039
It's still the same taste.

397
00:23:37,142 --> 00:23:38,362
Is that so?

398
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,802
Cheng Ru, you should eat more.

399
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,769
The atmosphere was tense when I first came in.

400
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,800
- I even saw... - There's nothing strange about it.

401
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,810
However, both of you are...

402
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,802
I owe him a horse.

403
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:02,015
What horse?

404
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:04,330
We went to the market to buy a horse.

405
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:07,322
The royalty of Qi has always been honest.

406
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,762
We never owe a debt.

407
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:10,819
Buy a horse?

408
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,460
I rode it just now.

409
00:24:13,603 --> 00:24:16,009
The warhorse of the Qing Kingdom are fast.

410
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,802
A warhorse bought from the capital market?

411
00:24:22,022 --> 00:24:23,080
She was tired.

412
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,335
Her Highness wanted to know you

413
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,602
so I brought here here.

414
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,100
Your Highness, please enjoy.

415
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,002
What were you two talking about?

416
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,639
There seemed to be killing intent.

417
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:37,739
Not at all. It was just a casual chat.

418
00:24:37,994 --> 00:24:39,623
I've been with the frontier army for a long time.

419
00:24:39,647 --> 00:24:41,562
I won't mistake a killing intent.

420
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,810
You know me. I've always been tolerant.

421
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,299
Is that so?

422
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,100
A toast to you.

423
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
A toast to me?

424
00:24:55,016 --> 00:24:56,236
It's an apology.

425
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,719
I shouldn't point my knife at you.

426
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:58,929
It's all right.

427
00:24:59,072 --> 00:25:00,912
It's better than throwing it right at my face.

428
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,689
Do you have someone you like?

429
00:25:09,117 --> 00:25:10,337
What?

430
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,769
Someone you want to marry.

431
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,259
A childhood friend perhaps.

432
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,439
I don't.

433
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:17,739
Me neither.

434
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:19,592
That's a good thing.

435
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:22,291
We won't suffer a lot when we get married in the future.

436
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,180
What's wrong?

437
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:29,610
I've been watching you just now.

438
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:30,999
Watching me?

439
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,522
I want to look at you in detail.

440
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,009
I've never studied you carefully.

441
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,519
Are you drunk?

442
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,819
I drank

443
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,299
but I'm sober.

444
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,140
Your Highness.

445
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,082
I've been watching you for a while.

446
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,660
You are special.

447
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:47,329
However, I still can't like you.

448
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,479
So?

449
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,802
How do you feel about me?

450
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,140
About the same.

451
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,682
Then, we should work hard together

452
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,370
and cancel the marriage.

453
00:25:59,302 --> 00:26:00,303
How?

454
00:26:00,384 --> 00:26:02,155
Didn't you say you were tolerant?

455
00:26:02,236 --> 00:26:03,482
They are two separate things.

456
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,015
This is a marriage granted by His Majesty.

457
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,959
We have no feelings for each other!

458
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,330
- Is that important? - Is that not important?

459
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,502
A marriage decides the latter half of our lives.

460
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:12,746
Do you believe in fate?

461
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,962
Are you trying to tell me that our marriage

462
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,962
is destined by fate?

463
00:26:18,142 --> 00:26:19,602
When we live in this world,

464
00:26:19,974 --> 00:26:21,442
destiny is absolute.

465
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,560
For both of us,

466
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,330
His Majesty's edict is destiny.

467
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,922
Since we can't go against it,

468
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,840
we can only accept it.

469
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,850
Can't we think of something?

470
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,160
Ask both of them. They were granted a marriage.

471
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,199
Ask them if they thought about escaping.

472
00:26:35,287 --> 00:26:36,522
I thought about it.

473
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,449
On my way back to the capital,

474
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:40,839
I left horses at a few posthouses along the way.

475
00:26:40,935 --> 00:26:42,345
You left horses? Why?

476
00:26:42,523 --> 00:26:43,739
I thought

477
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,080
I should meet the princess no matter what.

478
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,570
If she's fine,

479
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:50,162
I have nothing to say.

480
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,700
What if I'm not?

481
00:26:52,775 --> 00:26:54,704
After leaving the capital, I'll keep swapping horses at the posthouses.

482
00:26:54,728 --> 00:26:56,202
I'll reach the border in a few days.

483
00:26:56,472 --> 00:26:58,482
When are you planning to escape the capital?

484
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,130
What is your plan? Can I join you in making the plan?

485
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,203
You're going to help me plan my marriage escape?

486
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,640
I've been trying to escape the royal city since young.

487
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,289
However, that was only a dream.

488
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,330
I didn't expect to encounter a real one.

489
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:20,999
I have many ideas about this.

490
00:27:21,118 --> 00:27:22,338
Perhaps I can help you.

491
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,059
There's no need for now.

492
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,940
Why?

493
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,140
Right now,

494
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,799
I don't think I need to escape.

495
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,449
If you want to escape,

496
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,299
just tell me.

497
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,840
All right. I'll make sure that you are the first to know.

498
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,050
If you don't want the marriage,

499
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,322
you can consider escaping to the border.

500
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,522
It's far away and free from control.

501
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:55,979
I can't escape.

502
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,042
The whole Ye family is in the capital.

503
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,689
The whole family can escape with you.

504
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,339
It's not too possible.

505
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,015
The Ye family has been helped by His Majesty for generations.

506
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,399
All of us hold military positions.

507
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,520
It's impossible to escape to the border.

508
00:28:08,036 --> 00:28:09,802
It sounds like a rebellion.

509
00:28:09,942 --> 00:28:11,801
You can go to Danzhou if you don't want to go to the border.

510
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:14,208
When I first came to the capital, I wanted to escape back to Danzhou badly.

511
00:28:14,232 --> 00:28:15,452
You wanted to escape as well?

512
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,810
If the person I met wasn't Wan Er,

513
00:28:18,244 --> 00:28:19,764
I would've escaped as soon as I could.

514
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:21,434
Do you dare go against an imperial edict

515
00:28:21,647 --> 00:28:22,976
because of a marriage?

516
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:25,549
The rest of my life is more important than an imperial edict.

517
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,120
You are right.

518
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,130
I don't know about other people, but Lord Fan dares to go anywhere.

519
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,735
If you feel like leaving, you can even go to Northern Qi now

520
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:34,759
let alone in the past.

521
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:37,170
After all, you have many friends.

522
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,362
The rumors of Lord Fan in Northern Qi

523
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,090
are all false.

524
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,529
Especially the rumor about how amorous he is.

525
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,339
Your Highness,

526
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:53,209
nothing of that sort was spread here.

527
00:28:53,389 --> 00:28:54,999
However, there are many rumors.

528
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,729
Everyone knows about you and Duo Duo.

529
00:28:57,606 --> 00:28:59,959
The world thinks Lord Fan

530
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:02,439
and Haitang Duo Duo, the Saintess of Northern Qi,

531
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,759
understand each other,

532
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,532
share a deep bond, and regret not meeting each other sooner.

533
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:09,293
- Your Highness... - There's no need to describe it so vibrantly.

534
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:12,202
I'm sure you've heard about these rumors. Right, Princess Wan Er?

535
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,762
I've already heard about it.

536
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,080
So, I came to visit

537
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,360
to refute these rumors.

538
00:29:22,455 --> 00:29:25,362
Lord Fan and Duo Duo do not have an affair.

539
00:29:27,335 --> 00:29:28,495
Are the rumors false?

540
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,696
They are not necessarily false.

541
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,249
The things did happen.

542
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,560
- They did happen, right? - Yes.

543
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,090
Confessing in the hall and dancing together at the birthday banquet.

544
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,460
They are all true.

545
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,140
They are true, right?

546
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,130
However, they are just acts.

547
00:29:47,211 --> 00:29:50,772
Lord Fan and Duo Duo hit it off well

548
00:29:50,895 --> 00:29:52,480
and share a little understanding.

549
00:29:52,566 --> 00:29:54,337
They have no feelings for each other at all.

550
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:58,362
A little understanding, right?

551
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,140
Your Highness!

552
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,122
Hold your horses!

553
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:07,082
No. I'm asking you where is your warhorse?

554
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,700
It's at the entrance.

555
00:30:08,781 --> 00:30:10,112
Can I take a look?

556
00:30:10,248 --> 00:30:11,369
Go.

557
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,969
Can you bring me there?

558
00:30:14,065 --> 00:30:15,265
Sure.

559
00:30:15,471 --> 00:30:17,522
I'll go with him to take a look.

560
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,122
Your Highness, just tell me honestly.

561
00:30:35,352 --> 00:30:36,890
Why did you come here?

562
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:39,522
Mother told me

563
00:30:39,582 --> 00:30:41,863
you will be managing the Imperial Treasury in the future.

564
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,729
You have a business deal with Northern Qi.

565
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,760
So, I should protect you whether it's public or personal matters.

566
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,479
- Protect me? - Yes.

567
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,160
I came to visit Princess Wan Er

568
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,560
to help you clear any misunderstanding.

569
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,860
Clear...

570
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,562
Thank you very much.

571
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:01,259
It's what I should do.

572
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,959
There's no need to worry about me.

573
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,220
I can

574
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,779
deal with Wan Er.

575
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,929
Can you do it yourself?

576
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,380
I could at first.

577
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,860
That's great.

578
00:31:18,871 --> 00:31:21,151
Let's discuss business then.

579
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,720
You have business to discuss with me?

580
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,880
I heard about your fight

581
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,282
with Li Cheng Ze.

582
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,209
We can help you.

583
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,819
We?

584
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,922
You want to win against the prince

585
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,330
because he smuggled with Shen Zhong.

586
00:31:41,004 --> 00:31:42,999
I don't have enough evidence. It's only corruption at most.

587
00:31:43,023 --> 00:31:44,243
We can find evidence.

588
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:46,199
I can send a homing pigeon to Northern Qi.

589
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,838
I can give you as much evidence

590
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,379
of their collusion as much as you want.

591
00:31:49,403 --> 00:31:50,884
I can make sure that he can't dispute a thing.

592
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:53,428
- Have you sent the pigeon? - Not yet. You can choose a time.

593
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,400
Your Highness, if you get evidence from Northern Qi now,

594
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,762
I'll be the one who can't dispute anything instead of Li Cheng Ze.

595
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,759
Why do you say that?

596
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,249
The order is wrong.

597
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,819
If the evidence comes from Northern Qi before I complain about him,

598
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,680
it's reasonable.

599
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,610
Right now, everyone knows

600
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:16,071
that we are against each other.

601
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,825
If Northern Qi cooperates and sends evidence here,

602
00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:20,849
what will others think?

603
00:32:20,963 --> 00:32:22,883
Is it him or me who is colluding with the enemy?

604
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,570
Your concern is true.

605
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:31,289
However, if we don't involve colluding with the enemy,

606
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:34,929
how can we defeat a prince?

607
00:32:35,114 --> 00:32:36,547
It's none of your concern, Your Highness.

608
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:38,038
I can think of a way myself.

609
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:40,410
If you need Northern Qi's assistance, just tell me.

610
00:32:40,622 --> 00:32:41,842
Thank you.

611
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,700
Since I'm already here.

612
00:32:47,022 --> 00:32:48,382
Where's your horse? Bring it here.

613
00:32:48,463 --> 00:32:50,042
- Bring what here? - Your horse.

614
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,969
Aren't you feeding it?

615
00:32:56,294 --> 00:32:57,454
This is it?

616
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,560
This isn't a horse!

617
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,860
How isn't it a horse?

618
00:32:59,992 --> 00:33:01,073
I bought it at the market.

619
00:33:01,168 --> 00:33:03,402
I even rode it. It's very fast.

620
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:27,320
I think Fan Xian did all that

621
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,800
to stay alive

622
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:30,119
when he was in Northern Qi.

623
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,479
Wan Er, don't worry.

624
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,920
If he has an affair with the saintess,

625
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,220
I'll help you beat him up.

626
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,762
Thank you, Cheng Ru.

627
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,529
I wanted to ask.

628
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,903
Can you really buy a warhorse at the capital's market?

629
00:33:42,973 --> 00:33:45,042
That's impossible. Buying a warhorse at the market?

630
00:33:45,215 --> 00:33:46,735
Do you think the horse seller had a death wish?

631
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,130
What did you buy?

632
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,279
A mule.

633
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,560
A mule?

634
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,160
It can't go fast.

635
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,400
They are used to pull goods.

636
00:33:53,518 --> 00:33:55,688
Why did he tell me it's a warhorse?

637
00:33:57,231 --> 00:33:59,919
She kept saying the royalty of Qi must repay a debt

638
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:01,416
and insisted on returning a horse to me.

639
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,719
I didn't want to spoil her mood.

640
00:34:03,814 --> 00:34:05,687
How did she end up buying a horse together with you?

641
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:07,520
To compensate me a horse. I told you.

642
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,562
No. I'm asking where her guards went.

643
00:34:10,637 --> 00:34:11,880
Why would she need guards with me around?

644
00:34:11,904 --> 00:34:12,959
Where are your guards?

645
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:14,682
I came back from the battlefield.

646
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:16,523
Do I need guards to walk around the capital?

647
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:18,050
You asked her out alone

648
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,962
and she went out with you on her own?

649
00:34:20,214 --> 00:34:21,854
She wanted to compensate me with a horse.

650
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,140
What's wrong with that?

651
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,010
No. It's great.

652
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,700
I mean it.

653
00:34:41,464 --> 00:34:45,794
It seems like he was fooled by the horse seller.

654
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,769
Who fooled whom?

655
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,620
Him.

656
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,282
He is a prince after all.

657
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,639
I'm sure he's the same as me.

658
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,530
He has been protected since he was born.

659
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,816
Even if he joined the frontier army,

660
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,130
I don't think they will let him risk his life.

661
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,722
So, he's the same as me.

662
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,736
He can't differentiate between a mule and a horse.

663
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,490
You even have an explanation for that?

664
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,522
The people of royalty

665
00:35:12,304 --> 00:35:13,842
have their troubles.

666
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,540
Don't tell him.

667
00:35:16,843 --> 00:35:18,214
Otherwise, it'd be awkward for him.

668
00:35:18,238 --> 00:35:19,679
If Fan Xian didn't tell her,

669
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:21,800
all of you shouldn't tell her the truth.

670
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,280
There's no need to embarrass her.

671
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,769
- What's wrong? - I feel envious.

672
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:34,778
Sorry. I can't be compared to him.

673
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,575
Cheng Ru has been in the frontier army for a long time.

674
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,809
I can't be as valiant as him.

675
00:35:39,327 --> 00:35:40,617
I'm just rude.

676
00:35:42,418 --> 00:35:44,233
I hope you can contribute on the battlefield again

677
00:35:44,257 --> 00:35:46,446
when you return to the border in the future.

678
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,939
Thank you for your wish.

679
00:35:55,408 --> 00:35:56,628
However,

680
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,920
if Qing and Northern Qi are at war again,

681
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,082
we don't just need to rely on your martial prowess

682
00:36:02,253 --> 00:36:04,133
but we also need to depend on Lord Fan as well.

683
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:07,240
Both the saintess and the elder princess

684
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,159
are impressed with Lord Fan.

685
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:12,450
It's obvious that he has greatly benefited from his journey to Northern Qi.

686
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,980
Cheng Ze, I'm happy that you are here to see me today.

687
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,459
I also know

688
00:36:21,607 --> 00:36:24,857
that you didn't come here to visit me.

689
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:26,582
You are overthinking.

690
00:36:26,663 --> 00:36:29,393
I know there's trouble in the imperial court.

691
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:33,249
I also know Fan Xian has a conflict with you.

692
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,140
Wan Er,

693
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,700
these things

694
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,460
have nothing to do with you.

695
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:45,739
Cheng Ze,

696
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,209
I grew up in the palace too.

697
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:51,130
I've been watching your behavior.

698
00:36:51,322 --> 00:36:54,122
Every word you say and everything you do

699
00:36:54,321 --> 00:36:56,162
won't be for no reason.

700
00:36:56,549 --> 00:36:57,769
You came here

701
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,442
and said many things today

702
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,362
but it's all for one thing.

703
00:37:02,114 --> 00:37:03,994
Taking drastic measures to deal with a problem.

704
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,639
What do you mean?

705
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:07,961
His Majesty's imperial edict

706
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:11,242
is the one who marries me and will manage the Imperial Treasury.

707
00:37:11,918 --> 00:37:13,775
Everything you said today,

708
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,116
whether it was Moon Embracing Pavilion

709
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,578
or the Northern Qi rumors,

710
00:37:16,711 --> 00:37:18,272
was to make me hold a grudge

711
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,722
and cancel the marriage agreement.

712
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,680
Without the financial authority,

713
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,042
Fan Xian won't be able to go against you.

714
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,289
Cheng Ze, that is your true objective.

715
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,039
I'm just a scheming person

716
00:37:38,142 --> 00:37:40,033
who shows no true feelings

717
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:42,450
in your opinion.

718
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:43,859
Of course, you do.

719
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,442
However, you keep it deep down

720
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:46,779
where no one can see it.

721
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:49,779
This is the capital.

722
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,042
Everyone is trying

723
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,970
to hide their true intention.

724
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,140
I'm not.

725
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,289
Cheng Ze, I'll tell you today.

726
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:03,809
The marriage agreement between Lin Wan Er and Fan Xian won't change.

727
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,050
Since you've said that, what else can I say?

728
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:22,769
I shouldn't have come here today.

729
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,722
You can come here anytime, Cheng Ze.

730
00:38:24,918 --> 00:38:27,398
However, you don't need to bring any ulterior motive with you.

731
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,220
Warrior Ye,

732
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,882
are you still planning to kill me today?

733
00:38:42,462 --> 00:38:44,141
I'll be leaving then.

734
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:45,832
Why didn't you ask me?

735
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:53,425
What?

736
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:55,650
Lord Fan, are you going to do it yourself?

737
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,369
Please lift your cup.

738
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:26,530
You poisoned the wine?

739
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,840
There are many people in the capital.

740
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,580
People are dying every day.

741
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,620
What else can I say besides "What a pity"?

742
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:44,359
What else do you want me to say?

743
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:47,419
I don't believe

744
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,530
you will kill me

745
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,162
in front of so many people.

746
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:02,779
What poison is it?

747
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,540
What poison is it?

748
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,620
Where's the antidote?

749
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,650
Life and death are uncertain.

750
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,140
We shouldn't

751
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:29,809
take it too seriously.

752
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,930
I just learned this today.

753
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,729
It's quite good.

754
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,650
Your Highness, it was a joke.

755
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,369
Why did you take it so seriously?

756
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,580
Here.

757
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,980
Take it.

758
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,700
What is this?

759
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:14,329
Will you believe me if I tell you this is the antidote?

760
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,122
Wan Er.

761
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,060
Let's not disturb him.

762
00:41:40,682 --> 00:41:41,803
Interesting.

763
00:41:41,884 --> 00:41:43,165
I also didn't come here for nothing.

764
00:41:43,189 --> 00:41:44,600
I won't disturb you as well.

765
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,140
Let me send you off.

766
00:41:54,324 --> 00:41:55,722
Cheng Ru.

767
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,060
Cheng Ru.

768
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,209
Talk to Fan Xian.

769
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:04,299
If it doesn't work,

770
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:05,859
you can concede to him.

771
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,140
This is the poison.

772
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,962
What? What did you say?

773
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,299
This is poison?

774
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:24,680
How did you know?

775
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:26,058
Fan Xian told me himself.

776
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,650
So the wine was not poisoned.

777
00:42:31,142 --> 00:42:32,602
This is the poison?

778
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:34,053
Is that what you are saying?

779
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:37,859
Tell me!

780
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,930
I don't know!

781
00:42:52,774 --> 00:42:54,374
My life is on the line.

782
00:42:55,984 --> 00:42:58,313
I haven't been this excited for so long.
