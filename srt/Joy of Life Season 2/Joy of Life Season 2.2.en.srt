(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:34,002
(Episode 2)

3
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:37,842
If he can't overcome this,

4
00:01:38,157 --> 00:01:40,482
I'm afraid you might never leave this place.

5
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:43,642
I'm not important.

6
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:45,866
What matters is you.

7
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:49,482
If Fan Xian dies,

8
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,002
what will you do?

9
00:01:57,695 --> 00:02:00,122
If Fan Xian really dies,

10
00:02:02,104 --> 00:02:04,122
many people will accompany him in death.

11
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:35,185
Lord Fan.

12
00:02:35,586 --> 00:02:36,855
Nian!

13
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:38,758
- Ba Ba! - Nian!

14
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:39,939
Ba Ba!

15
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:42,242
I miss you so much.

16
00:02:42,478 --> 00:02:44,718
I didn't wake you up

17
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,602
because you were fast asleep this morning.

18
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,562
I miss you so much.

19
00:02:48,884 --> 00:02:50,324
Take care of what's important first.

20
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:53,082
Dear, you've worked hard.

21
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,819
Come here.

22
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,442
Nian.

23
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:00,491
Go.

24
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,402
Dear, you've worked hard.

25
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,122
Lord Fan, here's what you asked for.

26
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:12,910
The situation outside seems wrong.

27
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:14,071
What's wrong?

28
00:03:14,257 --> 00:03:16,124
Have you found the wife and kid of the Teng family?

29
00:03:16,148 --> 00:03:17,248
I haven't.

30
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,922
However, after asking around,

31
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,733
I realized not only has news of your death spread among the people

32
00:03:21,757 --> 00:03:23,402
but also in the government as well.

33
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,060
So what?

34
00:03:27,617 --> 00:03:29,896
So, I think it's bad

35
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:31,258
if this blows up.

36
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:33,842
How do you explain it to His Majesty in the future?

37
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:35,306
You are lying to the emperor.

38
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:36,602
You will be beheaded for that.

39
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:41,329
- I know. - Let's leave the capital and return to the convoy.

40
00:03:41,446 --> 00:03:43,727
Just tell them that the news of your death was a mistake.

41
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,799
Don't worry. I've considered all of that.

42
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,802
I'm glad that you are prepared.

43
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,759
Keep looking for the wife and kid of the Teng family.

44
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:53,442
Are you going back to the convoy yourself?

45
00:03:53,794 --> 00:03:55,284
I'm meeting His Majesty in the palace.

46
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:56,348
Meet His Majesty?

47
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:58,802
My Lord, news of your death has spread.

48
00:03:58,883 --> 00:04:01,174
Meeting His Majesty now is the same as having a death wish.

49
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:02,298
Yes.

50
00:04:02,502 --> 00:04:03,602
It's tough

51
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,527
but we can only survive in desperate situations.

52
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:07,482
No. You might be right

53
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,369
but what if you can't survive?

54
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,322
Are you going to head into a desperate situation first?

55
00:04:11,346 --> 00:04:13,042
There's no choice.

56
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:14,922
I still have to face it, right?

57
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,520
No, My Lord.

58
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,449
We shouldn't just go and die.

59
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,859
Qi Nian.

60
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,562
If I die, move immediately.

61
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,362
Don't stay in the capital anymore. It's pointless.

62
00:04:25,943 --> 00:04:27,802
I... My Lord.

63
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,859
My Lord.

64
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:31,417
My Lord.

65
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,939
My Lord!

66
00:04:33,247 --> 00:04:35,362
You must survive!

67
00:04:36,078 --> 00:04:37,802
I remember you told me

68
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:40,016
Lord Fan was smart.

69
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,820
Naturally.

70
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:46,162
Who do you think Lord Fan is?

71
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:48,802
He's extremely smart.

72
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:50,602
Why are you worried?

73
00:04:51,047 --> 00:04:53,642
The path he has chosen is a dead end.

74
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,199
- Intruder! - Catch the intruder!

75
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,679
- Intruder! - Catch the intruder!

76
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,002
Don't move!

77
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,042
Everyone, don't panic.

78
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:18,280
I'm just an intruder.

79
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,079
All of you, can you not embarrass me?

80
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,202
Someone is complaining to me

81
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,082
when you are just sweeping and spraying water.

82
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:30,042
When can I finally be at ease?

83
00:05:31,155 --> 00:05:33,119
Eunuch Hou. Message from the guards.

84
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:34,486
An intruder is looking for you.

85
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,650
Look!

86
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:37,131
Even a...

87
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,480
(Head Eunuch, Eunuch Hou)

88
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:43,922
Who did you say was looking for me?

89
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,913
Eunuch Hou.

90
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:49,553
He is familiar with everything about the palace

91
00:05:49,577 --> 00:05:51,108
- and doesn't seem like an outsider. - We think

92
00:05:51,132 --> 00:05:53,244
you should take a look, Eunuch Hou.

93
00:05:53,695 --> 00:05:55,202
A bunch of useless people.

94
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,460
Move.

95
00:06:01,263 --> 00:06:02,602
Greetings, Eunuch Hou.

96
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:07,962
Move.

97
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:22,322
Lord Fan, why are you here?

98
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,499
Eunuch Hou, please deliver a message for me.

99
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,762
What message?

100
00:06:25,862 --> 00:06:26,962
I want to meet His Majesty.

101
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,482
You mustn't.

102
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,362
His Majesty is furious right now.

103
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,962
Meeting His Majesty now means death for you.

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,802
Eunuch Hou, please tell His Majesty for me that I have my own reasons.

105
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,172
- I just want to meet him once. - Lord Fan.

106
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:44,922
I'm begging you. Just leave.

107
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,160
Just help me deliver a message.

108
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:49,402
His Majesty is very angry.

109
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,480
If I dare deliver your message,

110
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,762
I'll die together with you.

111
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,922
Forgive me for saying this.

112
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,489
In this situation,

113
00:06:57,608 --> 00:06:58,922
you'll be dead

114
00:06:58,997 --> 00:07:00,402
if you don't leave.

115
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,762
If you stay masked

116
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,602
and leave from where you came,

117
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,450
I'll turn a blind eye.

118
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,860
Faking death to lie to the emperor.

119
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,482
An act like this is extremely foolish!

120
00:07:47,588 --> 00:07:49,762
What else could I do?

121
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,295
No matter how important it was, you should return to the capital first.

122
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,159
A life was at risk. I couldn't wait that long.

123
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,962
- Is your life unimportant? - So?

124
00:07:58,381 --> 00:08:00,181
President Chen, are you here to take my life?

125
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:02,559
I'm sure you know your situation.

126
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:04,040
- I know. - What do you know?

127
00:08:04,163 --> 00:08:06,523
Everyone tells me that meeting His Majesty now means death.

128
00:08:06,631 --> 00:08:08,511
My only way to survive is to leave the capital.

129
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:10,042
Leaving the capital

130
00:08:10,638 --> 00:08:11,882
is no different than death.

131
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:13,960
According to you, I'll die no matter what.

132
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,141
You are right.

133
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,042
You die if you meet His Majesty.

134
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,362
If you want to live, you must first die.

135
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,282
Risk your life to meet His Majesty

136
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,362
and you'll have a chance to live.

137
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,202
If His Majesty doesn't kill you this time,

138
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,202
you'll overcome this.

139
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:33,042
But I have no way of meeting him now.

140
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,322
I can try to persuade him.

141
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,282
I don't know

142
00:08:46,565 --> 00:08:47,905
if you'll live or die.

143
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:02,379
I know you don't trust me now. That's good.

144
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,442
If you keep trusting me blindly,

145
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,762
it's all over for you.

146
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,722
However, you have no choice now.

147
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,300
Wait.

148
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,362
Help me give this to His Majesty.

149
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:36,842
There's no need to open it.

150
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,002
I don't need to know what it is.

151
00:09:39,694 --> 00:09:41,893
Xiao En revealed the secrets of the Divine Temple before his death.

152
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,119
Regarding the Divine Temple,

153
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,272
don't mention it

154
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:45,682
if His Majesty doesn't.

155
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,689
If His Majesty meets you today,

156
00:09:50,446 --> 00:09:51,922
you must remember.

157
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,642
Don't see me

158
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:56,442
before you can confirm that you are deemed officially alive.

159
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,476
I won't help you

160
00:09:58,557 --> 00:09:59,917
with what you do and who you save.

161
00:10:00,694 --> 00:10:02,842
Assume you have no help in the capital

162
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,280
and you are on your own.

163
00:10:04,383 --> 00:10:05,905
I can't go elsewhere.

164
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:07,640
Don't return to the Fan Residence. Don't come to see me.

165
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:09,442
Decide the rest yourself.

166
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:18,562
Thank you.

167
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,682
Greetings, Your Majesty.

168
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,522
I have good news

169
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,442
to report to Your Majesty.

170
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:42,322
News of Fan Xian's death has spread in the capital.

171
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:46,562
It has instigated the scholars of Qing to fight with us.

172
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:48,362
They are working hard.

173
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,322
The literary circle of Northern Qi has been suppressing us until now.

174
00:10:51,646 --> 00:10:53,146
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

175
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,760
The situation has changed now.

176
00:10:56,894 --> 00:11:01,842
The literary circle of Qing will no longer be inferior to Northern Qi.

177
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,922
If what you say is true, Fan Xian deserves his death.

178
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,722
The crime of lying to the emperor

179
00:11:12,398 --> 00:11:14,082
is indeed punishable by death.

180
00:11:14,286 --> 00:11:16,962
However, if he is alive,

181
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,340
he is still useful.

182
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:20,642
After all, every scholar

183
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:24,282
has seen Fan Xian as the future scholar model.

184
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,282
If he is alive,

185
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:31,562
the literary circle of Northern Qi will also admire him.

186
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,100
Your Majesty.

187
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,530
There are rumors out there.

188
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:38,282
They say there's a mistake

189
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,605
because of the distance.

190
00:11:39,694 --> 00:11:41,562
They say news of his death is wrong.

191
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,562
It's also possible.

192
00:11:45,978 --> 00:11:47,226
Regardless,

193
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:48,882
the crime of lying to Your Majesty

194
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:50,882
must not be forgiven.

195
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:58,198
However, Fan Xian is still requesting to meet Your Majesty

196
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,042
even if he knows that he will die.

197
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,242
That means he knows his mistake

198
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:03,802
and is willing to die.

199
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:06,402
He is not going to avoid his responsibility.

200
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,122
Look. This is the gift he brought you.

201
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,729
Look at him...

202
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,122
While Northern Qi is in danger

203
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,842
and his life is at risk,

204
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,962
the person he cares about most

205
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:27,160
is still Your Majesty.

206
00:12:30,343 --> 00:12:32,153
He deserves to die.

207
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:36,802
Your Majesty,

208
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,522
it's not too late

209
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:41,442
to kill him

210
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:43,663
after you've met him.

211
00:13:02,855 --> 00:13:04,202
Do you have anything else?

212
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,682
I'll be leaving.

213
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:41,002
I, Criminal Fan Xian,

214
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,282
faked my death and lied to Your Majesty!

215
00:14:43,623 --> 00:14:46,442
My crimes are unforgivable and deserve death!

216
00:14:53,921 --> 00:14:56,642
Since growing up in Danzhou,

217
00:14:57,694 --> 00:14:59,442
I've known nothing about the world

218
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:01,491
and had no ambition.

219
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,882
After I entered the capital,

220
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:05,619
my life became better.

221
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,282
Without Your Majesty's trust,

222
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,642
I wouldn't have achieved what I have today.

223
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,482
I did not express it

224
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,042
but I appreciated Your Majesty's grace.

225
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,322
Since becoming an envoy at Northern Qi,

226
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:26,402
I've been determined to sacrifice my life.

227
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,202
My life

228
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:31,410
is nothing when compared to Your Majesty's trust!

229
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,879
I came to meet Your Majesty today

230
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,962
not because of any other reasons

231
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,039
but to tell Your Majesty about all I learned from Northern Qi!

232
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:43,442
Please don't neglect the country's fate

233
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,442
because of my death.

234
00:15:51,965 --> 00:15:53,682
When I was an envoy at Northern Qi,

235
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,162
I found out that Elder Princess, Li Yun Rui

236
00:15:56,302 --> 00:15:58,282
and Second Prince, Li Cheng Ze

237
00:15:58,438 --> 00:16:00,848
were talking to Northern Qi's imperial guards!

238
00:16:01,014 --> 00:16:03,082
They might be colluding with each other!

239
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,562
On my way back with the convoy,

240
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,362
I was blackmailed

241
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,366
by Li Cheng Ze's men with the lives of my close ones

242
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,202
to obey their orders.

243
00:16:13,294 --> 00:16:14,882
I had no choice

244
00:16:15,286 --> 00:16:17,122
but to fake my death to escape.

245
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,122
Although I have a reason,

246
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,842
it's still absurd.

247
00:16:30,294 --> 00:16:31,442
Regarding the Divine Temple,

248
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,640
don't mention it

249
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:33,882
if His Majesty doesn't.

250
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,522
Besides that,

251
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:47,082
Xiao En told me before his death that the Divine Temple

252
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:48,722
was in the far north.

253
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,802
A secret information like this

254
00:16:55,646 --> 00:16:58,562
should be hidden and only be revealed to certain people.

255
00:17:01,572 --> 00:17:03,772
Your Majesty, please make a decision after considering.

256
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:13,522
I've told Your Majesty

257
00:17:13,703 --> 00:17:15,882
everything I learned in Northern Qi.

258
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,162
Right now,

259
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,922
even if I die,

260
00:17:22,015 --> 00:17:23,562
I won't have any more regrets!

261
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:26,842
My only regret

262
00:17:27,342 --> 00:17:31,352
is that I can't contribute to the Qing Kingdom and Your Majesty

263
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:33,202
after my death!

264
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:36,002
After I die, my spirit

265
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,162
will protect the Qing Kingdom

266
00:17:38,294 --> 00:17:40,002
and Your Majesty!

267
00:17:40,463 --> 00:17:43,162
I hope the Qing Kingdom can unite the land!

268
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:46,282
I hope Your Majesty can be healthy!

269
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:48,162
I've said everything.

270
00:17:48,884 --> 00:17:50,562
Now, I can receive my punishment.

271
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:00,242
Get lost!

272
00:18:33,763 --> 00:18:35,256
(Yanhua Hall)

273
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,602
Didn't I say to get lost?

274
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:50,802
It has been so long.

275
00:18:57,106 --> 00:18:58,206
Fan Xian?

276
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,202
Didn't you go to Northern Qi as an envoy?

277
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:03,962
What's going on?

278
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,870
Your Highness, you are going overboard with your act.

279
00:19:07,093 --> 00:19:08,402
What do you mean?

280
00:19:08,686 --> 00:19:10,333
My elegiac couplet is hanging at the city gates.

281
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,962
Do you not know of my death?

282
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:13,922
It's best if I know nothing.

283
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,082
What makes a good crown prince?

284
00:19:16,462 --> 00:19:18,101
Someone who knows nothing.

285
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:19,664
I'm already standing in front of you.

286
00:19:19,688 --> 00:19:21,082
I see nothing.

287
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:24,790
Don't you know why I faked my death and returned to the capital?

288
00:19:24,814 --> 00:19:26,842
I'm blind and deaf.

289
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,840
Li Yun Rui and Li Cheng Ze are colluding

290
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,280
with Northern Qi's imperial guards

291
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:32,402
to smuggle money and have ulterior motives.

292
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:40,562
Cheng Ze is good at scheming.

293
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,442
He always has his sights on the treasury's fortune.

294
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,642
No. This is impossible!

295
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,600
Aunt Yun Rui will never stand with Cheng Ze.

296
00:19:57,703 --> 00:20:00,063
Your Highness, do you think you know Princess Yun Rui well?

297
00:20:09,412 --> 00:20:10,452
Whom did you hear it from?

298
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:12,583
Northern Qi Imperial Guard Zhenfu Division Commander, Shen Zhong.

299
00:20:12,607 --> 00:20:13,707
Do you have proof?

300
00:20:14,141 --> 00:20:16,602
There's a town on the border of Qing called Shijia Town.

301
00:20:16,763 --> 00:20:18,700
Northern Qi's contraband will usually be stocked up here

302
00:20:18,724 --> 00:20:20,524
before they are transported into the kingdom.

303
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,286
If you investigate all the merchants in this town,

304
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,602
the truth will come to light.

305
00:20:26,998 --> 00:20:28,167
That means the news you have

306
00:20:28,248 --> 00:20:29,875
was given to you by this man called Shen Zhong, right?

307
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:31,797
- Northern Qi's emperor helped me. - Why should he?

308
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:33,242
I accepted a smuggling job.

309
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:35,108
That was why Li Cheng Ze wanted to kill me.

310
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,002
I sent people to Shijia Town late at night.

311
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:38,882
Your Highness, can you hear me now?

312
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,402
This is about life and death.

313
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,922
I don't care anymore.

314
00:20:43,146 --> 00:20:44,562
I'll send you back to the convoy.

315
00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:46,406
I still need to stay in the capital for now.

316
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,650
You can hide here.

317
00:20:47,774 --> 00:20:49,442
Thanks. I have my own things to do.

318
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:52,442
Your life is in danger now.

319
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,319
If you need any help, just tell me.

320
00:20:54,446 --> 00:20:55,642
Thank you.

321
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,575
Your Highness, you mustn't let Li Cheng Ze know we are working together.

322
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,682
Naturally. This is top secret.

323
00:21:00,763 --> 00:21:02,802
- The guards... - I'll lock them up for a while.

324
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:04,152
I didn't expect

325
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:05,992
we would work together one day.

326
00:21:06,151 --> 00:21:07,482
We are just taking what we need.

327
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,859
Take care.

328
00:21:12,025 --> 00:21:17,629
(Yanhua Hall)

329
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,162
The guards who came just now. Come here.

330
00:21:27,443 --> 00:21:29,224
- Is everyone here? - Yes.

331
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,882
Humans are not plants.

332
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,842
We all have feelings.

333
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,482
They have served me for many years.

334
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,282
Leave their dead bodies intact.

335
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,829
We must leave now.

336
00:21:56,918 --> 00:21:59,722
Otherwise, not only can we not save the Teng family's wife and kid,

337
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,493
but my wife and Ba Ba will also be in danger.

338
00:22:01,517 --> 00:22:02,848
Why are you panicking?

339
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:04,863
You went to His Highness in this situation?

340
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:06,956
Isn't that colluding with him?

341
00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:08,882
That's another crime in itself.

342
00:22:09,157 --> 00:22:10,257
Also,

343
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:12,482
you just entered the palace.

344
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:15,016
If someone finds out,

345
00:22:15,098 --> 00:22:16,562
someone will come out

346
00:22:16,643 --> 00:22:18,922
and use this opportunity to kill you for real.

347
00:22:19,014 --> 00:22:20,562
Wang, listen to me.

348
00:22:21,743 --> 00:22:24,962
Time is the most crucial thing for me to be alive, right?

349
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,842
If I am not alive by the time the convoy returns,

350
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:29,762
it'll be difficult to revive me.

351
00:22:29,874 --> 00:22:31,866
That was why I went to the crown prince.

352
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,522
Can the crown prince revive you?

353
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,925
That's not it. It's because time is short and I have crucial things to do.

354
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:39,566
We have too many things to investigate.

355
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,280
I can't do it alone so we need to work together.

356
00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:44,735
I asked the crown prince to investigate Prince Cheng Ze's smuggling

357
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:47,351
while we find the wife and kid of the Teng family.

358
00:22:47,436 --> 00:22:49,996
We can only return to the convoy after we investigate the truth.

359
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,602
What if we can't find anything?

360
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,762
Then, all of us have to die.

361
00:22:58,117 --> 00:22:59,682
Lord Fan, that's too serious!

362
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:02,682
- My family and Ba Ba... - That won't happen.

363
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,682
There are more solutions than problems.

364
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:10,064
Speaking of which, how's your investigation?

365
00:23:11,614 --> 00:23:14,242
I do have something.

366
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,442
I've asked around.

367
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,920
Fei Jie is not in the capital.

368
00:23:19,008 --> 00:23:20,642
He went to carry out his duty.

369
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:22,219
He's safe.

370
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,569
Young Master Si Zhe

371
00:23:25,735 --> 00:23:27,202
is safe as well.

372
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,642
I've asked around.

373
00:23:29,944 --> 00:23:32,439
They said he always left early and returned home late.

374
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,282
They didn't know what he was doing.

375
00:23:34,374 --> 00:23:37,362
However, there are no signs of him being held.

376
00:23:38,974 --> 00:23:42,562
Only the Teng family's mother and kid are missing?

377
00:23:43,718 --> 00:23:44,818
I do have

378
00:23:45,118 --> 00:23:46,682
news about them.

379
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:52,442
Someone saw them being taken away.

380
00:23:52,861 --> 00:23:54,381
Did they see where they were taken to?

381
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:00,042
Moon Embracing Pavilion.

382
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:01,859
Moon Embracing Pavilion?

383
00:24:02,183 --> 00:24:03,402
What kind of place is it?

384
00:24:04,822 --> 00:24:06,322
A brothel.

385
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,362
Are you not planning to come out?

386
00:24:20,747 --> 00:24:22,522
I don't know how long I'm going to stay here

387
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,042
so I moved some of them inside.

388
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,402
It won't be too long.

389
00:24:33,374 --> 00:24:35,722
- Do you have news? - The intruder met His Majesty.

390
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,522
An intruder who could meet His Majesty?

391
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:45,250
- Fan Xian? - His Majesty wanted to revive him officially.

392
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,409
He is running out of time.

393
00:24:53,628 --> 00:24:55,068
When the convoy reaches the capital,

394
00:24:55,144 --> 00:24:56,722
everything will be settled.

395
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,922
He will never be revived.

396
00:25:20,581 --> 00:25:23,002
Fan Xian was burned. Are we not returning to the capital?

397
00:25:23,663 --> 00:25:24,763
There's no rush.

398
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,442
Let's keep observing.

399
00:25:29,866 --> 00:25:31,466
We must be sure that nothing goes wrong.

400
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:34,105
If he plans to revive him in the future,

401
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,241
why did His Majesty announce Fan Xian's death

402
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,842
to everyone?

403
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,683
His Majesty wants the people who killed him to know

404
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,797
what happened after Fan Xian's death.

405
00:25:49,574 --> 00:25:50,882
The kingdom is shocked.

406
00:25:51,282 --> 00:25:52,495
It's soon going to be a state funeral.

407
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:55,602
After all, Zhuang Mo Han gave him all his books.

408
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,082
It is very significant.

409
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:00,202
The inheritance of the literary circle.

410
00:26:01,934 --> 00:26:03,034
One more thing.

411
00:26:03,115 --> 00:26:05,802
His Majesty wants to give him a lesson.

412
00:26:06,005 --> 00:26:07,285
Everything's good about this kid

413
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,536
but he's too unorthodox.

414
00:26:10,353 --> 00:26:11,628
Will Fan Xian understand his intention?

415
00:26:11,652 --> 00:26:12,942
He does understand

416
00:26:13,456 --> 00:26:14,882
but he will never obey.

417
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,162
This is a good opportunity.

418
00:26:27,036 --> 00:26:28,436
After news of his death has spread,

419
00:26:28,488 --> 00:26:30,002
no one will say anything

420
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:31,119
if he is really dead.

421
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:32,562
It's logical even.

422
00:26:37,788 --> 00:26:40,762
- What are you doing? - Weren't you asking me to kill Fan Xian?

423
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:42,349
Kill him only when he has been found.

424
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,882
Inform me when he has been found.

425
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,882
Actually,

426
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,762
it's difficult to find Fan Xian.

427
00:27:01,827 --> 00:27:03,547
However, we can make him appear on his own.

428
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,242
Where should he be appearing?

429
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,610
Where else?

430
00:27:06,807 --> 00:27:08,002
Moon Embracing Pavilion.

431
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,962
Moon Embracing Pavilion?

432
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:14,599
If he wants to find the mother and kid of the Teng family,

433
00:27:14,853 --> 00:27:16,647
Fan Xian will surely go to Moon Embracing Pavilion.

434
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:18,042
Aren't you going to help him?

435
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,682
In this situation,

436
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,376
His Majesty is also watching.

437
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,642
He might not be happy if I help Fan Xian.

438
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,242
Who is behind

439
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,642
Moon Embracing Pavilion?

440
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:42,947
(Moon Embracing Pavilion)

441
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:49,379
Open the door!

442
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,562
Can I have fun inside?

443
00:27:54,803 --> 00:27:56,603
Sorry. You can't enter without an invitation.

444
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,760
- Please make an exception. - I can't. This way, please.

445
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,082
(Moon Embracing Pavilion Invitation)

446
00:28:06,846 --> 00:28:09,002
Please come inside. Have fun.

447
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:26,522
An outsider can't enter this place.

448
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,522
Isn't it a brothel?

449
00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:31,002
It's a brothel

450
00:28:31,215 --> 00:28:32,642
but the standard is high.

451
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:34,242
They choose their customers.

452
00:28:34,743 --> 00:28:37,762
They must be people with an identity and talent.

453
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,228
Then, you'll have an invitation.

454
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:41,639
You can only enter with that invitation.

455
00:28:42,678 --> 00:28:44,797
Apparently, this brothel is quieter and more elegant

456
00:28:44,878 --> 00:28:46,602
than other brothels.

457
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,682
Great. It's members-only.

458
00:28:48,862 --> 00:28:50,122
What is that?

459
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,849
Nothing. Then, the invitation...

460
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,362
It's not easy to get one.

461
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,402
However, I asked around.

462
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:58,439
We have a godsent opportunity now.

463
00:28:58,565 --> 00:29:01,042
- What is it? - Mourning the Poetic Genius

464
00:29:01,183 --> 00:29:02,642
to express condolences.

465
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,202
It's to mourn you.

466
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,682
Can we enter Moon Embracing Pavilion by mourning me?

467
00:29:08,127 --> 00:29:10,283
If you do well, you will get an invitation.

468
00:29:10,363 --> 00:29:12,922
You can only enter Moon Embracing Pavilion with the invitation.

469
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:14,758
What do you mean by mourning me well?

470
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,179
Everyone,

471
00:29:16,318 --> 00:29:17,418
we've invited

472
00:29:17,511 --> 00:29:20,962
three reputable officials

473
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,522
to witness the mourning.

474
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:27,402
Every person

475
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,522
who received the three officials' approval

476
00:29:31,191 --> 00:29:33,682
will receive the invitation.

477
00:29:34,015 --> 00:29:36,802
With this invitation, you can enter Moon Embracing Pavilion.

478
00:29:46,054 --> 00:29:47,154
What is he doing?

479
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,682
Don't you see

480
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,290
how the Yellow River flows from heaven?

481
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:56,501
Reciting a poet when you were drunk at Qinian Hall.

482
00:29:56,597 --> 00:29:59,122
We are born talented!

483
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,082
Even if we spend a fortune, we can still make it back!

484
00:30:02,287 --> 00:30:05,377
Great!

485
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,002
He is imitating

486
00:30:09,118 --> 00:30:11,042
the ones who mourn well.

487
00:30:11,282 --> 00:30:13,345
Why does it sound weird?

488
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,202
They are mourning you.

489
00:30:15,824 --> 00:30:17,442
Lord Fan will live forever!

490
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:20,362
Lord Fan will live forever!

491
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:22,247
What weapon do you like?

492
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,682
A sword, of course.

493
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,060
- It's so awkward. - Look.

494
00:30:41,144 --> 00:30:43,322
They failed in the mourning.

495
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:44,882
An imitation show?

496
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,482
I can understand imitation

497
00:30:48,751 --> 00:30:50,602
but what's a show?

498
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,202
It's called a show.

499
00:30:56,027 --> 00:30:57,522
You are slimmer indeed.

500
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,682
I panic at Huangkong Bay.

501
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:08,602
Everyone.

502
00:31:09,561 --> 00:31:10,661
Try it.

503
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,562
Though we don't have the wings of a phoenix,

504
00:31:13,775 --> 00:31:16,679
our minds still understand each other.

505
00:31:16,806 --> 00:31:18,322
I'll do it again.

506
00:31:19,448 --> 00:31:20,802
I'll do it again.

507
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,522
Give me another chance!

508
00:31:24,128 --> 00:31:26,042
Do I look like him?

509
00:31:26,407 --> 00:31:29,042
Look. These people do badly in mourning you.

510
00:31:29,123 --> 00:31:32,202
They are bad in the imitation show.

511
00:31:33,661 --> 00:31:36,282
Isn't this a godsent opportunity?

512
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,817
Who can beat you in imitating yourself?

513
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,820
My Lord,

514
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,842
aren't we going to investigate at Moon Embracing Pavilion?

515
00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:50,762
Why aren't you participating?

516
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,667
If Moon Embracing Pavilion is welcoming all guests,

517
00:31:53,748 --> 00:31:54,887
we might be able to give it a try.

518
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:56,011
Lord Fan.

519
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,402
Why did you let him drink this?

520
00:32:01,306 --> 00:32:02,842
That's not bad.

521
00:32:04,518 --> 00:32:06,202
Dear, allow me.

522
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:18,042
Are you afraid that someone might recognize you

523
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,002
after you go on stage?

524
00:32:20,628 --> 00:32:22,481
Even if they don't recognize me on stage,

525
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:25,256
I'm afraid I can't hide myself if I enter without a crowd

526
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,962
as cover.

527
00:32:27,272 --> 00:32:29,513
Now that I think about it, the mourning

528
00:32:29,594 --> 00:32:31,042
might be a trap.

529
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:33,842
A trap to catch a turtle?

530
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:36,210
- To catch you. - No. I mean...

531
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:38,962
We should enter the place

532
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,042
to find them at night.

533
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,719
We only have one chance.

534
00:32:42,806 --> 00:32:44,362
I'm afraid I might scare them.

535
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,922
Who is the manager of Moon Embracing Pavilion?

536
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:49,362
I need to investigate it.

537
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,619
Yuan Meng.

538
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,362
Who is Yuan Meng?

539
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:18,402
Lord Fan, write me a poem!

540
00:33:18,703 --> 00:33:19,872
Lord Fan!

541
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,400
Lord Fan lives forever!

542
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:24,583
Lord Fan!

543
00:33:24,686 --> 00:33:26,202
You are finally here!

544
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,802
(Moon Embracing Pavilion Manager, Yuan Meng)

545
00:33:36,696 --> 00:33:38,722
Yuan Meng, Madam Yuan.

546
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,402
- Retreat. - She was the best courtesan in Liujing River.

547
00:33:41,915 --> 00:33:44,682
She is the most famous courtesan only second to Si Li Li.

548
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,842
How do you know this?

549
00:33:49,078 --> 00:33:51,882
We used to sell spices and rouge.

550
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,882
We know a thing or two about brothels.

551
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,535
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

552
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,879
Lord Fan, please don't blame him.

553
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,362
Qi Nian cares little

554
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:00,842
about this business.

555
00:34:01,945 --> 00:34:03,442
I need to avoid suspicions.

556
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,482
I should learn from you.

557
00:34:06,701 --> 00:34:11,402
My Lord, should we begin our investigation with Yuan Meng?

558
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,882
Is Yuan Meng the owner of Moon Embracing Pavilion?

559
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,562
Although she's the manager,

560
00:34:20,702 --> 00:34:22,042
she isn't the owner.

561
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,882
Moon Embracing Pavilion's owner is mysterious.

562
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,103
No one knows his background

563
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,562
and he has never shown his face.

564
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:31,695
If we want to find the mother and kid of the Teng family,

565
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:34,362
I'm afraid we need to find this mysterious owner.

566
00:34:35,244 --> 00:34:36,404
Even if outsiders don't know,

567
00:34:36,573 --> 00:34:37,922
the people in the brothel

568
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,322
might know about him.

569
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,198
Do you know someone inside?

570
00:34:42,222 --> 00:34:43,442
There's a lady

571
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,042
who is close to Qi Nian.

572
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,267
Impossible.

573
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,810
That's impossible, My Lord.

574
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,042
I care most about my reputation.

575
00:34:54,407 --> 00:34:56,802
Calling me as pure as ice and jade

576
00:34:56,951 --> 00:34:58,025
is not an exaggeration.

577
00:34:58,136 --> 00:35:01,442
I'm sure you've heard rumors.

578
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:02,962
Miss Sang Wen.

579
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,402
Why is my hand so slippery today?

580
00:35:09,488 --> 00:35:10,842
Are you sweating?

581
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,622
Didn't you deliver the spices and rouge

582
00:35:13,709 --> 00:35:15,802
to Miss Sang Wen initially?

583
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:18,402
You are right.

584
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,882
But there's nothing between us.

585
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,322
My Lord, I just remember.

586
00:35:26,927 --> 00:35:29,696
In the beginning, I sold her a Guqin book.

587
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,689
Later, I sold her a Guqin.

588
00:35:32,823 --> 00:35:35,202
After that, I sold her spices as my wife mentioned.

589
00:35:35,983 --> 00:35:37,722
You sold many things to her.

590
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,242
What else did you sell?

591
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,360
I sold maps and "Dream of the Red Chamber".

592
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:43,802
You know all that.

593
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:46,239
However, I've only been serving you

594
00:35:46,335 --> 00:35:48,522
after I met you.

595
00:35:49,695 --> 00:35:52,682
Dear, if you didn't mention

596
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,280
her name just now,

597
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:55,922
I already forgot about her.

598
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:58,682
Miss Sang Wen is in Moon Embracing Pavilion now.

599
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,242
I thought she said she would only become a singing courtesan and not...

600
00:36:11,077 --> 00:36:12,157
Lord Fan, you are lucky.

601
00:36:12,238 --> 00:36:14,282
It seems like Qi Nian still remembers something.

602
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:17,362
I'm sure he is able to help you contact her.

603
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,162
Why is it broken?

604
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,722
I don't know.

605
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,242
I'll go and change it.

606
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:40,532
Me?

607
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:42,722
I'll help you find it.

608
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,082
Why don't we...

609
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:49,427
Yes.

610
00:36:49,693 --> 00:36:50,962
Drink tea.

611
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,722
I should respect the host.

612
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:14,434
Where did I put the spoon?

613
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,442
It's here.

614
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,339
Go.

615
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:20,599
Lord Fan is waiting for you to talk about Miss Sang.

616
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,602
I'm not close to her.

617
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,640
Besides, she is inside Moon Embracing Pavilion.

618
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:28,779
Even if I want to meet her,

619
00:37:28,903 --> 00:37:30,402
I don't have an opportunity.

620
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:36,682
You still want to meet her?

621
00:37:36,763 --> 00:37:37,842
No, I...

622
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:40,080
I need to meet her. I must meet her.

623
00:37:40,213 --> 00:37:44,002
I'm doing that to think of a perfect plan for Lord Fan.

624
00:37:47,669 --> 00:37:48,769
My Lord.

625
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,100
My Lord.

626
00:37:52,718 --> 00:37:53,962
Don't stare.

627
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,322
Is there redness?

628
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:58,082
Her fingers are quite long.

629
00:37:58,225 --> 00:37:59,562
I'll be fine after a while.

630
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,060
My Lord.

631
00:38:01,578 --> 00:38:03,642
If you want to meet her, there's still a way.

632
00:38:04,471 --> 00:38:06,002
The clothing and rouge

633
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,840
of ladies in the brothel

634
00:38:07,967 --> 00:38:09,482
still need to be purchased outside.

635
00:38:09,566 --> 00:38:11,762
- Which shop? - I know which shop.

636
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,722
If we want to find Sang Wen,

637
00:38:15,005 --> 00:38:16,922
we must wait patiently.

638
00:38:17,093 --> 00:38:19,322
Can you sneak into the shop?

639
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:22,842
I know all of them.

640
00:38:23,457 --> 00:38:25,482
Qi Nian, you are guilty.

641
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,442
No. Don't overthink.

642
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:30,720
I'm just making a little money off them.

643
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,682
There's nothing between us.

644
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,442
Don't you believe me?

645
00:38:40,135 --> 00:38:41,326
I have a clear conscience, right?

646
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,719
Why didn't you make it clear?

647
00:38:44,298 --> 00:38:47,322
You don't understand because you are not married.

648
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,082
Even if I have a clear conscience,

649
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:52,282
I still can't say a word.

650
00:38:52,569 --> 00:38:54,322
Otherwise, it'll cause unwanted trouble.

651
00:38:54,577 --> 00:38:56,042
You can't plant a seed of doubt

652
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,722
in women.

653
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,482
For men,

654
00:38:59,562 --> 00:39:01,241
peace is happiness.

655
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:03,882
It's not easy to get married.

656
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,739
- Let's leave now. - Let's go.

657
00:39:12,991 --> 00:39:14,091
Dear.

658
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,777
I'm going with Lord Fan to carry out an official duty.

659
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:20,562
Remember to bring a blue flower handkerchief.

660
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,840
Sure!

661
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,900
What's wrong?

662
00:39:25,454 --> 00:39:27,562
- What did she mean? - What are you talking about?

663
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,442
The shop we are going to

664
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,402
is famous for its blue flower handkerchief.

665
00:39:35,725 --> 00:39:36,922
Interesting.

666
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:55,322
Hurry! The ladies of Moon Embracing Pavilion have come out!

667
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:57,122
They are so pretty!

668
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,082
Move.

669
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,202
- Smile! - Move!

670
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:14,152
All of them look like fairies.

671
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,362
Miss, look. This is the latest product.

672
00:40:17,744 --> 00:40:19,402
It suits you a lot.

673
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:21,930
Stop pushing!

674
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:24,922
You have good taste.

675
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:30,042
This is not bad.

676
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,202
This looks nice too.

677
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:34,562
What do you think about this?

678
00:40:36,376 --> 00:40:37,866
I like this color the most!

679
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,642
The embroidery is pretty.

680
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:43,842
This is a handmade embroidery. It's so pretty.

681
00:40:50,517 --> 00:40:51,762
Miss Sang Wen.

682
00:40:53,103 --> 00:40:55,162
(Moon Embracing Pavilion Courtesan, Sang Wen)

683
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,551
The sunset glow last night was thin.

684
00:40:59,575 --> 00:41:02,042
I'm guessing that you will visit soon.

685
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:05,402
I've prepared the things you asked for last time.

686
00:41:08,902 --> 00:41:10,162
Miss, this way.

687
00:41:20,423 --> 00:41:21,783
Are you going to follow me inside?

688
00:41:33,165 --> 00:41:34,265
Miss.

689
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:36,842
Don't shout.

690
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,482
We are friends.

691
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,322
It's me. Wang Qi Nian.

692
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,762
We are in disguise.

693
00:41:45,151 --> 00:41:46,362
Take this.

694
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,082
He is Master Zhao.

695
00:41:52,327 --> 00:41:54,082
He has admired you for a long time.

696
00:41:54,249 --> 00:41:57,008
He only wants to meet you and has no other intentions.

697
00:41:57,126 --> 00:41:58,802
Please don't cause a stir.

698
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,202
That's a lavish gift,

699
00:42:03,382 --> 00:42:04,482
Lord Fan.

700
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:06,562
No. He's Zhao...

701
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:08,739
I've met you.

702
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,282
- Where? - Miss Si Li Li took a boat to meet you

703
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:14,842
by using the fireworks as a cover.

704
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,522
I was watching from the building.

705
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,482
We are fated indeed.

706
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:22,042
I heard you were dead.

707
00:42:22,222 --> 00:42:23,482
I also heard the same.

708
00:42:24,114 --> 00:42:26,166
- My condolences. - Thanks for your concern.

709
00:42:26,247 --> 00:42:27,607
I will look forward to the future.

710
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:34,531
What do you mean?

711
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:38,339
Lord Fan,

712
00:42:38,978 --> 00:42:40,751
do you wish to investigate the Moon Embracing Pavilion?

713
00:42:40,775 --> 00:42:43,056
- Who did you hear that from? - I didn't tell her that.

714
00:42:44,158 --> 00:42:45,615
Lord Fan, I don't think that you came back from the dead

715
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:46,991
and came to find me in such a place

716
00:42:47,015 --> 00:42:48,865
because you fell for me.

717
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,403
I'm just an ordinary girl.

718
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,100
Everything around me is ordinary

719
00:42:53,124 --> 00:42:55,362
except for Moon Embracing Pavilion.

720
00:42:56,393 --> 00:42:59,002
What's not ordinary about Moon Embracing Pavilion, then?
