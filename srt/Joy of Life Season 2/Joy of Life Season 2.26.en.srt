00:01:25,012 --> 00:01:30,999
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,026
(Episode 26)

3
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,082
Shall we begin?

4
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,643
In observing the ancestral rites,

5
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,402
we carry on the legacy for generations to come.

6
00:01:48,952 --> 00:01:50,432
By adhering to ancient customs,

7
00:01:50,513 --> 00:01:52,183
we fulfill the covenant.

8
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,719
From this day forth,

9
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,642
husband and wife unite as one,

10
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,122
never to part in life or death.

11
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:10,442
Let the newlyweds perform the ritual.

12
00:02:10,744 --> 00:02:13,842
First bow to the heavens, earth, and the Divine Temple,

13
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:16,870
this is the foundation of all rites.

14
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,230
Bow.

15
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:32,168
Second bow to the parents,

16
00:02:32,274 --> 00:02:34,596
to honor the family's traditions...

17
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:35,802
Hold on.

18
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,162
Aunt,

19
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,400
please take the seat.

20
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,680
I mustn't.

21
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:49,376
I am not the matriarch of Fan family.

22
00:02:49,494 --> 00:02:51,402
According to the rites, I cannot sit there.

23
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:52,809
The rites may not recognize it,

24
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,242
but I do.

25
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:03,237
Come, sit.

26
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,704
Second bow to the parents,

27
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:20,495
to honor the family's traditions

28
00:03:20,631 --> 00:03:23,182
and to unite as one family.

29
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:27,574
Rise.

30
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:33,122
The couple will now bow to each other.

31
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,989
Bow.

32
00:04:01,913 --> 00:04:03,423
Rise.

33
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,280
With this exchange of bows between husband and wife,

34
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:16,198
the covenant is sealed.

35
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:36,242
Look at that, that's a lot of people.

36
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:38,042
It's like a temple fair.

37
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:46,245
By decree of His Majesty,

38
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,429
the union of Fan and Lin is blessed,

39
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:50,264
timed perfectly by fate.

40
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,319
Here is a handwritten scroll

41
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,910
to commemorate this occasion,

42
00:04:55,148 --> 00:04:57,433
as decreed.

43
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:05,762
(Eternal Union)

44
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:39,760
(Fan Residence)

45
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:51,533
Do you need me to walk you back to your residence?

46
00:05:52,204 --> 00:05:53,282
It's fine.

47
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:55,562
Thanks anyway.

48
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:57,362
For what?

49
00:05:57,678 --> 00:06:00,242
For not telling her about Lin Gong.

50
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,069
I promised you I wouldn't ruin the wedding.

51
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,590
A promise is a promise.

52
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,842
Anyway, thank you.

53
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,122
It hasn't been easy for Wan Er

54
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,900
to get to this day.

55
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:15,507
Wan Er is also my sister.

56
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,442
I'll be going then.

57
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:22,242
Be careful on your way.

58
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,669
Did you forget something?

59
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:46,722
You're alone. I'd better walk you back.

60
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,880
All right then.

61
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,482
I'll count on you

62
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,199
to keep my money and my life safe.

63
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:15,162
Wan Er.

64
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,640
You, come out.

65
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:22,362
Get out from under the bed.

66
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:23,728
I heard you.

67
00:07:30,113 --> 00:07:31,166
Xian.

68
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:33,697
Si Zhe?

69
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,202
Wan Er.

70
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,440
Congratulations.

71
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,640
I got it.

72
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,200
May you be blessed with a child soon.

73
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,790
These are feudalistic practices.

74
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,479
I'm going to teach him a lesson later.

75
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:57,170
I've been thinking only

76
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:00,202
about one thing this whole day.

77
00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:01,545
What is it?

78
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:02,939
I want to take a look at you.

79
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,629
I haven't seen you today.

80
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:12,814
Who is it?

81
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,880
It's you, Da Bao.

82
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,629
Da Bao, go back to your room.

83
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,991
Xian, I'm not like that little one.

84
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,400
I'll go back to my room after I watch you and Wan Er kiss.

85
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,719
Be a good boy, Da Bao.

86
00:08:29,838 --> 00:08:31,118
Return to your room.

87
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,350
Careful that someone might steal your red fruits.

88
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,562
Oh, yes. Father gave me those red fruits.

89
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,109
Little One!

90
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,760
Little One!

91
00:08:57,356 --> 00:08:58,648
Why does things keep coming

92
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:01,362
one after another this evening?

93
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:04,209
What?

94
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,082
Nothing.

95
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:11,536
Wan Er, I'm sorry.

96
00:09:11,623 --> 00:09:13,463
I have to go out for a bit. I'll be back soon,

97
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,000
and then I'll explain everything.

98
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:28,199
Mr. Wu Zhu, it's been so long. Where have you been?

99
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,762
I had a fight with Ku He.

100
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,959
I know. For me.

101
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,389
Besides the fight, I also asked him about my past.

102
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,704
I've forgotten a lot. I want to remember.

103
00:09:39,785 --> 00:09:40,799
What did Ku He say?

104
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,159
He didn't want to talk

105
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,039
about Young Lady Qing Mei.

106
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,600
My mother came from the Divine Temple.

107
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,959
The Divine Temple?

108
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:52,142
Ku He and the others saw my mother come out

109
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,806
of the Divine Temple with their own eyes when they traveled north.

110
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,389
Mr. Wu Zhu, could you also be from the Divine Temple?

111
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,440
The Divine Temple...

112
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,919
I can't remember.

113
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,199
It's all right. I'll accompany you north.

114
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,336
We'll look for it together.

115
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,520
Once we find the Divine Temple, maybe you'll remember.

116
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,199
- You can't go. - Why?

117
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,319
You're married now.

118
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,909
That's not a problem.

119
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,231
I can bring Wan Er along.

120
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,431
Mr. Wu Zhu, when we were bowing to our elders just now, I was thinking,

121
00:10:23,804 --> 00:10:26,257
if you were here, Wan Er and I would have bowed to you together.

122
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:29,996
Why don't you ask me where I went after my fight with Ku He?

123
00:10:30,104 --> 00:10:32,304
- Where did you go? - I went south.

124
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,280
Is the street cleared?

125
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,640
Yes, sir.

126
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,162
They didn't return to the office

127
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:41,346
just because they wanted to get something to eat.

128
00:10:55,038 --> 00:10:56,162
President.

129
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,688
You two, one leading Third Bureau and the other Sixth Bureau,

130
00:11:04,814 --> 00:11:06,924
are the pillars of the Overwatch Council.

131
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,046
If word of you brawling in the streets in the middle of the night gets out,

132
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,350
won't it be disgraceful?

133
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,799
- It's not that bad. - Who says it's not bad?

134
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:17,359
Even if it's disgraceful, it won't reflect on me.

135
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,759
I always wear a mask.

136
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,189
No one in the capital, inside or outside the Overwatch Council,

137
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,604
knows my name.

138
00:11:23,688 --> 00:11:25,165
Do you hide your identity

139
00:11:25,246 --> 00:11:27,716
just so you can fight freely?

140
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,950
He started it.

141
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,629
I mean, don't you know what day it is today?

142
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,400
It's my apprentice's wedding.

143
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,520
I know.

144
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,109
With your sneaky look,

145
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,880
you looked like you were up to no good.

146
00:11:42,132 --> 00:11:44,202
I had to stop him.

147
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,350
How can you even tell if I look sneaky or not?

148
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,522
Your posture alone is sneaky.

149
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:56,457
Just take off your mask and eat your bun properly.

150
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,620
It's not like I've never seen your face before,

151
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,202
and there's no one on this street.

152
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,230
What are you afraid of?

153
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,839
Just eat your noodles!

154
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,720
Did you go to Fan Xian's residence?

155
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,002
- He stopped me. - Why did you go there?

156
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,882
It's Fan Xian's wedding today.

157
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,190
Mr. Wu Zhu would certainly attend.

158
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,438
My lifelong wish is

159
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,042
to spar with him

160
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,642
and exchange skills.

161
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,950
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

162
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:33,077
A martial artist seeks enlightenment.

163
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,362
Even if I end up dead, I will not regret it.

164
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:38,047
Fei Jie,

165
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,602
when did you return to the capital?

166
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,360
I rushed back all the way.

167
00:12:43,448 --> 00:12:44,802
I just got back.

168
00:12:44,886 --> 00:12:46,197
I haven't even eaten.

169
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,400
On my way south, I kept craving for a meal here.

170
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:51,215
I have to say, nothing beats the food here.

171
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,480
By protocol,

172
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,350
you should have come to see me at the office first.

173
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,679
Yes, President.

174
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,040
But as I said,

175
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,962
it's my apprentice's wedding today.

176
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,360
I had to...

177
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,762
Right?

178
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,882
And I wouldn't disturb him, of course.

179
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,400
Just as I wouldn't disturb him,

180
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:14,519
I wouldn't let anyone else disturb him either.

181
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,760
So you've been keeping an eye on Fan Xian's residence?

182
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:21,641
Yes, it wasn't in vain.

183
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:23,072
I intercepted him.

184
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:25,245
Fei Jie,

185
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,909
you've been chasing the murderer

186
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,280
all the way from the south.

187
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,799
Tell me honestly,

188
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,715
is the murderer Wu Zhu?

189
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,710
I didn't see the murderer's face.

190
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:41,487
And I don't believe

191
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:43,882
Lord Wu would kill indiscriminately.

192
00:13:44,818 --> 00:13:45,818
But...

193
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,190
Considering the skills involved,

194
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,922
if it wasn't Lord Wu,

195
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:54,596
who else could have done it?

196
00:13:56,265 --> 00:14:00,962
And coincidentally, Lord Wu was in Jiangnan when the murders happened.

197
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,029
Why was Wu Zhu in Jiangnan?

198
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,240
I really don't know.

199
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:09,479
Young Lady Qing Mei and I went to Jiangnan together in the past.

200
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:12,362
I wanted to revisit the paths we once walked,

201
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,400
hoping to recover my lost memories.

202
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:15,783
Did you find anything?

203
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:18,202
No.

204
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,869
Many people died in Jiangnan.

205
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,320
I have

206
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,760
heard about that.

207
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,159
I didn't do it.

208
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,600
Then it wasn't you.

209
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,882
Someone's trying to frame you.

210
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,762
Following this line of thought,

211
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,199
first,

212
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,830
think about who would benefit from framing you;

213
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:44,357
second,

214
00:14:44,438 --> 00:14:46,039
who knew about your journey south;

215
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:48,254
- and third... - But it could only be me.

216
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,911
- Why? - I checked the victims' bodies.

217
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:53,675
The assailant's techniques

218
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,120
are those of a grandmaster.

219
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,800
Then one of the four grandmasters

220
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,202
is trying to frame you.

221
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,869
- Is it Si Gu Jian? - The killer didn't use Qi.

222
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,560
They used grandmaster techniques,

223
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:16,713
without using Qi,

224
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:19,067
I'm the only one in the world

225
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,817
who could do this.

226
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,320
But you said

227
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:26,799
you didn't kill anyone.

228
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,159
Yes.

229
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,669
I remember I didn't kill anyone.

230
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:34,802
That's enough then.

231
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,215
If I could lose

232
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:40,011
my memory once,

233
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,909
it could happen again.

234
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,389
I can't trust myself.

235
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,319
Fan Xian.

236
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,839
I'm here.

237
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:55,762
By right, I shouldn't have come and seen you again.

238
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:57,127
That doesn't sound right at all.

239
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,439
I've lost my past,

240
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:59,735
and it's hard to trace it back.

241
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,280
Now I only have one purpose in this world,

242
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,600
and that is to protect you.

243
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,322
If I lose control and harm you,

244
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,830
I will leave immediately

245
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:11,230
and never appear by your side again.

246
00:16:13,684 --> 00:16:15,282
Mr. Wu Zhu, you can't leave me.

247
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:18,322
Look closely.

248
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:19,693
Look at what?

249
00:16:19,774 --> 00:16:21,054
I can't see.

250
00:16:21,678 --> 00:16:23,462
Is there blood on this?

251
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,680
- No, there isn't. - If my memory is distorted

252
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,039
and I forget the past,

253
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:31,962
reality should leave traces.

254
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,670
I've looked very carefully.

255
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:35,523
It's clean,

256
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,001
not a single trace of blood.

257
00:16:37,132 --> 00:16:39,950
I haven't let it touch water this entire journey.

258
00:16:42,488 --> 00:16:43,888
That means it wasn't you.

259
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,710
Memory is no longer reliable,

260
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,162
reality is no longer trustworthy.

261
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,350
I can't even trust myself.

262
00:16:52,974 --> 00:16:54,605
I'm here now

263
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,830
because I trust you.

264
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,240
Mr. Wu Zhu,

265
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,870
you can always trust me.

266
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,680
All right.

267
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,162
I should go.

268
00:17:34,448 --> 00:17:35,642
Where are you going?

269
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:37,127
Don't disappear on me again.

270
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:38,820
I'll stay in the capital for now.

271
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:40,253
It's a promise then.

272
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,560
You're married now.

273
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:46,723
From now on, you have your own family.

274
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:49,990
Do you still need me?

275
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:51,351
I'll always need you.

276
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,040
There's no such thing as "always."

277
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,202
Yes,

278
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,359
there's no "always,"

279
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,682
but you can't be absent

280
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,599
from my life.

281
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,640
After the wedding,

282
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:15,962
take the chest Young Lady left for you

283
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,600
and stay at Mount Cang for a while.

284
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,322
Mount Cang?

285
00:18:37,503 --> 00:18:38,946
Who is that man?

286
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,150
Mr. Wu Zhu, my elder.

287
00:18:43,612 --> 00:18:45,322
Why didn't he come in and sit?

288
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,840
That's just how he is.

289
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,720
Why did you take it off yourself?

290
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,719
I got startled just now.

291
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:55,761
I was worried that something might happen to you.

292
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,559
I'm sorry.

293
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,800
Our wedding day

294
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:02,722
turned out quite chaotic.

295
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,920
- Let's start over. - This is good enough.

296
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,927
Tonight must be perfect for you.

297
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,440
Trust me.

298
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,230
I grew up in the palace.

299
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,269
My parents couldn't visit me often.

300
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:33,177
Every night,

301
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,989
I would stay alone in a very large room.

302
00:19:38,248 --> 00:19:39,918
Since then,

303
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,565
I've especially liked looking at the stars.

304
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,030
Because besides the stars,

305
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,789
there was nothing else to see.

306
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:07,762
During the ceremony just now,

307
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:09,802
I felt like something was missing.

308
00:20:09,984 --> 00:20:11,362
It wasn't perfect.

309
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:13,193
Why?

310
00:20:14,572 --> 00:20:16,600
There was only my father and Aunt Liu in the hall.

311
00:20:16,711 --> 00:20:18,380
Your exclusive witness wasn't there.

312
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,402
My parents couldn't come.

313
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:23,744
It's all right.

314
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:25,442
But the stars are always there.

315
00:20:29,397 --> 00:20:30,677
I remember

316
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,280
everything you said.

317
00:20:34,206 --> 00:20:35,756
The starry sky you gave me,

318
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,362
it's always there.

319
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,110
It has witnessed your loneliness.

320
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,720
It should also

321
00:20:53,856 --> 00:20:55,207
witness your happiness.

322
00:20:56,574 --> 00:20:57,854
From now on,

323
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,749
you will never be alone again.

324
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:15,039
Rings?

325
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,311
What are these for?

326
00:21:17,423 --> 00:21:18,577
I made them myself.

327
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:20,882
Newlyweds use these as a token of their commitment

328
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:22,878
to spend the rest of their lives together.

329
00:21:29,046 --> 00:21:30,676
Where does this belief come from?

330
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,390
The world in my memory.

331
00:21:35,786 --> 00:21:37,066
I'll tell you

332
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,842
about all those memories someday, all right?

333
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,999
Here, it's your turn to put it on me.

334
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,750
Yes, on the ring finger.

335
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,110
Our pact is sealed.

336
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,602
With the stars as our witness,

337
00:22:03,077 --> 00:22:04,357
from now on,

338
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,593
we'll never be alone again.

339
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:11,811
I like this pact.

340
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,230
Did you grow up with Mr. Wu Zhu?

341
00:22:36,374 --> 00:22:37,725
From Danzhou to the capital.

342
00:22:38,183 --> 00:22:39,933
Then there must be many stories.

343
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,421
I'll take my time and tell you the story of Mr. Wu Zhu.

344
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,119
But today is not the time for stories.

345
00:22:44,191 --> 00:22:45,471
What should we do then?

346
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,752
Good question.

347
00:23:19,922 --> 00:23:25,682
(Fan Residence)

348
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:27,717
My Lord, you're up.

349
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:28,959
Come.

350
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,549
My Lady, this way.

351
00:23:33,338 --> 00:23:35,319
- What are you doing? - Have a seat, My Lord.

352
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,351
- Please have a seat, My Lady. - What's going on?

353
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,655
Please sit.

354
00:23:41,073 --> 00:23:42,783
Come on out, guys.

355
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:52,544
What's going on in the First Bureau?

356
00:23:52,568 --> 00:23:53,768
Why are you all here?

357
00:23:54,056 --> 00:23:56,776
My Lord, it's your wedding day,

358
00:23:56,952 --> 00:23:58,674
we had to come pay our respects.

359
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,150
My Lady, I am Wang Qi Nian,

360
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,202
here to greet you.

361
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:06,865
I am Deng Zi Yue, and I, along with my colleagues,

362
00:24:06,954 --> 00:24:08,882
have come to greet you, My Lady.

363
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,039
All right now.

364
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:12,079
We're all peers, there's no need for formalities.

365
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,842
Why do you all look so tired?

366
00:24:21,017 --> 00:24:22,322
What were you doing last night?

367
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,362
My Lord, you don't know this,

368
00:24:24,489 --> 00:24:27,089
it was chaotic outside your residence last night.

369
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,950
So, I called in all the brothers from the First Bureau

370
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:31,322
to maintain order.

371
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,602
Everyone kept watch all night.

372
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,040
Nonsense!

373
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,992
The Overwatch Council isn't my private property.

374
00:24:37,016 --> 00:24:39,962
Qi Nian, I'm going to cut half a month of your pay...

375
00:24:42,645 --> 00:24:44,476
And reward it to the guys.

376
00:24:44,848 --> 00:24:46,688
Yes!

377
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,239
- No, My Lord! Don't do this! - Thank you, My Lord.

378
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:51,101
- Thank you, Lord Wang. - Don't thank me!

379
00:24:51,182 --> 00:24:55,560
My Lord, the guy came to maintain order voluntarily.

380
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,759
They don't want any reward.

381
00:24:57,912 --> 00:25:01,032
We want Lord Wang's reward!

382
00:25:01,113 --> 00:25:03,222
Rewards should be given,

383
00:25:04,489 --> 00:25:07,602
but it shouldn't come from Mr. Wang,

384
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,802
it should come from us.

385
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,959
- That's not necessary. - Thank you, My Lady.

386
00:25:14,065 --> 00:25:15,305
You all worked hard.

387
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:16,696
You deserve it.

388
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,511
Can we say no now?

389
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:26,319
My husband often tells me

390
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,951
that if he was alone,

391
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,759
he would not have been able to gain a foothold in the capital,

392
00:25:29,783 --> 00:25:31,494
even if he had superhuman power,

393
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:34,362
He owes his success to all of you.

394
00:25:34,552 --> 00:25:38,223
I'd like to thank you all for my husband.

395
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,430
Let's bow to Her Ladyship!

396
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,840
Mr. Wang.

397
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,320
Please, My Lady,

398
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,759
you can just call me by my name.

399
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,322
Call me Wang Qi Nian.

400
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:52,708
Or if it pleases you,

401
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:55,002
you can call me Nian.

402
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,263
Mr. Wang, my husband often talks about you.

403
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:03,733
He says you know when to advance and when to retreat, and is adaptable.

404
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:07,589
He's benefited a lot from your help in the capital.

405
00:26:09,423 --> 00:26:11,602
His Lordship is being modest.

406
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,762
What truly moves him isn't just that.

407
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,760
He says

408
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,360
due to his weird character

409
00:26:19,466 --> 00:26:20,746
and stubborn nature,

410
00:26:20,951 --> 00:26:23,501
he has few friends in the capital,

411
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,110
but Wang Qi Nian is one of them.

412
00:26:31,327 --> 00:26:33,958
You are not just a follower,

413
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:36,602
nor simply a subordinate,

414
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,000
but

415
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,160
a true friend

416
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,559
and confidant.

417
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,920
Mr. Wang,

418
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:51,456
thank you

419
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:53,670
for always being by my husband's side.

420
00:26:55,571 --> 00:26:58,922
My Lady, allow me to kowtow to you.

421
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,202
How's that? My wife is good with words, isn't she?

422
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,630
She's better than my wife.

423
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,080
You're a lucky man, My Lord.

424
00:27:11,183 --> 00:27:13,372
You're a lucky man, My Lord!

425
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,544
There's still much work to be done in the First Bureau,

426
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:16,848
you all should get back to it.

427
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,319
My Lord,

428
00:27:19,925 --> 00:27:21,022
there's no need to hold back.

429
00:27:21,046 --> 00:27:23,069
We've heard about the Imperial Treasury's problem.

430
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:24,591
Give us your orders.

431
00:27:24,765 --> 00:27:26,045
Orders for what?

432
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,640
House raids!

433
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,320
There are corrupt officials in the capital with sticky fingers.

434
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,622
Just tell us whose property to seize, and we'll do it. We need to prepare.

435
00:27:34,646 --> 00:27:35,886
Nonsense!

436
00:27:35,984 --> 00:27:37,681
You will stick to your official duties in the bureau.

437
00:27:37,705 --> 00:27:39,735
I'll take care of my own problem.

438
00:27:45,652 --> 00:27:47,283
No acting on your own initiative.

439
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,069
But My Lord, I really...

440
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,802
Let me deal with them.

441
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,479
What a mess. Go, get back to work.

442
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,338
- We will take our leave, My Lady. - This is ridiculous.

443
00:27:58,362 --> 00:28:00,002
All right. Get out of here, guys.

444
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:03,282
- I won't take matters into my own hands then, My Lord. - All right.

445
00:28:03,405 --> 00:28:04,796
- Get out. - Don't cause any trouble.

446
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,419
All right, we won't.

447
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,002
Qi Nian, take a look at this.

448
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,190
It's the gift from President Chen.

449
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,309
"Qingyu Hall?"

450
00:28:16,272 --> 00:28:19,642
That's the business founded by Ye Qing Mei back then.

451
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:22,387
At that time, it was amassing wealth from all corners.

452
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,079
I've heard

453
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:27,989
that her business became the foundation of the Imperial Treasury.

454
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:30,216
It's true her business was taken over by the royal family,

455
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,439
but those shopkeepers who started this business

456
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,319
with Ye Qing Mei are still in the capital.

457
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,070
Qingyu Hall is now managed by them.

458
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:41,117
Qingyu Hall is a store?

459
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,119
They don't open stores themselves.

460
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,759
They are paid and hired by shop owners

461
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,360
to be the shopkeepers of establishments.

462
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:51,615
Professional managers.

463
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,030
Not bad.

464
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,442
- What did you say? - Never mind.

465
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,029
But after Ye Qing Mei's death,

466
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,999
what connection do these shopkeepers have

467
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,910
with the Imperial Treasury?

468
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:07,439
This is the puzzle President Chen left us.

469
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,911
We'll have to go take a look.

470
00:29:09,683 --> 00:29:13,002
(Qingyu Hall)

471
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:25,602
You've even personally come to receive us.

472
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:29,642
This is the chief shopkeeper of Qingyu Hall.

473
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,722
And this is Lord Fan Xian, the Chief Inspector of the Overwatch Council.

474
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,870
Please come in.

475
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:48,639
This way, please, gentlemen.

476
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,029
Lord Fan.

477
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,670
Lord Fan.

478
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,351
Lord Fan.

479
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,870
- Lord Fan. - My Lord, they are Qingyu Hall's shopkeepers.

480
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:14,309
They are happy to see you.

481
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,390
Why are they happy to see His Lordship?

482
00:30:18,921 --> 00:30:20,201
This way, please.

483
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,150
Are you having a funeral here?

484
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,762
What is the meaning of this?

485
00:31:00,327 --> 00:31:01,402
My Lord,

486
00:31:01,845 --> 00:31:03,842
this doesn't feel right.

487
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,527
(Ye Qing Mei)

488
00:31:21,608 --> 00:31:23,277
"Ye Qing Mei."

489
00:31:44,232 --> 00:31:45,512
Young Lady,

490
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,002
Young Master Fan is back.

491
00:31:49,318 --> 00:31:53,348
Young Lady, Young Master Fan is back!

492
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:59,839
Young Master Fan is back!

493
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,880
Young Lady, Young Master Fan is back!

494
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,240
All right now.

495
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,282
I'll have a chat with Young Master Fan here.

496
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:17,589
You all are startling him by staying here.

497
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,962
We will take our leave then.

498
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,639
Goodbye.

499
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:30,482
Chief Shopkeeper, please have a seat as well.

500
00:32:30,563 --> 00:32:31,922
Yes, here.

501
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,120
As Young Lady's subordinate,

502
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:36,759
you are our young master.

503
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:37,840
With you here,

504
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,670
how can I have the right to sit?

505
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:45,322
Ye Qing Mei is my mother.

506
00:32:46,845 --> 00:32:50,269
Ye Qing Mei is your mother?

507
00:32:52,058 --> 00:32:54,349
Can this man be trusted?

508
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,682
Come on, Chief Shopkeeper,

509
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:01,877
we've known each other for years, and we've always...

510
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:04,522
I only trust Young Master.

511
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,002
He is trustworthy.

512
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,079
Young Master,

513
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,402
we knew you had come to the capital

514
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,002
as soon as you arrived.

515
00:33:18,227 --> 00:33:20,973
We even secretly went to the streets to have a look at you.

516
00:33:21,344 --> 00:33:24,054
You knew all along that I am her son?

517
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,190
Young Lady told me herself.

518
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,640
How? Through a dream?

519
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,910
She told me before she passed away.

520
00:33:35,585 --> 00:33:36,865
She was the one

521
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,480
who named you.

522
00:33:38,946 --> 00:33:40,128
My name?

523
00:33:40,288 --> 00:33:41,290
Fan Xian?

524
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,720
That's right.

525
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,362
That doesn't make sense.

526
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,936
I wasn't even born yet. How did she know my surname would be Fan?

527
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,160
Hang on, My Lord,

528
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,600
whether you were born or not,

529
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,880
your father's surname is Fan.

530
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,870
So naturally, your surname would be Fan.

531
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:56,840
Before Young Lady died, she mentioned

532
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,470
that she might not have much time left.

533
00:33:59,826 --> 00:34:01,457
If she survived,

534
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,922
your surname could be different.

535
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:06,737
If she passed away,

536
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,510
you would definitely be called Fan Xian.

537
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:13,680
If she passed away,

538
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:16,300
I would definitely be called Fan Xian.

539
00:34:17,074 --> 00:34:19,722
This still doesn't make sense.

540
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:21,441
How did she die?

541
00:34:21,522 --> 00:34:23,912
Not long after she said these things,

542
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,840
the business was handed over to the royal family.

543
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,990
After that, I never saw her again.

544
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:33,077
I'm not sure exactly

545
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:35,682
how she passed away.

546
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,135
I've been in the capital for so long,

547
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,602
you never thought to come see me?

548
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,269
Young Master, you might not know,

549
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,202
but we are being watched.

550
00:34:50,576 --> 00:34:52,922
His Majesty personally decreed

551
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:54,762
that no one from the Ye family

552
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,876
should leave the capital.

553
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:01,002
The royal family is wary.

554
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,720
Wary of you?

555
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,280
Wary of Young Lady.

556
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,160
Even though she has been gone for so many years,

557
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,162
they are still terrified.

558
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:13,222
Even we, who used to help her with business,

559
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,042
are being watched secretly.

560
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,789
We didn't dare come to you,

561
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,845
for fear of putting you in trouble.

562
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,439
However,

563
00:35:21,734 --> 00:35:24,645
we are well aware of all the things you've done

564
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,429
since you arrived in the capital.

565
00:35:28,197 --> 00:35:30,507
Had you worked closely with her back then?

566
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:35,280
She trusted me to manage the businesses in the capital.

567
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,482
What kind of person was she?

568
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,763
There has never been anyone

569
00:35:51,737 --> 00:35:55,007
as brilliant as her in this world.

570
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,270
She was so

571
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:01,919
perfect.

572
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,389
Besides business,

573
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,510
she was knowledgeable in astronomy and geography.

574
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:12,349
She knew why the sea had tides

575
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:16,021
and why the moon waxes and wanes.

576
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,711
She also wrote poetry.

577
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:23,590
That poem you wrote,

578
00:36:23,729 --> 00:36:26,879
"Wandering far from home in sorrow during autumn,"

579
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:28,533
was excellent.

580
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,240
Her poems were different

581
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:33,319
from the usual.

582
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,110
To be honest, she once wrote a poem for me.

583
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
Let's hear it.

584
00:36:41,776 --> 00:36:43,056
Eyes

585
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:46,882
wide like copper bells,

586
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:51,269
shooting lightning-like sharpness.

587
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,285
Ears standing like antennas...

588
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,110
Catching every suspicious sound.

589
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,909
Young Master,

590
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,842
are you puzzled?

591
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,202
She explained the word "antenna" to me.

592
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,710
Thunder from the nine heavens descends to the mortal world,

593
00:37:19,143 --> 00:37:20,664
silver-white and vertical,

594
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,159
resembling a celestial line,

595
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:25,469
meaning keen ears and eyes,

596
00:37:25,867 --> 00:37:27,147
seeing through everything.

597
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:31,469
So, that's how she explained it?

598
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,122
When the business was first established,

599
00:37:37,448 --> 00:37:39,442
I traveled the world with her.

600
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,360
We once caught some petty thieves.

601
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:42,948
She gifted me the poem

602
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,949
because of that.

603
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:47,882
It is the best gift

604
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,190
I've ever received.

605
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,562
This poem is indeed unique.

606
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:01,990
I think I know what kind of person she was now.

607
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,280
Chief Shopkeeper,

608
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:09,200
this poem not only has lyrics, but also a tune.

609
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,599
I'll teach it to you some day.

610
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,740
All right.

611
00:38:13,216 --> 00:38:15,242
As for the deficit in the Imperial Treasury,

612
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,789
we have been preparing.

613
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:20,320
Do you have that much money?

614
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,680
We don't,

615
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,599
but the shops in the capital do.

616
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:24,962
Which shops?

617
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:27,639
No single shop has that much money.

618
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,600
But if we combine all the shops in the capital,

619
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:34,126
it would be enough to fill the hole.

620
00:38:34,207 --> 00:38:35,487
All the shops?

621
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,869
We have been the shopkeepers in the various shops in the capital,

622
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,920
working diligently, never embezzling.

623
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,720
Over the years, we have built a good reputation.

624
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,429
Nowadays, all reputable shops in the capital

625
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:53,832
employ shopkeepers from Qingyu Hall.

626
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,720
Let's put it this way,

627
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,006
if those shops have any unspeakable secrets,

628
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:04,402
we know them better than they do.

629
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,429
So, you have dirt on them?

630
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,720
Young Master,

631
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,389
give us ten days.

632
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,840
Together,

633
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,520
we will pool our resources and accumulate enough to fill the gap.

634
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,840
I will ensure they gather the 20 million taels,

635
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,070
as a wedding gift for you.

636
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,321
My Lord, this is feasible.

637
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:37,839
Young Master, don't worry.

638
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,240
Leave the money collection to us.

639
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,896
It won't affect your reputation as an official.

640
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,439
How will you handle the aftermath

641
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:43,816
of extorting money from the shops?

642
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,550
It's not a problem. At worst, no one will hire us anymore.

643
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:48,540
Merchants value profit above all.

644
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,920
If things go wrong, they might hire assassins.

645
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,439
You could be in danger.

646
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:55,670
It's all right, we have lived to this age,

647
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:57,829
- we are content. - No way.

648
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,579
If it were my mother, would she do this?

649
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:03,599
When you talked about my mother's brilliance just now,

650
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,777
you sounded so proud of her.

651
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:07,175
I think if it were her, she wouldn't choose to do it this way.

652
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:09,479
Young Master, the situation is critical.

653
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:11,949
Had my mother ever been in critical situations?

654
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,749
Did she compromise back then?

655
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,200
I will deal with the Imperial Treasury's deficits myself.

656
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,720
Young Master, gathering 20 million taels

657
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,190
is beyond one person's ability.

658
00:40:23,312 --> 00:40:25,831
No matter how difficult, I have to try.

659
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:28,458
I cannot embarrass my mother.

660
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,349
But I do need your help.

661
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:42,292
List all the shop owners in the capital and give me a name list.

662
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,720
Yes, Young Master.

663
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:46,446
Everyone,

664
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:48,999
I appreciate your goodwill.

665
00:40:49,669 --> 00:40:51,899
Young Master, you are too kind.

666
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,789
Chief Shopkeeper, please stay.

667
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,479
My Lord,

668
00:40:57,642 --> 00:41:00,079
I think Chief Shopkeeper's plan

669
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:01,829
is workable.

670
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,879
If the merchants tries to kill them,

671
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:06,522
we can have our colleagues from the First Bureau protect them.

672
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:09,202
Pushing people into the abyss first

673
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:11,162
and then pulling them up,

674
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,680
it changes the nature of things.

675
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,311
Young Master really is a kind child.

676
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,270
I thought

677
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,122
that with Young Lady gone,

678
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,349
that light had gone out.

679
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,160
But it turns out,

680
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,711
the light can be passed on.

681
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,760
Why are you standing there?

682
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,749
Make yourself at home. Sit.

683
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,280
Aunt Yun Rui,

684
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,920
this is my home.

685
00:42:19,054 --> 00:42:21,564
Make yourself comfortable then. Sit wherever you want.

686
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,042
What are you doing?

687
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,949
Since I have some spare time,

688
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:46,680
I thought I'd make a new shade of rouge.

689
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,439
Aren't these flowers you brought meant for Fan Xian?

690
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:50,799
He didn't want them.

691
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:53,803
So, I'll give them to you instead.

692
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,639
How generous of you.

693
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:57,030
I'm here to thank you.

694
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:59,030
For what?
