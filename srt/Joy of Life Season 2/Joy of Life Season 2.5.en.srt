00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:31,008
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:34,002
(Episode 5)

3
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,799
Then let's shut down the place for now.

4
00:01:38,174 --> 00:01:39,324
You will pacify them.

5
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:41,944
When I return to the capital officially, I'll release them.

6
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,118
All right.

7
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,762
Oh, and there's a girl surnamed Jin in the establishment.

8
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:48,126
Take special care of her and return her indenture to her.

9
00:01:50,775 --> 00:01:52,695
How are you going to answer to my sister-in-law?

10
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,282
You're shutting down

11
00:01:54,374 --> 00:01:56,402
such a lucrative business just like this?

12
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,711
- I dare not continue. - There are actually things you dare not do?

13
00:01:59,735 --> 00:02:00,885
Some lines I dare not cross.

14
00:02:01,196 --> 00:02:02,237
Fine, then.

15
00:02:02,318 --> 00:02:03,562
If so, I won't make you stay.

16
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:05,775
You should return to the convoy as soon as possible.

17
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,122
Don't delay their return to the capital.

18
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:09,503
I'll head back right now.

19
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:12,661
Your Highness, as for Mrs. Teng and her son,

20
00:02:12,742 --> 00:02:14,181
please send your men to look after them for now.

21
00:02:14,205 --> 00:02:15,605
You don't need to worry about that.

22
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:18,802
What about Cheng Ze?

23
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:21,141
- Do you intend to... - I'll get to the bottom of it.

24
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,510
I'm glad to hear that.

25
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,082
We'll receive news from Shijia Town soon.

26
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,522
Let's cut our chatter.

27
00:02:27,645 --> 00:02:29,082
Let's do something huge

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,040
once you return to the capital officially.

29
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,189
Your Highness, take care.

30
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,950
Xian,

31
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,722
I have to tell you this.

32
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:50,352
The crown prince and Prince Cheng Ze can compete all they like.

33
00:02:50,464 --> 00:02:51,614
We shouldn't interfere.

34
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:53,402
It can cause us to be executed.

35
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:55,452
Even so, you won't be the one getting executed.

36
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,941
It's not okay no matter who is getting executed.

37
00:02:57,965 --> 00:02:59,905
When news of your death got to the capital,

38
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,519
the entire capital went bonkers.

39
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,377
Do you know how many people sent gifts to our family?

40
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:04,961
You should stop causing trouble for us.

41
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,720
Return all those gifts to them once I'm officially revived.

42
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,082
They don't want that.

43
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,639
Why not?

44
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:11,882
My Lord, think about it.

45
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:13,442
If you're not dead,

46
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:15,881
who dares to take their gifts back?

47
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,320
If you're alive,

48
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:20,202
the sensible ones will send you another batch of gifts.

49
00:03:20,355 --> 00:03:21,975
You're not cut out to be an official.

50
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,639
This is stupid.

51
00:03:25,735 --> 00:03:27,076
I beg to differ.

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,202
This is the officialdom in the capital.

53
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,290
Relationships and wisdom are vital.

54
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,242
Enough. Seal off the building.

55
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,562
I've told you what I need to tell you. Let's go.

56
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:39,482
Xian, wait!

57
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,962
You're not done yet!

58
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:43,322
There's this guy over here. What should we do with him?

59
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,481
- You can act accordingly. - Me?

60
00:03:45,584 --> 00:03:47,363
You were the one who gave him a karate chop.

61
00:03:47,976 --> 00:03:48,997
Isn't it obvious?

62
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:51,678
Do you want him to witness the ugly quarrel between his brothers?

63
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,842
You do act like an elder brother now.

64
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,950
You're my elder brother. You need to side with me.

65
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,187
What should I do?

66
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,242
Stay at home after this.

67
00:04:05,606 --> 00:04:07,562
Do not leave the house before my return.

68
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:10,402
- All right. - Don't tell anyone about this incident.

69
00:04:10,638 --> 00:04:11,788
Understood.

70
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:13,962
Don't worry. Everything'll be fine.

71
00:04:14,143 --> 00:04:16,223
- Wait for my return. - I'll wait for your return.

72
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,722
Take care, Young Master.

73
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,033
It's tough to make money nowadays.

74
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,962
Wasn't I supposed to be lying there?

75
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,042
Si Zhe?

76
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,669
Si Zhe?

77
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,842
Why were you asleep?

78
00:05:26,222 --> 00:05:28,522
My body might be still growing. That's why I was sleepy.

79
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:32,452
That's not right.

80
00:05:33,302 --> 00:05:35,885
Why do I remember that someone

81
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:38,602
struck my neck from somewhere?

82
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,842
After that, I was lying here.

83
00:05:42,982 --> 00:05:44,132
That's impossible!

84
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:46,519
Did you say someone gave you a karate chop over there

85
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,322
and you fell unconscious?

86
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:51,317
I think so.

87
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:52,686
That's impossible.

88
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:54,456
Listen. I don't know what's wrong with you today.

89
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,840
When you first came, you went to the bed.

90
00:05:56,936 --> 00:05:59,536
You said you were exhausted and that you wanted to take a nap.

91
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,252
I think you had a dream just now.

92
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:02,426
I had a dream, huh?

93
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:07,107
Si Zhe, what happened to your eye?

94
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,630
A donkey kicked me.

95
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,073
Donkey? You actually have a donkey?

96
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:11,922
No. I dreamt about it.

97
00:06:12,493 --> 00:06:15,233
I dreamt that a donkey kicked me in the eye.

98
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,922
Your dream is pretty lively, huh?

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,442
Yeah. There were even two dogs fighting in my dream.

100
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,522
Okay, then. Let's continue.

101
00:06:23,761 --> 00:06:24,911
Let's enjoy some songs.

102
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,122
Cousin, listen to me.

103
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:28,522
Let's stop for today.

104
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,562
- You should head back and rest. - But why?

105
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:33,482
Our mental state has been quite poor lately, right?

106
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,389
We had many dreams.

107
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,638
I dreamt that a donkey kicked me in the eye.

108
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,223
You dreamt that Fan Xian knocked you out, right?

109
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:39,397
Fan Xian?

110
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:42,402
A crook. You dreamt that a crook knocked you out, right?

111
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:43,814
I think we should rest for today.

112
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:51,437
My Lord.

113
00:06:51,518 --> 00:06:52,842
I can't find them.

114
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:54,673
But...

115
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,082
Where exactly did they go?

116
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:57,923
Say, where could they go

117
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,534
if Prince Cheng Ze didn't capture them?

118
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:01,238
How are your relationships in the capital?

119
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,600
Although I've been away for six months,

120
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,998
at most, I might've gotten some debts.

121
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:08,122
My family members should've been fine.

122
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:11,265
My Lord, you should return to the convoy first.

123
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:13,522
I'm sorry that I can't join you.

124
00:07:13,655 --> 00:07:15,997
- I have to find them. - I'll join you.

125
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:18,375
My Lord, you should leave. If not, you won't make it in time.

126
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,399
It's fine. Your family members are more important.

127
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:24,402
Dear?

128
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,082
You were inside the house?

129
00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:29,325
Where's Ba Ba?

130
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,122
Why are you avoiding me?

131
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,162
I'm trying to wipe your sweat away.

132
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,922
Look at how anxious you are.

133
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,349
We were inside the house.

134
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:39,642
I was coaxing her to sleep.

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,922
If so, how come I didn't see you two?

136
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:45,562
How did you two vanish out of the blue?

137
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,762
We were taken somewhere.

138
00:07:47,896 --> 00:07:49,202
What does that mean?

139
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:51,242
- For our safety. - Safety?

140
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:55,580
- Who did it? - Who else?

141
00:08:03,104 --> 00:08:04,442
Is it Chen Ping Ping?

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,150
That's right.

143
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,682
President Chen told me to relay a message to you.

144
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,869
Teng Zi Jing's wife and son have been released.

145
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:13,322
President Chen will help them to settle down in Danzhou.

146
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:14,636
He asked you

147
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,767
if you wanted to see them before their departure.

148
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,480
No need for that.

149
00:08:19,575 --> 00:08:21,918
The further I stay away from them, the safer they are.

150
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,927
He suggested you return to the convoy as soon as possible.

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,362
What exactly is he up to?

152
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,685
President Chen said

153
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,202
that you might be wary of him

154
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,002
after your trip to Northern Qi.

155
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,895
He said he didn't need to explain himself.

156
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,959
Sometimes, words are pointless.

157
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,082
You can only tell

158
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:42,882
how he treated you by his actions

159
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:45,562
instead of his words.

160
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:51,602
Can you figure him out, then?

161
00:08:52,112 --> 00:08:54,722
No one in the world can figure President Chen out.

162
00:08:57,814 --> 00:09:00,341
Dear, please take care of Ba Ba.

163
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,449
Lord Fan and I have to return to the convoy.

164
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:08,388
Lord Fan, where are you right now?

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,362
We've almost arrived at the capital.

166
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,282
I won't be able to keep the secret if you don't come back soon.

167
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,322
Did you see that?

168
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:43,762
That person speaks to Fan Xian's ashes every day.

169
00:09:44,477 --> 00:09:46,242
Although I can't hear him,

170
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,962
his loyalty

171
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,842
is truly impressive.

172
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,820
Where exactly are you?

173
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:54,602
You're making me anxious here.

174
00:10:03,957 --> 00:10:05,107
All right.

175
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,824
They'll arrive at the capital soon.

176
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:10,322
Seems like Fan Xian's death is confirmed.

177
00:10:12,387 --> 00:10:14,802
Let's go. Let's report this to His Highness.

178
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:49,336
He didn't leave his room for several days?

179
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,562
Yes. I had to deliver his meals to him.

180
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,322
Is he sick?

181
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:54,798
He still has a huge appetite.

182
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:58,282
We even prepared some delicious yogurt with fruits for him.

183
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,442
It didn't seem like he was sick.

184
00:11:00,623 --> 00:11:02,362
Is there anyone else in his room?

185
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:04,003
No.

186
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,522
That's hard to say.

187
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,242
At his age,

188
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,962
he's capable of anything.

189
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,042
Give it to me. You may leave.

190
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,364
Yes, Madam.

191
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,091
Mother, why don't you come inside?

192
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,482
I'm here to deliver yogurt to you.

193
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,042
You can check under the bed as well.

194
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:53,238
There's a cabinet over there.

195
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:08,696
- There's no one here, right? - If so, why didn't you leave your room?

196
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,965
You don't do this usually.

197
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:11,602
He didn't allow me to go out.

198
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,230
Who?

199
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,882
No one. It's me. I don't want to go outside.

200
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:18,196
But why?

201
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
Did you get yourself in trouble?

202
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:23,482
Stop asking. Anyway, I just can't leave the room.

203
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,922
Don't tell me you got involved with a lady?

204
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,839
What lady? Where can I find one?

205
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:32,682
That's not it. Don't make wild guesses.

206
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,602
If so, how long will you stay here?

207
00:12:38,477 --> 00:12:39,922
I don't know either.

208
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,682
I think I can leave after a few more days.

209
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:45,842
Are you waiting for someone?

210
00:12:46,602 --> 00:12:48,842
That's not it. Stop asking me.

211
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:50,282
You should stop.

212
00:12:50,424 --> 00:12:51,682
Is it a lady?

213
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,259
If only he was a lady.

214
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,525
It's a guy.

215
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,789
Mother,

216
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:04,282
it's been a few days since I left the room.

217
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,240
Did Father ask about my condition?

218
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,602
Why should he?

219
00:13:07,827 --> 00:13:11,082
I didn't greet him for many days. Isn't he angry?

220
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,709
Not at all.

221
00:13:13,422 --> 00:13:16,642
He's in a better mood now that you're not here to annoy him.

222
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,442
I knew it.

223
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,958
Father never liked me.

224
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,722
Look at you.

225
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,362
I'm just joking with you.

226
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:33,202
It's fine. You don't need to coax me.

227
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:35,002
I knew it all along.

228
00:13:35,793 --> 00:13:37,322
Father was never happy with me

229
00:13:38,228 --> 00:13:39,922
no matter what I did.

230
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:43,405
He thought that I was useless no matter how capable I was.

231
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,510
Mother,

232
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:51,859
say,

233
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:56,522
if I can't make Father proud in this lifetime,

234
00:13:57,822 --> 00:13:59,882
don't you think it's pointless to live?

235
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,402
Si Zhe,

236
00:14:04,623 --> 00:14:06,162
he's your father.

237
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,122
He doesn't think that you're useless.

238
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,282
He just wants you to be better.

239
00:14:18,832 --> 00:14:21,922
Can you tell me who the guy is now?

240
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,139
My Lord, do you feel better now?

241
00:14:38,707 --> 00:14:39,949
It wasn't a big deal anyway.

242
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:41,642
As if.

243
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,700
You can't control the qi inside your body

244
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:47,202
ever since we captured Xiao En.

245
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:49,082
Luckily, I got you a carriage.

246
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,120
At least you can rest now.

247
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,762
If not, you'll throw up blood again.

248
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,362
Now that Fan Xian's dead,

249
00:14:58,443 --> 00:15:00,363
His Highness no longer needs to worry about him.

250
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,082
I'll request rewards for you all when we head back.

251
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,002
It's a shame

252
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,642
that his body was cremated.

253
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:11,442
If not, His Highness would be more pleased

254
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,640
if he could see his body.

255
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:14,922
Enough already.

256
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,642
How long before we reach?

257
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,735
We should be able to reach the convoy

258
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,202
before sunset.

259
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,054
I need to go out and take a breather.

260
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:32,398
Please endure it a little longer.

261
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:42,301
Fan Xian?

262
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,446
What a coincidence.

263
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,677
What a coincidence indeed.

264
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,852
Xie Bi An, I've been dead for so many days.

265
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:52,933
Did you follow us so that you could mourn the first seven days of my death?

266
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,842
Kill him! Let him die again!

267
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,762
Qi Nian, charge!

268
00:16:58,262 --> 00:17:00,242
My Lord, there's a cliff in front of us!

269
00:17:03,468 --> 00:17:05,162
Let's bet everything on this!

270
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,870
My Lord, we won the bet.

271
00:17:40,782 --> 00:17:43,376
Although you can't bear to part ways with us, we have to part eventually.

272
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,550
Go back now.

273
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,202
Go back and tell Li Cheng Ze this.

274
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,322
Tell him to wait for me in the capital.

275
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,520
My Lord, should we stop going after them?

276
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,842
This place is near the capital.

277
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:08,956
We cannot assault the convoy here.

278
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:11,004
Now that he's here,

279
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,282
he can be revived.

280
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,762
My Lord, you're back?

281
00:18:42,673 --> 00:18:45,120
- I'm back too. - Both of you are back? This is great.

282
00:18:45,201 --> 00:18:46,399
It was tough.

283
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,087
I finally returned from the dead.

284
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:50,502
Mr. Yan said there was no way you could return from the dead.

285
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:51,926
What nonsense was he talking about?

286
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:53,436
Let me smash this inauspicious vat first!

287
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,882
Calm down!

288
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,560
Who does the convoy at the back belong to?

289
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,162
Elder Princess of Northern Qi.

290
00:19:07,191 --> 00:19:08,690
Elder Princess of Northern Qi?

291
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:10,082
Where did she come from?

292
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:11,897
They've been following us all along.

293
00:19:12,046 --> 00:19:13,979
They followed us not long after you departed from our convoy.

294
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:15,891
It's the order of the young emperor of Northern Qi.

295
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:17,183
They want to establish a marriage alliance with us.

296
00:19:17,207 --> 00:19:19,762
They followed us and urged us to travel faster.

297
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,926
We were only able to travel slower

298
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:23,602
all thanks to Mr. Yan's firm arguments.

299
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:29,479
- Who will she get married to? - First Prince of the Qing Kingdom.

300
00:19:29,704 --> 00:19:30,854
Prince Cheng Ru?

301
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,282
Isn't Prince Cheng Ru often away leading troops in battle?

302
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,842
How can they get married?

303
00:20:35,726 --> 00:20:37,589
(Second Prince Residence)

304
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,759
Cheng Ru is returning to the capital, huh?

305
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,522
The border troops have a new commander.

306
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,082
Prince Cheng Ru will return to the capital together with his bodyguards.

307
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,681
It's been so many years. Why was he transferred back out of the blue?

308
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,159
I heard that he was going to get married.

309
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:58,392
The Elder Princess of Northern Qi

310
00:20:58,805 --> 00:21:01,005
is going to form a marriage alliance with His Highness.

311
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,642
Her lifetime is decided just like that, huh?

312
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,833
She's a princess after all.

313
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,762
When will Cheng Ru arrive at the capital?

314
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:24,709
In a few more days.

315
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:28,162
They're already preparing to receive him outside of the city.

316
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,162
They can do whatever they like.

317
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,159
I'm just worried that they might bump into Fan Xian.

318
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,310
What do you mean?

319
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,482
I calculated the time.

320
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,538
Fan Xian should be arriving at the capital

321
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:44,962
on the same day as Prince Cheng Ru.

322
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,802
What a coincidence.

323
00:21:46,927 --> 00:21:49,847
Logically speaking, they can enter the city from two different entrances.

324
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,242
But what if there's only one entrance?

325
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,122
Who should give in, then?

326
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,790
Relay my order.

327
00:21:57,933 --> 00:21:59,679
I don't care if it's a coincidence or road construction.

328
00:21:59,703 --> 00:22:01,522
Anyway, make both of them

329
00:22:02,222 --> 00:22:03,762
enter through the same entrance.

330
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:22,037
Fan Xian?

331
00:22:27,422 --> 00:22:29,282
Seems like you two had a great time.

332
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,562
What do you mean by that?

333
00:22:32,054 --> 00:22:33,637
Didn't you see that she's bound by chains?

334
00:22:33,661 --> 00:22:35,386
So what if I did?

335
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:37,718
She's not from the Qing Kingdom. I have to be wary of her.

336
00:22:37,742 --> 00:22:39,082
If so, you could've killed her.

337
00:22:39,177 --> 00:22:40,531
Why did you keep watch over her?

338
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,362
Killing her

339
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:46,150
is not beneficial or harmful to me.

340
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:48,989
You're deceiving yourself.

341
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:52,130
Why did you return to the convoy?

342
00:22:52,154 --> 00:22:54,496
Isn't it obvious? My fake death has ended.

343
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:56,399
It's time for me to return from the dead.

344
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,400
You won't get to return from the dead.

345
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:13,144
(Qing)

346
00:23:34,574 --> 00:23:36,042
- Lord Gao. - Lord Gao.

347
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:40,989
Qi Nian.

348
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,550
I'm here.

349
00:23:45,318 --> 00:23:46,879
- Take this. - What is this?

350
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,110
Just take it.

351
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:49,842
You need a favor, don't you?

352
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:51,361
We're a family, you know?

353
00:23:51,443 --> 00:23:53,043
You don't need to do this in the future.

354
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,722
These silver taels are from Northern Qi, right?

355
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:00,002
- How did you know? - They smell different.

356
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,070
Gao,

357
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,922
why did you give me all this money?

358
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,150
It's your compensation.

359
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,482
Compensation? For what?

360
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,170
What did you break?

361
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,782
I didn't break anything. It's compensation for your clothes.

362
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:14,549
You left in a hurry back then.

363
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,002
And, you left some of your clothes behind.

364
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,482
Did you lose them?

365
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,802
Even so, they shouldn't cost this much.

366
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,282
What are you saying?

367
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,442
Why would I lose your clothes?

368
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,402
If so,

369
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,002
what are you compensating me for?

370
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,079
Someone bought them from me.

371
00:24:32,191 --> 00:24:33,562
Someone actually bought them?

372
00:24:34,032 --> 00:24:37,082
How could those outfits sell for this much?

373
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,442
You have no idea.

374
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,322
Every city that we passed through was filled with crowds.

375
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,669
But why?

376
00:24:44,007 --> 00:24:45,487
Are they there to collect used clothing?

377
00:24:45,511 --> 00:24:47,970
Can you forget about the clothes for now?

378
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,402
They all came to mourn Lord Fan.

379
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,922
Lord Fan!

380
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,162
They said the convoy was Lord Fan's last resting place.

381
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:05,442
All of them were flooding to our carriages.

382
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:09,282
They shouted that they wanted to keep Lord Fan's item as a keepsake.

383
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,482
The news of his death has spread so widely, huh?

384
00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:14,666
I thought they were only spreading it within the capital.

385
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,642
It's more than just the capital.

386
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,442
Your news of death

387
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:20,027
was spread throughout the Qing Kingdom.

388
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,251
- This makes no sense. - Of course it makes no sense.

389
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,470
Did the Overwatch Council do the publicity work?

390
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,322
What's publicity work?

391
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,522
It means they're the ones spreading the news.

392
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:33,082
The Overwatch Council alone can't achieve a feat like this.

393
00:25:33,486 --> 00:25:34,848
His Majesty has to be behind this.

394
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,740
But why did His Majesty spread news of my death

395
00:25:37,854 --> 00:25:39,522
when he knew that I was still alive?

396
00:25:39,653 --> 00:25:41,002
His Majesty has his eyes

397
00:25:41,214 --> 00:25:42,562
on the world.

398
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,882
So, he spread news of my death

399
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:46,782
for the sake of the Qing Kingdom?

400
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,090
Everything we did was for the sake of the Qing Kingdom.

401
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,522
Since my death benefits the Qing Kingdom,

402
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,682
why don't you take advantage of the situation and make it real?

403
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,136
- What do you want to do? - I need to return to the capital alive.

404
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,442
I need to investigate Li Cheng Ze until the end.

405
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,185
It's not that I'm not allowing you to live.

406
00:26:23,209 --> 00:26:24,416
There's no way for you to live now.

407
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,590
I understand.

408
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,442
Unless, my fake death was an attempt

409
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,442
at undergoing a meaningful mission.

410
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:33,856
Only then will it not be considered as deceiving His Majesty.

411
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,522
It's best if we can make the passing down of the literary circle

412
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:39,042
come true as well.

413
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,882
How is that possible?

414
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,120
Is Elder Princess of Northern Qi part of the convoy too?

415
00:26:46,442 --> 00:26:48,562
- What are you up to? - What kind of person is she?

416
00:26:48,653 --> 00:26:50,348
She's just like any ordinary princess.

417
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:03,402
It's late at night.

418
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,282
Mr. Yan, what do you need...

419
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:18,880
Fan...

420
00:27:18,991 --> 00:27:20,262
Fan Xian?

421
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,242
Weren't you dead?

422
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:24,602
Your Highness, have you seen me before?

423
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,682
In secret.

424
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:34,079
I'm more surprised than you.

425
00:27:34,175 --> 00:27:35,474
What do you mean by in secret?

426
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:37,362
During my mother's birthday banquet,

427
00:27:37,774 --> 00:27:38,962
at the back hall,

428
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,722
I saw you

429
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,402
and the female pilgrims

430
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,282
staring at each other in public

431
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,322
with deep affection for each other...

432
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,322
That's not true! There was no affection at all!

433
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:52,842
Is it that shocking?

434
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,030
Pick it up.

435
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:01,684
Envoy Fan, so, you...

436
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,122
Are you not entirely dead?

437
00:28:05,288 --> 00:28:06,802
My death was fake.

438
00:28:10,743 --> 00:28:12,042
His death was fake.

439
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,830
That's all.

440
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,482
All of you, dismissed.

441
00:28:40,472 --> 00:28:41,882
(Elder Princess of Northern Qi)

442
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:44,202
Envoy Fan, I was shocked

443
00:28:44,511 --> 00:28:46,111
when I heard about news of your passing.

444
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,482
However,

445
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,762
now that you're fine,

446
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,042
I feel relieved as well.

447
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,122
At least the heavens didn't take your life out of jealousy.

448
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,234
Your Highness, I assume you do not go outside often.

449
00:29:01,331 --> 00:29:02,970
As a princess,

450
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,922
how can I leave the palace without permission?

451
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:08,762
I understand now. That's why you look nervous.

452
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,840
The imperial family of Northern Qi

453
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,682
has to be honorable and unshaken

454
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,762
no matter where they are.

455
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,682
Why would I be nervous?

456
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,922
All right. I understand now.

457
00:29:22,238 --> 00:29:24,402
Your Highness, why don't we get to business?

458
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:26,974
What did your emperor and empress dowager

459
00:29:27,463 --> 00:29:30,562
tell you to do before you came here?

460
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:36,305
All of you may leave.

461
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,821
They told me

462
00:29:50,463 --> 00:29:52,402
that you, Envoy Fan,

463
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,882
were conducting a smuggling business with Northern Qi.

464
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,882
If you have any news in the future,

465
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,402
you may relay it to me.

466
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:03,242
And, I can relay the news to Northern Qi.

467
00:30:03,357 --> 00:30:05,602
So, I guess that makes us allies.

468
00:30:07,911 --> 00:30:10,199
- I think so. - That's why I can't afford to die.

469
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:11,400
You aren't dead.

470
00:30:11,503 --> 00:30:12,882
But I can't live as well.

471
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,402
If I can't live,

472
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,722
how can we continue our dealings?

473
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,989
If so,

474
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,362
Envoy Fan, how can you live, then?

475
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,082
Your Highness, do you know how to lie?

476
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,882
The imperial family of Northern Qi

477
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,479
treasures trust the most.

478
00:30:29,605 --> 00:30:31,522
How could I lie?

479
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,980
Your Highness, if you don't lie,

480
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,550
you won't be able to accomplish the task assigned to you.

481
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,110
Even so,

482
00:30:46,814 --> 00:30:48,617
I don't know how to lie.

483
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,722
Your Highness, don't worry.

484
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:54,042
It's very simple.

485
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,802
Let me teach you.

486
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,322
What's wrong?

487
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,162
What's going on?

488
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,042
Congratulations, everyone!

489
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:30,560
You guys managed to survive the life-and-death trial!

490
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,242
Life-and-death trial?

491
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,482
Ever since the convoy left Northern Qi and entered the Qing Kingdom,

492
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,762
people have been tailing and spying on them in secret.

493
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:42,039
Your Highness, you mustn't believe in such rumors.

494
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,616
The convoy was protected by the military

495
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,015
ever since they entered the Qing Kingdom.

496
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,362
Who dares to assault them?

497
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,882
In this world,

498
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:51,682
there are experts that even an army can't stop.

499
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,842
Could it be a grandmaster?

500
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,536
- That's right. - It's a grandmaster?

501
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,962
A grandmaster?

502
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,072
The might of a grandmaster surpasses even heavy cavalries.

503
00:32:03,153 --> 00:32:05,894
If so, why did he target the convoy?

504
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:10,882
Right before Mr. Zhuang Mo Han passed away,

505
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:15,242
he gifted Lord Fan Xian a secret book.

506
00:32:15,677 --> 00:32:16,679
What does that represent?

507
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:20,012
Of course that represents the passing down of the literary circle.

508
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:21,243
Indeed.

509
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,999
The golden age of literature always lied between two kingdoms.

510
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:26,780
What about the rest? What would they think about it?

511
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,962
- She's right. - She's right.

512
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,882
They must be foreign barbarians!

513
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,562
It must be Dongyi City!

514
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,762
Your Highness, how come you knew that there was a grandmaster?

515
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:39,722
I witnessed it myself.

516
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:41,242
In the convoy,

517
00:32:41,536 --> 00:32:45,082
one of them faced the grandmaster directly.

518
00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:47,002
Using his own life,

519
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:49,522
he protected the legacy of the literary circle.

520
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,162
He protected all of you.

521
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,896
- Who's that? - What kind of person is he?

522
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,616
- I don't know. - I'm sure he's an expert.

523
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,842
That's right.

524
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,219
He's daring enough to face a grandmaster directly.

525
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:00,882
Isn't that Fan Xian?

526
00:33:01,007 --> 00:33:02,482
Don't come close!

527
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:06,122
- Lord Fan? - Fan Xian?

528
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,282
Weren't you dead?

529
00:33:09,348 --> 00:33:11,728
Lord Fan, what exactly is going on?

530
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,959
Please explain yourself.

531
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,419
That's right.

532
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,082
Please explain yourself.

533
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,150
Forget it.

534
00:33:22,812 --> 00:33:24,452
It's fine even if I don't explain myself.

535
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,162
To Lord Fan, credits mean nothing!

536
00:33:28,448 --> 00:33:31,802
However, you guys have the right to know the truth!

537
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:34,141
- Qi Nian, stop. - Lord Fan!

538
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:36,692
Everyone,

539
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,619
in front of the grandmaster,

540
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,162
Lord Fan's only choice was to fake his death.

541
00:33:42,278 --> 00:33:44,959
The literary legacy

542
00:33:45,054 --> 00:33:46,682
will only vanish

543
00:33:46,763 --> 00:33:49,042
with Lord Fan's death.

544
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:52,682
Due to that, the grandmaster didn't attack the convoy.

545
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:55,962
Thus, our safety was ensured.

546
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:59,200
So, Lord Fan faked his death in order to save us.

547
00:33:59,317 --> 00:34:01,234
- He did it for the sake of the Qing Kingdom! - It's all thanks to him.

548
00:34:01,258 --> 00:34:02,482
It's nothing worth mentioning!

549
00:34:02,563 --> 00:34:03,713
That's right.

550
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,242
Your Highness!

551
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,442
Coincidentally, Her Highness witnessed the incident.

552
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,860
Your Highness, thank you for keeping it a secret.

553
00:34:19,206 --> 00:34:21,406
Literacy legacy is connected to the fate of the states.

554
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,602
It can only be shared between Northern Qi

555
00:34:24,808 --> 00:34:26,282
and the Qing Kingdom.

556
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:28,495
How could we let other people lay a finger on it?

557
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:30,319
That's right. Your Highness, please sit down.

558
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:38,202
Your Highness, have some water.

559
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,100
Lord Fan, may I know

560
00:34:41,207 --> 00:34:43,602
which grandmaster you fought against?

561
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,402
I never fought him.

562
00:34:45,607 --> 00:34:47,802
If I do engage a grandmaster in battle,

563
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,322
I'm afraid I would've been dead by now.

564
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,682
I only saw him from far away.

565
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,322
He was using a sword.

566
00:34:57,786 --> 00:34:58,962
What kind of stupid question is that?

567
00:34:58,986 --> 00:35:00,192
There are only four grandmasters in the world.

568
00:35:00,216 --> 00:35:02,040
Who else is there besides the ones in Northern Qi and the Qing Kingdom?

569
00:35:02,064 --> 00:35:03,093
Si Gu Jian.

570
00:35:03,174 --> 00:35:05,915
I didn't see his face clearly. You mustn't malign the innocent.

571
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,580
We shouldn't make assumptions when the truth isn't clear.

572
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:11,282
What if he attacks us because of this?

573
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,990
You're right.

574
00:35:15,162 --> 00:35:16,862
Lord Fan, thank you.

575
00:35:16,943 --> 00:35:20,443
Lord Fan, thank you.

576
00:35:34,205 --> 00:35:36,642
For the sake of the Qing Kingdom!

577
00:35:36,978 --> 00:35:42,202
- For the Qing Kingdom! - For the Qing Kingdom!

578
00:35:42,283 --> 00:35:46,402
For the Qing Kingdom!

579
00:35:46,483 --> 00:35:49,954
For the Qing Kingdom!

580
00:35:50,035 --> 00:35:51,282
Everyone, quiet down.

581
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,442
I'll give you guys one hour

582
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:57,122
to regroup and remove the camp.

583
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,962
We shall depart

584
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:00,522
in one hour sharp.

585
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,750
The Qing Kingdom is fortunate that Lord Fan is alive and kicking.

586
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:06,055
- Relay this news to the capital immediately. - Yes, sir.

587
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,322
Yes, My Lord!

588
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,030
Go now.

589
00:36:09,111 --> 00:36:10,254
Hurry and relay the news to the capital.

590
00:36:10,278 --> 00:36:11,357
Yeah.

591
00:36:11,535 --> 00:36:13,922
The Qing Kingdom is truly fortunate to have Lord Fan.

592
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,602
That's right.

593
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:29,162
I finally returned from the dead.

594
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,470
That's right.

595
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:36,242
Lord Fan,

596
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,802
aren't you afraid that Gu Si Jian might find you because of this?

597
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,880
He would've been here long ago

598
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:44,362
if he actually took it to heart.

599
00:36:45,983 --> 00:36:47,823
Your Highness, thank you for your cooperation.

600
00:36:53,227 --> 00:36:57,865
Lord Fan, there's something I don't know if I can ask you or not.

601
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,110
Go ahead.

602
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:04,062
Your kingdom is going to establish a marriage alliance with us.

603
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:08,642
So, what kind of person is Prince Cheng Ru?

604
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:10,590
His Highness is often away leading troops to battle.

605
00:37:10,614 --> 00:37:11,842
I've never met him before.

606
00:37:23,565 --> 00:37:26,066
Have you met Prince Cheng Ru before?

607
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:27,802
No, I have not.

608
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:33,749
Please take care.

609
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,110
Mr. Yan!

610
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,309
Thank you.

611
00:37:43,736 --> 00:37:45,842
You died through my hands.

612
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,362
Now, you're revived through my words.

613
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,110
Fan Xian,

614
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,070
no more next time.

615
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,602
Qi Nian, there's someone in front.

616
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,402
I think he's here to receive the convoy.

617
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,922
Why did he come here alone?

618
00:38:31,113 --> 00:38:33,402
He looks quite familiar, doesn't he?

619
00:38:39,206 --> 00:38:40,802
Lord Fan!

620
00:38:41,217 --> 00:38:43,042
You've finally returned!

621
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,282
Lord Fan!

622
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,558
Lord Xin, why don't you rest in the carriage?

623
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,850
Lord Xin.

624
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,990
Slow down.

625
00:39:26,245 --> 00:39:27,802
Thank you so much.

626
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,110
Fan...

627
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:34,562
Lord Fan,

628
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:37,442
you've done our kingdom proud indeed.

629
00:39:37,663 --> 00:39:40,565
I'm sure you'll rise through the ranks rapidly from now on.

630
00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:41,982
Congratulations.

631
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:44,482
So,

632
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,120
His Majesty didn't convict me for deceiving him, then?

633
00:39:48,632 --> 00:39:49,992
His Majesty said nothing about it.

634
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,202
He only told us to receive the convoy on their return.

635
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,919
Lord Xin, it must've been tough. Let's enter the city now.

636
00:39:56,286 --> 00:39:57,436
You see,

637
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:59,362
for your trip to Northern Qi,

638
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,242
all eyes were on you all.

639
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:05,482
The Department of Rites prepared a welcoming ceremony for you guys.

640
00:40:05,983 --> 00:40:07,133
But...

641
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,722
- But... - But what? Tell us.

642
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,642
But coincidentally,

643
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,562
Prince Cheng Ru will also be arriving

644
00:40:14,643 --> 00:40:16,122
at the capital today.

645
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:19,122
What a coincidence.

646
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,749
Initially, both of you can avoid each other.

647
00:40:25,898 --> 00:40:27,679
Unfortunately, the recent flooding

648
00:40:27,783 --> 00:40:30,122
destroyed the eastern official road.

649
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,819
And, Prince Cheng Ru changed his schedule suddenly.

650
00:40:32,976 --> 00:40:35,082
Now, both of you will be using the north entrance.

651
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:36,632
You guys will bump into each other.

652
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:38,942
Where is he now?

653
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:40,749
He's not far away.

654
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,402
He's less than three miles away.

655
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:43,669
So?

656
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,282
Prince Cheng Ru's cavalry guards

657
00:40:46,782 --> 00:40:47,840
will arrive soon.

658
00:40:47,921 --> 00:40:51,762
It doesn't look good to have both teams crowding outside the city gate?

659
00:40:53,578 --> 00:40:54,679
Precisely.

660
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,760
So, the Department of Rites sent you here so that I could make way for him?

661
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:04,160
He's a prince after all.

662
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:10,225
Lord Fan, you deserve recognition for your effort.

663
00:41:10,249 --> 00:41:13,682
My Lord, please rest on the roadside later.

664
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,282
Once His Highness passes through,

665
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:17,183
the officials of the Department of Rites and State Ceremonial Bureau

666
00:41:17,207 --> 00:41:19,667
will come out to receive you and the convoy personally.

667
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,122
It's not a big deal. You could've sent your subordinate

668
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,519
to notify me.

669
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,319
Lord Xin, why did you come here personally?

670
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,602
It doesn't matter.

671
00:41:30,803 --> 00:41:34,362
Lord Fan, I missed you too.

672
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:38,002
Look. I was so excited to see you that I didn't sleep last night.

673
00:41:38,805 --> 00:41:40,559
Look at how excited I am upon seeing you.

674
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:41,920
I'm so excited that I could...

675
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,402
Lord Xin, stop.

676
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,762
Lord Xin, you can cry later.

677
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,425
Okay.

678
00:41:48,526 --> 00:41:49,802
I'll cry later.

679
00:41:49,991 --> 00:41:51,751
If so, can you make way for Prince Cheng Ru?

680
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:53,669
This is simple.

681
00:41:53,749 --> 00:41:55,002
That's right.

682
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,282
But I can't make the call here.

683
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,082
You know that Elder Princess of Northern Qi is behind us, right?

684
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:03,077
Yes.

685
00:42:03,266 --> 00:42:04,456
When the two kingdoms form a marriage alliance,

686
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,442
she'll be Prince Cheng Ru's consort. You know that too, right?

687
00:42:07,867 --> 00:42:09,002
I do.

688
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,842
If so, don't you think we have to ask for her permission?

689
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,619
I don't think that's necessary.

690
00:42:15,718 --> 00:42:16,878
You wish to keep it a secret?

691
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,039
That's a great idea.

692
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,719
All right! All of you heard that, right?

693
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,042
Yes, Lord Fan!

694
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,562
Lord Xin was the one

695
00:42:22,643 --> 00:42:24,722
who tried to deceive Prince Cheng Ru's consort.

696
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,642
Don't say that!

697
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,800
If so...

698
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,050
If so, I think we should ask for her permission.

699
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:31,349
Sure.

700
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:33,042
Lord Xin, we'll follow your will.

701
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:35,522
Don't do that. Don't just follow my will.

702
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,079
- Lord Xin, please. - Don't!

703
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:40,202
- Lord Xin, please. - I can't make the call here.

704
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,322
This is too much of a coincidence.

705
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,282
He said they changed their schedule.

706
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,042
They changed their schedule?

707
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:47,722
Because of that, they bumped into me?

708
00:42:48,181 --> 00:42:50,162
Your Highness, although your carriage

709
00:42:50,311 --> 00:42:52,722
represents the honor of your kingdom,

710
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:54,219
in my opinion,

711
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,959
we'll be a family anyway.

712
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:57,562
You don't need to care about this.

713
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,082
We can discuss this.
