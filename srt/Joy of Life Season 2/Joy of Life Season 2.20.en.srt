00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:30,941
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:34,122
(Episode 20)

3
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:51,562
- Dig the outhouse again? - Yes.

4
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:53,238
It's Lord Fan's idea again.

5
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,600
My Lord, this is ridiculous.

6
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,119
Just tell them we are short-staffed

7
00:01:59,178 --> 00:02:00,419
and can't do it on time.

8
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,656
He got men from the First Bureau of the Overwatch Council.

9
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,930
He didn't even look for us.

10
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,882
One cannot simply enter the exam hall

11
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,120
unauthorized.

12
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,669
My Lord, the Overwatch Council manages the whole kingdom.

13
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,911
According to the law, they can even take candidates away in front of us.

14
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,200
Why are you still telling me?

15
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,959
He is asking you to get the wood and bricks

16
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:23,962
out from the warehouse.

17
00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:27,722
Those are Phoebe Zhennan logs and metal bricks.

18
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:29,317
Why is he using them to build an outhouse?

19
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:30,591
He said

20
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,682
it was a little overboard.

21
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,210
However...

22
00:02:34,726 --> 00:02:35,976
What?

23
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,536
The Spring Imperial Examination is organized by the Ministry of Rites.

24
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,202
He can provide manpower

25
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,802
but we need to provide the materials.

26
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,259
Doing that won't be violating the law and against the rules.

27
00:02:45,283 --> 00:02:46,482
Darn it.

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,370
Rules?

29
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,810
Yes.

30
00:02:57,963 --> 00:02:59,563
We need to do it according to the rules.

31
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,802
Lord Fan.

32
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,881
The repair of the outhouse by Zi Yue is done.

33
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,042
It won't affect the Spring Imperial Examination.

34
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,050
All of you have worked hard.

35
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,002
I'm afraid when I think about it.

36
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,959
They are so sinister.

37
00:03:22,462 --> 00:03:24,943
Adding kerosene in the outhouse.

38
00:03:25,063 --> 00:03:26,313
When night comes,

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,480
students will bring candles.

40
00:03:28,621 --> 00:03:31,625
If an accident happens, a fire will occur.

41
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,009
Qi Nian.

42
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:38,082
You might not know.

43
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,050
A place like that

44
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,359
won't just catch fire.

45
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,202
- It might even explode. - Explode?

46
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,359
If this place explodes,

47
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,880
then...

48
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,322
Won't it be written on

49
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,839
an exciting page in the history books?

50
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:56,162
On a certain year, month, day, and time,

51
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:59,399
at the Spring Imperial Examination hosted by Lord Fan Xian,

52
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,522
all the candidates died due to...

53
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,842
That's very embarrassing.

54
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,734
There are three more days to go.

55
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:09,912
No matter what,

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,160
I will protect their safety.

57
00:04:11,271 --> 00:04:13,471
The officials don't care about their lives,

58
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,129
but I do.

59
00:04:15,782 --> 00:04:17,318
If the officials don't want to protect them,

60
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:18,592
I will protect them.

61
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,050
Unfortunately,

62
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,360
you've done so much for them,

63
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,800
but they are unaware.

64
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:46,322
Good people and good deeds won't be remembered.

65
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,282
Call me the Red Scarf.

66
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:52,002
Lord Fan, what did you just say?

67
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,479
Red Scarf.

68
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,082
He changed the candles and drinking water.

69
00:05:10,274 --> 00:05:12,002
He even built a new outhouse.

70
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,802
Minister Guo also bribed a few students.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,680
We'll find a way to frame Fan Xian again in three days.

72
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,759
There's no need to do it anymore.

73
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:23,329
- No need? - Without water or fire,

74
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,762
it's not a major incident.

75
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,802
Fan Xian's grace

76
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:28,682
cannot be suppressed

77
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,089
unless a few dozen people die.

78
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,522
Why don't we cut him down to size?

79
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,440
Why waste effort if I can't cut him dead?

80
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,120
Ask Guo Zheng to give up.

81
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,640
What a waste of this good opportunity.

82
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,039
Something's amiss.

83
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,422
I might even be trapped by Guo Zheng's schemes.

84
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,242
Fan Xian is cunning.

85
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,962
No.

86
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,522
Something so trivial

87
00:05:58,696 --> 00:06:00,122
could only be discovered

88
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:03,143
by an old man who has many years of experience in the Ministry of Rites.

89
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,202
Otherwise, who would check the candles and drinking water?

90
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:09,056
Someone from the Ministry of Rites is helping him?

91
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,569
Who would it be?

92
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,450
- Someone fainted. - What's going on?

93
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:01,184
Get him up.

94
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:09,722
That's...

95
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,359
Submit your papers!

96
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:27,760
Lord Fan is very meticulous in doing things.

97
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:29,922
Even the Overwatch Council came to help.

98
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,479
Nothing happened in the last three days.

99
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:34,943
It's worthy of a celebration.

100
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,910
I have high hopes for Lord Fan.

101
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,959
Minister Guo, you have a good eye for talent.

102
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:41,659
Having you in the Ministry of Rites

103
00:09:41,718 --> 00:09:43,638
feels like rain during a drought

104
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,920
and springtime for a wilted tree.

105
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,802
Have all the papers been collected?

106
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,409
Everything has gone smoothly.

107
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,962
The sealing of papers comes next.

108
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,520
Nothing will happen.

109
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,482
There's no need to worry, Minister Guo.

110
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,649
Lord Fan.

111
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,680
You worked hard in the last few days.

112
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,870
Why don't you take a break back at your residence?

113
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,002
I can't.

114
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,642
I still need to supervise the sealing of papers.

115
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,390
I can't slack when it comes to a duty assigned by His Majesty.

116
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:53,723
A capable man has a lot of work to do.

117
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,442
Is this how the papers are sealed?

118
00:10:57,102 --> 00:10:58,142
Yes.

119
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:00,962
The papers can be judged fairly when the names are covered.

120
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,682
They are copying the papers over there.

121
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:06,280
We will make a copy of all the papers.

122
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,719
After all, one's handwriting

123
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,960
can also expose the candidate's identity easily.

124
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,929
How thorough.

125
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:18,162
After the papers are copied, they will be sent to be examined.

126
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,159
The candidates are chosen purely on the basis of their talents.

127
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,442
What should I do

128
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,239
if I want to tamper with the papers.

129
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:39,962
Lord Fan,

130
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,690
what did you say?

131
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:43,282
I'm asking you

132
00:11:43,518 --> 00:11:44,844
what I should do

133
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,360
if I want to tamper with the process of sealing exam papers?

134
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,922
Lord Fan, you mustn't joke about this.

135
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,322
I won't do that. I'm just curious.

136
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,882
Nothing of that sort will happen.

137
00:11:58,663 --> 00:12:00,261
We are not talking about the current examination.

138
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:01,762
It has never happened in the past.

139
00:12:01,843 --> 00:12:03,358
Are you not treating me as one of your own?

140
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:04,632
It has never happened.

141
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:07,780
Why did I hear that the papers used to cover up the names

142
00:12:07,804 --> 00:12:09,202
had different lengths?

143
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,522
A difference in the paper's length

144
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,082
is also a marking.

145
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,362
That is the area for copying, right?

146
00:12:33,495 --> 00:12:34,739
You can also stain the paper with ink

147
00:12:34,763 --> 00:12:36,602
in the area where the papers are copied.

148
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,119
By doing that, the person who judges the paper

149
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,882
will know what to do.

150
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,322
There's nothing of that sort.

151
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,839
Lord Fan, where did you hear this?

152
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:47,233
They are all rumors.

153
00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:51,407
Of course.

154
00:12:51,502 --> 00:12:53,222
I believe all of you here

155
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,440
will never do that.

156
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,769
After all,

157
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:03,119
no one wants to die.

158
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,508
I was only joking.

159
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:14,839
Everyone. Do your job well

160
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,170
while I study.

161
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:22,803
Message from Guo Zheng.

162
00:14:22,884 --> 00:14:25,096
Fan Xian knows the tricks of the Ministry of Rites well.

163
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,479
He wanted to help Your Highness' retainers

164
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,882
but it doesn't seem too convenient right now.

165
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,970
What retainer?

166
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,719
I have no retainer.

167
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,122
Understood.

168
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,280
There are only candidates.

169
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,442
No retainers.

170
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,049
It's not bad

171
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,080
for the Spring Imperial Examination to be clean.

172
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,482
No one should interfere

173
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,442
and let destiny take charge.

174
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,680
I'll ask someone to inform Guo Zheng.

175
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:41,562
(Yang Wan Li)

176
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:53,842
Chan Li, Wan Li. Why do you get up so early?

177
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:56,722
It's a habit of mine. I wake up when it's time.

178
00:15:57,326 --> 00:15:59,205
Chan Li, the exam is over.

179
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:00,536
Why are you still reading?

180
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:07,082
Ji Chang, look.

181
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,979
I couldn't remember this sentence no matter how much I thought about it.

182
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,573
Enough. The exam is finished.

183
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:12,922
Stop thinking about it.

184
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,838
Where's Cheng Jia Lin?

185
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:17,255
He's exhausted after the three-day exam.

186
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,479
I couldn't wake him up.

187
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,360
Yes. I feel reborn after the last three days.

188
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,690
Indeed.

189
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,922
Chan Li, you are acting strange.

190
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,522
Ji Chang, what's that smell?

191
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:31,958
You smell nice.

192
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:33,392
You have a good nose.

193
00:16:33,473 --> 00:16:35,000
- You have food again? - Of course.

194
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,479
You are so kind.

195
00:16:36,574 --> 00:16:37,824
Chicken?

196
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,319
Roasted Chicken.

197
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,615
- Where did you get this? - I prepared it last night.

198
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,640
I wanted to celebrate after we finished the exam.

199
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,840
In the end, the three of you slept soundly like pigs.

200
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,641
Thank you for feeding us in the last three days.

201
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,640
The chicken will still return one day.

202
00:16:50,735 --> 00:16:53,162
That's not how you use Lord Fan's poem.

203
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:54,388
All right. Let's eat.

204
00:16:54,469 --> 00:16:55,719
Otherwise, it might rot.

205
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,250
I'll split it.

206
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,690
Who would expect

207
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,042
Lord Fan to buy me wine and meat

208
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,410
that night?

209
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:13,784
Right?

210
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,882
Who would expect that?

211
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:18,207
Yes. I was shocked when I found out.

212
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,562
Speaking of which, a note was found

213
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,439
in his pastry when he entered the exam hall.

214
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:23,974
I was scared to death.

215
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,040
Thankfully, Lord Fan proved my innocence.

216
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,279
Shouldn't the four of us visit Lord Fan?

217
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,759
Why?

218
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,239
There are rumors on the streets

219
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,762
that the four of us have become Lord Fan's disciples.

220
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,887
However, we know we aren't.

221
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:41,762
Why don't we

222
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,362
take advantage of this?

223
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:45,569
Are you saying

224
00:17:46,505 --> 00:17:47,735
that we should visit our "teacher"?

225
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:48,997
With Lord Fan's talents,

226
00:17:49,078 --> 00:17:50,758
he is more than enough to be our teacher.

227
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,962
Having Lord Fan as our teacher?

228
00:17:53,043 --> 00:17:54,725
- That's great. - Of course.

229
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,322
But if we visit him now,

230
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,162
we'll be seen as taking a shortcut.

231
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,849
You are right.

232
00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:03,655
There's no need to be afraid if you have a clear conscience.

233
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,693
Yes.

234
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:07,055
I must have a clear conscience and not be afraid as well.

235
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,959
We can visit Lord Fan

236
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,600
but now is not the time.

237
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,930
When should we visit him then?

238
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:17,541
Even if we are going,

239
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:20,642
a good time is waiting until the results are released.

240
00:18:20,888 --> 00:18:21,962
But...

241
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:23,807
This is it.

242
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,970
I think so.

243
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,402
Save some for Jia Lin.

244
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,042
- I am Cheng Jia Lin. - Go away.

245
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,559
I wonder what Lord Fan

246
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,450
is doing now.

247
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,799
Lord Fan, you haven't returned home for a few days.

248
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,572
Your family misses you.

249
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:50,903
I couldn't go back.

250
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:53,802
I had to keep an eye on the judgment.

251
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,219
If I want the exam to be fair, I must spend some effort.

252
00:18:56,243 --> 00:18:57,842
That's all, right?

253
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,519
I watched the judgment for a few days.

254
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,015
Only the results need to be released.

255
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,962
This time, the examination

256
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,239
is clean and fair at least.

257
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,362
What about the four people at Tongfu Inn?

258
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:11,202
Shi Chan Li failed.

259
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,804
- Lord Fan, didn't you help... - It's fair and that's good enough.

260
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:16,882
What about the other three?

261
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:18,640
If nothing goes wrong,

262
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:20,522
the three of them should be on the ranking.

263
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,279
Especially Yang Wan Li.

264
00:19:22,382 --> 00:19:23,802
His article is not bad.

265
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:26,679
Lord Fan, your eye for talent is amazing.

266
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:27,800
You met four people,

267
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,402
and three of them were chosen.

268
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:30,809
If I had known,

269
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,162
I would've participated in the exam as well.

270
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,799
With your blessing,

271
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,614
perhaps I could...

272
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,840
Just sleep.

273
00:19:46,302 --> 00:19:54,302
(Fan Residence)

274
00:20:12,404 --> 00:20:15,725
Zi Yue, don't you have any footsteps?

275
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,202
Qi Nian, this is...

276
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:24,262
This is Lord Fan's meal.

277
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,242
Qi Nian,

278
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,002
what about this?

279
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,560
The meat?

280
00:20:30,686 --> 00:20:31,936
I'm sure you know.

281
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:35,562
This is Ba Ba's favorite.

282
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:38,686
Understood.

283
00:20:38,774 --> 00:20:41,534
Qi Nian, you are stealing Lord Fan's meat.

284
00:20:42,294 --> 00:20:44,494
How can you call this stealing?

285
00:20:44,598 --> 00:20:47,078
Lord Fan is resting.

286
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,799
He won't be eating these dishes.

287
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,160
The dishes cannot be... Right?

288
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,439
You still can't do that.

289
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:56,103
No. If no one eats the dishes,

290
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,239
they will be thrown away.

291
00:20:58,358 --> 00:20:59,608
Isn't that a waste?

292
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,680
- But... - Wasting is bad, right?

293
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,840
- You are right. - What's bad about what I'm doing now?

294
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,198
Qi Nian, after saying that,

295
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,962
I don't know what's right and wrong about this anymore.

296
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:15,762
Enough. Sit down.

297
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,562
Let's eat together. Be my guest.

298
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:21,322
Here. I'll let you

299
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,162
try Lord Fan's meal.

300
00:21:24,353 --> 00:21:25,603
Here.

301
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:29,640
Come on. Try it.

302
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,002
The meat is for my daughter.

303
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,242
Let's eat this

304
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:37,122
troublesome dish, fish with bones.

305
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,718
- Here you go. - Well, Qi Nian. You asked me to eat.

306
00:21:41,821 --> 00:21:42,862
I'm asking you to eat.

307
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:44,922
Here. Try the fish eyes.

308
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,810
You read books often. They are good for your eyes.

309
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,141
Sure.

310
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:52,761
You are right. I'll try it then.

311
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,650
What do you think?

312
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,122
Delicious.

313
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:00,642
- Is it nice? - Yes.

314
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:02,283
Of course, it's nice.

315
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:03,381
Look at me.

316
00:22:03,462 --> 00:22:04,741
I've gained weight.

317
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,882
Try this.

318
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,410
Qi Nian.

319
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:12,009
How long

320
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,962
is Lord Fan going to sleep?

321
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,239
- Are you looking for him? - No. The ranking for the exam

322
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,440
has been published by the Ministry of Rites.

323
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:24,849
According to the rules, we need to take a look

324
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,277
-before the ranking is released. - President Chen can do that.

325
00:22:28,334 --> 00:22:30,442
He asked me to deliver it to Lord Fan.

326
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,199
Why are you so stubborn?

327
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,039
Let Lord Fan sleep more

328
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:37,602
and we can eat more. Isn't that great?

329
00:22:38,743 --> 00:22:40,306
Here.

330
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,602
Try this.

331
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,922
Let me try it first.

332
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,410
It's delicious. Try it.

333
00:22:54,224 --> 00:22:55,602
What do you think?

334
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,402
It's a very special taste.

335
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,890
What is this?

336
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,650
Yogurt.

337
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:06,362
Lord Fan, you're awake?

338
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,011
It's fine. Keep eating.

339
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:18,642
Why are you looking at me?

340
00:23:18,901 --> 00:23:21,581
Qi Nian, stop pretending. You didn't wipe the yogurt off your lips.

341
00:23:25,377 --> 00:23:26,950
Lord Fan, what's yogurt?

342
00:23:27,116 --> 00:23:28,242
What is it?

343
00:23:30,054 --> 00:23:32,174
This is the ranking for the exam.

344
00:23:32,727 --> 00:23:34,527
President Chen asked me to deliver it to you.

345
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,049
Keep eating.

346
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,802
I'll go and find my chopsticks.

347
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,962
Well, you should keep eating.

348
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,970
What's wrong, Lord Fan?

349
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,609
Yang Wan Li failed the exam.

350
00:24:04,247 --> 00:24:06,282
His name is not on the list.

351
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,840
Did he break some kind of rules?

352
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:13,459
Qi Nian, go to the Ministry of Rites with me after you finished eating.

353
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,730
I'm not eating.

354
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,202
You shouldn't walk back and forth.

355
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,442
Lord Fan.

356
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,400
- How is it? - I looked through the checked papers.

357
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:39,035
Yang Wan Li's paper is in the batch of papers

358
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,490
written by chosen candidates.

359
00:24:40,571 --> 00:24:41,812
Weren't the names covered?

360
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,680
I saw what he write at the exam hall.

361
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,130
I still remember the content.

362
00:24:45,998 --> 00:24:49,878
Did they miss out on his name when they copied his paper?

363
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:51,002
No.

364
00:24:52,248 --> 00:24:54,602
The content is Yang Wan Li's,

365
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,602
but the name has been changed.

366
00:25:02,035 --> 00:25:05,944
(Sheng Huai Yuan)

367
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,239
Is it that difficult

368
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:23,089
to ask for fairness?

369
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,642
We must investigate it, Lord Fan.

370
00:25:24,728 --> 00:25:26,809
We must see who replaces Yang Wan Li.

371
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,210
There's no need to investigate. I recognize this name.

372
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,089
You recognize it?

373
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,999
Help me keep an eye on these names.

374
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,280
What do you want me to do, Your Highness?

375
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,159
Not doing anything while sealing the papers

376
00:25:38,183 --> 00:25:39,433
is good enough.

377
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:42,962
The name that replaces Yang Wan Li is one of them.

378
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,002
The crown prince's retainer?

379
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:48,759
Lord Fan,

380
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,479
is there someone else besides him?

381
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,679
He is the only one.

382
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,640
Besides him, the other names are normal.

383
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,400
Lord Fan,

384
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,959
you must be cautious.

385
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:59,696
There's dissent between you and Prince Cheng Ze.

386
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,922
If you make the crown prince your enemy now...

387
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:04,369
- You must think twice. - There's no need.

388
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,482
- I always keep my promise. - What promise?

389
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,200
This year's Spring Imperial Examination

390
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,569
must be clean.

391
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:13,434
Zi Yue, bring men from the First Bureau and surround this place.

392
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:15,879
Without my order, no one is allowed to release the results.

393
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,640
Yes.

394
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,320
- Wang Qi Nian. - Yes.

395
00:26:20,415 --> 00:26:21,882
Let's go to the Eastern Palace.

396
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,040
Your Highness, Lord Fan is visiting without an invitation.

397
00:26:48,364 --> 00:26:49,802
Why didn't you report it sooner?

398
00:26:50,097 --> 00:26:51,562
Hurry! Keep everything!

399
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,735
The silk dress you wanted is completed today.

400
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,080
It's being delivered now.

401
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,279
Who arranged that?

402
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,609
You did.

403
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,329
Lord Fan,

404
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,840
why are you in a rush to visit me?

405
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,289
Please come inside.

406
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:25,002
I see. You came here for this matter.

407
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:36,882
- This is... - I want to show them to you.

408
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:38,609
Which outfit do you like?

409
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,960
I don't know about these things.

410
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,482
Which shop made them?

411
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:43,849
I made them.

412
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,730
Your Highness?

413
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:47,599
I simply drew them

414
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,160
and got a tailor to make them for me.

415
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,999
A designer, huh?

416
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
What?

417
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,039
It's nothing.

418
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,479
Why are they covering their faces?

419
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:01,079
They don't look pretty and their temperaments don't match.

420
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,162
I understand.

421
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,160
Who is Your Highness making these dresses for?

422
00:28:16,317 --> 00:28:18,357
They are not for anyone. I was only fooling around.

423
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,215
They are good quality. It's not fooling around.

424
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,639
That's what I appreciate about you.

425
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,959
Someone else

426
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,362
might advise me to focus on state matters.

427
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:28,559
Humans should have some hobbies.

428
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,002
Oh,

429
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,122
the person who replaced

430
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,600
someone on the ranking

431
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,210
is indeed my retainer.

432
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:43,802
However, if I say this has nothing to do with me,

433
00:28:44,317 --> 00:28:46,362
- will you trust me? - Of course.

434
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,042
If Your Highness did it,

435
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,802
it wouldn't be just one person

436
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,111
and you wouldn't be against Yang Wan Li.

437
00:28:52,318 --> 00:28:53,936
It's obvious that someone tried to sow discord

438
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,210
between us.

439
00:28:55,773 --> 00:28:57,023
You are insightful.

440
00:28:58,042 --> 00:29:00,142
- Fan Xian surrounded the exam hall? - The capital is shocked.

441
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,486
- What next? - He went to the Eastern Palace after that.

442
00:29:04,462 --> 00:29:06,461
Did the crown prince tamper with the results?

443
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:07,792
The crown prince is not a fool.

444
00:29:07,884 --> 00:29:10,216
That's weird. Who would tamper with the results of the examination

445
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,360
after His Majesty's orders?

446
00:29:11,441 --> 00:29:13,570
Who else would do it apart from Cheng Ze?

447
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,809
It's unlike him.

448
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,210
It's too straightforward.

449
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,959
You can take time to investigate who did it,

450
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:22,799
but we must know how to solve this.

451
00:29:27,325 --> 00:29:28,575
He is my retainer after all.

452
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,930
Why not keep the mistake?

453
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,882
As for Yang Wan Li,

454
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,771
I'll make sure he becomes an official in one year. What do you think?

455
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:38,959
If someone informs His Majesty about this one day

456
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,095
and makes a complaint about Your Highness' cheating,

457
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,369
what will happen?

458
00:29:44,026 --> 00:29:45,746
How can you expose your weakness to others?

459
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:47,686
You are farsighted.

460
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,202
We can't endure this.

461
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,262
Not only must we not endure, we must blow it up.

462
00:29:52,286 --> 00:29:54,977
How? Are we going to inform the Overwatch Council?

463
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:58,410
This is the exam hall of the Spring Imperial Examination.

464
00:29:58,456 --> 00:30:00,016
It is the Ministry of Rites' territory.

465
00:30:01,017 --> 00:30:02,309
Now that all of you are blocking the way,

466
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,253
who will take responsibility if the result announcement is late tomorrow?

467
00:30:07,794 --> 00:30:09,853
I, Deng Zi Yue from the First Bureau of the Overwatch Council,

468
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:11,437
am willing to take this responsibility.

469
00:30:12,466 --> 00:30:13,730
When did the Overwatch Council

470
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,479
start trampling on the law of the Minister of Rites?

471
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,719
Blades are dangerous.

472
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,920
Minister, please take care of yourself.

473
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,080
I do want to see

474
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,642
how dangerous your blade is.

475
00:30:37,062 --> 00:30:38,202
Everyone,

476
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,534
the First Bureau has been observing etiquette for years

477
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:42,198
and knows all about the ways of the world

478
00:30:42,261 --> 00:30:43,682
but does the Overwatch Council

479
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,131
need to know about the ways of the world?

480
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,162
The blade in our hands

481
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,962
is not an accessory.

482
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,682
I want to see

483
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,250
how you deal with this.

484
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,002
Everyone,

485
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,522
Lord Fan is sealing the exam hall for the sake of all candidates.

486
00:31:24,743 --> 00:31:26,542
This quality is rare in this world.

487
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,842
Everything he says is true.

488
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:32,562
I was muddled in the past

489
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,282
and just drifted along.

490
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:35,769
I was

491
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,440
blind and deaf.

492
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,519
After Lord Fan came here,

493
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:44,162
the First Bureau became different.

494
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,450
I believe

495
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:48,602
the First Bureau can return to its old ways

496
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:50,864
of carrying out its duty of keeping watch over the officials

497
00:31:50,888 --> 00:31:52,602
and deter the traitors.

498
00:31:52,893 --> 00:31:54,162
Hence, I have decided

499
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:57,060
to follow Lord Fan forever.

500
00:31:57,487 --> 00:31:59,122
I hope all of you

501
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,442
can not let your uniform and the Qing Kingdom down

502
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,442
when you do things in the future!

503
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,282
For the Qing Kingdom!

504
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:11,095
They entered the palace to meet His Majesty?

505
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:12,799
Lord Fan and the crown prince?

506
00:32:12,942 --> 00:32:14,082
Indeed.

507
00:32:15,095 --> 00:32:17,453
- What for? - I heard it was for cheating in the examination.

508
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,077
This year's Spring Imperial Examination?

509
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:21,160
Lord Fan has surrounded the exam hall.

510
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,920
How do you know something like this?

511
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,640
The rumors are all over the streets.

512
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,600
Lord Fan is seeking justice for every candidate in the kingdom.

513
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,642
As expected of Lord Fan.

514
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:34,360
How did you always hear about rumors on the streets

515
00:32:34,471 --> 00:32:35,721
but I couldn't?

516
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,279
Rumors on the streets.

517
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:38,400
Who is spreading them?

518
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,800
They are rumors on the streets.

519
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,130
Who knows?

520
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,015
Cheating in the Spring Imperial Examination is serious.

521
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,600
There are already rumors so soon.

522
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:48,642
This is not right.

523
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,482
Perhaps Lord Fan did it himself?

524
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:52,685
Using the people to aid him.

525
00:32:52,775 --> 00:32:54,899
Sounds right. The rumors wouldn't spread so quickly

526
00:32:54,979 --> 00:32:56,245
if it weren't for the Overwatch Council.

527
00:32:56,269 --> 00:32:57,519
After doing that,

528
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,482
he has no choice but to move forward

529
00:32:59,955 --> 00:33:01,475
after reaching the point of no return.

530
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,482
Why do I feel like

531
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,682
all of these tricks

532
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,799
are slowly pushing him forward?

533
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:12,450
Who is pushing him and what for?

534
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,722
It's confusing.

535
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,482
I can't see it clearly.

536
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,519
Where's Eunuch Hou?

537
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:25,602
Lord Fan, he can't leave His Majesty's side.

538
00:33:25,813 --> 00:33:28,015
- What is your name? - I'm humbled to be asked my name.

539
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,239
I am Hong Zhu.

540
00:33:29,352 --> 00:33:31,320
You get to help out Eunuch Hou at your age.

541
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,920
You have a bright future ahead of you.

542
00:33:33,164 --> 00:33:34,296
It's all thanks to praise from Eunuch Dai

543
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,534
from the Vegetable Inspection Office.

544
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:36,808
Vegetable Inspection Office?

545
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,479
Eunuch Dai who paid 3,000 taels to bribe you.

546
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,239
Eunuch Dai made a mistake.

547
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,609
The palace asked him

548
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,647
who should take over the Vegetable Inspection Office

549
00:33:44,671 --> 00:33:46,111
and he said my name.

550
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,650
Wait.

551
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,559
What is your relationship with him?

552
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,880
Your Highness, we are unrelated.

553
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,080
I only picked up Eunuch Dai shoes once.

554
00:33:59,573 --> 00:34:00,823
In that case,

555
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,529
you should blame me.

556
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:04,642
- I should thank you. - What for?

557
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,360
If Eunuch Dai didn't fall,

558
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:08,682
I wouldn't get the chance to replace him.

559
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:10,816
If I didn't replace him at the Vegetable Inspection Office,

560
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,000
I would never be appreciated by Eunuch Hou.

561
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:15,802
I should thank Lord Fan after all.

562
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,760
Has anyone told you

563
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,240
that you shouldn't be so blunt when you speak in the palace?

564
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:25,279
Lord Fan, you are talented.

565
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,039
You even entered the palace for the sake of all candidates.

566
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:29,959
I'm impressed

567
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,319
and excited.

568
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,400
How did you know that I came for the sake of the candidates?

569
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,800
Lord Fan, rumors have spread about your words and actions.

570
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,079
Rumors have spread?

571
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,409
Everyone in the capital knows.

572
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:48,769
It is impressive.

573
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,680
Did you purposely spread the news?

574
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,570
What a great move.

575
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:03,840
It's nothing.

576
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:05,082
Lead the way.

577
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,119
Your Majesty.

578
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,439
His Highness requests a meeting.

579
00:35:19,463 --> 00:35:20,902
Fan Xian requests a meeting.

580
00:35:51,394 --> 00:35:54,039
- Greetings, Your Majesty. - Greetings, Your Majesty.

581
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:56,729
- Greetings, President Chen. - Greetings, President Chen.

582
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,535
If Your Majesty has something important to discuss with President Chen,

583
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:05,680
I can excuse myself.

584
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,010
There's no discussion.

585
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,800
I'm giving something to His Majesty.

586
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,090
Your Majesty,

587
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:26,200
Fan Xian has an important matter to report to you.

588
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,650
Why are you here when he has an important matter?

589
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,239
This important matter is somehow related to me.

590
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,894
Just say it.

591
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,002
Yes.

592
00:36:39,723 --> 00:36:42,563
The results of the Spring Imperial Examination have been tampered with.

593
00:36:42,706 --> 00:36:44,376
The candidate who is supposed to pass the exam

594
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,879
has been swapped with my retainer.

595
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,336
Cheating in the examination is serious.

596
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,762
Someone is obviously framing me.

597
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,250
I'm wronged.

598
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:52,929
So, I think

599
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,960
this matter should be investigated.

600
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,010
What do you think?

601
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,719
Your Majesty, I find this ridiculous.

602
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,530
Fan Xian,

603
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,079
are you in charge of watching the examination?

604
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:11,240
It is my duty.

605
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:13,877
Then, you should finish your duty.

606
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,599
The exam hall has been sealed off

607
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:17,254
and the results will be amended.

608
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:19,600
However, should I keep investigating

609
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,050
who tampered with the results?

610
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,242
What do you think?

611
00:37:27,988 --> 00:37:29,777
The Spring Imperial Examination is important to the kingdom.

612
00:37:29,801 --> 00:37:31,920
I think it should be investigated.

613
00:37:32,006 --> 00:37:33,880
- Investigate it then. - Who should do it?

614
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,210
Young people.

615
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:39,560
All of you should do more.

616
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,999
How far should we go and how ruthless can we be?

617
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,650
These are

618
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:53,123
the booklets

619
00:37:53,226 --> 00:37:56,822
that has proven cheating in the examination over the last five years.

620
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:01,042
There are no results until now. Why?

621
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:04,119
The matters have been downplayed and forgotten.

622
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,520
No one dares to investigate it

623
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,319
because the investigation result

624
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:10,642
will involve many people.

625
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,000
How deep should the matter be investigated?

626
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:16,039
How ruthless can one be in the investigation?

627
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,839
How strict can one be in the investigation?

628
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,489
They dared not.

629
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:23,839
No one has dared to investigate it until now.

630
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,799
I will be daring.

631
00:38:34,511 --> 00:38:36,551
You? You will investigate it?

632
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,559
Do you think you can handle

633
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:43,162
the investigation results?

634
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,882
I will take responsibility.

635
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:49,809
Take a look.

636
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,762
There are many booklets here.

637
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,719
It is my obligation to rectify the situation.

638
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,409
Investigate it.

639
00:39:42,669 --> 00:39:44,503
You should investigate this year's case

640
00:39:44,636 --> 00:39:46,896
but why are you investigating the cases from previous years?

641
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,359
I'm loyal.

642
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,282
I must investigate them, Your Highness.

643
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:55,459
The stage has been set and I've put my reputation on the line.

644
00:39:55,483 --> 00:39:57,639
- I can't go back now. - Are you saying

645
00:39:57,777 --> 00:39:59,757
that His Majesty and President Chen want you to investigate them?

646
00:39:59,781 --> 00:40:01,031
Do you think otherwise?

647
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,369
It's a tough job and you'll offend people.

648
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,843
Do you think I haven't offended enough people?

649
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,730
It's hard being you.

650
00:40:16,737 --> 00:40:17,882
Mother is summoning me.

651
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,882
- You should leave without me. - Sure.

652
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,280
Thank you for your reminder just now, Eunuch Hong.

653
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,282
Let's speak in private.

654
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,809
This way, please.

655
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,600
Do you have something to tell me?

656
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:01,000
What are you doing?

657
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:07,242
My surname was Chen.

658
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,482
I am from Yingzhou.

659
00:41:09,737 --> 00:41:11,257
I was persecuted by a corrupt official

660
00:41:11,653 --> 00:41:12,774
who stole my assets.

661
00:41:12,855 --> 00:41:14,105
My clan was annihilated.

662
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,122
I got lucky and survived.

663
00:41:17,487 --> 00:41:18,737
I had nowhere to go

664
00:41:19,048 --> 00:41:20,448
and was forced to enter the palace.

665
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:23,666
- Which corrupt official? - The current magistrate of Yingzhou.

666
00:41:23,886 --> 00:41:25,482
Magistrate of Yingzhou?

667
00:41:25,824 --> 00:41:27,744
You punished him.

668
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,280
His assets have been seized and he has been imprisoned.

669
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:32,142
He is sentenced to be executed immediately.

670
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:42,162
If you hadn't sought justice for me,

671
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,602
I would never get a chance

672
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:46,849
to get revenge.

673
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,122
The list was investigated by President Chen

674
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:55,520
and handled by the Censorate.

675
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:57,922
Why are you thanking me?

676
00:41:58,039 --> 00:41:59,522
I might be a fool,

677
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:01,082
but I still know

678
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:03,359
that you were the one who is pushing this, Benefactor.

679
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:13,969
There's no need.

680
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:20,042
How many people in the palace

681
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,922
know about your identity?

682
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,280
When I entered the palace,

683
00:42:23,383 --> 00:42:24,633
I registered

684
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:26,642
as a Jiaozhou resident.

685
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,722
My surname is Hong in the palace.

686
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:31,879
No one knows about my past.

687
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,760
How did you get your surname, Hong?

688
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:36,570
When I entered the palace, I met an old eunuch called Hong.

689
00:42:36,879 --> 00:42:38,402
He treated me well

690
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:40,242
so I called myself Hong as well.

691
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:50,680
Don't call me Benefactor anymore.

692
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:52,489
Understood,

693
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,130
Lord Fan.

694
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,090
What do you understand?
