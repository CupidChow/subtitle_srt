00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:30,936
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,017 --> 00:01:34,002
(Episode 19)

3
00:01:34,397 --> 00:01:36,301
You have to eat well down there, okay?

4
00:01:37,246 --> 00:01:38,806
Did you miss me?

5
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,320
You have to take good care of yourself.

6
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,559
Mother, I'm back.

7
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,105
Why are you back in the middle of the day?

8
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,282
Can't I return in the day?

9
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:04,082
(Grave of Fan Si Zhe)

10
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,370
What... What does that mean?

11
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,610
Fan Xian?

12
00:02:24,096 --> 00:02:25,221
What?

13
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,402
Is it time for me to die?

14
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:32,480
I don't even know what kind of image I have in your mind.

15
00:02:37,394 --> 00:02:39,442
Father! Father, I'm back!

16
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,370
You...

17
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,042
You still got arrested in the end, huh?

18
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,640
In the end? What does that mean?

19
00:02:56,165 --> 00:02:58,922
I knew this day would arrive eventually

20
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,282
after you said you wanted to assassinate Lord Fan.

21
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,706
Thank you, Lord Fan.

22
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,679
Thank you for sparing my son.

23
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,402
Father, the assassination is all in the past now.

24
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:15,962
Now, I'm serving him.

25
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,889
I see.

26
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,810
My son

27
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,079
is foolish and ignorant.

28
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:29,855
Lord Fan, you actually forgave his past mistakes

29
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,119
and gave him a chance.

30
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:33,007
You're truly magnanimous.

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,560
Why don't you two chat over here?

32
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,640
Okay.

33
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,000
Father, I'm a useful person.

34
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,000
I've been lurking within the capital of Northern Qi all this while.

35
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:49,199
Why did you go to Northern Qi?

36
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:52,134
I was managing the secret scouts

37
00:03:52,214 --> 00:03:54,534
and overseeing the collection of confidential information.

38
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,320
- Really? - That's right, Father.

39
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,200
My infiltration until now

40
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:04,005
has been flawless.

41
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:13,739
Northern Qi,

42
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,604
is it facing its demise?

43
00:04:15,685 --> 00:04:17,046
It's not that bad.

44
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:21,668
Father, seems like you don't trust me.

45
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,682
It's been many years, yet you still don't understand my capabilities.

46
00:04:30,096 --> 00:04:31,322
Father!

47
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,689
What's wrong?

48
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:37,002
This isn't a dream, huh?

49
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,917
I think I'm mentally exhausted.

50
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,079
How did I fall asleep and dream during the day?

51
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,170
But that's fine.

52
00:04:53,438 --> 00:04:55,159
I can see you in my dream again.

53
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,079
I'm happy about it.

54
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,440
Mother,

55
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,842
you aren't dreaming.

56
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,170
I've returned for real.

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,720
They better don't wake me up right now.

58
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,082
Mother, this isn't a dream.

59
00:05:23,776 --> 00:05:24,922
Mother,

60
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:26,882
why did you hit me?

61
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:28,976
It doesn't hurt when you're in a dream.

62
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,202
Does it hurt?

63
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,562
It does.

64
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,962
My son, you're truly back!

65
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:40,959
- This is great! - Wait.

66
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,400
It's useless for you to hit me when it's your dream, right?

67
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,575
- Let me pinch you. - Don't!

68
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,722
- Mother, that hurts. - One more time!

69
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,800
- Stop crying. - I'm glad that you're back.

70
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,280
I'll make something nice for you.

71
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,017
No need for that. You mustn't tell anyone else.

72
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,719
I came back in secret this time around.

73
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,460
I see.

74
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,880
Princess Yun Rui and Prince Cheng Ze are allies.

75
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,519
This is truly unexpected.

76
00:06:03,622 --> 00:06:04,821
Father,

77
00:06:04,902 --> 00:06:06,742
Prince Cheng Ze is in a dispute with Fan Xian.

78
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:09,322
He'll set him up during the Spring Imperial Examination.

79
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:11,343
Help him out.

80
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:14,622
He promised that he would release you once the event is over.

81
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,719
Mr. Guo, what are you doing?

82
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,002
Lord Fan, I want to thank you for saving my son.

83
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,442
He's not saving me. He's saving you.

84
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,599
It doesn't matter whether I get out or not.

85
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:34,502
As long as my son can survive,

86
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm willing

87
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,674
to sacrifice my life.

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,362
I'm a man of my word.

89
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:43,753
I'll definitely rescue you.

90
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,319
Lord Fan, you said

91
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,522
that Guo Zheng gave you a manual.

92
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:07,296
May I have a look?

93
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:24,334
Father, how is it?

94
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:27,280
Many of the details here listed are correct.

95
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,999
So, can Fan Xian accomplish the deed

96
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:30,703
just by following it?

97
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:36,402
However, it doesn't contain rules

98
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,239
outside of the Spring Imperial Examination.

99
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,784
If so, they must be trying to harm you.

100
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,440
Who does Guo Zheng serve?

101
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,079
Judging from what I saw in the past,

102
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,480
it didn't seem like he was serving anyone.

103
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,170
His intention is well-hidden.

104
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,359
Father, let's forget about him, then.

105
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,679
Hurry and tell Lord Fan about the other rules.

106
00:07:58,774 --> 00:08:01,015
He needs to rescue you after this.

107
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,762
There's no rush for the rules.

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,560
I have a question.

109
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,719
Lord Fan, how many of your proteges are attending the exam this time?

110
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:11,407
I don't have any proteges.

111
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,359
Not a single one?

112
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,490
I'm too young to be a mentor.

113
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,055
It's a good thing for you not to be involved with the candidates.

114
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,719
It saves you from a lot of trouble.

115
00:08:29,438 --> 00:08:32,122
Lord Fan, are you remembering something?

116
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,680
I did meet some of the candidates a few days ago.

117
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,809
Did you only meet them?

118
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,882
We had a chat

119
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,370
and drank together.

120
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,882
If so, that means they're your proteges.

121
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,479
But they don't know who I am.

122
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,840
That's not important.

123
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,719
To other people,

124
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,920
those candidates are already your proteges.

125
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:08,522
Father, forget about his proteges.

126
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,479
Even Master Zhuang Mo Han gave him all of his books.

127
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:13,280
He has inherited the literary heritage.

128
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,959
It's normal for him to have proteges.

129
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,289
Don't interrupt us.

130
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,880
Lord Fan,

131
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,200
what do you think the exam candidates hate the most during the exam?

132
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,762
Cheating and showing favoritism.

133
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,839
Your proteges represent that.

134
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,540
But Fan Xian doesn't intend to practice favoritism.

135
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:46,222
Why should we worry about it?

136
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,479
Even if he doesn't want to do certain deeds,

137
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:51,442
other people will do them on his behalf.

138
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,959
Why are they helping him out?

139
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:00,522
How did you manage to infiltrate Northern Qi?

140
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,440
Father, what has the exam got to do with Northern Qi now?

141
00:10:14,663 --> 00:10:18,482
(Fan Residence)

142
00:10:23,351 --> 00:10:25,208
Aunt Liu? Si Zhe?

143
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,522
Xian.

144
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,562
Do you guys need anything?

145
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,659
- What are you doing? - Don't stop me.

146
00:10:31,683 --> 00:10:32,820
- What's going on? - I don't know either.

147
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:35,398
- Stop messing around. Are you still competing with him? - Let me go.

148
00:10:35,422 --> 00:10:37,222
What nonsense are you talking about?

149
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:39,719
That was a long time ago. Now, we're a family.

150
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,120
I need him to do me a favor.

151
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,744
Even so, you shouldn't harm him because of it.

152
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,265
- What do you mean? - What were you doing just now?

153
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:45,799
Si Zhe is right. You're my elder.

154
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,217
If people saw that you knelt in front of me,

155
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:48,596
I'll be in huge trouble.

156
00:10:48,684 --> 00:10:51,279
There are only the three of us here. No one else saw that.

157
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,640
- I'll do it quickly! - Don't!

158
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:55,202
I talk too fast, Mother. I can't help it.

159
00:10:55,484 --> 00:10:58,010
Aunt Liu, we're a family.

160
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:01,202
There's no need to beg me. We can talk inside.

161
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,599
Let's talk inside.

162
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:03,998
Come, Mother.

163
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,362
Here, Aunt Liu.

164
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,129
Have some water.

165
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:12,553
Thank you, Xian.

166
00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:18,562
How do I put it?

167
00:11:19,775 --> 00:11:20,935
You see,

168
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:23,167
I'm getting older and older.

169
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,722
Aunt Liu, you're forever young.

170
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:27,679
You're such an eloquent child.

171
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:29,710
If only Si Zhe was as eloquent as you.

172
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,930
He was a mischievous child since young.

173
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,082
Sometimes, he does irk me.

174
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:36,042
But when I don't see him,

175
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,562
I miss him.

176
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:40,242
I don't know if it's because I owed him in my past life.

177
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,682
Aunt Liu, what are you trying to get at?

178
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,242
Can you not send him to Northern Qi again?

179
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,758
Aunt Liu, don't worry. I don't intend for Si Zhe

180
00:11:52,782 --> 00:11:54,762
to leave the capital again now that he's back.

181
00:11:55,437 --> 00:11:57,842
- Really? - You haven't asked me about it.

182
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,400
I want to go to Northern Qi.

183
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,359
But Fan Xian said you didn't need to go there again.

184
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:06,202
This doesn't concern him. I want to go there myself.

185
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,439
But why?

186
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,282
I've learned a lot from my trip to Northern Qi.

187
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,032
Although it was dangerous and harsh...

188
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,454
You shouldn't go there, then.

189
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:14,962
Mother, let me finish my words.

190
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,200
I found a reason to live.

191
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:20,398
In the past, I always stayed in the capital.

192
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:22,959
Yes. It's safe, and I don't need to fret.

193
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:24,814
But I only indulge myself in pleasures all day long.

194
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:26,239
What's the point of living?

195
00:12:27,294 --> 00:12:30,734
When I went to Northern Qi, at least I felt useful as a person.

196
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:33,722
Although I only did the Qing Kingdom a small favor,

197
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:35,402
I think that's enough.

198
00:12:36,471 --> 00:12:37,743
I don't wish to return to the past

199
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:40,559
and become the bored and insignificant Fan Si Zhe again.

200
00:12:42,725 --> 00:12:46,371
If so, are you still heading to Northern Qi? For what?

201
00:12:51,093 --> 00:12:52,343
I'll go to you.

202
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,402
Xian,

203
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,822
I heard that you're going to do business with Northern Qi

204
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:02,206
- after taking over the Imperial Treasury. - That's true.

205
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:06,095
Have you decided on a manager yet?

206
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:07,279
Not yet.

207
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:08,887
I've decided on the candidate for you.

208
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,759
Why are you trying to take this path?

209
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,239
I'm a citizen of the Qing Kingdom.

210
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:18,522
I'm just contributing to my own kingdom.

211
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,929
Any other reasons?

212
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,522
I also want to make a little profit.

213
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,242
I wish to make some money.

214
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,402
Let me ask you something.

215
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,242
Why should I choose you?

216
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,839
Why wouldn't you choose me?

217
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,242
As brothers, we should be united.

218
00:13:33,323 --> 00:13:35,135
Can you rest at ease if you leave the post to someone else?

219
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,136
- I can rest at ease if I leave it to you. - Yeah.

220
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,920
The thing is, it depends on Aunt Liu's will.

221
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,562
Mother.

222
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,680
When do you plan to leave?

223
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,842
Have you agreed to it?

224
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,202
I want to see you grow up too.

225
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,878
All right. I'll pack my belongings.

226
00:13:53,902 --> 00:13:55,482
I'll depart tomorrow morning.

227
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,009
There's no rush.

228
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:59,495
I'll hold my wedding after the Spring Imperial Examination.

229
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,360
You should attend it before leaving.

230
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,759
All right. That's great.

231
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:04,416
When's the Spring Imperial Examination?

232
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,640
This is bad. I'm nervous.

233
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,936
I couldn't sleep well last night.

234
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,576
Your snore was comparable to the sound of a cannon.

235
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,759
I was the one who couldn't sleep well.

236
00:14:12,056 --> 00:14:15,242
Ji Chang, I think I've reached a certain stage.

237
00:14:15,628 --> 00:14:17,908
When I was home, I memorized all of the books.

238
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:19,456
But I forgot half of them on my way here.

239
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,362
Now that I'm here, I forgot everything.

240
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:23,850
Sober up! The exam is nearing.

241
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,400
Where's Cheng Jia Lin?

242
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,655
He said he went to buy some flatbread.

243
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,920
He told us to go first.

244
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,120
Be careful!

245
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,360
Be careful!

246
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,296
There are so many people here.

247
00:14:32,398 --> 00:14:33,962
10,000 carps vie in the current,

248
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:36,056
- fighting for a chance to leap over the Dragon Gate! - Yeah!

249
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,461
The end of this road

250
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:40,337
represents the hope of all scholars!

251
00:14:40,795 --> 00:14:42,056
Sorry about that.

252
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:43,387
Come.

253
00:14:43,943 --> 00:14:45,997
Ji Chang, I think you slept pretty well.

254
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,614
At least you have the energy to shout.

255
00:14:48,062 --> 00:14:50,682
I became energetic from all the squeezing.

256
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:53,769
Be careful.

257
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,769
Sorry.

258
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,499
(Spring Imperial Examination Hall)

259
00:15:18,103 --> 00:15:19,353
Lord Fan.

260
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,240
Minister Guo, why are you here?

261
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:23,536
It's almost time.

262
00:15:24,134 --> 00:15:25,734
The candidates will enter the hall soon.

263
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,799
It's been tough on them.

264
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:29,400
They studied all their lives for the sake of these three days.

265
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,359
The scholars are not to leave the hall within these three days.

266
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,239
That's why they brought their blankets and food with them.

267
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:36,479
It must've been tough.

268
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,096
Since they're bringing plenty of things here,

269
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,016
that means they have a better opportunity to smuggle cheat sheets as well.

270
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,521
Lord Fan, you're in charge of the inspection.

271
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,120
This first hurdle is of utmost importance.

272
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,599
I'm quite worried about it.

273
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,929
I came here to take a look

274
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,922
so that you wouldn't overlook any mistakes.

275
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,602
Minister Guo, you're truly a nice person.

276
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,819
It's only natural

277
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,120
to nurture younger generations, don't you think?

278
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,800
You're getting your portraits drawn again?

279
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,642
We're running out of time.

280
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,919
I have to get it commemorated as quickly as possible.

281
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:13,176
Don't worry. I've already checked the rule book.

282
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,400
It doesn't go against the law

283
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,802
or break the rules.

284
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,416
Minister Guo, you do obey the rules, huh?

285
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,690
I'm an educated individual.

286
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,049
I know my limits.

287
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,362
Minister Guo, is this...

288
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:26,522
This is a work log.

289
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:31,116
Minister Guo, you should do it like this.

290
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:33,239
- It shows more power. - Is that so?

291
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,570
It's more powerful.

292
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,671
Your emotion! That's important.

293
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:52,808
Look at the time.

294
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,391
Why aren't the candidates here yet?

295
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:57,282
Lord Fan, you may not know,

296
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,391
but according to the established customs,

297
00:16:59,472 --> 00:17:03,359
the candidates are busy crossing the Dragon Gate Bridge at this moment.

298
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,690
Dragon Gate Bridge?

299
00:17:11,294 --> 00:17:13,013
I'll surely pass the exam!

300
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:16,322
I crossed the Dragon Gate Bridge!

301
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:18,385
I crossed the Dragon Gate Bridge!

302
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,545
We'll surely pass the exam after crossing the bridge!

303
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,722
We've arrived!

304
00:17:45,015 --> 00:17:47,215
We've arrived!

305
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:58,882
- There are so many people here. - Yeah.

306
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,202
Here they come.

307
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,360
Good morning, everyone.

308
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,849
I'm Fan Xian.

309
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,362
That's Poetic Genius Fan.

310
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,514
He's the future grandmaster of the literary world.

311
00:18:38,538 --> 00:18:39,788
That's right.

312
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,319
Let me take a look.

313
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:44,775
That's the grandmaster of the literary world.

314
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,202
It's rare to see him.

315
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,999
- Today's the Spring Imperial Examination. - That's right.

316
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,242
Here, I have some wishes for you guys.

317
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,376
May you all carry the golden key to the treasury of wisdom,

318
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,999
with a mind full of ten thousand books,

319
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:58,306
wear the halo of confidence,

320
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,815
ride the skateboard of good fortune,

321
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,319
set sail with full confidence, and sail towards the heights...

322
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,002
I mean, sail toward the shore of success.

323
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,710
You guys can do this.

324
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,089
Rise up!

325
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,282
Now that I'm done with the wishes,

326
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,482
I have something unpleasant to say as well.

327
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,559
For this exam, I shall be inspecting you all.

328
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,522
If any of you brought something that you weren't supposed to,

329
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,039
please leave them here before entering the hall.

330
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,320
If we find such items on you after you enter the hall,

331
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:33,349
your qualifications will be canceled.

332
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,029
There's no room for negotiation.

333
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:38,551
I hereby implore you all to do so.

334
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:42,695
Lord Fan gave us the message.

335
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,719
We cannot bring cheat sheets into the exam hall.

336
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,562
Yeah. It'll affect our future.

337
00:19:50,843 --> 00:19:52,362
Let's take them out, then.

338
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:22,872
Go now.

339
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:25,727
Queue over there. One by one.

340
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,082
Prepare your documents for us to confirm your identity.

341
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,458
All right.

342
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,522
This is yours. Here you go.

343
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,849
Next.

344
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:35,272
Over here.

345
00:20:36,312 --> 00:20:37,682
Queue over here.

346
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:40,610
Who brought the cheat sheets here?

347
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:41,815
All right now. Just take them out.

348
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,239
It'll be terrible if they find out.

349
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,882
You, show me your bag.

350
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,480
Minister Guo, how could you just stand all the time?

351
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:49,474
- Get him a chair. - No need for that.

352
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,522
He needs to draw another portrait if I change my pose.

353
00:20:52,603 --> 00:20:53,853
One by one.

354
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,202
Lord Fan, you may proceed.

355
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,499
I'll leave once I'm done.

356
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,922
Thank you, Minister Guo.

357
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,519
It's my duty.

358
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,407
Inspect everything thoroughly.

359
00:21:03,488 --> 00:21:04,648
Okay.

360
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,049
Okay. Next.

361
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,602
Here you go. You may go.

362
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:11,762
Come and queue up.

363
00:21:11,843 --> 00:21:13,512
- One by one. - Where are Ji Chang and Jia Lin?

364
00:21:13,536 --> 00:21:14,626
I think they're in front.

365
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,970
They won't get lost.

366
00:21:16,102 --> 00:21:17,352
Let's go inside.

367
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,682
I wonder where's Lord Fan.

368
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,009
Next.

369
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,202
Coming.

370
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,802
Come. Leave your belongings here.

371
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,359
Someone did try to smuggle their cheat sheets.

372
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,120
Were we too late?

373
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,840
Is that why we don't get to see Lord Fan?

374
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,599
We'll see him once we enter the hall.

375
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:45,637
My Lord!

376
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:47,322
My Lord, I know my fault now!

377
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,802
- My Lord! - Hurry!

378
00:21:50,088 --> 00:21:52,907
- Leave! - My Lord, I know my fault now!

379
00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:54,238
My Lord!

380
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,805
My Lord, I know my fault now!

381
00:21:56,886 --> 00:21:58,082
My Lord!

382
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:01,079
I'm sure he smuggled cheat sheets into the hall too.

383
00:22:01,368 --> 00:22:03,522
Shameless fool. You deserve it.

384
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:05,403
All those years of studying were for nothing.

385
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,239
It'll be our turn soon.

386
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,806
I heard that Lord Fan would inspect our belongings personally.

387
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:11,522
Say, since he's a poetic genius,

388
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:13,482
what do you think he looks like?

389
00:22:14,737 --> 00:22:17,202
Please give me another chance!

390
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,842
My Lord!

391
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:22,200
I know my fault now!

392
00:22:23,513 --> 00:22:24,763
Turn around.

393
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,522
Okay. Over here.

394
00:22:30,543 --> 00:22:31,962
Leave your blanket here.

395
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,202
- Move forward. - Excuse me.

396
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,842
Who's that person sitting over there?

397
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,559
Don't you even recognize Lord Fan Xian?

398
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,120
Is he Fan Xian?

399
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,642
Do not raise your voice.

400
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,863
- Turn around. - Are my eyes playing tricks on me?

401
00:22:50,887 --> 00:22:52,847
Isn't he the guy who had a chat with us?

402
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,242
He's actually Poetic Genius Fan?

403
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,522
It's him indeed.

404
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:11,888
Go now.

405
00:23:12,047 --> 00:23:13,162
Next.

406
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,722
What is this?

407
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:31,602
Vegetable flatbread.

408
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:43,122
My Lord, there's a note inside.

409
00:23:43,768 --> 00:23:45,122
How could that be...

410
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,690
Go over there!

411
00:23:47,353 --> 00:23:48,755
I didn't bring any cheat sheets!

412
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:03,162
What is this, then?

413
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:04,856
He's pretty bold, isn't he?

414
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,282
Does he not want to take the exam?

415
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,522
My Lord,

416
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,322
I have no idea.

417
00:24:11,495 --> 00:24:12,735
I truly...

418
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,239
I truly have no idea about this.

419
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:16,255
I can testify for him! Wan Li is an extraordinary talent!

420
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,958
He would never commit such a deed!

421
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,239
What's your name?

422
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,569
Where do you come from?

423
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,130
I'm Yang Wan Li.

424
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,840
I come from Quanzhou.

425
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,170
Yang Wan Li?

426
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,442
That's right.

427
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,802
Lord Fan,

428
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:35,600
isn't he your protege?

429
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,882
Fan Xian met them before?

430
00:24:38,326 --> 00:24:39,802
Seems like these four candidates

431
00:24:39,883 --> 00:24:42,042
are regarded highly by Fan Xian.

432
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:44,442
We'll start with them.

433
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,482
Do away with all four of them.

434
00:24:48,961 --> 00:24:50,722
That's going too far.

435
00:24:51,469 --> 00:24:52,719
Pick one.

436
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,569
Yang Wan Li.

437
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,082
Lord Fan's protege?

438
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:04,809
I'm not!

439
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:08,120
What should we do?

440
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:16,809
In my opinion,

441
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,897
the Spring Imperial Examination should be clean and fair.

442
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:22,171
It has to be fair.

443
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,042
If so, should we follow the rules?

444
00:25:30,974 --> 00:25:32,562
- All right. - Okay.

445
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:37,718
Rescind the qualifications of Yang Wan Li, a student from Quanzhou.

446
00:25:37,814 --> 00:25:38,872
Chase him out of the exam hall.

447
00:25:38,896 --> 00:25:40,976
Ministry of Rites, record this. He shall never be recruited!

448
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,160
I didn't prepare that.

449
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,400
I didn't prepare that!

450
00:25:43,495 --> 00:25:44,745
I didn't prepare that!

451
00:25:44,873 --> 00:25:46,242
I didn't prepare that!

452
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,362
Minister Guo, please pardon me!

453
00:25:51,189 --> 00:25:52,562
Pardon you for what?

454
00:25:53,022 --> 00:25:54,143
Minister Guo,

455
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,682
I stuffed the note inside in secret just now.

456
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:02,380
You stuffed the note inside?

457
00:26:02,483 --> 00:26:04,522
- That's right. - But why?

458
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,682
I was never born to study. I had no future.

459
00:26:08,763 --> 00:26:10,082
It felt unfair to me.

460
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:11,983
That's why I wanted to trick a candidate for fun.

461
00:26:12,007 --> 00:26:13,487
For fun?

462
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,999
You want to trick him?

463
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,360
I'm evil and devious.

464
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,599
If so, why are you confessing to your crime, then?

465
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,602
He looked pitiful.

466
00:26:21,975 --> 00:26:23,271
I suddenly had a change of heart.

467
00:26:23,295 --> 00:26:25,055
That's pure nonsense.

468
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,450
Minister Guo, I'm speaking the truth.

469
00:26:28,512 --> 00:26:29,912
Who'll believe something like that?

470
00:26:29,975 --> 00:26:31,225
Minister Guo,

471
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:32,962
don't be angry.

472
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,602
You're not young anymore.

473
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,082
Your health will be affected.

474
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:42,222
- I'm ashamed. - Shut up for now.

475
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,442
All right.

476
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,402
Lord Fan, Wan Li is not a person like that.

477
00:26:48,768 --> 00:26:49,962
Minister Guo,

478
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:52,522
I don't know about the rules within the Ministry of Rites.

479
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,162
- May I ask you something? - Ask away.

480
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:58,360
Just now, you said that you wanted to kick him out of the exam hall.

481
00:26:58,473 --> 00:26:59,616
You wanted the Ministry of Rites to record it, right?

482
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,890
Indeed.

483
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,562
If so, that's quite a harsh punishment.

484
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,682
What crime has he committed, then?

485
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:07,456
He smuggled cheat sheets into the exam hall.

486
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,959
That shows his poor character.

487
00:27:09,068 --> 00:27:10,962
- Where's the cheat sheet, then? - This...

488
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,959
Lord Fan, everyone saw it.

489
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,118
- I did that. - Shut up.

490
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:17,202
- All right. - You were referring to this?

491
00:27:17,525 --> 00:27:19,558
If you want to press charges against him, this is considered evidence.

492
00:27:19,582 --> 00:27:20,832
Why don't we open it

493
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,279
and see what it is?

494
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,665
Of course. We have to.

495
00:27:25,086 --> 00:27:26,336
I wish to read it too.

496
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:29,440
I wonder what's inside.

497
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,880
Meat flatbread, two qian per piece.

498
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,716
Flatbread, half a qian per piece.

499
00:27:36,797 --> 00:27:38,282
Vegetable flatbread...

500
00:27:40,471 --> 00:27:42,191
These are just the prices of the flatbread.

501
00:27:43,007 --> 00:27:46,242
Are the prices of the flatbread determined by the sages as well?

502
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,482
I thought it was a cheat sheet.

503
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,540
The menu is pretty complete.

504
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:54,850
They also sell preserved vegetables.

505
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:56,124
This is...

506
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,560
Since it's just the price,

507
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,817
why did you hide it in the basket?

508
00:27:58,841 --> 00:27:59,920
What's inside the basket?

509
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,522
Vegetable flatbread...

510
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:06,999
If so, is it possible

511
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,762
that the shopkeeper put it inside by accident?

512
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,322
Or, maybe I was mistaken.

513
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:16,802
Maybe the sages did say

514
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:20,482
that meat flatbread costs two qian per piece, huh?

515
00:28:20,671 --> 00:28:22,511
Minister Guo, why don't you check the records?

516
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:32,642
You shouldn't have oily food for all three meals.

517
00:28:33,263 --> 00:28:34,783
You should have some normal flatbread.

518
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,650
Yes, My Lord.

519
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,210
I'll remember your words.

520
00:28:40,316 --> 00:28:42,162
Go inside now.

521
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:44,602
Let's go!

522
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:53,920
What's your deal?

523
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,439
- My Lord, I slept too much. - Nonsense!

524
00:28:56,597 --> 00:28:58,120
The exam inspection is a major event!

525
00:28:58,292 --> 00:28:59,430
I'll deduct your salary for one month!

526
00:28:59,454 --> 00:29:00,934
Yes, My Lord. I accept my punishment.

527
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,122
Minister Guo, what do you think?

528
00:29:05,271 --> 00:29:06,521
Lord Fan,

529
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,400
please tend to the affairs here.

530
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,671
I still need to check the exam papers.

531
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:14,171
I'm exhausted. I have no time to be idle.

532
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,602
I have no time to be idle.

533
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:17,322
Thank you, Minister Guo.

534
00:29:17,403 --> 00:29:19,242
Farewell, Minister Guo.

535
00:29:39,926 --> 00:29:43,442
- Who taught you to do that? - My Lord, I serve Chancellor Lin.

536
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,759
It was Chancellor Lin's will.

537
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:49,056
I'll be your scapegoat if anything happens during the exam.

538
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,442
What about your life?

539
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,849
This is my duty.

540
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,009
Relay my message to Uncle.

541
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,959
Tell him that I appreciate his protection.

542
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,559
However, I'll deal with the exam myself.

543
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:16,519
My Lord,

544
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:20,279
out of the four scholars Deng Zi Yue was protecting,

545
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,456
only Yang Wan Li was accused of smuggling cheat sheets.

546
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,730
Who did it?

547
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,289
Xie Bi An.

548
00:30:25,454 --> 00:30:26,704
I'm correct, then.

549
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,762
Guo Zheng serves Prince Cheng Ze.

550
00:30:30,575 --> 00:30:33,242
I became energetic from all the squeezing.

551
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,250
Stop squeezing!

552
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,329
Sorry about that!

553
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,519
Stop squeezing!

554
00:30:42,622 --> 00:30:43,872
Be careful!

555
00:30:44,704 --> 00:30:48,002
Guo Zheng is pretty vicious himself.

556
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,569
This is only the beginning.

557
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,042
The exam will last for three days.

558
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:55,239
Let's have some fun with Minister Guo.

559
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:27,686
Everyone,

560
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:31,006
the exam is more than just a test of your knowledge.

561
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,962
It's also a test of your character.

562
00:31:33,043 --> 00:31:34,293
I wish you all

563
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,162
a promising future.

564
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:37,583
I also advise you guys

565
00:31:38,108 --> 00:31:39,602
to behave yourselves.

566
00:31:54,478 --> 00:31:55,728
It's time.

567
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,042
Where's Cheng Jia Lin?

568
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,970
He's in East Two.

569
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,642
Stop.

570
00:34:00,193 --> 00:34:01,768
- What are you guys doing? - My Lord.

571
00:34:02,035 --> 00:34:03,562
It's time to distribute the candles.

572
00:34:18,196 --> 00:34:21,036
Lord Fan, you have a great reputation,

573
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:22,762
and you have all the power in the world.

574
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,719
Trivial affairs won't affect you much.

575
00:34:27,975 --> 00:34:30,322
If they want to ruin your reputation,

576
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:32,162
they have to stir up huge trouble.

577
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,882
And, the first thing they'll do

578
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:36,322
is related to fire.

579
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:41,727
The Ministry of Rites will distribute candles to all candidates.

580
00:34:42,117 --> 00:34:45,844
In terms of responsibility, this must be handled by you.

581
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,522
All of the candidates are cramped together.

582
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,439
If they tamper with the candles,

583
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:52,962
what do you think will happen?

584
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,800
A fire will start.

585
00:34:55,935 --> 00:34:58,150
What if thousands of rooms are on fire at the same time?

586
00:34:58,174 --> 00:35:01,042
It may turn into a tragedy.

587
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,120
If they wish to ruin your future,

588
00:35:04,111 --> 00:35:06,351
this is what they have to resort to.

589
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,210
I smell kerosene.

590
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,730
Don't distribute them for now.

591
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:11,889
Don't distribute them.

592
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,040
Fire prevention is of utmost importance

593
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,802
in the inspection of the exam hall.

594
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,319
However, in this manual,

595
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,080
Guo Zheng just brushed things off.

596
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,439
I predict

597
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:28,200
that this is the trap he set for you.

598
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:43,301
Are these candles doused with kerosene too?

599
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:50,111
My Lord,

600
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:52,485
the candles are doused with kerosene.

601
00:35:52,566 --> 00:35:55,286
But even if they're lit, they'll only produce some sparks.

602
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,360
Such sparks

603
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,999
shouldn't cause any major fire.

604
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,110
You're wrong.

605
00:36:01,191 --> 00:36:03,952
What if the candidates weren't tending to the candle while they rest?

606
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,170
You do have a point.

607
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:09,360
Think about it. Why do the candidates need the candles?

608
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:12,039
It's because the exam hall is dark.

609
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,240
They use the candles

610
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,999
to illuminate their exam papers.

611
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,079
That's right.

612
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:18,639
The fire doesn't need to be huge.

613
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,519
It's already a huge deal if the exam papers were burned because of it.

614
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,482
That's a huge deal indeed.

615
00:36:24,654 --> 00:36:26,974
Did you guys hear that? This batch of candles is unusable.

616
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,680
But My Lord, where can we get this many candles out of the blue?

617
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,439
For the next three days,

618
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:58,080
the Overwatch Council will supply the exam hall with candles.

619
00:36:58,454 --> 00:37:00,522
And, please deliver this

620
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:04,640
to Minister Guo.

621
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:11,434
Thank you.

622
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:27,416
Record this in the inventory record? What does this mean?

623
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,922
The Overwatch Council said...

624
00:37:29,265 --> 00:37:30,722
The Overwatch Council

625
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,042
is providing candles to the candidates.

626
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,799
We're doing a good deed here.

627
00:37:37,596 --> 00:37:39,922
However, when it comes to business...

628
00:37:40,095 --> 00:37:41,935
No, I mean,

629
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:44,442
officialdom is officialdom.

630
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,719
Most importantly, we have to obey the rules.

631
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:51,803
The Ministry of Rites was supposed to manage the exam.

632
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:53,599
If so, the cost of these candles

633
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:56,000
should also be borne by the Ministry of Rites.

634
00:37:56,696 --> 00:37:57,946
Of course,

635
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:00,748
since we're doing a good deed here,

636
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:04,616
I can give you a 10% discount for the candles.

637
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:06,400
Officialdom is officialdom?

638
00:38:06,526 --> 00:38:07,882
What kind of phrase is that?

639
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,815
Besides, why is the Overwatch Council

640
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,215
interfering with the candle supply?

641
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:13,042
Didn't we have our own candles?

642
00:38:13,654 --> 00:38:15,774
Lord Fan has a message for you.

643
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,039
Minister Guo,

644
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,856
I was suddenly inspired for the past few days.

645
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,079
When I did divination,

646
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,522
guess what happened?

647
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,265
It foretold that a firestorm would happen. That's inauspicious.

648
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:25,682
Therefore, I thought to myself

649
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,642
that I should swap out all of the candles.

650
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,984
I should use the ones from the Overwatch Council.

651
00:38:29,008 --> 00:38:30,249
If anything happens,

652
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,042
I'll bear all of the responsibilities.

653
00:38:32,447 --> 00:38:34,806
Of course, if you're not willing,

654
00:38:34,887 --> 00:38:37,530
we can inspect the candles provided by your ministry again.

655
00:38:37,656 --> 00:38:39,737
If nothing's wrong with them, we can use them again.

656
00:38:39,832 --> 00:38:41,351
Is it okay?

657
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:43,263
The divination part

658
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,399
was kind of a joke.

659
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:48,365
Besides, usually, people say "A bloody storm would happen."

660
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:50,200
A firestorm doesn't exist.

661
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,160
My Lord, why don't we follow Lord Fan's instruction

662
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,040
and inspect our candles again?

663
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:58,080
Lord Fan is just concerned about national affairs.

664
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,399
At least his intention was good.

665
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,282
I guess we can use the candles

666
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,090
that they provide.

667
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,799
But we have to pay for them.

668
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:09,857
Pay them, then.

669
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:12,125
Wait.

670
00:39:17,047 --> 00:39:19,322
Didn't they agree to give us a 10% discount?

671
00:39:19,768 --> 00:39:21,728
Why is it more expensive than its original price?

672
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,882
Don't forget about the delivery fee.

673
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:32,600
We can't afford to delay the exam.

674
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,722
Just follow their instructions.

675
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:40,431
Here. This is yours.

676
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:41,999
- Thank you. - Be careful with it.

677
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:43,199
- Keep it properly. - Okay.

678
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:45,095
- Be careful with it. This is yours. - Thank you.

679
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,539
- Thank you. - Be careful with it.

680
00:39:46,563 --> 00:39:47,722
Thank you.

681
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,159
Be careful with it. Here.

682
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:52,602
- Here you go. Be careful with it. - Okay.

683
00:39:52,951 --> 00:39:54,751
- Be careful. - Okay.

684
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,929
- Thank you. - Thank you.

685
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,559
Besides the fire issue,

686
00:40:05,662 --> 00:40:06,912
there's also a water issue.

687
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,682
The water in the exam hall is prepared for the candidates.

688
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,562
It serves as drinking water, and it's also used to put out fires.

689
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
If something's wrong with the water,

690
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:21,759
all of the candidates will be affected.

691
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,642
My Lord.

692
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:30,482
- Is the water poisoned? - It's not that bad.

693
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:32,039
I'm glad to hear that.

694
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:33,559
The water has almost gone bad.

695
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,889
It won't last for three days.

696
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,575
My Lord, we've brought the water tanks

697
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:38,416
from the First Bureau here as per your instruction.

698
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,690
Change all of them.

699
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,889
Tread lightly.

700
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,655
This time, don't charge them for the delivery fee.

701
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:45,929
Yes, My Lord.

702
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:53,202
My Lord,

703
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:55,115
shouldn't we try to blow up

704
00:40:55,248 --> 00:40:56,928
the issue with the tampered candles?

705
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,962
The candles were only doused with kerosene.

706
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:01,642
It's not a huge deal yet.

707
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,042
It'll only be a huge deal when there's a fire.

708
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,239
But if a fire does break out,

709
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:08,682
everything will be done for.

710
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,050
Indeed.

711
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:12,439
But have they never considered

712
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:15,202
the lives of all these scholars here?

713
00:41:16,623 --> 00:41:18,002
What do you think?

714
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,962
I'm truly perplexed.

715
00:41:21,232 --> 00:41:23,849
How could they talk about being parental officials, then?

716
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,180
Parental officials, my foot!

717
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:27,882
Initially, I thought I was already ruthless enough.

718
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,402
I never expected them to leave me in awe.

719
00:41:30,729 --> 00:41:32,296
It's better for such tall-standing officials

720
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,762
to collapse.

721
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:37,322
Think again. What other oversights are there?

722
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,640
We've resolved the issues with both fire and water.

723
00:41:41,768 --> 00:41:43,442
Food, clothing, housing, transportation,

724
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:45,442
eating, drinking, defecating, and urinating?

725
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:46,962
The food and drinks

726
00:41:47,143 --> 00:41:48,943
are brought here by the candidates themselves.

727
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:51,406
They can't just tamper with them one by one.

728
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:31,809
Where are they going?

729
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,479
He's going to poop.

730
00:42:33,566 --> 00:42:34,816
They're heading to the loo.

731
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:37,279
Isn't there a toilet in each compartment?

732
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:39,639
We did use that in the past.

733
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:42,039
However, the exam lasts for three days.

734
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,940
The terrible stench will affect the candidates.

735
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:47,319
After that, we switched to using the loo outside.

736
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,802
That's the one thing we cannot avoid.
