00:01:24,922 --> 00:01:30,903
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:30,984 --> 00:01:33,967
(Episode 36)

3
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:36,836
Doing something like this before informing,

4
00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:38,602
I'm afraid

5
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,760
Father will get mad.

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,510
We mustn't be worried if we want to be successful.

7
00:01:45,527 --> 00:01:47,482
I'm not optimistic about this path.

8
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,362
I'll pretend that I know

9
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:51,801
and hear nothing.

10
00:01:52,662 --> 00:01:54,242
I won't even report it

11
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:55,762
and inform Father about it.

12
00:01:59,654 --> 00:02:00,802
Thank you.

13
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,590
However, I'm not optimistic about this.

14
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,162
- What about you?   - Me too.

15
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,560
You're not optimistic as well?

16
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,762
Yes.

17
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,790
This path of mine

18
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,230
might seem like it hurts the royal family and benefits the people.

19
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,190
He's a part of the royal family.

20
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,070
It's normal that he is not optimistic about it.

21
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:22,341
Why don't you feel optimistic about it?

22
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,840
I don't really understand

23
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,389
what you say,

24
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,040
but I believe your choice

25
00:02:30,135 --> 00:02:31,415
is surely correct.

26
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:33,202
Why do you still feel not optimistic about it?

27
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,430
However, right or wrong is not important

28
00:02:35,605 --> 00:02:36,885
in this world most of the time.

29
00:02:37,797 --> 00:02:40,318
The path you take will affect the benefit of too many people.

30
00:02:40,857 --> 00:02:42,402
If you continue on this path,

31
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,239
I'm afraid you might get enemies and obstacles everywhere.

32
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,180
Many people often say

33
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,442
right or wrong isn't important.

34
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,630
However, if they are forever not important

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,230
and no one tries to make a change,

36
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,999
the fire of the Three Great Workshops and Shijia Town

37
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,149
will never be extinguished.

38
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:05,904
Teacher. Although I'm not optimistic about this path,

39
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,562
I'm willing to walk it with you.

40
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:09,146
I won't regret it

41
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,560
even if I sacrifice myself.

42
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,400
I think the same as him.

43
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,579
Do you really think so?

44
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,122
I knew you were crazy, but I didn't know you were that crazy.

45
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,949
You even brought a prince along with you.

46
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,815
- Were you eavesdropping?   - I didn't do it on purpose.

47
00:03:27,852 --> 00:03:29,132
Teacher,

48
00:03:29,253 --> 00:03:31,043
we'll be leaving.

49
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,919
Let's go. You haven't played.

50
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,082
Sit.

51
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:42,402
Why are you looking for me?

52
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:45,743
I came to take a look.

53
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,750
I'm afraid that Yun Zhi Lan might return.

54
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:50,402
- Thanks.   - No need.

55
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,870
With the path you're taking,

56
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:55,080
there might even be a thousand people who are trying to kill you.

57
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:56,599
Yun Zhi Lan alone is not important now.

58
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,510
So, I need to trouble you to stay in Jiangnan longer.

59
00:04:00,394 --> 00:04:02,755
With your ability, the other ninth-ranked experts

60
00:04:02,836 --> 00:04:04,756
might not be able to kill you except for the grandmaster.

61
00:04:08,144 --> 00:04:09,463
After I was stabbed at Xuankong Temple,

62
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:10,720
my internal energy burst my meridians

63
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,080
and it dispersed in the body.

64
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,380
I haven't recovered until now.

65
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:15,909
That was why I need you.

66
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,080
You are finally going to admit it.

67
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:18,510
I wasn't planning to hide it.

68
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:21,722
That was not what you wrote in the letter.

69
00:04:21,935 --> 00:04:23,826
Many people could see the letter.

70
00:04:23,943 --> 00:04:25,288
Some things can only be said face to face.

71
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,896
Why didn't you just hide it from me as well?

72
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,429
I don't feel it's right.

73
00:04:28,591 --> 00:04:29,753
Why?

74
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,400
I see you as a friend.

75
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,682
We've only met a few times.

76
00:04:39,263 --> 00:04:42,122
Well, it's strange between people.

77
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:43,878
Some people have known each other for their whole lives,

78
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,999
but they aren't close.

79
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,560
Some people only met once, but they can trust them with their lives.

80
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,350
Don't find it corny.

81
00:04:51,703 --> 00:04:54,012
I've met many people in my life,

82
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,869
but I only have a few who I can call friends.

83
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,440
You are one of them.

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,280
It's corny indeed.

85
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:06,202
I think so too. I won't say it again.

86
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,359
So, you wanted Heaven's Path

87
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:10,922
to reconstruct your internal energy.

88
00:05:11,942 --> 00:05:13,622
I'll try everything in this desperate situation.

89
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,679
Bring that here.

90
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:30,614
What are you doing?

91
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,642
Grind the ink.

92
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,442
Keep grinding. Don't stop.

93
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,562
(Heaven's Path)

94
00:05:55,943 --> 00:05:57,223
What did you change?

95
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:00,402
Master did something to it.

96
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:02,235
This manual is fake?

97
00:06:02,316 --> 00:06:04,157
It's not completely fake. Most of it is real.

98
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,628
Only a few parts were amended.

99
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:09,680
What will happen if I practice with this amended manual?

100
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:10,882
You can still reconstruct your internal energy,

101
00:06:10,963 --> 00:06:12,362
but you won't achieve the ninth rank.

102
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,962
You might become a retard.

103
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,669
How evil!

104
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,842
Didn't Ku He say this was from my mother?

105
00:06:19,923 --> 00:06:22,280
- Yes.   - Why did he amend it when it was supposed to be mine?

106
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,396
You are an important official of the Qing Kingdom after all.

107
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:25,756
You should understand.

108
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,679
Hold on. You knew about this.

109
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:31,122
- Of course.   - Why didn't you remind me about it?

110
00:06:31,784 --> 00:06:33,522
Trust is mutual.

111
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,802
How could I be honest if you weren't being honest with me?

112
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,639
You knew there was something wrong with my internal energy?

113
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:39,052
You wrote to me asking for the manual.

114
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,699
Even a fool could guess that you were met with an accident.

115
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,442
If you hid the truth from me,

116
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,749
you deserved to become a retard.

117
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,522
Were you going to be so cruel?

118
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:51,246
With our identities,

119
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,189
our friendship is a heavy burden.

120
00:06:56,294 --> 00:06:57,882
If you restore this,

121
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,239
how will you explain it to Ku He?

122
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:02,252
I don't need to. A disciple doesn't need to obey her master outside.

123
00:07:05,797 --> 00:07:06,922
Thank you.

124
00:07:07,147 --> 00:07:08,882
There are many kind people in this world indeed.

125
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,630
How corny.

126
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,119
Give me the brush.

127
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,919
- What?   - Let me paint you a drawing.

128
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,679
What drawing?

129
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,362
The Overwhelming Internal Energy Manual I gave you previously

130
00:07:24,774 --> 00:07:26,402
was lacking a few paintings.

131
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,109
If you practice it, you might bleed to death.

132
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:39,429
When will the people of the world stop scheming against each other?

133
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,239
Both of us should work hard together.

134
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,549
Lord Fan, look who's here.

135
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:10,372
Deng Zi Yue from the First Bureau of the Overwatch Council

136
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:12,122
greets you, Chief Inspector.

137
00:08:12,364 --> 00:08:14,922
Zi Yue, we've known each other for so long. Stop doing this.

138
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:17,421
- Sit down.   - It's the rules.

139
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,359
Qi Nian.

140
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,202
Where's your mustache?

141
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,762
I came to Jiangnan to investigate the Ming family

142
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,480
on Lord Fan's order.

143
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,719
I think a spy

144
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:35,282
should change his appearance completely.

145
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:37,842
Here. Have a drink.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,280
Thank you, Qi Nian.

147
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:40,648
I should brief you first.

148
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,140
After I obeyed Lord Fan's orders

149
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,920
and came to Jiangnan pretending to be a victim,

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,989
I was bought by the Ming family.

151
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,029
However, they were very suspicious.

152
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,430
I was doing labor the first month.

153
00:08:51,936 --> 00:08:54,166
I figured they were probably investigating my background.

154
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:57,909
Your identity was created by the First Bureau and the Fourth Bureau.

155
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,710
There wouldn't be any flaws, right?

156
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,400
Indeed.

157
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,602
During my second month,

158
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:05,278
they were more relaxed.

159
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,880
I found an opportunity

160
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:08,790
to show my bookkeeping skills.

161
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,959
They started to accept me.

162
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,120
Finally,

163
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,480
I entered the Three Great Workshops.

164
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,280
That means the Three Great Workshops still exists.

165
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,640
Of course.

166
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,880
Lord Fan, the Ming family moved the Three Great Workshops' warehouse

167
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,440
with its supervisors and craftsmen

168
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:27,172
outside the city in secret.

169
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,122
They substituted the whole place indeed.

170
00:09:30,997 --> 00:09:33,028
So many lives were lost as well.

171
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,919
Lord Fan, look.

172
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:37,765
This is the warehouse's current position.

173
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,559
Lord Fan,

174
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,070
I think

175
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,839
the Ming family set fire and massacred the people.

176
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,199
They committed serious crimes.

177
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,109
They should be punished according to the law.

178
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,442
We must deal with the Ming family

179
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,839
but not now.

180
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:56,000
Not only do we need to consider the Ming family

181
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,670
but also the uncertainty of Jiangnan's future for decades to come.

182
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:04,202
Lord Fan, what should I do next?

183
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,989
Did someone notice you

184
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,446
when you left the warehouse?

185
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,679
Rush back overnight

186
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,149
and pretend that nothing happened.

187
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,319
Since we've planted a spy,

188
00:10:14,422 --> 00:10:15,962
you should keep hiding.

189
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,629
We still don't know what other variables

190
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,710
will appear in this Three Great Workshops play.

191
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,642
Yes.

192
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,640
Qi Nian.

193
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,162
Protect Lord Fan well.

194
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,559
Don't worry.

195
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,842
Zi Yue,

196
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,789
you must protect yourself well.

197
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,602
Go.

198
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,199
Please stay here.

199
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,362
Did Shadow appear later?

200
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,029
After fighting Yun Zhi Lan that day,

201
00:10:58,255 --> 00:10:59,725
he has never appeared anymore.

202
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,199
Forget him.

203
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,880
Both of us will leave the city

204
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,270
and capture the Three Great Workshops.

205
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,362
Well,

206
00:11:10,623 --> 00:11:13,132
you lost your internal energy, right?

207
00:11:13,383 --> 00:11:15,772
Meanwhile, I'm only good at running.

208
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:19,442
Why don't we call Miss Duo Duo as well?

209
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,839
She can't come with us.

210
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,389
She is the Saintess of Northern Qi.

211
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:24,679
If she's around when I capture the Three Great Workshops,

212
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:26,095
someone will make a big deal out of it.

213
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,190
Qi Nian, we are the only ones who can do this at this crucial moment.

214
00:11:34,605 --> 00:11:36,882
I'll listen to you.

215
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,240
Fan Xian rode a horse and left the city?

216
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:54,660
A report that was sent recently.

217
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,842
The direction he headed in after leaving the city

218
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:59,077
is where the current Three Great Workshops warehouse is located.

219
00:11:59,378 --> 00:12:01,122
The location of the warehouse

220
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,640
is confidential.

221
00:12:02,751 --> 00:12:04,402
I'm sure information has been leaked.

222
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,559
Were there only two people when they left the city?

223
00:12:09,677 --> 00:12:10,957
It was two people in the beginning.

224
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,509
- There were cavalries?   - The Overwatch Council's Black Cavalry.

225
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,722
Didn't Xie Bi An say

226
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,322
Fan Xian would die in two days?

227
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,562
It has been two days.

228
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,000
Not even Yun Zhi Lan could do it.

229
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,839
Who else can kill Fan Xian?

230
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,200
Yun Zhi Lan

231
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:11,190
is not the grandmaster.

232
00:13:12,774 --> 00:13:14,078
The grandmaster is going to take action?

233
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:16,920
Otherwise, why would Li Yun Rui

234
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,749
go and invite himself?

235
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,109
I wonder who

236
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,710
among the four grandmasters

237
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:29,922
will take action.

238
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,360
Shadow?

239
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:53,557
I thought you would hide from me forever.

240
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,722
We'll talk about this later.

241
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:58,389
- Return to the city immediately.   - We can't do that now.

242
00:13:58,527 --> 00:14:01,117
We will capture the Three Great Workshops soon.

243
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,670
Ye Liu Yun is heading to Suzhou City.

244
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:10,269
Ku He is in Northern Qi.

245
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,116
Si Gu Jian is not willing to make a move.

246
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,550
There's only one person left.

247
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,439
Ye Liu Yun.

248
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,310
Ye Liu Yun is a grandmaster from the Qing Kingdom.

249
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:24,233
Why would he attack one of his own?

250
00:14:24,314 --> 00:14:25,714
During the Xuankong Temple assassination,

251
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:27,279
the Ye family was chased out of the capital.

252
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,320
It had nothing to do with Lord Fan.

253
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,950
That was His Majesty's order.

254
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,670
Yes. Ye Liu Yun is taking revenge against the royal family.

255
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:42,470
Lord Fan, why don't we return to the city?

256
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,280
Ye Liu Yun won't attack in a busy city,

257
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,562
right?

258
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:47,922
If it won't work,

259
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,350
we'll just take a boat and leave Jiangnan.

260
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,802
A grandmaster is invincible.

261
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,280
The people you have can't defend against him.

262
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,443
If I return now,

263
00:15:01,523 --> 00:15:04,350
the Ming family can move the Three Great Workshops again.

264
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:05,839
After learning this lesson,

265
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:07,362
they will break up the Three Great Workshops

266
00:15:07,443 --> 00:15:09,369
and spread them across Jiangnan.

267
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,842
That means we must strike quickly if we want to take back

268
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,950
the Three Great Workshops.

269
00:15:13,031 --> 00:15:14,861
This is the only chance.

270
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,629
Who will stop Ye Liu Yun?

271
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,600
How long until he arrives?

272
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:23,039
He's quite far away.

273
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,940
With the method used by a grandmaster to rush here,

274
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:26,420
he will be arriving in a matter of hours.

275
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:29,959
I want to take back

276
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,839
my mother's assets.

277
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,030
Lord Fan,

278
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:37,042
I am underpaid.

279
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,027
Isn't doing this the same as heading to your death?

280
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,720
- Who are they?   - Be careful.

281
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:10,084
Over here.

282
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,440
Let me do it.

283
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:26,002
Don't move! Stop immediately!

284
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:28,280
Don't move! Stop immediately!

285
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,680
Don't move!

286
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,359
Stop!

287
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,480
You! Go there!

288
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,842
Who is it?

289
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,039
Come with me.

290
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,639
Follow me.

291
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,480
Where are they?

292
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,640
Who? Where are they?

293
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,959
At the entrance.

294
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:10,335
- What's going on?   - Let's go.

295
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:12,069
Move.

296
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,520
Hurry up!

297
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:17,202
Keep up! Hurry!

298
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,670
Don't move!

299
00:19:29,256 --> 00:19:30,536
Don't move!

300
00:19:30,818 --> 00:19:32,562
- All of you, don't move!   - Don't move!

301
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,880
Don't move.

302
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,240
Put them down.

303
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,160
You...

304
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,880
What are you doing here?

305
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:46,314
This place is the Ming family's private property.

306
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,029
All of you trespass on this place with your horses.

307
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,439
Are you disregarding the law?

308
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,830
Are you disregarding the law?

309
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,879
What did you say? I couldn't hear you clearly.

310
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,110
What is this place?

311
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,710
I've told you clearly.

312
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,509
This is the Ming family's property.

313
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,160
Qi Nian.

314
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,642
The Imperial Treasury Transport Department Case.

315
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,888
Are you Xiao Jing, the supervisor of the first workshop

316
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:17,001
at the Three Great Workshops of the Imperial Treasury Transport Department?

317
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,160
It's me.

318
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:21,596
These are your crimes from the Qing Kingdom's year of Yuan

319
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,430
until now.

320
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,439
That's... You are forcing crimes on me!

321
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,800
Keep listening!

322
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,282
In the second year and third month of the Qing Kingdom,

323
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,282
Xiao Jing hid the bronze hill mine accident

324
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:34,069
and took the dead victims' wages for five years

325
00:20:34,247 --> 00:20:38,083
which totaled up to 13,700 taels.

326
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,278
On the ninth of the seventh month in the fourth year of the Qing Kingdom,

327
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:46,004
Xiao Jing bribed the Suzhou bookkeeper

328
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:49,670
and purchased 700 mu of fertile land for dirt cheap.

329
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:51,799
During the first month of the sixth year of the Qing Kingdom,

330
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:55,836
The supervisors of the Three Great Workshops led by Xiao Jing

331
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:57,599
colluded with the treasurer

332
00:20:57,731 --> 00:21:00,789
to owe the workers' wages worth more than 10,000 taels.

333
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,479
It caused a riot

334
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:05,635
with 14 people dead and more than 50 people injured.

335
00:21:05,716 --> 00:21:09,360
- You...   - You may be able to plead for corruption and bribery,

336
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,670
but causing people's death is unforgivable.

337
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,079
According to the law of Qing,

338
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,200
you should be executed.

339
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,399
How can you convict me

340
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,442
without evidence?

341
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,549
These are the testimonies and evidence.

342
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,480
See for yourself.

343
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,162
Even if you are going to convict me,

344
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:34,509
you still need to have a trial!

345
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,724
The Chief Inspector of the Overwatch Council can convict someone.

346
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,411
With evidence and witnesses,

347
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:51,578
a trial is not needed.

348
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,059
He can be executed according to the law.

349
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,599
Everyone,

350
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:00,110
can you tell me

351
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,589
what this place is?

352
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,840
Supervisor Xiao is dead.

353
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,842
The Overwatch Council is true to its name.

354
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,202
Lord Fan,

355
00:22:08,385 --> 00:22:09,665
this is...

356
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,480
This is

357
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:13,878
the private property of the Ming family.

358
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:20,642
You must be Ma Xiong Jian, the supervisor of the second workshop

359
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,857
of the Imperial Treasury Transport Department.

360
00:22:23,868 --> 00:22:24,869
Yes.

361
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,230
Listen well.

362
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,549
Since you took on this position, you had 12 concubines.

363
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,239
You forced nine of them to be your concubines.

364
00:22:34,327 --> 00:22:38,478
Two of them, you killed their husbands to steal their wives.

365
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:41,989
There was also the riot case during the year of Qing.

366
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,320
Ma Xiong Jian worked with Xiao Jing

367
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:47,141
and committed the same crimes.

368
00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:49,500
According to the law of Qing, you should be executed.

369
00:22:50,376 --> 00:22:51,376
My Lord!

370
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,829
Spare me, My Lord!

371
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,479
Spare me, My Lord! I won't do it again!

372
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,198
My Lord, spare me this time.

373
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,442
Execute him.

374
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:05,282
All of you, listen well.

375
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,562
I just came to Jiangnan, but it doesn't mean I don't know everything.

376
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,522
There's nothing in this world

377
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:12,349
that you can hide from the Overwatch Council.

378
00:23:13,703 --> 00:23:17,309
Where is the bookkeeper called Hu?

379
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,910
I'm here!

380
00:23:28,285 --> 00:23:29,859
Supervisor of the third workshop, Hu Jin Lin,

381
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:31,402
greets Lord Fan.

382
00:23:31,503 --> 00:23:32,783
Supervisor Hu, right?

383
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:34,822
Tell me.

384
00:23:34,983 --> 00:23:36,402
What is this place?

385
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,599
I'm asking you a question!

386
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:46,332
My Lord,

387
00:23:46,413 --> 00:23:48,898
this is the warehouse of the Imperial Treasury's Three Great Workshops.

388
00:23:49,064 --> 00:23:51,322
Every item from the Transport Department is stored here temporarily.

389
00:23:51,626 --> 00:23:53,562
Is this the Three Great Workshops?

390
00:23:53,704 --> 00:23:54,984
This is the Three Great Workshops!

391
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:01,868
Fan Xian, the Chief Inspector of the Overwatch Council,

392
00:24:02,004 --> 00:24:04,164
will take over the Three Great Workshops on His Majesty's edict.

393
00:24:04,546 --> 00:24:06,642
I'm doing things according to the edict. Does anyone

394
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,563
have any objections?

395
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,269
Do you have an objection?

396
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:18,162
Lord Fan follows His Majesty's orders.

397
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,322
The Three Great Workshops will be handed over to you.

398
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,950
You should be grateful that you've killed no one.

399
00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:39,119
Do the Three Great Workshops have machines to forge steel parts?

400
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,199
Yes. They are gathered in one warehouse.

401
00:24:41,303 --> 00:24:43,464
- Stand up and lead the way.   - Yes.

402
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:45,439
Make way quickly! Move!

403
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:46,762
Move!

404
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,920
My Lord.

405
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:25,002
Fan Xian entered the warehouse

406
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,670
and never came out again.

407
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:27,880
Yes.

408
00:25:27,967 --> 00:25:29,206
The doors are shut,

409
00:25:29,302 --> 00:25:30,772
but we can hear

410
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,360
metals knocking on each other

411
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,600
and the forge being lit up.

412
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,749
However, we don't know what he is doing inside.

413
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,200
It doesn't matter.

414
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,150
Even if he captures the Three Great Workshops,

415
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:43,390
Fan Xian will

416
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,000
still die this time

417
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,509
if Ye Liu Yun makes a move.

418
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,630
What if he doesn't die?

419
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,039
He is the grandmaster.

420
00:25:56,078 --> 00:25:57,358
You are the head of the family.

421
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,482
You should be cautious.

422
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:01,950
You must not rely on others for your success.

423
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,870
If Fan Xian doesn't die,

424
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,680
what will happen?

425
00:26:11,927 --> 00:26:13,682
The Ming family is fighting for the Three Great Workshops.

426
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:15,870
The family will be annihilated for the crime.

427
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,230
Who said it was the Ming family?

428
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,359
You are right.

429
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:25,950
The Ming Family was lied to.

430
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,430
The other families also have bad intentions.

431
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,989
However, if that happens,

432
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:38,190
even if we find someone else to take over,

433
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,760
they still can bear the consequences

434
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:42,799
of such a serious crime.

435
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,989
You have many siblings.

436
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,279
Just send your siblings

437
00:26:47,374 --> 00:26:49,485
to their doom one by one!

438
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,750
Mother, calm down.

439
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,829
You can decide

440
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,749
whether my siblings die together

441
00:27:17,743 --> 00:27:20,213
let alone dying one by one.

442
00:27:20,487 --> 00:27:22,049
However, I'm afraid doing that

443
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:25,799
still won't be enough.

444
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,282
That's easy.

445
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,042
Just sacrifice

446
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,470
either one of us.

447
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,839
Naturally, I'll be the one.

448
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:52,359
No matter

449
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,349
how much of a coward I am,

450
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,280
I'm still human.

451
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:06,950
How can I sacrifice

452
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,630
my compassionate mother?

453
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,000
My good son.

454
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,749
It's still not time to make a choice.

455
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:23,110
Let's see if Fan Xian lives.

456
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:32,839
You are right, Mother.

457
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,749
However, I think

458
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,842
Fan Xian will surely die this time.

459
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,962
It has been some time now.

460
00:29:20,084 --> 00:29:21,199
I don't understand.

461
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,400
With such a short amount of time,

462
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,230
how can he create a weapon

463
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,599
to defeat a grandmaster?

464
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:31,639
Lord Fan!

465
00:29:34,271 --> 00:29:35,798
Black Cavalry, guard the Three Great Workshops!

466
00:29:35,879 --> 00:29:37,802
- No one can enter without my order.   - Yes!

467
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,762
Is Ye Liu Yun here?

468
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,199
You can't wait for him to arrive? He'll be here soon.

469
00:29:43,317 --> 00:29:44,597
I'm going to meet him.

470
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,039
Lord Fan!

471
00:29:48,646 --> 00:29:49,920
Lord Fan.

472
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,710
It's my first time seeing someone going to meet a grandmaster.

473
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,072
My Lord

474
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,670
has always been unique.

475
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,559
You're still praising him?

476
00:29:59,271 --> 00:30:00,279
He must be crazy.

477
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:01,639
Being crazy once in a while

478
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,559
is quite exciting.

479
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,630
My Lord, wait for me!

480
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,922
All of them are crazy.

481
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,762
Waiter, give me a pot of tea.

482
00:30:38,752 --> 00:30:40,162
Shadow,

483
00:30:40,663 --> 00:30:42,162
you are here as well.

484
00:30:43,413 --> 00:30:45,293
I still need to be here to watch what happens.

485
00:30:45,374 --> 00:30:47,245
If both of you have nothing to say,

486
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,829
you can keep your mouth shut.

487
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,200
I'm nervous.

488
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,680
I have to say something at least.

489
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,039
Lord Fan,

490
00:30:56,134 --> 00:30:59,004
is it too late for me to go to the outhouse?

491
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,000
I don't think so.

492
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,200
What's going on?

493
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,319
What is this?

494
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,749
Ye Liu Yun is here.

495
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,722
Don't follow me. I'll deal with this myself.

496
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,860
Going alone? Are you planning to die?

497
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,520
It's fine.

498
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:21,961
If you die, I'll retrieve your corpse.

499
00:32:22,134 --> 00:32:24,445
What corpse? If I die,

500
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,362
my corpse won't even be left.

501
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,799
Lord Fan.

502
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,322
Qi Nian,

503
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,882
you've always been smart.

504
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,399
You run quickly.

505
00:32:38,822 --> 00:32:40,213
If something happens,

506
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,799
don't be foolish.

507
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,602
Lord Fan.

508
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:18,047
What do you mean?

509
00:33:18,189 --> 00:33:20,039
Having this might not be enough to defeat the grandmaster?

510
00:33:20,173 --> 00:33:21,453
That's right.

511
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,202
Grandmaster is a human too.

512
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:25,173
How can he dodge a weapon that's not from this era?

513
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,559
A grandmaster

514
00:33:27,663 --> 00:33:29,532
is no longer bound by the human's common sense.

515
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
Doesn't it make him a monster?

516
00:33:49,231 --> 00:33:50,780
What's going on?

517
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,680
Over there!

518
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,029
He's coming!

519
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,160
That's amazing.

520
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,639
Fan Xian.

521
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,269
Greetings, Mr. Ye.

522
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,482
I owe you a favor.

523
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:35,429
I won't kill you if you leave Jiangnan.

524
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,120
Sorry.

525
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,190
I don't listen to advice.

526
00:34:44,033 --> 00:34:46,718
What did you see just now?

527
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,829
A divine weapon.

528
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,959
Why won't you use it?

529
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,240
I thought about it

530
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,519
I figured

531
00:34:58,622 --> 00:34:59,902
I had no use for it.

532
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,399
What do you mean?

533
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,045
Because you won't kill me.

534
00:35:25,878 --> 00:35:29,427
I heard you are famous for your Liuyun Palm technique.

535
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:32,802
Killing with a sword

536
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,600
is faster.

537
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,670
Why can't I kill you?

538
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,190
Because you dare not kill me.

539
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,200
In this world,

540
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,119
only someone heartless like Si Gu Jian can do it.

541
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:46,479
Otherwise,

542
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,309
no one dares to kill me.

543
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:50,599
Is it true?

544
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:52,559
The Ye family has been chased out of the capital,

545
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:54,590
but the Ye family still exists.

546
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,362
It hasn't perished.

547
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:59,389
If you kill me,

548
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,119
the Ye family

549
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:03,436
will never recover.

550
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:09,959
Is this

551
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,640
your confidence?

552
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,110
You are a cloud in the sky.

553
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,680
You are unaffected by anything.

554
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:21,101
However, you still left a line in the mortal world after so many years.

555
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,320
With a line in the mortal world, you are still human.

556
00:36:24,401 --> 00:36:25,681
Since you are human,

557
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,280
you still have emotion.

558
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,350
A wave only happens for a while,

559
00:36:29,431 --> 00:36:30,940
but it can go against a thousand-year rock.

560
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,150
There's nothing different.

561
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,389
You are also the same.

562
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,789
Who told you

563
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,269
I care about the Ye family?

564
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,399
What is it?

565
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,120
Keep eating.

566
00:37:24,048 --> 00:37:25,251
Mr. Ye,

567
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,282
my gamble paid off.

568
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:29,042
You are a grandmaster,

569
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:30,922
but you are still human.

570
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,282
You are a gambler

571
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:34,999
who is very crazy.

572
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:38,070
I don't know who you resemble.

573
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:42,359
Thank you, Mr. Ye.

574
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,479
Just this once.

575
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,469
It won't happen again.

576
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,550
I want to thank you for letting me know

577
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:54,869
that a grandmaster can still be human.

578
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,159
In this life of mine,

579
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:00,221
I'm an official who also practices martial arts.

580
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:03,030
If I reach the pinnacle of these two paths

581
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,962
and lose my humanity,

582
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,309
it'll be pointless.

583
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,829
You are different from your mother.

584
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:24,791
You are so corny.

585
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,202
Do you know her too?

586
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,869
She's not like you.

587
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,359
You are smart,

588
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:34,990
but don't be too smart.

589
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,479
What do you mean?

590
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,359
I'm human,

591
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,269
but it doesn't mean the other grandmasters

592
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:45,230
still think they are human.

593
00:39:27,678 --> 00:39:28,761
Lord Fan,

594
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:31,331
is this over?

595
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,680
We won.

596
00:39:35,781 --> 00:39:37,732
How did you know he wouldn't kill you?

597
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,242
I gambled with my life.

598
00:39:41,975 --> 00:39:44,295
Congratulations on winning the gamble.

599
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:46,959
Let me ask another question.

600
00:39:47,222 --> 00:39:48,562
Since he didn't kill you,

601
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:51,359
what was the point of that slash?

602
00:39:52,197 --> 00:39:53,477
It was for the capital to see.

603
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,560
The grandmaster is not satisfied that the Ye family was banished.

604
00:39:55,678 --> 00:39:58,428
That slash was to show the capital his stand.

605
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,800
When that slash was heading towards me,

606
00:40:01,949 --> 00:40:03,779
I felt the ground break.

607
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,190
I thought I would be dead at that moment.

608
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,120
I didn't expect him

609
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:11,030
to only cut off a strand of my hair.

610
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,840
What's going on?

611
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,482
- Why is this happening?   - What's going on?

612
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:50,522
Splitting a building with one slash.

613
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:53,562
This is the strength of a grandmaster.

614
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:55,919
A grandmaster

615
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:57,469
is really not human.

616
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,230
Why does it sound like you're scolding them?

617
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,080
You are wrong.

618
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,680
Actually,

619
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:15,839
they are still human.

620
00:41:17,635 --> 00:41:20,122
Do you think we will achieve this one day?

621
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,200
I might.

622
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:28,799
What about me?

623
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:30,762
Lord Fan,

624
00:41:30,903 --> 00:41:33,173
let's talk when you've recovered your internal energy.

625
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:00,479
I'm back.

626
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:06,242
(The End)

627
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:22,990
It's not over yet.

628
00:42:23,825 --> 00:42:25,279
Do I need to wait a few years

629
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,150
for the finale?

630
00:42:29,966 --> 00:42:31,315
(The building will be closed.)

631
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,602
(Please leave orderly with your personal belongings.)

632
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:39,282
Will Fan Xian really forget about the injury caused by Shadow?

633
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:42,949
What about Yuan Meng?

634
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,499
She has life on her hands.

635
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:50,590
What is the relationship between the Emperor of Qing and the Divine Temple?

636
00:42:54,907 --> 00:42:57,145
Can you speed up the story after this?

637
00:42:57,179 --> 00:42:58,032
(May all patience be rewarded with success.)

638
00:42:58,057 --> 00:42:58,852
(May all hardships and trials don't disturb one's inner peace.)

639
00:42:58,877 --> 00:42:59,671
(Fan Xian chose a path without compromise. I hope you do the same as well.)

640
00:42:59,696 --> 00:43:00,508
(Glad that we still walk the same path with the joy of life.)

641
00:43:00,533 --> 00:43:01,154
(See you in Season 3.)
