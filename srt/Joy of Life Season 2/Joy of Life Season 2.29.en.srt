00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:30,948
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,029 --> 00:01:33,985
(Episode 29)

3
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,082
Once every three years?

4
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,922
It has become a tradition.

5
00:01:39,814 --> 00:01:41,576
If someone is up to something bad,

6
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:42,799
this is a chance.

7
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,360
We will take strict precautions to ensure no one can break in.

8
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,282
In the early years, there were assassins, but not in recent years.

9
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:50,750
It's harder to assassinate here than in the capital.

10
00:02:20,158 --> 00:02:21,402
These are...

11
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:24,682
They are all craftsmen from Xuankong Temple.

12
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,402
It's always been like this.

13
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,882
Before the Flower Viewing Festival,

14
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,402
they must all leave to ensure no outsiders are present on the day.

15
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,199
After the Flower Viewing Festival, they will come back.

16
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:46,322
Don't worry about them. Let's go up.

17
00:02:53,142 --> 00:02:54,682
Why are they all bound with chains?

18
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,762
It's a royal area.

19
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,271
We can never be too cautious.

20
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,190
Lord Fan.

21
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,899
This is the place.

22
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,190
Can these craftsmen go home?

23
00:04:15,061 --> 00:04:16,322
Lord Fan.

24
00:04:16,718 --> 00:04:18,002
You must be kidding.

25
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:26,374
Does the Flower Viewing Festival, which occurs once every three years,

26
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:28,482
keep these people confined here for life?

27
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,189
It concerns His Majesty's safety.

28
00:04:30,913 --> 00:04:32,344
Someone must bear the burden.

29
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,519
Lord Fan.

30
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,319
Is there anything else you want to ask?

31
00:04:37,246 --> 00:04:38,246
Nothing.

32
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,202
Let's complete the errands first.

33
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,962
His Majesty instructed that

34
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:10,637
Lord Fan's pot

35
00:05:11,342 --> 00:05:12,642
should be placed here.

36
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:23,764
That's the only errand.

37
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,402
We'll return to the capital now.

38
00:05:49,109 --> 00:05:50,109
What's wrong?

39
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,522
Is there anyone up here?

40
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,079
No one.

41
00:05:54,206 --> 00:05:55,522
After the craftsmen leave,

42
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:58,111
it's just an empty temple.

43
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,882
Did you see anyone else?

44
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:03,596
I just heard some movement up there.

45
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:04,677
Footsteps?

46
00:06:05,176 --> 00:06:07,776
Not quite, more like the light sound of toes touching the ground.

47
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:14,706
There's nowhere to hide here.

48
00:06:15,612 --> 00:06:16,612
Could it have been

49
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,509
a bird?

50
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,278
Maybe.

51
00:06:21,487 --> 00:06:22,487
Don't worry.

52
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,270
After we leave, the palace guards will enter.

53
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:27,772
They will surely thoroughly inspect the place.

54
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,840
There won't be any hidden dangers.

55
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,760
Nice view.

56
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,069
The Chrysanthemum Viewing Festival is held here every three years.

57
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,350
It is for this very view.

58
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:49,869
Three years ago, I wasn't in the capital.

59
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,762
Lord Fan, your rise

60
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,562
has been unprecedented.

61
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,350
Let's go.

62
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,700
Okay.

63
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,830
Your internal energy seems a bit chaotic.

64
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,319
I'm fine.

65
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,390
Sometimes my cultivation goes out of control.

66
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,242
I'm fine now.

67
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,679
It's not my place to ask about your cultivation,

68
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,679
but chaotic internal energy isn't good.

69
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:24,965
You should consult your mentor.

70
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:27,459
No one teaches me.

71
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,540
I taught myself.

72
00:07:31,678 --> 00:07:33,028
You learned this by yourself?

73
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,111
To be honest,

74
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,680
Lord Fan,

75
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:41,283
His Majesty really thinks highly of you.

76
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,053
His Majesty delayed the Flower Viewing Festival for an official.

77
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:46,106
It's unheard of.

78
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:49,050
Lord Fan, you have a bright future ahead.

79
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,882
Commander Gong, you're too kind.

80
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:53,959
With such a promising future, you should take care of your health.

81
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,762
Negligence in mastering cultivation can have dire consequences.

82
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,362
I appreciate your concern.

83
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,999
Lord Fan.

84
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,280
You have a promising future.

85
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,749
I too aspire to reach such heights.

86
00:08:32,856 --> 00:08:36,282
(Fan Residence)

87
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:51,988
I win again.

88
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,172
Thanks for letting me win.

89
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,162
No, Ruo Ruo, this is not enough.

90
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:01,482
I lost all my money.

91
00:09:01,654 --> 00:09:04,202
Even between siblings, we must be clear about money.

92
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,399
No money left.

93
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:11,322
I can't play anymore.

94
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,922
I don't have any money to play.

95
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,242
Wan Er, you take over. I'll give way.

96
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,279
Give way?

97
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,230
It's all the same. Come.

98
00:09:35,552 --> 00:09:36,793
Shuffle the tiles.

99
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,122
Why are you locking me up?

100
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,842
Let me go.

101
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,722
Are you deaf?

102
00:10:21,646 --> 00:10:23,802
Watch out, I'll poison you.

103
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:33,482
I'll kill you.

104
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,149
These are your people.

105
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:44,922
Are you willing to

106
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,562
kill them with poison?

107
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:48,452
President.

108
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,639
Don't worry.

109
00:10:50,062 --> 00:10:52,132
Watch how I deal with these boys.

110
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:53,642
I gave the order.

111
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:54,880
Don't make it hard on them.

112
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
You want to lock me up?

113
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,042
Eat while it's hot.

114
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,960
- Why lock me up? - Eat.

115
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,242
Lord Wu was the one who attacked me?

116
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,122
At our age, we need to be mindful of

117
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,882
what we consume and do.

118
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,962
I've returned to the capital with a single mission,

119
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,840
which is to bring the culprit to justice.

120
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,070
But I'm puzzled.

121
00:11:27,215 --> 00:11:30,722
I tracked the whereabouts of the murderer in Jiangnan,

122
00:11:30,886 --> 00:11:33,876
but after returning to the capital, he vanished.

123
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,789
Even the Overwatch Council found no clues.

124
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:40,124
Who's secretly protecting him?

125
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,562
Tell me in advance what you want to eat next time.

126
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:49,265
President.

127
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,421
What are you doing?

128
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,754
Bringing you food.

129
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:25,690
Wan Er, it doesn't seem like it's your first time playing.

130
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:29,219
When I was sick and couldn't go out,

131
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:32,532
I always found something to play with myself.

132
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:45,882
Come, let's continue.

133
00:13:03,957 --> 00:13:05,282
What's going on?

134
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:08,559
Fan Si Zhe came early in the morning to bid farewell to Father.

135
00:13:08,677 --> 00:13:09,962
He said he wants to head north.

136
00:13:12,414 --> 00:13:15,762
So he wants one last game before leaving?

137
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:18,002
It wasn't his idea.

138
00:13:18,535 --> 00:13:19,695
It was Father.

139
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,682
Father suggested playing poker?

140
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:27,002
Father doesn't want Si Zhe to leave.

141
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:28,741
No wonder.

142
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,629
Father prepared a lot of money.

143
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,722
He's been losing money, but keeps playing.

144
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,869
It's not about playing poker.

145
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,559
He wants him to stay.

146
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,082
Father is embarrassed to say it directly,

147
00:13:41,725 --> 00:13:43,562
so he tries to keep him at the poker table.

148
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:47,484
But why does Aunt Liu want him to leave?

149
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:50,260
I really can't understand that.

150
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:51,543
I think

151
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,230
Aunt Liu wants to let go,

152
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:58,555
to let Si Zhe grow and experience on his own.

153
00:13:59,174 --> 00:14:00,242
Also,

154
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,922
many recent troubles in the capital were on me.

155
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,122
Sending Si Zhe away from the capital

156
00:14:07,422 --> 00:14:09,442
might be a way to protect him.

157
00:14:11,624 --> 00:14:12,624
Father.

158
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,242
I think

159
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,762
all the tiles have been dealt,

160
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:17,078
how about we stop here?

161
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,640
It will get dark if we keep playing.

162
00:14:18,765 --> 00:14:19,925
If it gets dark, we'll eat.

163
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:21,286
After we eat, we will continue.

164
00:14:23,064 --> 00:14:24,322
I'll skip dinner.

165
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:25,589
I need to get going.

166
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,140
No rush to leave.

167
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,480
I have to leave sooner or later.

168
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,562
Once you've been through the hardship,

169
00:14:34,735 --> 00:14:36,044
that's enough.

170
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:40,837
He's grown up and has his own ideas.

171
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,322
Just let him follow his heart.

172
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,722
How about this, Father?

173
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,562
We'll play one game to decide.

174
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,989
If I lose, I'll leave.

175
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:13,070
Well, you two are out.

176
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,962
It's still between us.

177
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,520
What's the rule?

178
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,802
Didn't I just say that?

179
00:15:19,176 --> 00:15:20,455
I'll only play one game.

180
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:22,565
If I lose this game, I will leave.

181
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,909
If you lose, you can leave.

182
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,389
If you win, will you stay?

183
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,143
We'll see after the winner is decided.

184
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:34,117
And you won't be able to play anymore if I win.

185
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:35,922
You guys have no money left.

186
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,640
Father, stop, you're getting addicted.

187
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,559
You left last time to avoid trouble.

188
00:15:47,686 --> 00:15:48,997
It's unnecessary now.

189
00:15:50,222 --> 00:15:53,372
You've grown a lot since you returned.

190
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,159
Honestly,

191
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,362
I wanted to make money previously

192
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,989
to show you my ability.

193
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,029
I was just afraid you'd think I was a useless son.

194
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:07,070
I wanted to make you proud.

195
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,602
I wanted to do something you could see.

196
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:11,839
I've seen it.

197
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,140
But it's different this time.

198
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:16,710
This time, I'm doing it for myself.

199
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,190
I want to open an unprecedented shop in Northern Qi.

200
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:23,042
I want to link Northern Qi's fortune and wealth.

201
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,882
So this time,

202
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,279
I'm chasing my own dream.

203
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,431
Si Zhe

204
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,159
has really grown up.

205
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:33,529
Fine.

206
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,319
Just do it your way.

207
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:37,307
One game to decide the winner.

208
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:39,012
Loser switches out.

209
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:53,778
Father.

210
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,389
Should I lose or win?

211
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:03,190
Wan Er. You're not respecting your opponent.

212
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,630
Do you think you can decide whether to win or lose?

213
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,860
This way, I win.

214
00:17:17,325 --> 00:17:18,325
Fine.

215
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,413
This way, I lose.

216
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,400
Wan Er, can you do it again?

217
00:17:35,503 --> 00:17:36,503
This...

218
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,790
Wan Er, this...

219
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,522
What kind of trick is this?

220
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,719
When I was sick, I played by myself a lot.

221
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,242
I get faster with more practice.

222
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:56,922
We've really seen something today.

223
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,002
So, should I win or lose?

224
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:08,066
No game lasts forever.

225
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Father.

226
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
Mother.

227
00:18:34,654 --> 00:18:35,842
I'll get going now.

228
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
Xian,

229
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,682
Ruo Ruo,

230
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:06,002
please take care of Father and Mother.

231
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
Go ahead.

232
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:21,019
Xian.

233
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,882
Have Wan Er teach me that trick when I come back.

234
00:19:49,484 --> 00:19:50,484
Don't look.

235
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:39,545
What's the situation now?

236
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:40,828
- My Lord. - Why is it so congested?

237
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:43,509
You should sit inside. It's dusty outside.

238
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:44,922
Why are there so many carriages?

239
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:49,870
All the officials in the capital are heading out to Xuankong Temple.

240
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,642
There aren't usually this many people in the court.

241
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,309
Attending court is tiered by rank.

242
00:20:56,573 --> 00:20:59,484
Lower-ranked officials aren't qualified to attend court.

243
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:03,622
And those who can, often choose to walk instead of taking the carriage

244
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,870
and have breakfast on the way.

245
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,042
But now, we're going to Xuankong Temple.

246
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:11,501
All officials need carriages, so it's congested.

247
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,981
Not everyone is qualified to go to court,

248
00:21:14,062 --> 00:21:15,762
but they can all go to the flower viewing.

249
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,482
It's a celebration for everyone.

250
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,150
All the officials can go.

251
00:21:20,443 --> 00:21:21,501
That's not right.

252
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:22,891
Not everyone can be an official.

253
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:24,159
What about the common people?

254
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,042
The common people can't go.

255
00:21:28,774 --> 00:21:30,362
It's a celebration for everyone,

256
00:21:31,012 --> 00:21:32,211
excluding the common people.

257
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:35,482
The officials will celebrate it for everyone.

258
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:37,639
Even celebrations are done on behalf of them.

259
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,789
That's why they're called parental officials.

260
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,682
There are too many things to worry about.

261
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,002
Officials below third rank, go straight ahead.

262
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:55,642
Officials below third rank, go straight ahead.

263
00:21:55,868 --> 00:21:58,219
Officials below third rank, go straight ahead.

264
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,922
Officials with third rank and above, come this way.

265
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:03,362
Officials with third rank and above, come this way.

266
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,934
Officials with third rank and above...

267
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,122
Don't be envious. Let's go our own way.

268
00:22:07,256 --> 00:22:09,802
Officials below third rank, go straight ahead.

269
00:22:09,904 --> 00:22:12,293
Officials below third rank, go straight ahead.

270
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,150
Lord Fan, you're an exception.

271
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:16,110
Lord Fan, you're an exception.

272
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:18,202
Lord Fan, you're an exception.

273
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,470
Lord Fan, you're an exception.

274
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:22,922
Lord Fan, you're an exception.

275
00:22:23,287 --> 00:22:25,442
Officials with third rank and above, come this way.

276
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,002
Officials with third rank and above, come this way.

277
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:30,630
Officials below third rank, go straight ahead.

278
00:22:31,056 --> 00:22:32,297
Officials below third rank...

279
00:22:32,424 --> 00:22:35,573
The path for officials above third rank is smooth.

280
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,442
Why am I an exception?

281
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,600
His Majesty trusts you.

282
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:43,069
No way. Considering His Majesty temperament,

283
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,501
he'd have me stuck in traffic.

284
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,122
- Quick! - Something's not right.

285
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:01,402
Let's go!

286
00:23:01,885 --> 00:23:03,122
My Lord, don't panic.

287
00:23:10,951 --> 00:23:12,471
If there's danger, I'll retreat first.

288
00:23:13,318 --> 00:23:14,518
I have good flying technique.

289
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:15,840
I can get help easily.

290
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,160
I should thank you then.

291
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
Don't mention it.

292
00:23:40,454 --> 00:23:43,093
Lord Fan, your reputation precedes you.

293
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,559
I am

294
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,599
Ye Zhong.

295
00:23:53,255 --> 00:23:54,375
The garrison of the capital.

296
00:23:54,456 --> 00:23:56,166
You are Ye Ling Er's father.

297
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,040
Who is the guard on duty on the day of flower viewing?

298
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,482
Of course it's Senior Ye.

299
00:24:00,614 --> 00:24:01,614
Senior Ye?

300
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:04,762
It's Ye Zhong, Lord Ye.

301
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:07,602
The garrison of the capital, Ye Zhong.

302
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:08,879
He is your senior?

303
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,882
Yes.

304
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,029
My junior fought against you, Lord Fan.

305
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,256
It wasn't much of a fight, just a spar.

306
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,400
My daughter often praises you for your extraordinary skills.

307
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
You're flattering me.

308
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:26,601
You've fought my junior, my daughter, but not me.

309
00:24:26,823 --> 00:24:28,414
Do you look down on me?

310
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:30,576
- What kind of logic is this? - Just one move.

311
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,559
Not bad.

312
00:25:01,544 --> 00:25:02,544
Not bad.

313
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,202
Do you have a ninth rank?

314
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,562
Enough to spar.

315
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,760
The younger generation has surpassed the older generation.

316
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Retreat.

317
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,559
Lord Ye, did you purposely come just to spar?

318
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:19,659
Let's talk privately.

319
00:25:21,192 --> 00:25:23,472
You, step aside.

320
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,799
Lord Fan.

321
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,029
Please be extra vigilant at Xuankong Temple today.

322
00:25:34,294 --> 00:25:35,294
Why?

323
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,639
His Majesty decreed that

324
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,950
the palace guards are not allowed to disturb the flower viewing.

325
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,359
Therefore, the area around Xuankong Temple is heavily guarded.

326
00:25:43,471 --> 00:25:44,471
However,

327
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:48,150
the inner part of Xuankong Temple is guarded only by inner guards.

328
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,720
We're short on manpower.

329
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,922
Lord Ye, do you expect assassins?

330
00:25:52,032 --> 00:25:53,113
Not really.

331
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,039
I'm just being cautious.

332
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,479
Lord Ye, why don't you personally oversee it?

333
00:25:58,574 --> 00:25:59,695
Of course I will be there.

334
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,880
But

335
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,282
we're still short on men.

336
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:04,598
Why ask me?

337
00:26:04,951 --> 00:26:06,911
Among the officials attending the flower viewing,

338
00:26:06,992 --> 00:26:08,581
only you can fight.

339
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:10,950
Is Eunuch Hong Si Xiang not going?

340
00:26:11,063 --> 00:26:12,454
Only His Majesty knows that.

341
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,160
It's not my place to ask.

342
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,439
What about Commander Gong Dian?

343
00:26:15,463 --> 00:26:16,703
If my junior was around,

344
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,749
we wouldn't need to trouble you.

345
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:23,710
Lord Ye, we're meeting for the first time, right?

346
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,269
I'm a garrison in charge of the capital's defense and military affairs.

347
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,670
Lord Fan, if you don't rebel, we wouldn't meet often.

348
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,279
Have you considered the possibility that I might say no?

349
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:37,359
Yes, I have.

350
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,640
What do you mean?

351
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,950
I heard you're in debt.

352
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,479
Consider this a small favor.

353
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:52,279
If nothing goes wrong, remember to give it back to me.

354
00:26:52,374 --> 00:26:53,374
Give it back to you?

355
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:55,559
If nothing goes wrong, shouldn't you pay me back?

356
00:26:57,681 --> 00:27:00,400
Lord Ye, you don't do this often, do you?

357
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,519
This is my first time.

358
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:05,150
Are you afraid of jeopardizing your career if something goes wrong?

359
00:27:05,263 --> 00:27:06,303
That doesn't matter.

360
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,160
Then it's about loyalty to His Majesty and the kingdom.

361
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,279
There's a saying,

362
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,239
something about breeze and fire.

363
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,600
What?

364
00:27:18,524 --> 00:27:20,322
These soldiers were all trained by me.

365
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,242
If something goes wrong, they'll suffer the most.

366
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:27,718
There's a saying that when a storm hits, it's the nameless who fall.

367
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,719
A gentle breeze can start a prairie fire.

368
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,870
Yes, that's it.

369
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,642
That's not how you use that phrase.

370
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:37,319
Close enough.

371
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:52,922
- Is it not enough? - You can pay me when something really happens.

372
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,920
So to speak,

373
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,150
you've agreed.

374
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,670
But don't worry, Lord Ye.

375
00:28:03,447 --> 00:28:04,859
The Flower Viewing Festival happens every three years,

376
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:05,923
and it's always been safe.

377
00:28:05,966 --> 00:28:08,606
There's not that many accidents in the world.

378
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,280
Lord Ye!

379
00:28:32,046 --> 00:28:33,326
Lord Ye!

380
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:50,278
My Lord.

381
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,630
We've arrived.

382
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,282
Okay, let's find a place to park.

383
00:28:57,449 --> 00:29:00,202
Aren't we going into the temple to see the flowers?

384
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,457
I don't feel like joining the crowd.

385
00:29:01,481 --> 00:29:04,631
Besides, when they are standing so high, is it still about the flowers?

386
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:07,200
If not the flowers, then what?

387
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,559
- Lord Qin. - Hello, Lord Fan.

388
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,722
Where is your father?

389
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,789
My father would rather take a nap at home.

390
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:18,722
Has Minister Fan gone up?

391
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:20,122
He should be up there.

392
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,720
He should be

393
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,602
- on that floor. - How do you know?

394
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,710
His Majesty is on the top floor.

395
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,637
Each level below is arranged according to official rank and title.

396
00:29:32,661 --> 00:29:34,371
It's very orderly. I'm sure of it.

397
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,322
Don't worry, it's very solid.

398
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:58,459
You won't fall.

399
00:30:04,472 --> 00:30:05,472
Cheng Ru.

400
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,682
Kiddo, are you afraid of heights?

401
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,162
Three years ago, I was too young to come to the flower viewing.

402
00:30:15,406 --> 00:30:17,366
I didn't expect it to be so scary.

403
00:30:17,486 --> 00:30:18,835
What's there to be scared of?

404
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:19,983
Look at me.

405
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,802
Only when you stand high can you see far.

406
00:30:27,023 --> 00:30:29,133
Only then can you have a commanding view.

407
00:30:29,688 --> 00:30:30,802
Come.

408
00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:32,042
I'm scared.

409
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:37,039
People are different. Not everyone wants to be like you,

410
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:38,722
always aiming to stand higher.

411
00:30:38,844 --> 00:30:40,444
Cheng Ze, are you afraid of heights too?

412
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:49,202
The height doesn't matter.

413
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,430
What's interesting is when someone falls.

414
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,110
As long as I stand firm,

415
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,271
no one can make me fall.

416
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:03,839
Is that so?

417
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,780
Standing firm isn't enough.

418
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,870
You need someone to protect you.

419
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,962
Are you scared?

420
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,520
Thanks for saving my life, Cheng Ze.

421
00:31:43,272 --> 00:31:44,602
Don't mention it.

422
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:52,360
We sincerely wish Your Majesty long life and prosperity,

423
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:54,880
and eternal fortune for the Qing kingdom.

424
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,870
Long live Your Majesty!

425
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:10,548
The hierarchy here is clear.

426
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:12,864
Only by dividing finely can there be a chance to rise up.

427
00:32:12,888 --> 00:32:14,238
As you said,

428
00:32:14,327 --> 00:32:15,607
when you stand so high,

429
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,080
it's not about the flowers,

430
00:32:17,214 --> 00:32:20,204
but the path to success and the high platforms.

431
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,920
My Lord.

432
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:25,304
- Over there. - There's a fire.

433
00:32:25,385 --> 00:32:27,840
Fire!

434
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:31,039
- There's a fire. - Get water!

435
00:32:34,984 --> 00:32:36,144
Quick, put out the fire!

436
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,280
Hurry up!

437
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:38,602
Move quickly!

438
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,000
Move faster! Get up there!

439
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,362
Use more sand and stone!

440
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:43,070
Hurry up.

441
00:32:43,425 --> 00:32:44,522
Hurry up!

442
00:32:44,578 --> 00:32:46,322
Hurry up!

443
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,484
Lord Fan, why aren't you going to protect His Majesty?

444
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:52,736
Qi Nian, assist Lord Ye in finding the source of the fire.

445
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,841
- Yes, My Lord. - The water is here.

446
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:05,929
Your Majesty.

447
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,778
- Get water quickly. - I, Fan Xian, request an audience.

448
00:33:16,838 --> 00:33:18,878
Your Majesty, someone set a fire.

449
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,402
Was it you?

450
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,549
I'm here to protect Your Majesty.

451
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,790
Protect me?

452
00:33:29,524 --> 00:33:30,524
Where is the fire?

453
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,759
It's out.

454
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:33,474
If the fire's out, why do you need to protect me?

455
00:33:33,498 --> 00:33:35,162
I'm worried about Your Majesty's safety.

456
00:33:35,342 --> 00:33:36,422
What a killjoy.

457
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,449
Come in.

458
00:33:42,122 --> 00:33:43,829
Check everything thoroughly.

459
00:33:43,998 --> 00:33:45,198
Don't leave a single spark.

460
00:33:45,286 --> 00:33:46,405
Look at this fire starter.

461
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,000
Fire starter?

462
00:33:49,118 --> 00:33:51,028
The fire seems deliberate.

463
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,159
There's something off with the fire.

464
00:33:53,183 --> 00:33:55,973
If there are assassins, this cliffside is the hardest part to defend.

465
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,446
Your Majesty should return to the capital for safety.

466
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,309
I've faced all kinds of storms in my life.

467
00:34:01,511 --> 00:34:03,462
You're scared by a fire

468
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,349
that didn't even burn.

469
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:09,319
His Majesty has faced 43 assassination attempts.

470
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:10,703
His Majesty never retreated.

471
00:34:16,408 --> 00:34:18,408
So, Your Majesty's decree today is not to retreat.

472
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,639
Not convinced?

473
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,751
Not at all.

474
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,202
You're defying my order.

475
00:34:26,342 --> 00:34:27,856
It's not that I want to defy your order.

476
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,840
In this situation, everyone here will want to defy your order.

477
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,159
I don't.

478
00:34:32,284 --> 00:34:34,200
Your Majesty is the ruler of the Qing Kingdom.

479
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,919
Your safety concerns the entire kingdom.

480
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,893
There is a risk of assassination in Xuankong Temple,

481
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:38,976
yet Your Majesty won't retreat.

482
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,630
If I accept your decree to stay, I'll be disloyal to Your Majesty.

483
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:46,980
True loyalty means protecting Your Majesty even if it means defying orders.

484
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:54,550
It's not just chrysanthemums I favor.

485
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,202
When they're in full bloom,

486
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,510
no other flowers can compare to them.

487
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,122
How spectacular.

488
00:35:16,129 --> 00:35:17,129
Good.

489
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,210
Thank you.

490
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,590
Here, this is absolutely stunning.

491
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,030
Your Majesty, you should ask the princes if they agree with me.

492
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,320
Father, Fan Xian has a point.

493
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,359
Your Majesty's safety concerns the kingdom.

494
00:35:33,478 --> 00:35:34,718
We must investigate thoroughly.

495
00:35:36,165 --> 00:35:38,955
You all can really talk.

496
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:40,959
We're just speaking from the heart.

497
00:35:43,256 --> 00:35:44,335
This is strange.

498
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:49,110
How did Fan Jian raise a son like you?

499
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:54,242
Your Majesty.

500
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,349
I grew up in Danzhou without guidance, wild and untamed.

501
00:36:08,414 --> 00:36:10,494
You've suffered much in the first half of your life,

502
00:36:11,023 --> 00:36:15,014
but since arriving in the capital, you've been thriving.

503
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,621
So, the elders owe you nothing.

504
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,919
Everything you say, Your Majesty.

505
00:36:20,967 --> 00:36:21,967
All right.

506
00:36:22,654 --> 00:36:24,642
Don't spoil my mood.

507
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,842
Today is a good day.

508
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,042
Let's drink and enjoy the flowers.

509
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:31,039
Come.

510
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Let's

511
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:38,560
have a drink.

512
00:36:38,727 --> 00:36:42,158
Long live Your Majesty.

513
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,789
I confined Li Cheng Ze for six months.

514
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:55,038
Are you satisfied?

515
00:36:55,142 --> 00:36:56,142
I wouldn't dare.

516
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
Go.

517
00:36:59,005 --> 00:37:00,205
Have a drink with him.

518
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,909
Your Highness, this isn't personal between us.

519
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,559
What should be satisfied is the law, not me.

520
00:37:11,655 --> 00:37:14,122
We must resolve things between us someday.

521
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:15,670
- I'll be waiting for that day. - There is ample time.

522
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:17,042
And that day will come.

523
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,402
Your Majesty, we're done...

524
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:01,720
Assassins!

525
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,040
Assassins!

526
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,749
Protect His Majesty!

527
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,670
Protect His Majesty!

528
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,240
Protect His Majesty!

529
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,140
Protect His Majesty!

530
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:27,482
Your Majesty!

531
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:59,258
Take them down!

532
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:13,242
I heard that Si Gu Jian has a younger brother

533
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:15,802
who ran away from home since childhood.

534
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,202
Take him down.

535
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:23,276
I want to see if these brothers are really demented.

536
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:24,639
Protect His Majesty.

537
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,510
You're being hasty.

538
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:35,479
Assassin!

539
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:36,922
Protect His Majesty!

540
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,749
Protect His Majesty!

541
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,429
Protect His Majesty!

542
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,962
Your Majesty.

543
00:40:16,252 --> 00:40:18,893
Your Majesty, why is Fan Xian chasing alone?

544
00:40:18,974 --> 00:40:21,443
Why aren't you concerned about my safety?

545
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,840
Your Majesty is blessed with good luck,

546
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,105
nothing will happen to you.

547
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:26,800
- But my son... - Don't worry.

548
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,345
The palace guards have closed off the mountain. Fan Xian will be fine.

549
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:30,809
- But... - Come.

550
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:33,082
Stay with me and enjoy the flowers.

551
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,242
Lord Fan.

552
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:18,719
Aren't you tired?

553
00:42:20,256 --> 00:42:22,557
After an assassination attempt, you don't want to hide in the mountains.

554
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,341
Instead, you want to go back to the capital?

555
00:42:24,831 --> 00:42:27,101
I didn't expect you to chase me so closely.

556
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,880
I mentioned the capital, and you didn't refute,

557
00:42:29,982 --> 00:42:31,572
meaning you were in the capital.

558
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,959
You're rambling.

559
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:37,366
I'll just go along with you.

560
00:42:37,447 --> 00:42:38,850
Why would I bother to refute?

561
00:42:39,575 --> 00:42:40,842
You are right.

562
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:42,400
I was just bluffing.

563
00:42:42,511 --> 00:42:47,621
But now, your reaction confirms you've been hiding in the capital.

564
00:42:48,398 --> 00:42:49,438
Does it matter?

565
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:51,349
You know the guards' movements well.

566
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,440
Why?

567
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:55,110
Because I don't want to hurt you.

568
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,282
You are Si Gu Jian's younger brother.
