00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:31,016
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:34,042
(Episode 16)

3
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:37,482
The one inside the cart, come out!

4
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,998
Lord Fan,

5
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,522
these people come from an impressive background.

6
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,922
They are either from a duke's family or a marquises' family.

7
00:01:50,702 --> 00:01:52,342
Offspring of distinguished generals, huh?

8
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,082
More like distinguished nobles.

9
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,202
I assume some of their fathers are generals.

10
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:01,802
You're right.

11
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,600
However, it's inappropriate for us to strike in public.

12
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,790
- I'll remember their faces - He doesn't dare to come out.

13
00:02:07,814 --> 00:02:09,322
On your behalf.

14
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,799
Why don't we beat them up in private later?

15
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,042
We can beat them up however we like

16
00:02:18,142 --> 00:02:20,631
as long as we don't make it public.

17
00:02:23,462 --> 00:02:24,642
You do have a point.

18
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,282
But today,

19
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,919
I feel like making it public.

20
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:40,475
So, you're Fan Xian, huh?

21
00:02:40,749 --> 00:02:42,190
I heard that you took over

22
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,880
Moon Embracing Pavilion.

23
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:45,682
Can you cut the crap?

24
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:51,005
Do you know who owns Moon Embracing Pavilion?

25
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,522
You don't have the right to take over it.

26
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,839
This is His Highness's property.

27
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,482
You better know what's good for you and return it to us.

28
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,600
If so, I'll spare your life.

29
00:03:02,753 --> 00:03:04,513
So, you're from Prince Cheng Ping's faction.

30
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,919
I guess

31
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:08,552
he has no idea that you're doing this.

32
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,482
You're trying to take it back so that you can gain his favor.

33
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,202
What are you laughing at?

34
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,593
Do you know that you're harming him by doing so?

35
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,082
Who are you trying to intimidate?

36
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,522
Hand over the building.

37
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,002
Do you believe

38
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,600
that I can let you die right here if you don't hand it over?

39
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,710
I don't believe it.

40
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,639
You don't believe that I dare to kill you here?

41
00:03:37,905 --> 00:03:39,682
Brothers, attack!

42
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:03,882
I'm falling!

43
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:09,402
Two.

44
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:11,962
Three...

45
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,522
There he goes.

46
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:27,202
They actually dared to attack Fan Xian?

47
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:29,295
They were raised in comfort and privilege from a young age.

48
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,642
That's why they don't behave well even at this age.

49
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,642
If so, we should prepare ourselves

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,602
and see how we can pick on Fan Xian using this opportunity.

51
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,174
He always wanted to uphold justice, right?

52
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,678
If so, we'll let him uphold justice.

53
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,402
Head to Ye Residence and find Ye Ling Er.

54
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,336
Tell her that I'm under house arrest and that I can't leave.

55
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,680
Tell her to come and see me.

56
00:04:53,222 --> 00:04:54,502
She might not come.

57
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,479
Tell her it's about my dispute with Fan Xian.

58
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:58,304
She'll come.

59
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,440
Miss Ye is close to the princess.

60
00:05:01,693 --> 00:05:03,174
She's close to Fan Xian too.

61
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,200
You want to use her against Fan Xian? I don't think that's possible.

62
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,471
Get me some help.

63
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:20,776
I need to use the ladder.

64
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,242
Get out of the way!

65
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,720
- Get out of the way! - How dare you?

66
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:28,042
My Lord.

67
00:05:28,123 --> 00:05:29,363
Sorry for being late.

68
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:30,762
Get out of the way!

69
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:36,135
Do you know them?

70
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,279
I do.

71
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,666
All of their parents

72
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:42,039
are court officials...

73
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,762
Are you sure you know them?

74
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,639
I...

75
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:52,607
I guess I can't see properly now?

76
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,580
I don't know who they are!

77
00:06:00,134 --> 00:06:02,734
I don't know these buffoons.

78
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:04,960
How dare they stop the chief inspector's carriage?

79
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:06,882
Should I

80
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,119
- arrest them? - You can make the call here.

81
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,503
Take them away!

82
00:06:15,694 --> 00:06:16,694
Yes, sir!

83
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:18,962
Get up!

84
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,602
How dare you arrest me? I'll execute you and your entire clan!

85
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,359
- Don't move! - Guys.

86
00:06:25,454 --> 00:06:27,442
Do some good deeds for once and shut up.

87
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:30,968
My Lord, do we have to arrest them?

88
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,079
Yes.

89
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,599
- And then? - And then,

90
00:06:35,468 --> 00:06:38,238
take their money as compensation for my property.

91
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:40,238
Those brats, they had no respect for me at all.

92
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,042
Our lord is truly wise, right?

93
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,639
Go now.

94
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,642
I think it's Prince Cheng Ze's doing.

95
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:52,479
He's forcing you to fall out with Prince Cheng Ping.

96
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:54,002
I know.

97
00:06:54,258 --> 00:06:56,263
We won't fall for that. Let's return to the First Bureau.

98
00:06:56,287 --> 00:06:58,242
- All right. - Give us all of your money!

99
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,922
- Wang Qi Nian. - Yes, My Lord?

100
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,059
Forget about the First Bureau. Head to the palace.

101
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,065
Wait, My Lord. Didn't you say you don't want to fall for it?

102
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,686
I feel infuriated if I take a step back. I can't tolerate this.

103
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,042
What is he doing up there?

104
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:43,362
I have no idea.

105
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:45,242
Does he greet his guests like this usually?

106
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
No, he doesn't.

107
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,002
Must I go up there as well?

108
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,402
Not necessarily.

109
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,239
His Highness said you don't need to go up if you don't feel like it.

110
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,170
Thank you for coming.

111
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,322
I prepared these for you.

112
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,959
Help yourself.

113
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,282
Why are you sitting here?

114
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,482
Would you believe me

115
00:08:35,735 --> 00:08:39,374
if I said my dispute with Fan Xian was just a misunderstanding?

116
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,416
Why would I? Look at the situation you two are in.

117
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,760
But I still admire him from the heart.

118
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:46,242
You can tell him that yourself.

119
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:47,521
Why did you call me to come?

120
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,602
He might not come to see me.

121
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,962
Our misunderstanding is too deep.

122
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,882
Actually,

123
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,282
I never tried to plot against him.

124
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:02,695
Look into my eyes if you don't believe me.

125
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,042
I swear upon my royal dignity.

126
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,962
Can I ask you something?

127
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,442
Why are you telling me all of this?

128
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,162
I had no choice.

129
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,482
If so, you should tell me

130
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,160
who's capable enough to push you into this situation.

131
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
It's His Majesty.

132
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,079
I wish to stay away from disputes,

133
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,442
but he wouldn't let me.

134
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,520
He said I possessed both wisdom and virtue in front of his subjects.

135
00:09:49,903 --> 00:09:51,495
He appointed me as a prince at the age of 13.

136
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,502
And, I had to join the court sessions at the age of 15.

137
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,282
He wouldn't allow me to leave the capital.

138
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:58,222
He gave me the chance to mingle with the officials and form my faction.

139
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,040
What would the crown prince think about that?

140
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,359
Would the crown prince believe me if I said I didn't intend to compete?

141
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,885
I had no choice but to fall deeper and deeper into the abyss.

142
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:16,311
Now, if I wish to turn back,

143
00:10:18,142 --> 00:10:21,021
I'll suffer a terrible death.

144
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,442
Why did His Majesty do so?

145
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,400
He wants me to be the crown prince's grindstone.

146
00:10:28,604 --> 00:10:30,085
That's heresy.

147
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,925
That's why we're talking on the roof. No one will hear us.

148
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,999
Why are you telling me that

149
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,840
if you're afraid that people might hear us?

150
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:45,602
We're engaged.

151
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,762
Since we have no way to resist it,

152
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,280
you and I will be one

153
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,602
for the rest of our lives.

154
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,562
If I have to find someone

155
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,680
in this world

156
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,642
to confide in,

157
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:04,575
it should be you.

158
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,479
Now, you should believe

159
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,442
that I bear no ill will

160
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,962
toward Fan Xian.

161
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:30,602
Wait.

162
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,562
I'm a little confused.

163
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,082
You're confiding in your fiancé

164
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,520
to prove that it was a misunderstanding between you and Fan Xian?

165
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,588
Don't you feel like something's off?

166
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:48,247
Now, I'm under house arrest.

167
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,642
No one else is willing to see me

168
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,079
except for you.

169
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,955
- So? - So, I hope that you can help me

170
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,119
deliver a memorial to the throne.

171
00:12:01,314 --> 00:12:03,184
- What memorial? - I'm going to recommend someone to the kingdom.

172
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,338
- Who? - Fan Xian.

173
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,042
- Continue. - This is the latest news from the Overwatch Council.

174
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:34,627
Sons of officials and nobles blocked Fan Xian's carriage in public.

175
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,682
Fan Xian retaliated and hurt three of them.

176
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:38,242
Now, all of them

177
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,402
are locked up in the First Bureau.

178
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,682
I thought it was a huge deal.

179
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:44,682
You didn't need to tell me this.

180
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:49,598
Your Majesty, I'm here to get some peace and quiet.

181
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:56,282
You have no idea. The dukes and marquises are at the Overwatch Council.

182
00:12:56,398 --> 00:12:58,118
They're demanding me to release their sons.

183
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,682
Is that why you hid yourself in the palace?

184
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,062
Right now, your quarters is the most peaceful area

185
00:13:05,143 --> 00:13:07,583
both outside and inside the capital.

186
00:13:15,735 --> 00:13:17,094
Why did you avoid that?

187
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,639
Your Majesty,

188
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,640
are you making gunpowder?

189
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:26,759
Yes.

190
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:34,647
Let me ask you this.

191
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,602
Is the First Bureau not willing to release them?

192
00:13:40,806 --> 00:13:42,926
Your Majesty, Fan Xian was the one who arrested them.

193
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:45,367
They should find Fan Xian if they want their sons to be released.

194
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,711
You guys can find Fan Xian, then.

195
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:49,162
Fan Xian?

196
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,562
He's hiding inside the palace too.

197
00:13:56,495 --> 00:13:57,495
Kneel!

198
00:14:06,422 --> 00:14:08,247
Were you the master of Moon Embracing Pavilion?

199
00:14:08,271 --> 00:14:09,722
Fan Si Zhe is the true master.

200
00:14:10,368 --> 00:14:11,928
That means you're one of them too, huh?

201
00:14:12,464 --> 00:14:13,667
Fan Si Zhe said it was a lucrative business.

202
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:15,820
If so, will you eat crap if he tells you to?

203
00:14:15,901 --> 00:14:17,482
Fan Si Zhe won't resort to that.

204
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,002
Why are you speaking up for him?

205
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,570
That's not true.

206
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,160
How dare you instigate the others to stop him in public?

207
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,082
- I didn't do that. - I'll ask you again.

208
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:29,375
- Did you do it or not? - I didn't.

209
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,359
Fine. You don't want to tell me the truth?

210
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,062
Someone, get me a cane.

211
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:37,311
Mother, I didn't tell them to stop him.

212
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,962
Aunt Liu, please be appeased.

213
00:14:40,104 --> 00:14:42,082
His Highness isn't that foolish.

214
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,079
Look at you guys.

215
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,959
Don't you see how angry Aunt Liu is?

216
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,320
You guys are still fishing?

217
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:53,162
Hurry and get a cane for her!

218
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,270
(Mother of Prince Cheng Ping, Noble Consort Liu)

219
00:14:59,294 --> 00:15:00,892
You don't want to tell me the truth, huh?

220
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,334
- Mother, that hurts! - Will you be honest with me or not?

221
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:03,522
Still trying to be stubborn?

222
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:04,996
- Will you tell me or not? - Mother!

223
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,682
Will you tell me or not?

224
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:08,882
- Mother, stop hitting me! - You brat!

225
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,039
Aunt Liu, please calm down.

226
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,240
I'll see if you dare to run away again!

227
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,604
Who told you to run away?

228
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:16,071
Who told you to run away?

229
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,842
I'll beat you to death!

230
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:19,682
Aunt Liu, you should take a break.

231
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:22,162
Brat, how dare you disobey me?

232
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,343
Aunt Liu, you should have some tea.

233
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,962
Mother, it wasn't me!

234
00:15:27,043 --> 00:15:28,563
- You brat. - Stop hitting me.

235
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:30,085
Give me a second. Let me teach him a lesson first.

236
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:32,562
Since I'm free anyway, I'll educate him while I'm at it!

237
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:35,049
- Will you tell me or not? - Mother, I didn't!

238
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,482
Aunt Liu, why don't you go and fish?

239
00:15:37,643 --> 00:15:38,839
The servants are watching.

240
00:15:38,955 --> 00:15:40,520
I don't care who's watching!

241
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:43,093
Fishing eases my boredom. Teaching him a lesson is the same thing!

242
00:15:43,117 --> 00:15:44,442
Will you tell me or not?

243
00:15:44,855 --> 00:15:46,642
How dare you deny it?

244
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,522
But I didn't do it.

245
00:15:49,922 --> 00:15:51,202
You brat!

246
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:54,122
Mother, stop hitting me.

247
00:15:56,742 --> 00:15:58,182
She used a cane?

248
00:15:58,263 --> 00:15:59,642
She did beat him up.

249
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:04,640
Say, should we go and visit them?

250
00:16:04,721 --> 00:16:05,962
It's too late.

251
00:16:07,623 --> 00:16:09,682
- She's done. - That quick?

252
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:12,402
In the end, Fan Xian was the one who stopped her.

253
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,399
Boring.

254
00:16:14,728 --> 00:16:15,962
This is boring.

255
00:16:17,456 --> 00:16:19,495
The show is already over.

256
00:16:24,038 --> 00:16:26,399
I have a question. Why are you always one step ahead of me

257
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,959
when it comes to palace affairs?

258
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:35,562
Your Majesty, it's because the Overwatch Council are your eyes and ears.

259
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:40,842
Seems like Lai Ming Cheng is right.

260
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:44,589
No one can keep the Overwatch Council in check now.

261
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:46,471
He's right.

262
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,882
He has a point.

263
00:16:48,486 --> 00:16:51,246
- Your Majesty, please think twice. - Think twice, huh?

264
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:53,287
You always tell me to think twice.

265
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,482
Think twice about what?

266
00:16:55,877 --> 00:16:58,116
No matter what Lai Ming Cheng said, he was wrong.

267
00:16:58,213 --> 00:17:00,439
His Majesty, it's because you flogged him to death.

268
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:02,343
If everything he said was right...

269
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,319
You're pretty bold, aren't you?

270
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,749
I'm loyal to you, Your Majesty.

271
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:12,622
Therefore, I tell you everything I know.

272
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,680
Aren't you afraid that you'll end up like Lai Ming Cheng one day?

273
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,231
I'll lay down my life for the kingdom gladly. I don't fear death.

274
00:17:21,255 --> 00:17:22,465
Enough already.

275
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,802
You don't fear death, huh?

276
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,602
If so, why did you avoid me just now?

277
00:17:30,952 --> 00:17:32,042
Your Majesty,

278
00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:35,678
not all deaths carry the same significance.

279
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,202
I'm sure you don't see me as significant.

280
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:50,238
What a stubborn child.

281
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:51,602
Please be appeased.

282
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,448
Go now.

283
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:02,166
Why did you let them take it away? I'm not done yet.

284
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,879
Aunt Liu, I think he truly has no idea about what the brats did.

285
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:07,242
I truly had no idea.

286
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,629
Someone is using the opportunity

287
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,482
to drive a wedge between us, Aunt Liu.

288
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:16,479
You should remain in the palace in the future, you hear me?

289
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,239
Xian, look after him for me in the future.

290
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:22,842
When it comes to seniority,

291
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,562
he has to call you Cousin Xian.

292
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:26,735
Aunt Liu, please don't say that. His Highness is a prince.

293
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:28,882
Even so, he has to be reasonable.

294
00:18:29,438 --> 00:18:31,322
- Call Cousin Xian. - Cousin Xian.

295
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,362
He's such a pleasant child.

296
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,710
Come.

297
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:42,402
Those who stopped you came from noble backgrounds, huh?

298
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,639
Yes, their fathers are esteemed figures.

299
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,400
- Did you arrest them? - I did.

300
00:18:46,488 --> 00:18:48,502
- If so, you'll offend many people. - I'm not afraid.

301
00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:50,602
Silly child, how could you not be afraid?

302
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,962
The officialdom is all about building connections.

303
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,159
His Majesty wants me to be a lone subject.

304
00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:57,263
I have no choice but to be impartial and unyielding.

305
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,991
You better don't spout nonsense when you go outside.

306
00:19:04,015 --> 00:19:05,122
I don't dare to.

307
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,242
You're something else. You dare to say anything.

308
00:19:08,766 --> 00:19:11,406
I don't tell outsiders that. But Aunt Liu, you're not an outsider.

309
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,122
It must've been tough on you.

310
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Aunt Liu,

311
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,722
you mustn't let him leave the place in the next few days.

312
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:21,335
I'm worried that people might still try to exploit him.

313
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,727
Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him.

314
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,031
I won't let him leave the place.

315
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,362
I'll make a move, then.

316
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:28,105
Why the rush? Let's chat a little longer.

317
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:30,175
After all, you're his eldest cousin.

318
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:31,562
And, you guys are related.

319
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,158
Visit him when you're free.

320
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,682
Keep him in check on my behalf.

321
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:36,309
Teach him a lesson if you dislike his behavior.

322
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,813
You can lecture him however you like.

323
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,202
What's with that response?

324
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:41,402
What I meant was,

325
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:43,623
Cousin Xian, please visit me often in the future.

326
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,759
All right. I'm sure you remember your lesson now.

327
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:49,002
Get up.

328
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,279
Get up.

329
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,966
Will you head to Moon Embracing Pavilion again?

330
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,038
I won't.

331
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,400
I was tricked before this.

332
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:04,922
Cousin Xian, from now on, Moon Embracing Pavilion is yours.

333
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,202
Aunt Liu, I'll make a move first.

334
00:20:07,265 --> 00:20:09,560
By the way, the palace delivered a batch of yogurt to us.

335
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:10,962
You love them, right?

336
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:13,055
I'll instruct my men to deliver them to your residence.

337
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,295
Yogurt is creamy and tasty indeed.

338
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,402
Thank you, Aunt Liu.

339
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:16,919
You should have dinner before you leave.

340
00:20:16,943 --> 00:20:19,223
No thanks. The dukes are waiting for me.

341
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,599
Xian,

342
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,160
take care, then.

343
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:28,030
Okay. Thank you, Aunt Liu.

344
00:20:35,055 --> 00:20:37,002
Xian, take care.

345
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,560
You should move around more often in the future.

346
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,519
You mean together with Cousin Xian?

347
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,122
But he's in a dispute with Cheng Ze.

348
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,815
Cheng Ze is under house arrest now.

349
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:57,682
Listen,

350
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,122
whether or not

351
00:20:59,294 --> 00:21:01,295
you'll be able to lead a peaceful life in the future

352
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:03,562
might be dependent on your cousin's performance.

353
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,800
Regarding the Moon Embracing Pavilion incident,

354
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,202
someone set this trap for you on purpose.

355
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,082
The imperial palace is a treacherous place.

356
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:16,703
Actually, I don't wish for you to remain in the capital.

357
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,282
Can you understand my feelings?

358
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,480
Mother,

359
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,202
I understand.

360
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,122
Did it hurt when I punished you just now?

361
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,682
Did it hurt?

362
00:21:32,877 --> 00:21:33,877
It didn't.

363
00:21:34,117 --> 00:21:35,117
It didn't?

364
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:36,511
It didn't.

365
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,682
You won't remember your lesson, then.

366
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:40,325
Someone.

367
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,482
Someone! Hurry! Get me the cane!

368
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,319
Did you hear me? Get me the cane! Hurry!

369
00:21:49,648 --> 00:21:51,602
Brat! You better come back!

370
00:21:51,683 --> 00:21:53,962
Listen! I'll punish you until you remember your lesson!

371
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,322
You hear me?

372
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:56,566
Come back!

373
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,602
You'll be the death of me!

374
00:22:07,862 --> 00:22:10,882
Your Majesty, the Ye family has submitted a memorial.

375
00:22:11,671 --> 00:22:13,122
Show it to President Chen first.

376
00:22:13,636 --> 00:22:15,792
- Your Majesty, you're breaking the rules. - Did you think you never

377
00:22:15,816 --> 00:22:17,162
broke the rules before?

378
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,082
Your Majesty, everything you say is right.

379
00:22:29,838 --> 00:22:33,562
It's a joint memorial from the Ye family and Prince Cheng Ze.

380
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,082
Your Majesty,

381
00:22:36,472 --> 00:22:39,202
Fan Xian inherited the books of Zhuang Mo Han.

382
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:40,962
His literary talent is unparalleled.

383
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,602
They recommend Fan Xian to be the examiner of Spring Imperial Examination.

384
00:22:44,694 --> 00:22:46,974
What do you think about the recommendation letter?

385
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,320
Prince Cheng Ze is smart indeed.

386
00:22:50,431 --> 00:22:53,562
He submitted a joint memorial with the Ye family after his house arrest.

387
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,560
He knows the background of the Ye family well.

388
00:22:55,888 --> 00:22:58,282
It's led by Ye Liu Yun, the grandmaster.

389
00:22:58,423 --> 00:23:00,303
Prince Cheng Ze will still have a bright future

390
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,400
ahead of him after submitting this joint memorial.

391
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:07,159
I granted them the marriage.

392
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,200
No matter how smart he is, it's all thanks to you, Your Majesty.

393
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,722
Is that all you figure out?

394
00:23:13,903 --> 00:23:14,903
There's more.

395
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,600
Prince Cheng Ze has a dispute with Fan Xian.

396
00:23:17,727 --> 00:23:20,602
But he recommended him right after it.

397
00:23:20,737 --> 00:23:22,562
It touches my heart.

398
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,773
Let's not talk about the individual.

399
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:27,282
What do you mean?

400
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,602
I was thinking to myself

401
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,360
whether or not it's appropriate for Fan Xian

402
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,280
to host the Spring Imperial Examination at his age.

403
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:48,082
What kind of expression is that?

404
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,569
Your Majesty,

405
00:23:53,247 --> 00:23:54,247
I can't

406
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,202
say for sure.

407
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,120
Your Majesty, you said we shouldn't talk about the individual.

408
00:24:00,331 --> 00:24:02,482
But Fan Xian is an individual.

409
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,932
The Spring Imperial Examination is important.

410
00:24:05,013 --> 00:24:07,493
I dare not cross my boundaries.

411
00:24:07,735 --> 00:24:10,762
Your Majesty, I'll follow your will.

412
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,080
President Chen,

413
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:18,082
you're still as cautious as always.

414
00:24:18,534 --> 00:24:22,082
Your Majesty, I'm loyal to you after all.

415
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:51,122
I did it!

416
00:24:53,814 --> 00:24:55,064
Mr. Fan.

417
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,322
Mr. Fan!

418
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,842
This is His Majesty's oral edict.

419
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,282
What a coincidence. I was just about to leave.

420
00:25:05,668 --> 00:25:06,748
What's His Majesty's order?

421
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,322
According to His Majesty's order,

422
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,656
the Spring Imperial Examination is nearing.

423
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,255
Fan Xian shall serve concurrently as the fourth-rank Central Official.

424
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,402
And, he shall serve as the examiner of the exam.

425
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:20,536
Congratulations, Lord Fan.

426
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,239
The scholars

427
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,322
have to address you as Examiner now.

428
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,762
Central Official?

429
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,080
That's an interesting title.

430
00:25:33,327 --> 00:25:34,887
Did His Majesty make it up on the spot?

431
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,362
Of course not.

432
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,282
The title existed since ancient times.

433
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,562
If so, Eunuch Hou, do you think I should be the central official

434
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,482
in the imperial court?

435
00:25:45,898 --> 00:25:48,202
I don't know about that.

436
00:25:48,287 --> 00:25:51,727
That all depends on His Majesty's will.

437
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,160
Eunuch Hou, thanks for the reminder.

438
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,600
You flatter me.

439
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,294
My words aren't good enough to serve as reminders.

440
00:26:00,318 --> 00:26:01,882
I was just spouting nonsense.

441
00:26:04,023 --> 00:26:06,042
I didn't bring any money with me.

442
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:09,762
Lord Fan, please don't joke with that.

443
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,239
It's inappropriate.

444
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,519
Besides, I dare not do so.

445
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,239
Since I've relayed the oral edict to you,

446
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:17,562
I shall return to my post.

447
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,322
Its head is moving.

448
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:41,322
It was looking at me.

449
00:26:44,983 --> 00:26:46,602
Xian, you're back.

450
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,282
- Young Master. - You guys don't need to bow to me.

451
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,142
Tell your mother to make the dishes blander tomorrow.

452
00:26:55,271 --> 00:26:57,471
- All right, Young Master. - All right, Young Master.

453
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,442
Why are you here?

454
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,922
Is it because you can't bear to do it?

455
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:03,402
I'm done with the sutures.

456
00:27:04,254 --> 00:27:05,442
You're done?

457
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:09,490
I already dressed its wound.

458
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:13,042
It looks pretty energetic.

459
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:14,682
You did a great job.

460
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:16,842
I've read plenty of medical books.

461
00:27:17,296 --> 00:27:19,976
By the way, Xian, your chloroform is pretty effective.

462
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,402
It was unconscious all the way.

463
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:24,371
Weren't you scared?

464
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,602
It wasn't that bad.

465
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:28,656
Have you never thought of what'll happen if you fail?

466
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,002
I could just roast it.

467
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,943
You have a point. However, with such a mindset, you should be a vet.

468
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:35,562
No. I won't do the same with human patients.

469
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,779
Ruo Ruo, you need more than just guts to learn medicine.

470
00:27:40,934 --> 00:27:43,294
You have to be meticulous, and have a pair of steady hands.

471
00:27:44,678 --> 00:27:45,920
What should I do?

472
00:27:50,066 --> 00:27:51,642
Here, hold this.

473
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,122
Put it straight and raise it.

474
00:27:58,232 --> 00:27:59,775
You hid that many needles in your hair?

475
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:01,519
I'm doing it so that my hair looks thicker.

476
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:02,759
You do have a point.

477
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:04,162
Don't keep saying that.

478
00:28:08,028 --> 00:28:10,122
Stabilize your hands. Don't let it fall.

479
00:28:12,598 --> 00:28:13,722
And then?

480
00:28:20,926 --> 00:28:23,166
Say, your hand is pretty steady.

481
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:26,399
After that, you have to learn how to balance it while moving.

482
00:28:26,423 --> 00:28:28,082
Firstly, you have to walk.

483
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,719
After that, you need to practice it

484
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,095
until you can make sure it doesn't fall

485
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,372
when you walk in all directions, or even when you're blindfolded.

486
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:35,877
When I was practicing this,

487
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:37,362
- my teacher said... - And then?

488
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:46,482
You...

489
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,482
Is this your first time trying this?

490
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,630
Yeah.

491
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:53,402
Are your hands this steady?

492
00:28:53,502 --> 00:28:55,142
Don't you think I'm talented in medicine?

493
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,960
I guess so.

494
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,600
- Xian, did you practice this in the past? - I did.

495
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,642
So, you could do the same as me, right?

496
00:29:05,841 --> 00:29:07,402
More or less.

497
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:09,562
Ruo Ruo, you can stop practicing that.

498
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,082
Listen, this is just the first step.

499
00:29:14,364 --> 00:29:15,471
We're just scratching the surface.

500
00:29:15,495 --> 00:29:17,802
These are just insignificant tricks.

501
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,535
When it comes to medicine, you have to read a lot of medical books.

502
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,519
You have to remember the positions of all internal organs and acupoints.

503
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,482
After that, get a fruit.

504
00:29:25,646 --> 00:29:26,958
- A fruit? - That's right.

505
00:29:27,078 --> 00:29:29,060
Get a fruit, slice it, and sew it back.

506
00:29:29,162 --> 00:29:30,959
Keep slicing it and sewing it back.

507
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,136
Not only does that train your hand, but it also trains your thoughtfulness.

508
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,079
I'll remember that. Do I start practicing now?

509
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,362
There's no rush.

510
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,242
That's all for today.

511
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,400
If so, I'll make a move first.

512
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,762
Xian, my IQ almost fell to the ground again.

513
00:29:48,463 --> 00:29:49,842
Wan Er is looking for you.

514
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,200
You're here.

515
00:30:03,374 --> 00:30:05,294
Did you predict that I would visit you at night?

516
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,119
Lord Fan,

517
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,162
you visit me during nighttime more often than daytime.

518
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:14,670
You're making it as if I'm a crook here.

519
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,130
I've heard about the incident where the noble sons stopped you.

520
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,322
I think Cheng Ze instigated them to do so.

521
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:26,519
I know.

522
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,040
He used them as his weapons.

523
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:29,392
For those youngsters,

524
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,719
you should beat them up

525
00:30:30,806 --> 00:30:32,095
and teach them a lesson if it's necessary.

526
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,250
His Majesty is your backer.

527
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,849
Those noblemen don't dare to do anything to you.

528
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,998
At most, I'll visit them and apologize to them

529
00:30:38,022 --> 00:30:39,402
after you beat them up.

530
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:41,519
I'm the princess after all.

531
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:44,160
Even if they feel upset, they can't do anything about it.

532
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,039
Wan Er,

533
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,239
we're a match made in heaven indeed.

534
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,122
The incident might appear to be terrifying,

535
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:02,319
but it doesn't affect you in reality.

536
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,782
If Cheng Ze truly wished to seek revenge against you,

537
00:31:05,806 --> 00:31:07,847
he would've done something more drastic.

538
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,319
So, you think he's just seeking revenge on the surface?

539
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:11,842
He wants you to be at ease

540
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,842
and thinks that he's at his limit.

541
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,479
After that, he'll use his killer technique, huh?

542
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,442
The Spring Imperial Examination is the real deal here.

543
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:26,039
I remembered that he was the one who mentioned this too.

544
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:29,400
If Cheng Ze does want to set you up,

545
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,160
the Spring Imperial Examination will be his best chance.

546
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:37,239
The Spring Imperial Examination is a grand feast for all scholars.

547
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,840
All the hard study behind closed doors,

548
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,802
all the toils under the stars,

549
00:31:42,111 --> 00:31:43,922
all the hardships they've endured,

550
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,959
they did all of those in order to

551
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,042
get a chance to make it big in this examination.

552
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,095
The people will set their sights on the capital

553
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:52,722
for the days ahead.

554
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:55,762
All hopes and despair

555
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:57,642
will be expressed through this event.

556
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,279
You and I are born to be a couple.

557
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,122
We're thinking of the same thing.

558
00:32:04,334 --> 00:32:06,054
We're fated to be together.

559
00:32:06,135 --> 00:32:07,495
You thought the same as well?

560
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,675
Our marriage is right after the exam.

561
00:32:10,699 --> 00:32:13,080
After that, I'll take over the Imperial Treasury.

562
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,950
The Spring Imperial Examination is his only chance of stopping me.

563
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,414
Did you come up with a countermeasure?

564
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:19,758
I was prepared for this long ago.

565
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm just waiting for Li Cheng Ze to make his move.

566
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,348
If so, you have to be careful.

567
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:27,915
But it's fine even if you lose the battle.

568
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,200
At most, you can resign from your post, and we can travel around the world.

569
00:32:38,774 --> 00:32:40,494
Anything is fine as long as you're with me.

570
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,391
Don't touch me. You'll ruin my embroidery.

571
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,802
Speaking of which,

572
00:32:45,895 --> 00:32:47,495
I've been looking at this for some time.

573
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,322
What exactly are you embroidering?

574
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,440
A pair of Mandarin ducks playing in the pond.

575
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,002
Those are Mandarin ducks?

576
00:33:05,822 --> 00:33:07,722
Actually, you did a great job.

577
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,960
Yeah.

578
00:33:09,463 --> 00:33:10,632
Stop pacifying me.

579
00:33:10,752 --> 00:33:12,402
It's my issue.

580
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,202
When I was learning embroidery,

581
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:17,362
I loved to embroider plants and rocks.

582
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:19,762
I didn't like to embroider living beings.

583
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,842
Now that I want to learn it,

584
00:33:22,064 --> 00:33:23,656
it's proving to be too difficult for me.

585
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,002
If so, you can quit, then.

586
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,642
Here, have some water.

587
00:33:29,102 --> 00:33:30,502
This is for you.

588
00:33:30,653 --> 00:33:32,448
I have to embroider a pair of Mandarin ducks for you.

589
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:33,472
It's for me?

590
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:35,922
It's one of the rules of marriage.

591
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,442
What's with the rule?

592
00:33:38,023 --> 00:33:39,562
It's an unspoken rule.

593
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,950
By doing so, I'll show that I'm a qualified noble lady.

594
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:46,695
If so, didn't you practice this in the past?

595
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,322
In the past, I thought I couldn't live until the day of my marriage.

596
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,359
It'll be soon.

597
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,802
We'll get married after the Spring Imperial Examination.

598
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:07,722
By then,

599
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,800
I'll make sure the Mandarin ducks are complete.

600
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,239
Why didn't you like to embroider living beings when you were young?

601
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,882
No matter how good of a job

602
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,482
I did at embroidering,

603
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,322
the objects are dead.

604
00:34:22,654 --> 00:34:24,414
It's as if they're trapped inside the cloth.

605
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,919
I was locked away in the palace since young.

606
00:34:28,031 --> 00:34:29,162
I was sick too.

607
00:34:29,327 --> 00:34:30,607
I couldn't go anywhere.

608
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,242
When I saw these objects,

609
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:34,002
they reminded me of myself.

610
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,730
It felt terrible.

611
00:34:41,937 --> 00:34:43,122
I'm fine now.

612
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,722
Now, I have you.

613
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,202
I grew up in Danzhou.

614
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,442
Danzhou is a harbor.

615
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:57,239
Many boats come and go every day.

616
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:01,922
Whenever the sun sets,

617
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,799
the birds flying on the ocean will soar with the wind.

618
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,239
The view there is filled with life and vigor.

619
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,122
I've never seen such a view before.

620
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:22,122
Actually,

621
00:35:23,311 --> 00:35:25,282
I've never left the capital before.

622
00:35:25,561 --> 00:35:26,842
I'll take you there

623
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,617
after our marriage.

624
00:35:33,095 --> 00:35:34,642
I always had a dream.

625
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,719
When all of my troubles no longer troubles me,

626
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:44,522
I'll take you around the world.

627
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,482
That day will surely arrive.

628
00:36:25,055 --> 00:36:26,202
Innkeeper,

629
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:27,602
do you have an empty room now?

630
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:28,856
The inn was full when I came here yesterday.

631
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,162
The waiter told me to come again and try my luck today.

632
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:32,362
Please wait.

633
00:36:35,647 --> 00:36:37,282
- Are you Mr. Shi? - That's right.

634
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,279
- I'm Shi Chan Li. - You're lucky.

635
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,760
One of our guests had just left.

636
00:36:40,878 --> 00:36:42,197
We have one empty slot.

637
00:36:42,278 --> 00:36:43,368
But it's a four-man room.

638
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:45,775
Mr. Shi, I'll be honest with you.

639
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:47,095
The Spring Imperial Examination is nearing.

640
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,720
Right now, it's difficult to find a place to stay in the capital.

641
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,359
Although a four-man room is noisy,

642
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,583
it's much cheaper.

643
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,111
Mr. Shi, you must be here for the Spring Imperial Examination as well.

644
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,180
Of course.

645
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,655
Since you're one of the participants,

646
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,680
may I take a look at your official document?

647
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,160
I'm not trying to pick on you here.

648
00:37:06,903 --> 00:37:07,952
Since the exam is nearing,

649
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,642
the capital is under strict watch.

650
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:12,762
We have to record the details.

651
00:37:13,176 --> 00:37:15,402
The capital magistrate will do an inspection later on.

652
00:37:15,487 --> 00:37:16,617
No problem.

653
00:37:19,568 --> 00:37:21,839
(Shi Chan Li)

654
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,522
Innkeeper,

655
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,962
is there a cheaper room available?

656
00:37:26,126 --> 00:37:27,562
You want a cheaper room?

657
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,197
It's fine even if I don't get to stay with humans.

658
00:37:29,221 --> 00:37:30,482
Huh?

659
00:37:30,808 --> 00:37:32,122
We don't have such a room.

660
00:37:32,203 --> 00:37:34,682
If so, is there a service

661
00:37:35,414 --> 00:37:36,962
where you'll pay me to stay?

662
00:37:39,152 --> 00:37:40,464
Innkeeper, don't misunderstand me.

663
00:37:40,488 --> 00:37:42,488
I was saying that I could clean the courtyard

664
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:43,897
or serve your guests as a waiter.

665
00:37:43,921 --> 00:37:45,842
I'll use my wage to pay for the room.

666
00:37:46,036 --> 00:37:47,199
Sorry, Mr. Shi.

667
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,840
We have enough workers here.

668
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,842
Let me talk about him first.

669
00:37:50,999 --> 00:37:52,602
Back then, during the village exam,

670
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:55,442
I was leagues above him.

671
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:58,279
But he actually shot to fame

672
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,882
during the civil service exam.

673
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,682
Mr. Shi, are you facing difficulties?

674
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,962
I'll be honest with you. The Spring Imperial Examination is too expensive.

675
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:11,762
I do think there's a solution for you.

676
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,402
- Innkeeper, please tell me. - An official is hosting the exam this time.

677
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,642
Mr. Shi, he might be able to lend you a hand

678
00:38:18,723 --> 00:38:20,842
if you manage to find him.

679
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,736
He's hosting the Spring Imperial Examination?

680
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,042
May I know which official it is?

681
00:38:26,935 --> 00:38:28,042
Lord Fan.

682
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,722
How have you been?

683
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,950
Lord Fan, your literary talent is unparalleled.

684
00:38:32,198 --> 00:38:33,682
People are shocked by your talent.

685
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,482
However, I beg to differ.

686
00:38:35,817 --> 00:38:37,922
Lord Fan, ever since I first saw you,

687
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,279
I knew your talent

688
00:38:40,391 --> 00:38:42,082
was unparalleled.

689
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,722
Who are you?

690
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,360
My Lord,

691
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:56,242
it's me, He Zong Wei.

692
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,602
We've met before.

693
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,170
He...

694
00:39:00,648 --> 00:39:02,962
He Zong Wei? I think I remember you.

695
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,680
You helped Guo Bao Kun

696
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:06,407
in his court case against me in the Judicial Bureau.

697
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:07,642
Was that you?

698
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:11,239
My Lord, the Guo family forced me to do so!

699
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,139
- Enough. Stop kneeling. - I had no choice!

700
00:39:13,163 --> 00:39:15,723
My Lord, I didn't want to do that at all!

701
00:39:15,804 --> 00:39:17,122
Help him up.

702
00:39:17,391 --> 00:39:19,602
Enough. Get up and talk. Come.

703
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,362
Thank you, Lord Wang.

704
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,999
You're He Zong Wei, huh?

705
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,962
But you look different now.

706
00:39:28,622 --> 00:39:30,222
One's thoughts reflect their appearance.

707
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,242
Now that I've left the Guo family,

708
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,842
my aspirations have gotten higher.

709
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:36,202
Therefore, I look better now.

710
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:38,638
If so, it was the Guo family's fault entirely, huh?

711
00:39:38,662 --> 00:39:39,922
It has nothing to do with you?

712
00:39:40,435 --> 00:39:42,242
My Lord, it has nothing to do with me at all.

713
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:45,042
I always wanted to record their evil deeds.

714
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:46,856
My Lord, I was thinking of reporting them to you one day

715
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,999
and rid the kingdom of evildoers!

716
00:39:48,023 --> 00:39:49,623
If so, why didn't you report them to me?

717
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:54,642
My Lord, you were too quick.

718
00:39:54,902 --> 00:39:56,522
Guo You Zhi is already in prison.

719
00:39:56,697 --> 00:39:58,922
And, I've escaped from their clutch too.

720
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,402
It's all thanks

721
00:40:01,207 --> 00:40:02,802
to you, My Lord.

722
00:40:03,432 --> 00:40:06,402
My Lord, you're like my second parent.

723
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:08,079
Don't say that. You look older than me.

724
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:09,320
You're my spiritual parent.

725
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,456
Are you here to reunite with your family?

726
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,959
Everything I've learned was for the sake of the Qing Kingdom.

727
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:14,680
It's for His Majesty and you, My Lord!

728
00:40:14,768 --> 00:40:16,002
Stop right there!

729
00:40:16,742 --> 00:40:18,942
You're here for the Spring Imperial Examination, right?

730
00:40:22,407 --> 00:40:23,489
Indeed.

731
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,362
Why are you looking for me?

732
00:40:27,362 --> 00:40:28,776
I hope that you can take me as your student.

733
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,282
My Lord, your talent is unparalleled.

734
00:40:30,606 --> 00:40:32,282
And, you're my second parent as well.

735
00:40:32,734 --> 00:40:35,374
Scholars like us pursue learning for the sake of virtues.

736
00:40:35,783 --> 00:40:37,383
My Lord, if I don't make you my teacher,

737
00:40:38,008 --> 00:40:40,402
even the heavens won't spare me.

738
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,280
So, you found out that I was the examiner, huh?

739
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:48,362
My Lord, that's definitely not true!

740
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,002
My Lord, I'm sincerely impressed by your talent

741
00:40:51,488 --> 00:40:52,962
My Lord, you know me.

742
00:40:53,094 --> 00:40:55,002
I emphasize virtues the most.

743
00:40:55,383 --> 00:40:56,962
My Lord, I wouldn't have knelt

744
00:40:57,118 --> 00:40:59,799
if the examiner was someone else!

745
00:40:59,883 --> 00:41:01,599
If so, you should stand up and speak.

746
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:02,882
I'll speak while kneeling.

747
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:04,642
I'm truly sincere.

748
00:41:05,078 --> 00:41:06,642
My Lord, I wonder if you're willing

749
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,202
to take me as your adoptive son?

750
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:12,362
Godfather, I'm willing to serve you every day

751
00:41:12,463 --> 00:41:13,682
and be filial to you.

752
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,103
You wanted me to be your teacher just now.

753
00:41:15,127 --> 00:41:16,607
And now, you're calling me Godfather?

754
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,199
Godfather,

755
00:41:18,305 --> 00:41:19,882
I've wandered around most of my life.

756
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,362
I had no one to depend on.

757
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:23,602
Godfather, please fulfill my wish.

758
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,880
My Lord.

759
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,082
Just get up!

760
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,322
My Lord.

761
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:37,181
The First Bureau just delivered a secret report to us.

762
00:41:37,205 --> 00:41:38,842
Do you still remember Shijia Town?

763
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,319
Of course. It's the town that was massacred.

764
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:42,798
Now, there's a survivor.

765
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:46,162
Shi Chan Li?

766
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,015
He came to the capital for the examination

767
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,882
before Shijia Town was burned to the ground.

768
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:52,842
Therefore, he's the only survivor

769
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,682
of Shijia Town.

770
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,279
He arrived at the capital yesterday.

771
00:41:56,303 --> 00:41:59,202
According to the rules, the participants have

772
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,149
to get their identities confirmed before getting a place to stay.

773
00:42:01,173 --> 00:42:03,973
Deng Zi Yue delivered the report to us immediately after receiving it.

774
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,040
The only survivor, huh?

775
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,319
The only survivor of Shijia Town?

776
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,439
And, he already arrived at the capital?

777
00:42:21,463 --> 00:42:23,143
He's staying in one of the capital's inns.

778
00:42:23,745 --> 00:42:25,002
Your Highness,

779
00:42:25,744 --> 00:42:26,744
let me make a trip.

780
00:42:27,034 --> 00:42:28,050
For what?

781
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:30,562
It's a piece of cake for me to assassinate a scholar.

782
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:33,159
Why are you trying to assassinate him?

783
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,722
Aren't we going to silence him?

784
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,882
I told you already.

785
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:40,802
I didn't burn Shijia Town to the ground.

786
00:42:40,966 --> 00:42:42,882
However, he's still a survivor of Shijia Town.

787
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,855
Fan Xian is still keeping an eye on your past dealings with Northern Qi.

788
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:47,442
If so, all the more we can't kill him.

789
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:50,567
Since you already found out, I'm sure the Overwatch Council knows as well.

790
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:52,642
Just let him investigate the case.

791
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:55,759
I'm also curious about the perpetrator

792
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,600
who burned the town to the ground.
