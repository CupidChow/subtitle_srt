(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:34,004
(Episode 4)

3
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:41,101
I knew you were still alive!

4
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:42,562
Everyone said that you were dead.

5
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,150
Why does it feel like it's been a few years since I saw you?

6
00:01:44,174 --> 00:01:45,242
Lower your volume.

7
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,242
Didn't you go to Northern Qi as a diplomat?

8
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,202
Why are you back before the convoy?

9
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,002
Did you get in trouble?

10
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:57,029
Are you the master of Moon Embracing Pavilion?

11
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,339
You figured it out?

12
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,200
I've been so busy talking to you, I've lost track of my ledgers.

13
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,780
Stand there.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,100
Look at me.

15
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,002
I'll ask you again,

16
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,562
is Moon Embracing Pavilion your business?

17
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,922
Don't grind your teeth at me like that.

18
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,762
Jealousy and envy won't get you anywhere.

19
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:20,295
Even between brothers, money matters should be settled clearly.

20
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,419
Xian, let me tell you,

21
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,699
every brick and tile,

22
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:25,337
every blade of grass in Moon Embracing Pavilion,

23
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,762
they're all the results of my efforts.

24
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,082
Moon Embracing Pavilion is mine...

25
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,522
It's our Fan family's business.

26
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,519
Why did you open Moon Embracing Pavilion?

27
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,642
To make money, of course.

28
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,482
I should be questioning instead.

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,240
Our bookstore was doing just fine, and then you went off to Northern Qi.

30
00:02:44,326 --> 00:02:46,326
What's that term you used again? Oh, update.

31
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,722
You stopped updating,

32
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:50,016
and the readers are demanding updates, what was I supposed to do?

33
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,776
There's no update for "Dream of the Red Chamber."

34
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,480
Does anyone in the family know about this?

35
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,802
No, they don't know.

36
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,135
I've been keeping it from them.

37
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,562
I want to give them a surprise.

38
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:01,362
So, this was all your idea?

39
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,962
No one forced you?

40
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:05,358
I really don't get you.

41
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,842
Making money is such a good thing,

42
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:08,562
why would anyone need to be forced?

43
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,559
If you don't mind,

44
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,162
I'd like to ask you something too.

45
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,402
You've been in Northern Qi for so long, have you...

46
00:03:15,286 --> 00:03:16,386
I...

47
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,242
Have you lost your mind? Why are you hitting me?

48
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,002
Who is he with?

49
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,679
Isn't Master Fan alone up there?

50
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:27,122
What's that noise?

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,482
Every blade of grass, huh?

52
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:31,962
Every brick and tile, huh?

53
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,402
It's all yours, huh? All yours!

54
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:36,049
All yours!

55
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:38,539
I'm going to kill you!

56
00:03:54,823 --> 00:03:55,903
I...

57
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:57,091
This won't hurt him.

58
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,539
Fan Xian,

59
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,042
even my father never hit me this hard.

60
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,220
What gives you the right?

61
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,162
You run Moon Embracing Pavilion?

62
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:13,442
Yes, I run it. You have a problem with it? Are you jealous?

63
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,531
What about Old Man Jin?

64
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:17,602
I don't know any Old Man Jin.

65
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,480
Stop saying things I don't understand.

66
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,599
I've put up with you for too long, Fan Xian.

67
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,889
Who do you think you are?

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,761
Believe it or not, I can call my men up here now and break your legs.

69
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,042
I haven't called anyone yet.

70
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,682
Fan Si Zhe,

71
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,282
you can save the trouble.

72
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,722
I'll be honest with you.

73
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,242
I sneaked back to the capital,

74
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,122
and I'm in trouble.

75
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,562
If you go out and tell them Fan Xian is here,

76
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,879
I'm done for.

77
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:06,366
It'll be worse than having my legs broken, I might even die.

78
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,202
Stop trying to gain sympathy from me.

79
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,442
- You really think I won't dare to call them? - Go ahead. I'll wait here.

80
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,136
You will only feel satisfied if you take revenge yourself. Go on.

81
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,440
All right.

82
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,882
You're screwed.

83
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,802
Just you wait. Stay here.

84
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:20,482
Guards! Come here!

85
00:05:21,474 --> 00:05:22,796
Get over here!

86
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,202
We're here, Master Fan.

87
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:27,842
I've been bullied.

88
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,879
Who bullied you, Master Fan?

89
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,402
Gather all our men.

90
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:32,762
Is everyone here?

91
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:34,322
Why are there only a few of you?

92
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,200
Where are our 300 warriors?

93
00:05:36,318 --> 00:05:38,398
Get them all here. Get them here!

94
00:05:38,493 --> 00:05:41,082
What's going on? Is our ledger a mess...

95
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:43,642
What happened to you?

96
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,562
Master Fan, whose legs did you say you wanted us to break?

97
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,770
That Fan...

98
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:49,522
Who?

99
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,720
Fan who? Whose legs?

100
00:05:52,831 --> 00:05:54,642
I mean the table's legs.

101
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,119
The dining... The dining table.

102
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:57,562
The dining table?

103
00:05:57,782 --> 00:05:59,482
Who is this "dining table"?

104
00:06:03,055 --> 00:06:04,962
It just tripped me and made me fall hard.

105
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,322
Tomorrow, I want you to replace it with tea table!

106
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,402
- Tea table? - Move!

107
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,660
He...

108
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,882
Where are your men?

109
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,242
Earlier,

110
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,962
you said if I called someone up,

111
00:06:37,193 --> 00:06:39,602
you'd be done for. Was that true?

112
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:40,824
Yes.

113
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,880
Well, I just saved your life then.

114
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:51,762
I'll let you off this time,

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,362
but don't get too happy.

116
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,700
I'm still mad at you.

117
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,162
Who gave you the right to hit me?

118
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,059
Hang on.

119
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,842
Are you all right?

120
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,939
I'm fine.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,362
My internal energy has been acting up lately.

122
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,442
I got too worked up when I hit you,

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,322
and it went out of control again.

124
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,522
You should've stayed calm.

125
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:19,802
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,442
What do I have to be sorry for?

127
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,642
Did you take away Mrs. Teng and her son?

128
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,760
What?

129
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,380
Who?

130
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:33,682
Teng Zi Jing's widow.

131
00:07:34,568 --> 00:07:36,997
I took them away? To where? Moon Embracing Pavilion?

132
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:40,367
No way. Zi Jing and I were friends.

133
00:07:40,448 --> 00:07:42,082
Why would I do such a despicable thing?

134
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,362
You don't know?

135
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,600
Who told you we had them here? Do you have any evidence?

136
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,762
Someone saw it.

137
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,481
- I'll ask around. - Come back.

138
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:56,202
What about the forced prostitution?

139
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:00,922
What nonsense are you talking about? That's absurd.

140
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,359
Moon Embracing Pavilion is a refined establishment.

141
00:08:03,446 --> 00:08:04,762
Isn't it a brothel?

142
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,242
You're driving me mad.

143
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:08,642
Let me explain it to you.

144
00:08:09,774 --> 00:08:12,722
You thought Moon Embracing Pavilion is a brothel?

145
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,482
Think about it, if we open a brothel in the capital,

146
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:17,384
there are already a few well-established ones.

147
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:19,408
So, it's not exactly something new in the capital.

148
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:20,922
And how are we going to compete

149
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:22,655
with those well-established businesses?

150
00:08:22,797 --> 00:08:24,762
So, we have to find another path.

151
00:08:24,913 --> 00:08:27,242
Besides,

152
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,544
if word gets out that a child of the Fan family

153
00:08:29,646 --> 00:08:32,042
runs a brothel, Father will kill me.

154
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,762
So, all those girls earlier were fake?

155
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,399
They were real, but not... They absolutely aren't what you imagine.

156
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,280
Don't get the wrong idea. They're not in the flesh trade.

157
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,040
The girls I've chosen must be well-educated and talented in various arts

158
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,017
like music, chess, calligraphy, and painting,

159
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:49,538
proficient in poetry and literature.

160
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:51,035
After all, entertaining people with sex

161
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:52,562
is the lowest form of entertainment.

162
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:54,802
My goal is to turn Moon Embracing Pavilion

163
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,545
into the only sanctuary

164
00:08:57,632 --> 00:09:00,042
in the bustling capital,

165
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,162
where scholars and literati

166
00:09:02,262 --> 00:09:05,762
can find their true soulmates.

167
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,282
That's the uniqueness I aim for.

168
00:09:12,305 --> 00:09:14,962
And you don't know anything about Old Man Jin's death?

169
00:09:16,053 --> 00:09:18,962
You keep talking about Old Man Jin. Who exactly is he?

170
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,580
And he died here?

171
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:22,045
My business has just opened,

172
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:24,096
if someone dies here, how am I supposed to do business?

173
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,002
Which rival is trying to ruin my reputation?

174
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,562
I'll confront them face to face.

175
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:45,002
Has anyone entered Master Fan's room?

176
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,300
No.

177
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,762
So, he just fell by himself?

178
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:34,073
How can I help you?

179
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,042
I just want to check on your injuries.

180
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:38,123
Took you long enough.

181
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,802
I thought I'd give you some time. Didn't want to disturb you.

182
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,442
I'm fine. It's nothing serious.

183
00:10:46,368 --> 00:10:48,427
- You may go. - No need to walk me out.

184
00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:51,402
You need me?

185
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:53,922
I do need you.

186
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,100
- What can I... - Hold on.

187
00:10:58,815 --> 00:11:03,682
I've thought about those fallacies you told me about earlier,

188
00:11:04,324 --> 00:11:06,522
and there do have some truth to it.

189
00:11:08,054 --> 00:11:10,402
Going through the ledgers alone here

190
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,722
can be a little boring.

191
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,042
See, you've gained some insight after that fall.

192
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,475
I've grown.

193
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:24,242
There was this tall girl

194
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:29,319
playing the pipa just now, is she still around?

195
00:11:29,414 --> 00:11:30,802
Have her come

196
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,642
and play a piece for me,

197
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,282
I'd like to enjoy it.

198
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,722
There's nothing better than having a beautiful companion.

199
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,640
Just the pipa? Or would you like a whole set of instruments?

200
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,522
No need for more,

201
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,779
just the pipa.

202
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:44,507
I'll be back.

203
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,540
No need to walk me out.

204
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,722
Remember what I taught you.

205
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:02,079
Smile more later. Don't make any mistakes.

206
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,240
Got it?

207
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,936
I'm telling you, your chance to marry the rich

208
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,842
depends entirely on your performance today.

209
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,082
Don't mess it up.

210
00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:11,316
Got it.

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,040
Let me see.

212
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,220
You're good.

213
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,820
Come in.

214
00:12:33,972 --> 00:12:35,202
Why are you still here?

215
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,362
I don't need you here.

216
00:12:39,536 --> 00:12:41,762
I'll call you when we're done.

217
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:01,082
You caught me.

218
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:02,882
I figured so. Go.

219
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,340
Please stay.

220
00:13:17,286 --> 00:13:18,386
Xian...

221
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,362
Sit here, take a breather.

222
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,060
Is she the one?

223
00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:28,193
Sang Wen, Miss Sang.

224
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,180
Miss Sang.

225
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,882
Let me ask something.

226
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,522
What business does Moon Embracing Pavilion do?

227
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,451
It's a brothel, of course.

228
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,922
How could it be a brothel?

229
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,562
You're the owner, shouldn't you know?

230
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:51,720
Xian, I really had no idea.

231
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:53,562
Yuan Meng handled everything on her own.

232
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,962
It's your own business. Don't you come here usually?

233
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,722
I only come to check the accounts.

234
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,442
I don't get involved otherwise.

235
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:02,642
I don't even like singing and dancing.

236
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,882
Tell me, Miss Sang,

237
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:08,802
is it true that this place

238
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:10,842
forces women into prostitution?

239
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,282
They're kept in the backyard.

240
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,960
Xian, I promise I'll investigate thoroughly.

241
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,282
You want to investigate it?

242
00:14:18,662 --> 00:14:21,211
Of course, why wouldn't I? I've been deceived too. I'm also a victim.

243
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,103
You're the owner. If you investigate, how will you explain it to people?

244
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:25,402
I can't explain it.

245
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,482
I say, will you two just sit closer? You're torturing me.

246
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,820
Fan Si Zhe,

247
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,160
you think you're very capable now, huh?

248
00:14:35,303 --> 00:14:37,927
Every brick and tile, every blade of grass belongs to you, huh?

249
00:14:38,384 --> 00:14:41,322
- Your business, huh? - No, Xian.

250
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,482
Actually, I admit I might have exaggerated a little earlier.

251
00:14:47,632 --> 00:14:50,082
Tell me, where did you hire Yuan Meng from?

252
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:51,362
She wasn't hired by me.

253
00:14:51,445 --> 00:14:52,602
Aren't you the owner?

254
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,843
I'm not the only owner.

255
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,002
Who else?

256
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,737
Have we been making money recently?

257
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:02,122
Of course we have.

258
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:04,922
I thought so. How much have we made?

259
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:06,713
Master Fan is inside checking the accounts.

260
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:08,642
Why don't you go in and have a look with him?

261
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,940
So, my cousin is here.

262
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:14,122
Cousin? The second owner here calls you cousin?

263
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:17,602
He's a relative from my mother's side.

264
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,552
- Which family's child is he? - The royal family.

265
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,802
He's a son of the royal family.

266
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,882
My mother is a cousin of Noble Consort Yi, right?

267
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:30,760
So, Noble Consort Yi's son and I should be considered cousins, right?

268
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:32,642
Noble Consort Yi's son...

269
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,402
- He's the third prince? - Yes, that's my cousin.

270
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:38,562
Lord Fan, maybe I should leave first.

271
00:15:38,784 --> 00:15:39,884
Why leave?

272
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,682
I dare not listen anymore. I fear the more I know, the shorter I'll live.

273
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,605
Just stay.

274
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:47,905
What you should and shouldn't hear, you've heard them all.

275
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:49,202
It's too late now.

276
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,000
The color of these curtains isn't right,

277
00:15:58,247 --> 00:15:59,562
especially these drapes.

278
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,722
What color do you think would be better?

279
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,505
- Blue. - All right.

280
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,162
No.

281
00:16:07,744 --> 00:16:08,946
Pink is better.

282
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,562
Pink it is then.

283
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:12,282
Purple seems nice too.

284
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:14,362
Purple then?

285
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:16,927
It's best to have all three colors,

286
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,180
mixed in with black.

287
00:16:18,288 --> 00:16:19,518
At first glance, it looks black,

288
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:22,402
but upon closer inspection, you'll see blue, pink, and purple.

289
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,962
Replace them with colorful black.

290
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,000
This candlestick isn't right. It doesn't look good.

291
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,120
We'll replace it.

292
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:36,464
Get one that's sturdier and more imposing.

293
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,980
Got it.

294
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,282
It should also have a delicate and refined feel to it.

295
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,040
Replace it with a candlestick that's both thick and slender.

296
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,322
Master Li,

297
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,349
Master Fan is upstairs checking the accounts.

298
00:16:58,373 --> 00:17:00,122
Why don't you go up and take a look too?

299
00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:01,482
There's no rush.

300
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,136
The reason why I opened Moon Embracing Pavilion,

301
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,498
making money isn't the most important thing.

302
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:06,782
What matters most is making money.

303
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:15,282
Do you understand what he said just now?

304
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,602
Money isn't easy to come by these days.

305
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,122
Still don't get it?

306
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,760
Let me explain it from the beginning.

307
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:35,562
The truth is, he's doing this for honor.

308
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,820
Honor?

309
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,839
No matter what business he's in,

310
00:17:39,905 --> 00:17:41,202
as long as it makes money,

311
00:17:41,288 --> 00:17:45,202
it proves he has vision, strength, and capability.

312
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:48,402
And he can make his mother proud in the palace.

313
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:50,674
Hang on, he thought he could make

314
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:52,255
his mother proud by running a brothel here?

315
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,279
What's he thinking?

316
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,767
No, Xian, didn't I just say?

317
00:17:54,848 --> 00:17:57,239
Both my cousin and I were deceived by bad people.

318
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,400
We didn't know Moon Embracing Pavilion is a brothel.

319
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,202
Didn't Noble Consort Yi ask about it?

320
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,722
Like me, my cousin wanted to surprise his mother.

321
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,642
Then where did he hire Yuan Meng from?

322
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,844
I really don't know.

323
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:13,080
Why are you so fixated on Yuan Meng?

324
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:14,682
- You still don't get it? - This...

325
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,759
Doesn't that clash with this color?

326
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,849
This red one, replace it with...

327
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:20,101
With...

328
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,842
- Purple. - Got it.

329
00:18:23,046 --> 00:18:25,352
- Hang on, that... - That's him?

330
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,882
Got it.

331
00:18:27,217 --> 00:18:30,017
- Got it. - This doesn't look good either.

332
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,562
Replace it with purple.

333
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:34,122
The color looks too heavy. That won't do.

334
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,760
There are still many areas that can be improved.

335
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:38,595
I'll think about it, and tell you later.

336
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:39,792
All right.

337
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,282
Is Si Zhe upstairs?

338
00:18:42,648 --> 00:18:45,568
Master Fan is meticulous, he's upstairs checking the accounts by himself.

339
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,689
- He's checking the accounts alone? - He's accompanied by our singer.

340
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:50,573
Si Zhe has never enjoyed listening to music.

341
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:52,202
Let's go take a look.

342
00:18:56,017 --> 00:18:57,267
Slow down.

343
00:19:03,582 --> 00:19:05,522
Si Zhe, I'm coming in.

344
00:19:06,316 --> 00:19:07,416
Come in.

345
00:19:14,297 --> 00:19:16,977
I thought you were listening to music. Why are you playing instead?

346
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,482
Don't even get me started.

347
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,450
How did you train her?

348
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,722
She even plays worse than me.

349
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:24,762
Go back and practice more.

350
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:33,522
What did I just tell you?

351
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,122
You can't even do this right.

352
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,260
Get out of here.

353
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,722
Back when I was a courtesan at Liujing River,

354
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:48,722
I was the best at playing pipa.

355
00:19:48,905 --> 00:19:50,005
Get up!

356
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,619
Get out!

357
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:55,802
Just call for me if you want to hear it later.

358
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,762
Si Zhe, I can sing too.

359
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:00,975
Shall I sing for you?

360
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,962
Knock it off. Where did you hire these people from?

361
00:20:07,952 --> 00:20:10,522
Who are you?

362
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:30,082
So, they're in there?

363
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,980
Your Highness, we're here.

364
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,402
(Moon Embracing Pavilion)

365
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,015
- Are you sure Fan Xian is in there right now? - Absolutely.

366
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,139
Come with me.

367
00:20:45,273 --> 00:20:46,722
Your Highness, I...

368
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,682
You shouldn't be overly cautious.

369
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,800
Those who constantly leave themselves a way out

370
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,279
often find themselves in a dead end.

371
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,580
As you command.

372
00:20:53,703 --> 00:20:55,442
Very wise. Let's go,

373
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,922
let's watch the fun.

374
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:19,042
Did you kill him?

375
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,384
I knocked him out.

376
00:21:20,465 --> 00:21:23,385
- He passed out just like that? - I'm a martial arts expert, after all.

377
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:25,482
How's your internal energy?

378
00:21:25,656 --> 00:21:26,882
It'll get better in a while.

379
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,199
What should I tell him when he wakes up?

380
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,642
He saw you.

381
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,642
Say something. What's going on?

382
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,002
What are these men doing here?

383
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,842
What is Prince Cheng Ze doing here?

384
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,922
He's here for me.

385
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,122
He knows you're here?

386
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,242
Just a reminder,

387
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:21,590
this building is surrounded from all sides.

388
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:22,771
There's nowhere to escape.

389
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,322
Forget about climbing through windows onto the roof.

390
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,962
Open the door. Let's welcome them in.

391
00:22:30,094 --> 00:22:31,554
But I thought you couldn't be seen by anyone.

392
00:22:31,578 --> 00:22:33,825
A door can't stop a prince. Open it.

393
00:22:44,904 --> 00:22:46,004
Your Highness.

394
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:55,282
Young Master, how have you been?

395
00:22:55,743 --> 00:22:57,762
Qi Nian, what are you...

396
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,922
What a party.

397
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,282
What is he...

398
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:13,540
- He's probably tired. He's taking a nap. - What is that...

399
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,459
I was kicked by a donkey.

400
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:24,682
Fan Xian,

401
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,522
it's been a long time.

402
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,162
It hasn't been that long.

403
00:23:32,425 --> 00:23:34,242
It's been less than

404
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,719
half a year,

405
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,611
but it feels like it's been two or three years since I last saw you.

406
00:23:39,312 --> 00:23:40,602
It's been boring in the capital

407
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,419
without you.

408
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,682
You know,

409
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,442
Yan Xiao Yi tried to assassinate me

410
00:23:45,576 --> 00:23:47,122
on my way to Northern Qi.

411
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,360
Really?

412
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,002
I've been curious about

413
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,242
how he knew my itinerary.

414
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,690
I didn't tell anyone

415
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,050
which route I would take.

416
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,320
So how did he find out?

417
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,682
It's quite simple, actually.

418
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,962
If one knew which route I wouldn't take,

419
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:04,882
they could deduce my itinerary.

420
00:24:04,973 --> 00:24:06,933
Going north, I wouldn't go through Fengming Pass.

421
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,722
It's too far.

422
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,360
Not taking Fengming Pass but not wanting to take the longer route,

423
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,202
which route would I choose?

424
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,682
It's straightforward, isn't it?

425
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:20,899
So,

426
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,684
it has always been you who conspired

427
00:24:23,786 --> 00:24:25,482
with the elder princess to try to kill me.

428
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,620
Fan Xian,

429
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,322
actually,

430
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:41,540
Moon Embracing Pavilion's human trafficking case is easily verifiable.

431
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:44,642
Both the first and the second owners are here,

432
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,944
along with our supposedly deceased Poetic Genius Fan here.

433
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:48,682
The situation couldn't be clearer.

434
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:54,083
Indeed, even if I say I have nothing to do with Moon Embracing Pavilion,

435
00:24:54,255 --> 00:24:55,602
no one will believe me.

436
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,882
Actually, at this point,

437
00:24:58,007 --> 00:24:59,967
human trafficking is no longer your main concern.

438
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,439
Fan Xian,

439
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:03,171
you faking your own death to deceive His Majesty

440
00:25:03,195 --> 00:25:05,602
is the real capital offense.

441
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,060
Nonetheless,

442
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,042
I must thank Lord Wang Qi Nian.

443
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,616
We've been planning this for so long, but we wouldn't have been able

444
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,962
to catch you without him.

445
00:25:17,943 --> 00:25:19,282
He has always been good

446
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,562
at his job.

447
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,722
Qi Nian,

448
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,002
you're a traitor!

449
00:25:35,225 --> 00:25:36,325
Your Highness,

450
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:40,250
now that Lord Fan is in your hands,

451
00:25:41,118 --> 00:25:42,922
I implore you to honor your promise

452
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:47,042
and return my wife and daughter.

453
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:48,922
I don't have them.

454
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:51,162
Your Highness, you promised.

455
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,882
I've told you very clearly,

456
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,442
anything I have, I can give you,

457
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,562
but I really don't have your wife and daughter.

458
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,122
I did send my men to fetch them,

459
00:26:01,438 --> 00:26:02,722
but we were late.

460
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:04,722
They were already gone.

461
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,122
They're really not with Your Highness?

462
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:08,359
I'm telling the truth.

463
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,282
Don't panic.

464
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:12,882
Once this is over,

465
00:26:12,968 --> 00:26:14,362
I'll help you find them.

466
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,202
Where could they have gone?

467
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:40,682
(Moon Embracing Pavilion)

468
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,100
My Lord,

469
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,002
I thought they were taken by His Highness.

470
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,540
I understand.

471
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,602
Actually, I find it quite strange too.

472
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,682
Someone took them away

473
00:27:06,064 --> 00:27:07,164
without making any demands.

474
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,802
Indeed, unlike you, right?

475
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,410
You always kidnap people for leverage.

476
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,202
It doesn't matter.

477
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:18,762
At this point, I'm actually a little touched by myself.

478
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,682
Even in this situation,

479
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:23,802
I still want to give you a chance.

480
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,802
If you agree to become my ally,

481
00:27:26,032 --> 00:27:27,729
I'll release Mrs. Teng and her son immediately.

482
00:27:27,753 --> 00:27:30,442
And Moon Embracing Pavilion's troubles will go away.

483
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,028
At this point, you think you're the one who has to forgive me?

484
00:27:35,128 --> 00:27:36,228
It's all the same.

485
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,002
Everyone makes mistakes in life.

486
00:27:39,231 --> 00:27:41,802
Let it go, and all will be well.

487
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:43,962
Let it go?

488
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,282
How can I let it go?

489
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,218
This place is trading people and forcing them into prostitution,

490
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:50,122
who will release those people of suffering?

491
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,439
Who will release them of suffering? That's on you.

492
00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:54,184
They're suffering because of you.

493
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,939
I don't care about them,

494
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:57,522
I care about you.

495
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,765
As long as you agree to be my ally,

496
00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:00,842
won't you have the final say over those people?

497
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,500
Two choices,

498
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,362
either reconcile

499
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,393
or I kill you.

500
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:16,212
I see.

501
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,202
I will not reconcile!

502
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:23,519
Li Cheng Ze, we are not the same kind of people.

503
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,282
We're destined to be enemies!

504
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:33,882
What a pity.

505
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,800
The Judicial Bureau is on a case! Put your weapons down!

506
00:28:51,488 --> 00:28:52,506
Don't move.

507
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,700
Don't move.

508
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,540
No one moves.

509
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,765
You're supposed to be dead, how did you manage

510
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:07,709
to summon the officers from the Judicial Bureau?

511
00:29:09,139 --> 00:29:11,962
No, even if you weren't dead, you couldn't have summoned them.

512
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,980
Who could it be?

513
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:20,282
Greetings, Your Highness!

514
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,202
Continue with your tasks. Spare the formalities.

515
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,282
Cheng Ze, you're here too.

516
00:29:51,513 --> 00:29:53,042
Greetings, Your Highness.

517
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,322
We're family, don't stand on ceremony.

518
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,682
Shall we have a chat?

519
00:30:10,922 --> 00:30:12,202
Spare the formalities, everyone.

520
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,380
Your Highness.

521
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,962
What's with this boy?

522
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,602
He's tired. He's taking a nap.

523
00:30:28,384 --> 00:30:29,496
He's taking a nap like this?

524
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,442
He's still growing. He needs to get enough rest.

525
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:33,689
I was like him when I was younger.

526
00:30:33,745 --> 00:30:35,404
- I understand. - Understand my foot!

527
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,889
What happened to your face?

528
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,242
He was kicked by a donkey.

529
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,842
You seem to know everything, Cheng Ze.

530
00:30:49,752 --> 00:30:52,922
Your Highness, what brings you here?

531
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,816
I had some free time. When I saw the officials from the Judicial Bureau

532
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,416
conducting an investigation, I followed along.

533
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,642
What investigation?

534
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,399
The Moon Embracing Pavilion.

535
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,442
Human trafficking is a capital offense.

536
00:31:01,572 --> 00:31:02,892
I had to come and see for myself.

537
00:31:02,932 --> 00:31:05,322
Who would have thought I'd run into you here?

538
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,122
Perhaps you should come back tomorrow.

539
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,642
You'd better think twice before you speak and act.

540
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:13,762
Think about what?

541
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,200
- How should I think? - Fan Xian deceived His Majesty.

542
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,442
That's a capital offense.

543
00:31:19,174 --> 00:31:20,882
Are you really going to protect him?

544
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,530
But isn't he really dead?

545
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:25,922
Then who is this person in front of you?

546
00:31:33,918 --> 00:31:35,642
Cheng Ze, don't scare me.

547
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:37,442
I don't see anyone in front of me.

548
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:46,282
You'd better think about the consequences.

549
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,160
Sheltering someone who deceives His Majesty is equally guilty.

550
00:31:49,393 --> 00:31:51,642
I've been quite exhausted lately.

551
00:31:51,801 --> 00:31:53,642
I'm blind and deaf,

552
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:55,242
what crime have I committed?

553
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,242
Do you think you'll still be able

554
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,922
to protect him if this escalates?

555
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,899
I don't know. Let's try.

556
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,602
The Judicial Bureau is on a case.

557
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:21,279
Anyone who obstructs them will be treated as guilty of treason.

558
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,999
Have you thought about how this would end?

559
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,774
No, Why don't you think about it?

560
00:32:27,866 --> 00:32:29,202
If I may ask,

561
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,762
how did you know I would come to Moon Embracing Pavilion today?

562
00:32:40,914 --> 00:32:42,202
Wang Qi Nian...

563
00:32:42,376 --> 00:32:43,826
Oh, Your Highness,

564
00:32:43,907 --> 00:32:47,682
this is all Lord Fan Xian's fault.

565
00:32:48,312 --> 00:32:51,274
I'm actually kind and honest in nature.

566
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,642
Fan Xian went to Moon Embracing Pavilion?

567
00:32:54,865 --> 00:32:56,082
Yes, Your Highness.

568
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:58,122
And you still have to visit Cheng Ze later?

569
00:32:58,295 --> 00:32:59,522
Lord Fan said

570
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:02,522
that as long as Your Highness gets the timing right,

571
00:33:02,693 --> 00:33:05,282
you can trap him in Moon Embracing Pavilion.

572
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,962
Fan Xian is using himself as bait?

573
00:33:12,126 --> 00:33:15,442
He hopes Your Highness enjoys the catch.

574
00:33:18,632 --> 00:33:19,962
It's a trap in disguise.

575
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,409
You really fooled me.

576
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:24,613
It's all because Lord Fan has a devious mind.

577
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,290
I was just following orders.

578
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:28,998
If your wife and daughter were really in my hands,

579
00:33:29,022 --> 00:33:30,962
I would've handed them over to you earlier.

580
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:32,939
Thankfully,

581
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,602
they're not in your hands.

582
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,122
That's much safer.

583
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,080
You did such a good job tricking me.

584
00:33:40,175 --> 00:33:41,962
Oh, I'm ashamed.

585
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,329
Wang Qi Nian, you're such a natural liar.

586
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:46,776
You've even fooled me. You must have done this often.

587
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,162
No, no.

588
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:53,082
I've always been an honest person.

589
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,260
It's all because of Lord Fan's influence.

590
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,241
Cheng Ze,

591
00:33:59,377 --> 00:34:00,603
your men have drawn their swords.

592
00:34:00,627 --> 00:34:01,759
Why are you still chatting?

593
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,202
Swords? What swords?

594
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:09,522
So no swords are drawn. Let's sit down and talk then.

595
00:34:19,872 --> 00:34:21,389
We're brothers,

596
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,729
and you're the crown prince.

597
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,202
Drawing swords in front of you is considered treason.

598
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,282
That was just a joke, don't take it seriously.

599
00:34:28,363 --> 00:34:29,902
It's exactly because we're brothers,

600
00:34:29,983 --> 00:34:31,312
I have to give you an advice.

601
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,562
You shouldn't have come to Moon Embracing Pavilion.

602
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,249
People will talk if they see you here.

603
00:34:36,425 --> 00:34:37,922
The owner of Moon Embracing Pavilion

604
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,562
is from the Fan family.

605
00:34:40,136 --> 00:34:42,815
But its second owner is your younger brother, who is still growing.

606
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:44,995
He is your younger brother too.

607
00:34:45,076 --> 00:34:46,482
You're mistaken, Cheng Ze.

608
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,039
The crown prince doesn't fall into the category of princes.

609
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:51,159
He might be younger than me, but he's third in line.

610
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,362
So, he doesn't count as my brother.

611
00:34:53,465 --> 00:34:55,215
So, what? Are you going to take me down today?

612
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,370
Don't say that. I do see you as my brother.

613
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:59,862
Once we step out of this door, I won't bring this up again.

614
00:34:59,886 --> 00:35:01,840
And how should I repay you?

615
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,682
Release Mrs. Teng and her son.

616
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,602
I thought Fan Xian isn't here?

617
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,282
You just heard the voice in my mind.

618
00:35:11,128 --> 00:35:12,228
Actually,

619
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,402
so what if we fall out with each other?

620
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:16,162
I have nothing to do

621
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,922
with Moon Embracing Pavilion.

622
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,362
A few criticisms from outsiders won't hurt me.

623
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:22,539
Moon Embracing Pavilion has nothing to do with you?

624
00:35:22,563 --> 00:35:23,802
I have a clear conscience.

625
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,679
- Are you sure? - Absolutely.

626
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,002
- Could I have a word with you in private? - Sure.

627
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,080
That woman downstairs is Yuan Meng, right?

628
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,202
What are they talking about? I can't hear them.

629
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,180
I don't know.

630
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,819
Don't look.

631
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,416
She used to be quite famous as a courtesan at Liujing River.

632
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,042
If I remember correctly,

633
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,286
she should be under Hong Cheng's patronage now.

634
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,848
Although Hong Cheng is Lord Jing's son,

635
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,060
I'm not very familiar with him.

636
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,722
You are close to him.

637
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:05,082
One could say that Hong Cheng serves you loyally.

638
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,602
Speak plainly.

639
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,010
The relationship

640
00:36:12,778 --> 00:36:14,202
between Yuan Meng, Hong Cheng,

641
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,042
and you

642
00:36:17,038 --> 00:36:18,682
forms a kind of triangle, doesn't it?

643
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:22,981
It still seems to outsiders

644
00:36:23,062 --> 00:36:25,296
that you're somewhat involved with Moon Embracing Pavilion.

645
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,250
Somewhat involved might be an understatement.

646
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,942
- They might look deeper into it. - What if they can't find anything?

647
00:36:29,966 --> 00:36:31,282
Rumors can be dangerous.

648
00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:32,906
Just say it.

649
00:36:32,993 --> 00:36:35,042
What deal do you want to make with me?

650
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:43,802
Releasing Mrs. Teng and her son is what I want.

651
00:36:44,212 --> 00:36:46,772
You think you can intimidate me into releasing them with rumors?

652
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,602
Do you really see me as that type of person?

653
00:36:56,478 --> 00:36:58,002
You've got me pegged.

654
00:36:58,384 --> 00:36:59,722
I really am that type of person.

655
00:37:14,913 --> 00:37:16,013
At the end of the day,

656
00:37:16,328 --> 00:37:17,712
we're brothers.

657
00:37:18,078 --> 00:37:19,602
We're family.

658
00:37:20,295 --> 00:37:22,402
Who backs down first doesn't really matter.

659
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,242
Fan Wu Jiu.

660
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,659
Yes, Your Highness.

661
00:37:26,097 --> 00:37:28,202
Send Mrs. Teng and her son back home.

662
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,101
- Well... - Go now!

663
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:33,779
Yes, Your Highness.

664
00:37:44,288 --> 00:37:46,982
Move! Get out of my way!

665
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:52,762
What else can I do for you?

666
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,922
Don't worry, I'll release them unscathed.

667
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,802
I fear the power of rumors.

668
00:37:59,072 --> 00:38:00,575
Is there anything I can do for you then?

669
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:03,242
With the crown prince here, how could I not yield?

670
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,580
May I ask,

671
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,002
can I leave now?

672
00:38:08,685 --> 00:38:09,785
As you wish.

673
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,042
Human nature is unpredictable.

674
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,420
Good luck.

675
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,442
Who is he talking to?

676
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,860
I don't know.

677
00:38:42,128 --> 00:38:44,322
The Judicial Bureau is on a case. Don't obstruct them.

678
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,282
Don't get in their way.

679
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,482
What are you pondering?

680
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,442
Do you think he really meant it?

681
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,122
From what I know about my brother,

682
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,882
he's not one to go back on his word.

683
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:14,722
Since he has promised to release them,

684
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,482
he'll keep his word.

685
00:39:18,945 --> 00:39:21,282
I just find it odd how quickly he compromised.

686
00:39:21,617 --> 00:39:22,736
Even if the situation was unfavorable,

687
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,922
leaving immediately could have been an option.

688
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,522
But to release them so easily?

689
00:39:28,727 --> 00:39:29,960
Maybe he really

690
00:39:30,176 --> 00:39:32,271
was worried about the triangle connection I told him.

691
00:39:32,295 --> 00:39:33,762
He probably also believes

692
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,322
that outsiders would think he is involved with Moon Embracing Pavilion.

693
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:38,611
Right?

694
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,242
Don't you think Yuan Meng

695
00:39:41,561 --> 00:39:43,401
was a loophole that seemed almost too obvious?

696
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,882
Maybe I showed up too suddenly,

697
00:39:49,565 --> 00:39:51,162
and he didn't have time to hide her.

698
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,322
No, what I mean is,

699
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,880
why did he have to choose Yuan Meng to manage the brothel?

700
00:39:55,905 --> 00:39:57,220
Couldn't he have chosen someone else?

701
00:39:57,244 --> 00:39:58,922
Yuan Meng used to be a courtesan.

702
00:39:59,128 --> 00:40:00,390
Such a versatile talent

703
00:40:00,471 --> 00:40:02,762
is best suited for this job, isn't she?

704
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:08,202
He set up Fan Si Zhe with Moon Embracing Pavilion,

705
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,960
then, he sent me a message,

706
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,496
and he captured Mrs. Teng and her son.

707
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,962
After all that effort,

708
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,402
he compromised just like that?

709
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:17,962
He was going to get you convicted

710
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,882
for deceiving the emperor.

711
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:23,202
But he didn't expect that his plan would fail.

712
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:29,482
Could it be that he let us notice Yuan Meng on purpose?

713
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,242
And what would he gain from that?

714
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,380
What would he gain?

715
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:46,922
That's right.

716
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:49,242
What indeed.

717
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,699
Are they released?

718
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,202
I've given the order.

719
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,330
They're just a woman and a child, don't terrify them.

720
00:41:18,354 --> 00:41:20,336
Are we really going to return them just like that?

721
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,416
Since we couldn't catch Fan Xian, there's no point in holding them anymore.

722
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,530
Besides, risking everything for this isn't worth it.

723
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:26,970
But then, we didn't gain anything from this.

724
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,039
Be patient. The Moon Embracing Pavilion is only the beginning.

725
00:41:30,135 --> 00:41:31,722
Only he thinks he's won.

726
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,322
What about Wang Qi Nian?

727
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,242
He really fooled me.

728
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,682
He's a talent.

729
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,482
I dare not accept such praise.

730
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:46,042
I'm not a talent.

731
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:48,242
At best, just an ordinary person.

732
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,379
Your Highness, you're overly generous with your compliments.

733
00:41:50,403 --> 00:41:52,362
You're quite humble.

734
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:56,115
Not many people can fool Cheng Ze.

735
00:41:56,224 --> 00:41:57,682
That's already impressive.

736
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,362
It's all thanks to Your Highness's fortune,

737
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:05,842
coupled with Lord Fan's brilliant strategies.

738
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,642
I just did my honest duty,

739
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,320
which is why everything turned out so well.

740
00:42:12,425 --> 00:42:14,362
Qi Nian, that's enough.

741
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:15,619
Got it.

742
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,202
What are your plans

743
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,762
for Moon Embracing Pavilion?

744
00:42:20,521 --> 00:42:22,642
Can we release these people?

745
00:42:25,272 --> 00:42:26,762
If we release them now,

746
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,214
I doubt a single one will survive.

747
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,960
Then let's shut down the place for now.

748
00:42:36,298 --> 00:42:37,562
You will pacify them.

749
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,095
When I return to the capital officially, I'll release them.

750
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:41,219
All right.

751
00:42:41,441 --> 00:42:43,844
Oh, and there's a girl surnamed Jin in the establishment.

752
00:42:43,925 --> 00:42:46,322
Take special care of her and return her indenture to her.

753
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,880
How are you going to answer to my sister-in-law?

754
00:42:50,984 --> 00:42:52,354
You're shutting down

755
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:54,562
such a lucrative business just like this?

756
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,817
- I dare not continue. - There are actually things you dare not do?

757
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,162
Some lines I dare not cross.
