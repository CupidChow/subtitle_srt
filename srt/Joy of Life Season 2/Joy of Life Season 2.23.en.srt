00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:30,987
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,068 --> 00:01:34,022
(Episode 23)

3
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:35,789
It's small and can be placed here.

4
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,109
Put it inside. Hurry.

5
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,791
Go and bring Da Bao here from my father.

6
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,562
Leave a space for Da Bao.

7
00:01:43,318 --> 00:01:44,568
Stop!

8
00:01:46,382 --> 00:01:47,905
You can't touch this.

9
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,880
Da Bao is inside this.

10
00:01:53,678 --> 00:01:55,885
Da Bao, don't be afraid. He is not a bad person.

11
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:57,216
I know.

12
00:01:57,828 --> 00:01:59,789
Da Bao eats a lot of good food.

13
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,805
Its stomach is so big that it's going to explode.

14
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,322
- It eats a lot. - Qi Nian.

15
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:05,319
Lord Fan, let me do it.

16
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:10,564
No!

17
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:12,046
You can't touch this as well.

18
00:02:12,764 --> 00:02:14,724
Do you know what's inside this?

19
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:18,509
I'm telling you. These are the hawthorns my father gave me.

20
00:02:18,788 --> 00:02:19,882
They are delicious.

21
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:21,691
Your father gave them to you as a snack.

22
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:25,603
What's wrong with you?

23
00:02:25,684 --> 00:02:26,844
I told you.

24
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:28,188
You can't take this.

25
00:02:28,268 --> 00:02:30,349
Give it to me. Da Bao, don't be afraid.

26
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:31,903
- It's fine. - He's not a bad person.

27
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:33,177
Da Bao is full.

28
00:02:35,357 --> 00:02:36,802
My father gave it to me.

29
00:02:36,932 --> 00:02:38,362
The hawthorns my father gave me.

30
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:39,828
Yes. It's your snack.

31
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,159
Yes.

32
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:43,716
I've told you.

33
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:45,773
Don't touch it.

34
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:48,322
This is Da Bao's Da Bao.

35
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:49,451
All right.

36
00:02:49,532 --> 00:02:50,842
I understand.

37
00:02:58,605 --> 00:02:59,855
Help me place it.

38
00:03:00,828 --> 00:03:02,078
Place it...

39
00:03:05,749 --> 00:03:07,999
Young Master, don't tire yourself.

40
00:03:08,445 --> 00:03:09,601
Don't be afraid.

41
00:03:09,682 --> 00:03:10,932
Don't be afraid, Da Bao.

42
00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:29,092
Father is an exception!

43
00:03:29,212 --> 00:03:30,722
Father is an exception!

44
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:33,077
Father is an exception!

45
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:34,748
Father is an exception!

46
00:03:36,644 --> 00:03:38,562
Father is an exception!

47
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:42,535
Da Bao!

48
00:03:51,228 --> 00:03:52,748
Father is an exception!

49
00:03:56,749 --> 00:04:01,042
(Fan Residence)

50
00:04:10,948 --> 00:04:12,016
Shi Chan Li.

51
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:15,766
Shi Chan Li!

52
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,042
Shi Chan Li!

53
00:04:53,605 --> 00:04:54,855
Shi Chan Li.

54
00:04:57,693 --> 00:04:58,861
Lord Fan.

55
00:04:59,428 --> 00:05:00,842
The accident report said

56
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:03,402
the fire was an accident

57
00:05:03,557 --> 00:05:05,437
due to the hot weather and flammable materials.

58
00:05:09,957 --> 00:05:11,490
That's not right, Lord Fan.

59
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:13,327
A natural fire disaster

60
00:05:13,741 --> 00:05:15,162
must have a source.

61
00:05:15,486 --> 00:05:17,462
Even if the wind was strong and the fire was blazing,

62
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:19,842
it wouldn't burn the whole town.

63
00:05:19,989 --> 00:05:21,516
Even if the whole town was burned down,

64
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,790
the people

65
00:05:23,718 --> 00:05:25,442
would not be all dead.

66
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,350
Even I know that.

67
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:34,122
It was impossible for the person

68
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,362
who wrote to not know that.

69
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,829
A whole town full of people

70
00:05:49,828 --> 00:05:51,078
and a sudden fire.

71
00:05:53,388 --> 00:05:54,749
This is what's left.

72
00:05:58,798 --> 00:06:00,282
When I rushed there,

73
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,842
the whole town was burnt.

74
00:06:05,613 --> 00:06:06,863
No one was left alive.

75
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:10,522
Cheng Ze was too cruel.

76
00:06:13,197 --> 00:06:14,962
Now that the town is burnt,

77
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:17,282
the clues of the smuggling stop there.

78
00:06:17,828 --> 00:06:20,069
But the most important thing is all the lives lost!

79
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,602
There needs to be an explanation

80
00:06:22,053 --> 00:06:23,762
for the burnt town.

81
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,400
An accidental fire.

82
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:28,135
That's all?

83
00:06:31,293 --> 00:06:32,853
I dare ask.

84
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,869
Was the one who set fire

85
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,134
a powerful figure?

86
00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:44,829
No one knows

87
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:46,562
who set the fire.

88
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:48,242
However, the conclusion is right.

89
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:49,718
The person

90
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:51,151
must be a powerful figure.

91
00:06:51,335 --> 00:06:52,585
Then...

92
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,624
Can the case still be investigated?

93
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:03,663
Do you know?

94
00:07:05,054 --> 00:07:06,893
Another murder case

95
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:08,562
was sent to me today.

96
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:10,591
However,

97
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:12,767
the case was gone just now.

98
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:14,059
What do you mean that it's gone?

99
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,683
The one who made the report has escaped.

100
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:17,949
Shi Chan Li.

101
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,522
In this time and age,

102
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,870
if a victim is unwilling to track down the murderer,

103
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:23,522
it is difficult to file a case.

104
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:25,733
Lord Fan,

105
00:07:25,884 --> 00:07:27,165
I want to find the true culprit.

106
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,310
Will you escape?

107
00:07:28,391 --> 00:07:30,591
I've lost my home, Lord Fan!

108
00:07:30,876 --> 00:07:32,756
Where can I escape to?

109
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:39,082
Good.

110
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,101
I accept your case.

111
00:07:41,182 --> 00:07:44,838
Not only that. I'll also accept you.

112
00:07:45,037 --> 00:07:46,997
From now on, you are my retainer.

113
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:49,333
I can't guarantee to give you a result immediately

114
00:07:49,414 --> 00:07:50,762
but I promise you

115
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:53,122
that I'll keep investigating it.

116
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:58,322
I, Shi Chan Li, am willing to give my life to serve you!

117
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:06,170
(Censorate)

118
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:32,616
Seniors.

119
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:35,694
I am He Zong Wei.

120
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:38,082
Thanks to His Majesty's promotion,

121
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,762
I have become a censor from today onward.

122
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,522
Please give me lots of support.

123
00:08:53,548 --> 00:08:54,798
Nice to meet you.

124
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,869
Nice to meet you.

125
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,882
It's nothing much. Please accept it.

126
00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:01,846
Please give me lots of support.

127
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:07,214
Please give me lots of support.

128
00:09:08,517 --> 00:09:09,637
Senior.

129
00:09:09,831 --> 00:09:11,081
Please give me lots of support.

130
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,480
Are you giving gifts?

131
00:09:13,588 --> 00:09:14,667
No.

132
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,039
I know

133
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,412
that censors like us are responsible

134
00:09:18,436 --> 00:09:21,476
for eliminating corruption and ensuring the officials do their duty.

135
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,629
Giving gifts is taboo since it's bribing.

136
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,167
We mustn't do that.

137
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:27,588
However,

138
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:29,202
there's no need to worry.

139
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:32,882
I bought these snacks on my way.

140
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:34,442
They are the cheapest ones.

141
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:36,279
It's purely

142
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:37,655
to show my sincerity.

143
00:09:40,877 --> 00:09:43,362
Please give it to everyone.

144
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:55,759
Senior,

145
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:59,733
was this Lai Ming Cheng's seat when he was alive?

146
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,150
Senior, do you have a firestriker?

147
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:14,481
Please light it.

148
00:10:14,726 --> 00:10:15,976
What are you doing?

149
00:10:17,998 --> 00:10:19,248
To be honest,

150
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:23,028
Lai Ming Cheng

151
00:10:23,948 --> 00:10:25,828
was my benefactor.

152
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,842
Although we never met,

153
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:30,710
he was like

154
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:33,365
a teacher and a friend to me.

155
00:10:34,989 --> 00:10:36,442
Censor Lai's death

156
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:40,557
hurts me and makes me sad.

157
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,282
After seeing Senior Lai's seat when he was alive,

158
00:10:43,428 --> 00:10:45,322
I had to pay my respects no matter what.

159
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:49,162
- What are you doing? - You shouldn't do this in the Censorate.

160
00:10:49,243 --> 00:10:51,082
- Don't do this. - Get up quickly.

161
00:10:51,163 --> 00:10:53,322
Censor He, please stand up.

162
00:10:53,392 --> 00:10:55,201
- Yes. - I got too emotional.

163
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:13,122
Oh, right.

164
00:11:13,668 --> 00:11:15,148
I've been a commoner for a long time.

165
00:11:15,614 --> 00:11:18,174
I only know about Censor Lai's death but I don't know the cause.

166
00:11:19,006 --> 00:11:20,619
Was he harmed by a despicable person?

167
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:23,802
You don't know?

168
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:26,054
Censor Lai was executed

169
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:28,442
because he started complaining about Fan Xian.

170
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:31,677
This man was also the one who supervised Censor Lai's punishment.

171
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:35,399
It's him?

172
00:11:36,052 --> 00:11:37,892
I even visited this evil man before this.

173
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:42,402
You didn't know. It's not your fault.

174
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,562
In the future, just meet him less.

175
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:45,682
No.

176
00:11:46,086 --> 00:11:48,482
How can we concede in front of an evil person like him?

177
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:51,046
I'll go to the Fan Residence and argue with him now!

178
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:55,879
(Fan Residence)

179
00:12:00,446 --> 00:12:01,696
Excuse me.

180
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:03,744
Do you have a knife?

181
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:07,399
- I don't. - Can you help lend me one?

182
00:12:09,294 --> 00:12:11,418
I just came here. I'm not familiar with this place.

183
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:27,927
Lend it to me.

184
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,910
Thank you.

185
00:12:58,768 --> 00:13:00,018
What did you tell him?

186
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:02,645
I'm here to ask you to punish me.

187
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:05,038
Lord Fan, please punish me.

188
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:06,449
He Zong Wei,

189
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,893
you are a censor after all.

190
00:13:09,094 --> 00:13:10,773
Can you simply kneel as an official?

191
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:12,003
Lord Fan, please spare me.

192
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:13,589
When did I say I wanted to kill you?

193
00:13:14,413 --> 00:13:15,567
Lord Fan.

194
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:19,109
When I sent the Spring Imperial Examination murder case to your residence,

195
00:13:19,358 --> 00:13:21,558
I had offended you, Lord Fan.

196
00:13:21,908 --> 00:13:22,949
Lord Fan,

197
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,749
I'm sure you know me well.

198
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:26,689
Indeed.

199
00:13:27,437 --> 00:13:28,687
Lord Fan,

200
00:13:28,843 --> 00:13:30,093
your talent and knowledge

201
00:13:30,196 --> 00:13:31,516
is impeccable.

202
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:33,887
You hold many positions in the imperial court

203
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:35,076
and are powerful.

204
00:13:35,157 --> 00:13:36,722
When it comes to relationships,

205
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,202
you are my godfather.

206
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,293
Stop.

207
00:13:40,374 --> 00:13:41,624
I don't have a son like you.

208
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:44,310
He Zong Wei, I knew you were used by others.

209
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:45,527
I didn't plan to take revenge.

210
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:46,801
Stand up and get lost.

211
00:13:47,469 --> 00:13:48,719
Lord Fan,

212
00:13:49,334 --> 00:13:50,584
beat me up

213
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:52,239
to relieve your anger.

214
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:57,543
Why don't you ask your subordinate to do it?

215
00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:04,163
Are you here to get a beating?

216
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,937
Lord Fan,

217
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:09,124
after Lai Ming Cheng's death,

218
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:10,909
the Censorate shares a common enemy

219
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:12,620
and sees you as a thorn in its side.

220
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:15,003
If I got beaten at your residence,

221
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:17,191
my life as a censor

222
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:18,941
will be easier in the future.

223
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:23,824
You came to my residence to help you gain an advantage?

224
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,280
You won't be beating me up for nothing, Lord Fan.

225
00:14:27,606 --> 00:14:29,082
I work in the Censorate.

226
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:30,853
If there's any news in the future,

227
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:32,655
I can inform you in secret.

228
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:39,597
Lord Fan, I have no support and no power.

229
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:41,442
I'm just struggling to survive.

230
00:14:41,558 --> 00:14:43,178
Lord Fan, please don't laugh at me.

231
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:46,998
Send him off.

232
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,190
With respect.

233
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,282
Lord Fan,

234
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:56,743
please beat me twice.

235
00:14:56,869 --> 00:14:58,362
Beating me once will do.

236
00:14:58,709 --> 00:14:59,722
Please leave.

237
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,282
Sure.

238
00:15:09,974 --> 00:15:11,054
Lord Fan,

239
00:15:11,157 --> 00:15:12,407
you're kind.

240
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:31,806
What is your name?

241
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,922
I don't beat people.

242
00:15:36,431 --> 00:15:38,098
Are you Lord Fan's retainer?

243
00:15:40,126 --> 00:15:41,376
I failed the exam.

244
00:15:44,118 --> 00:15:45,522
It's good to fail the exam.

245
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,620
If you don't give your life as an official,

246
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,030
you still don't have a future.

247
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:53,828
He's still too young.

248
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:03,541
Someone like He Zong Wei might seem sophisticated

249
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,000
but he overdid it.

250
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:07,749
- When did you come here? - I've been here for a long time.

251
00:16:07,773 --> 00:16:10,006
I dared not disturb you since you looked like you were busy.

252
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,043
What is it?

253
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,276
- Has Mr. Wu Zhu been here recently? - No.

254
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:24,717
I heard you are Mr. Wu Zhu's direct disciple.

255
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:26,406
If Mr. Wu Zhu isn't around,

256
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:29,242
fighting you is the same as well.

257
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,998
Ignore him, he's just a fighting addict.

258
00:16:32,277 --> 00:16:33,916
He always thinks about fighting Wu Zhu.

259
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:36,278
Do the important things first.

260
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:45,275
I'm sure you know about the Fifth Bureau of the Overwatch Council.

261
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,123
I know. They manage the Black Cavalry.

262
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:48,454
Yes.

263
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:52,661
The Black Cavalry has been stationed outside the capital

264
00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:54,278
but its food and supplies

265
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:56,383
have always been arranged by the capital.

266
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:59,162
So, the First Bureau needs to coordinate this.

267
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,709
This book records the allocation of supplies

268
00:17:02,817 --> 00:17:04,693
and the Black Cavalry's distribution in recent years.

269
00:17:04,717 --> 00:17:06,170
Study it in detail.

270
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:07,631
In the future,

271
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,082
you'll be in charge of this.

272
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:12,093
You can just find someone to tell me something so minor.

273
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:13,397
Why did you come here in person?

274
00:17:13,422 --> 00:17:15,362
The Overwatch Council's Black Cavalry

275
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:17,162
is not controlled by the army.

276
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:20,202
Apart from me, there's only one other person in the Qing Kingdom

277
00:17:21,182 --> 00:17:22,642
who can command the Black Cavalry.

278
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,165
His Majesty?

279
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,559
Yes.

280
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:31,362
Oh, I heard Chancellor Lin is retiring.

281
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,602
Yes. It happened two days ago.

282
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,030
That's so soon.

283
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:39,134
Everyone is old.

284
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:42,059
However, Chancellor Lin

285
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,765
is not the only person

286
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:46,268
who will retire during this period.

287
00:17:48,813 --> 00:17:50,063
Take a closer look

288
00:17:50,398 --> 00:17:51,648
and put in more effort.

289
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:54,472
Let's go.

290
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,798
- Are you leaving just like that? - I'm busy.

291
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:05,288
What's this?

292
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:08,759
A riddle?

293
00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:29,093
Lord Fan, it's late.

294
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:30,432
Have some supper.

295
00:18:32,006 --> 00:18:33,485
What is this?

296
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:35,268
An exam question?

297
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,034
The First Bureau is in charge of

298
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,955
the transport of the Black Cavalry's supplies.

299
00:18:40,112 --> 00:18:41,842
Are you overthinking this?

300
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:43,242
No.

301
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:45,952
There must be something else hiding here.

302
00:18:52,101 --> 00:18:53,802
I just can't figure it out.

303
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:56,602
Tell me. Why can't he say what's on his mind directly?

304
00:18:57,734 --> 00:18:58,894
Is it because

305
00:18:58,975 --> 00:19:01,254
he has no choice but to do this?

306
00:19:29,325 --> 00:19:30,440
Uncle.

307
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:32,956
Uncle.

308
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:37,377
Didn't I ask you not to send me off?

309
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:38,855
I just want to get a ride.

310
00:19:39,148 --> 00:19:40,398
Where are you going?

311
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:42,153
Just in front.

312
00:19:42,462 --> 00:19:43,741
What are you planning again?

313
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,522
Uncle, your departure from the capital

314
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,042
is unceremonious this time.

315
00:19:47,422 --> 00:19:48,862
It's a farewell.

316
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:50,402
Crying,

317
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,390
drinking farewell wine,

318
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:54,002
and reading poems.

319
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,842
Something like that is tiring.

320
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,757
I'm old.

321
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,268
It's better to be quiet.

322
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:04,094
Don't worry, Uncle.

323
00:20:04,181 --> 00:20:05,431
I don't do that.

324
00:20:06,902 --> 00:20:08,301
Da Bao...

325
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,141
He likes the food in my residence.

326
00:20:11,222 --> 00:20:12,472
He has gained weight recently.

327
00:20:13,943 --> 00:20:15,193
That's great.

328
00:20:16,094 --> 00:20:17,642
That's great.

329
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:20,415
I didn't tell him that you were leaving according to your orders.

330
00:20:20,564 --> 00:20:21,885
That's right.

331
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:24,762
Let him be happy

332
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,722
and experience fewer farewells.

333
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,482
However, I think you still want to see your family

334
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:34,362
one last time

335
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:36,602
when you leave the capital.

336
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,731
Please stop.

337
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,680
Da Bao!

338
00:21:16,805 --> 00:21:18,055
Wan Er!

339
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:19,423
What is it, Wan Er?

340
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:20,958
Wan Er!

341
00:21:21,085 --> 00:21:22,335
What is it, Wan Er?

342
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:24,962
Let's bow in that direction.

343
00:21:27,646 --> 00:21:28,896
Why?

344
00:21:30,773 --> 00:21:32,162
I suddenly feel like doing it.

345
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:33,667
Do it with me.

346
00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:35,897
I'll listen to you.

347
00:22:59,085 --> 00:23:01,005
I only told Da Bao this was an outing

348
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:02,664
and nothing else.

349
00:23:07,198 --> 00:23:08,282
Good.

350
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,402
It's just that

351
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:19,162
I've troubled you.

352
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:21,882
Uncle, I'll be leaving.

353
00:23:25,373 --> 00:23:27,362
I wish you and Wan Er

354
00:23:29,132 --> 00:23:31,613
a happily ever after.

355
00:23:35,662 --> 00:23:37,802
I also wish you a smooth journey.

356
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:49,319
Xian!

357
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,650
Xian!

358
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,642
Xian!

359
00:23:56,829 --> 00:23:58,549
Xian!

360
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,882
Xian, let's go.

361
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,162
Wan Er!

362
00:24:18,414 --> 00:24:20,012
Having the opportunity to retire

363
00:24:20,943 --> 00:24:22,196
is good enough.

364
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:25,562
What's good enough?

365
00:24:27,974 --> 00:24:30,482
Being together as a family is good enough.

366
00:24:31,142 --> 00:24:34,042
We are a family. We should be together.

367
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:36,925
We won't separate with each other. Let me share my hawthorns with you.

368
00:24:37,006 --> 00:24:38,256
Here you go, Xian.

369
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:45,322
Wan Er, for you.

370
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:48,303
Thanks, Da Bao.

371
00:25:01,525 --> 00:25:03,175
- What's wrong? - What's wrong?

372
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:05,402
This hawthorn is sour.

373
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,722
I wished Father was here.

374
00:25:14,317 --> 00:25:15,567
It's all right.

375
00:25:15,702 --> 00:25:16,822
Father is busy.

376
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:18,957
We should have fun on our own, all right?

377
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,700
Xian, let's go. I'll bring you to catch butterflies.

378
00:26:18,717 --> 00:26:20,082
- Da Bao. - Play with me!

379
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:21,413
Be careful.

380
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:24,045
I'm asking it to catch butterflies with me

381
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:25,709
but it won't follow me.

382
00:26:28,365 --> 00:26:30,682
If you don't come with me, I'll play with someone else!

383
00:26:42,221 --> 00:26:43,471
What's wrong?

384
00:26:45,623 --> 00:26:47,237
A riddle from President Chen.

385
00:26:47,318 --> 00:26:48,562
I haven't solved it yet.

386
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:51,748
Why don't you help me take a look?

387
00:26:52,854 --> 00:26:55,122
The distribution of Black Cavalry is confidential.

388
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,199
I won't see it.

389
00:26:59,508 --> 00:27:00,788
How did you end up getting this?

390
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:03,669
The First Bureau is in charge of the Black Cavalry supply distribution.

391
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:11,362
What did you just say?

392
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:17,108
The distribution of Black Cavalry is confidential.

393
00:27:21,983 --> 00:27:25,122
The Black Cavalry has been stationed outside the capital.

394
00:27:25,385 --> 00:27:28,842
This book records the allocation of supplies

395
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,772
and the black cavalry's distribution in recent years.

396
00:27:30,796 --> 00:27:32,046
Study it in detail.

397
00:27:33,229 --> 00:27:34,479
What's wrong?

398
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,082
It's nothing.

399
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:41,642
Play without me. I suddenly remember something.

400
00:27:52,397 --> 00:27:53,442
Wang Qi Nian.

401
00:27:54,018 --> 00:27:55,682
Lord Fan, are you going back?

402
00:27:55,796 --> 00:27:57,116
How many men did you bring today?

403
00:27:57,392 --> 00:27:58,644
I brought a few from the First Bureau.

404
00:27:58,668 --> 00:28:00,842
They are protecting around this place.

405
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:02,682
- That's no use. - What's wrong?

406
00:28:03,275 --> 00:28:05,539
President Chen asked the First Bureau to help distribute the supplies.

407
00:28:05,563 --> 00:28:06,574
That's right.

408
00:28:06,655 --> 00:28:08,501
Recording the supplies in this book is good enough.

409
00:28:08,525 --> 00:28:10,845
Why is the distribution of Black Cavalry recorded as well?

410
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:15,011
Did he want you to slowly take over the Black Cavalry?

411
00:28:15,157 --> 00:28:17,082
- Do you have a horse? - It's over there.

412
00:28:19,277 --> 00:28:20,527
(How soon.)

413
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:24,238
Everyone is old.

414
00:28:24,983 --> 00:28:26,762
However, Chancellor Lin

415
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,042
is not the only person

416
00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:31,230
who will retire during this period.

417
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:33,638
Which important official retired recently?

418
00:28:33,828 --> 00:28:36,442
The official who has retired and left the capital

419
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:39,885
is the Magistrate of the capital, Mei Zhi Li. You saw him.

420
00:28:39,972 --> 00:28:42,852
- How did he end up? - I heard he was killed by bandits.

421
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:44,989
- Do you still remember when it happened? - I do.

422
00:28:45,206 --> 00:28:46,757
Take a look at that day's distribution.

423
00:28:46,781 --> 00:28:48,031
13th of June.

424
00:28:52,108 --> 00:28:54,749
The Black Cavalry was indeed ordered to leave camp.

425
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,300
- No way. - There's another important sentence.

426
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:59,162
The Overwatch Council's Black Cavalry

427
00:28:59,469 --> 00:29:00,988
is not controlled by the army.

428
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:04,162
Apart from me, there's only one other person in the Qing kingdom

429
00:29:05,085 --> 00:29:06,602
who can command the Black Cavalry.

430
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,082
Don't tell me...

431
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,204
Every sentence of his was the riddle itself.

432
00:29:10,285 --> 00:29:11,645
Let's go! We'll catch up to Uncle!

433
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,941
If we meet the Black Cavalry,

434
00:29:19,053 --> 00:29:20,332
we still can't stop them.

435
00:29:20,428 --> 00:29:22,419
This is an emergency. Where can I go to find reinforcements?

436
00:29:22,443 --> 00:29:23,762
We'll have to take a gamble.

437
00:29:49,461 --> 00:29:50,602
Your Highness.

438
00:29:52,277 --> 00:29:54,282
Isn't this Fan Xian? What a coincidence.

439
00:29:54,717 --> 00:29:55,922
Why are you here?

440
00:29:56,317 --> 00:29:58,317
Wasn't I assigned as the Imperial Bodyguard?

441
00:29:58,494 --> 00:29:59,574
I saw the men slacking

442
00:29:59,655 --> 00:30:00,895
so I brought them out to train.

443
00:30:00,936 --> 00:30:03,202
- You train here? - It was arranged by President Chen.

444
00:30:03,285 --> 00:30:06,125
They are the palace guards. It's hard to find a day when they are free.

445
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:07,591
He's really impressive.

446
00:30:07,734 --> 00:30:08,802
What's wrong?

447
00:30:09,285 --> 00:30:12,402
Your Highness, do you dare accept a job that will get you killed?

448
00:30:12,901 --> 00:30:14,762
It sounds exciting.

449
00:30:14,843 --> 00:30:16,299
We might be fighting the Black Cavalry.

450
00:30:16,323 --> 00:30:17,404
I know nothing!

451
00:30:17,485 --> 00:30:18,564
You abduct me.

452
00:30:18,645 --> 00:30:21,202
Time is running out, I have no time to explain it. Follow me.

453
00:31:47,242 --> 00:31:48,358
(Chief Inspector)

454
00:32:24,828 --> 00:32:25,988
Greetings.

455
00:32:26,076 --> 00:32:27,482
All of you have worked hard.

456
00:32:27,758 --> 00:32:29,008
Let me introduce ourselves.

457
00:32:29,117 --> 00:32:31,362
These are the palace guards.

458
00:32:31,627 --> 00:32:33,787
This man is Prince Cheng Ru.

459
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,682
He has been leading the troops at the border.

460
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:37,788
He is a prince regardless.

461
00:32:38,878 --> 00:32:39,957
Regardless?

462
00:32:40,052 --> 00:32:41,162
That man.

463
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,920
Wang Qi Nian.

464
00:32:44,933 --> 00:32:47,173
Lord Fan, I'm useless.

465
00:32:47,261 --> 00:32:48,842
He is good at Qinggong.

466
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:50,519
No one can catch him.

467
00:32:51,381 --> 00:32:53,562
Everyone, please spare us.

468
00:32:56,764 --> 00:32:58,605
We have the palace guards, the prince,

469
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:00,846
and someone good at Qinggong.

470
00:33:02,449 --> 00:33:04,042
It's difficult to kill us all.

471
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,070
Why don't we discuss this

472
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,522
and each take a step back?

473
00:33:08,765 --> 00:33:10,042
We'll return to our homes.

474
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,341
If someone asks,

475
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:12,802
just explain it with this.

476
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:14,162
I hold all the responsibility.

477
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,566
Do we have a discussion?

478
00:33:15,647 --> 00:33:16,897
Are you Fan Xian?

479
00:33:17,109 --> 00:33:18,162
Yes.

480
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:20,002
As a member of the Black Cavalry,

481
00:33:20,285 --> 00:33:22,362
we can't leave camp without an order.

482
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,821
Since I'm here,

483
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,322
that means I've received an order.

484
00:33:25,573 --> 00:33:27,442
Chief Inspector Fan, you should know

485
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:29,282
that a military order is absolute.

486
00:33:30,522 --> 00:33:32,202
That means there's no room for discussion.

487
00:33:49,108 --> 00:33:50,202
Retreat.

488
00:33:54,854 --> 00:33:56,453
This is a surprise.

489
00:33:57,317 --> 00:33:59,019
Didn't you say we should return to our homes?

490
00:33:59,043 --> 00:34:00,381
Didn't you say the order was absolute?

491
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,157
The Black Cavalry belongs to the Fifth Bureau of the Overwatch Council.

492
00:34:03,181 --> 00:34:05,421
We left the camp on the Fifth Bureau's orders.

493
00:34:05,758 --> 00:34:07,802
Chief Inspector Fan is the man

494
00:34:07,926 --> 00:34:09,842
who is only inferior to President Chen.

495
00:34:10,237 --> 00:34:12,402
Your order is above the Fifth Bureau's.

496
00:34:12,893 --> 00:34:14,402
So, returning to our homes

497
00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:15,838
is a military order.

498
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,719
Thank you.

499
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:20,542
A military order.

500
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,870
Return to camp!

501
00:34:42,024 --> 00:34:43,664
(Black Cavalry Commander, Commander Jing)

502
00:35:03,807 --> 00:35:05,682
Do you still have something?

503
00:35:12,269 --> 00:35:14,202
(Poetic God)

504
00:35:16,092 --> 00:35:17,802
I bought it overnight

505
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:19,958
when I heard about your death.

506
00:35:20,574 --> 00:35:21,842
Should I

507
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,882
thank you then?

508
00:35:24,935 --> 00:35:26,522
Thankfully, it was a false rumor.

509
00:35:29,054 --> 00:35:31,042
- Why don't I pay you for the book? - No need.

510
00:35:33,846 --> 00:35:35,322
Chief Inspector, can you

511
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,882
leave an autograph?

512
00:35:43,085 --> 00:35:44,402
I didn't bring a brush.

513
00:35:44,566 --> 00:35:45,767
Do you have a brush?

514
00:35:45,902 --> 00:35:47,152
Don't look at me.

515
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,082
- What are you doing? - Blood can also be used to write.

516
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:53,442
Brush.

517
00:35:55,885 --> 00:35:57,165
There's a brush.

518
00:36:09,164 --> 00:36:11,522
I have no ink.

519
00:36:19,822 --> 00:36:21,602
I need water to grind ink.

520
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:23,613
I don't think tea works.

521
00:36:23,694 --> 00:36:25,282
It's better than blood.

522
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,602
You are right.

523
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:48,162
Lord Fan, here you go.

524
00:36:56,638 --> 00:36:58,402
Both of you are blocking the light.

525
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,680
Who should I sign to?

526
00:37:05,748 --> 00:37:08,082
I'm not asking you to vomit. I'm writing your name.

527
00:37:08,165 --> 00:37:09,525
To show that it's for you.

528
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:10,878
Great.

529
00:37:12,244 --> 00:37:13,845
- What's your surname? - Jing.

530
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:15,366
- Jing that means thorns? - Yes.

531
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:16,719
A good surname.

532
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,499
- Your name? - Nameless.

533
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:20,878
Nameless Jing. Good name.

534
00:37:21,188 --> 00:37:23,508
My name is not Nameless. I have no name.

535
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,442
- Your position? - Vice Commander.

536
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:40,842
I belong to the Fifth Bureau.

537
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:43,922
All right.

538
00:37:52,494 --> 00:37:53,744
Vice...

539
00:37:54,636 --> 00:37:55,886
Vice...

540
00:38:01,468 --> 00:38:03,595
(To Commander Jing, Fan Xian)

541
00:38:11,194 --> 00:38:13,123
(To Commander Jing, Fan Xian)

542
00:38:18,156 --> 00:38:19,317
My handwriting is bad.

543
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:20,637
You are too humble.

544
00:38:20,718 --> 00:38:22,238
It's no wonder why President Chen said

545
00:38:22,276 --> 00:38:25,116
the Chief Inspector's handwriting would even shock spirits and deities.

546
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:31,335
- Thank you. - Commander Jing, do you like to read poems?

547
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,359
I don't understand them

548
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,690
but I like it.

549
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:37,061
The literary circle of the Qing Kingdom has been declining for a long time.

550
00:38:37,085 --> 00:38:38,485
Your sudden appearance

551
00:38:38,572 --> 00:38:40,042
is fortunate for the Qing Kingdom.

552
00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:41,922
Even if I don't understand the poems,

553
00:38:42,749 --> 00:38:44,070
I still respect someone like you.

554
00:38:46,317 --> 00:38:47,567
Chief Inspector Fan,

555
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:50,522
it's good that you are alive.

556
00:38:52,717 --> 00:38:53,967
I feel the same as well.

557
00:39:23,749 --> 00:39:24,950
You should

558
00:39:25,037 --> 00:39:26,802
really practice your handwriting.

559
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,362
Uncle, I'll go back with you.

560
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:32,922
I guessed wrongly.

561
00:39:33,213 --> 00:39:35,573
- What did you guess wrong? - The Black Cavalry appeared.

562
00:39:36,845 --> 00:39:38,322
What did that mean?

563
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:40,042
His Majesty wants to kill you.

564
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,842
No.

565
00:39:42,372 --> 00:39:45,532
His Majesty is not trying to change the chancellor.

566
00:39:46,646 --> 00:39:49,122
He wants to remove the chancellor.

567
00:39:49,258 --> 00:39:51,010
What's the difference?

568
00:39:52,612 --> 00:39:54,042
Remove the chancellor.

569
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:56,477
Abolishing the position of chancellor?

570
00:39:56,597 --> 00:39:57,878
I made a wrong judgment

571
00:39:57,966 --> 00:40:01,206
so my way of dealing with it was wrong.

572
00:40:02,628 --> 00:40:03,878
Wait for me.

573
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,002
This list

574
00:40:11,228 --> 00:40:14,468
has all my retainers and acquaintances.

575
00:40:15,052 --> 00:40:16,842
Give it to His Majesty

576
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,642
and tell him

577
00:40:19,548 --> 00:40:21,042
that I'll submit a report

578
00:40:21,148 --> 00:40:22,682
when I return home

579
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,991
to state the harm caused by the position of chancellor.

580
00:40:26,525 --> 00:40:27,644
The leader of all officials

581
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,082
has too much authority.

582
00:40:29,732 --> 00:40:31,482
If an ambitious official takes over,

583
00:40:31,613 --> 00:40:33,214
the people will be in danger.

584
00:40:33,771 --> 00:40:35,966
I will lead the move to abolish the position of chancellor.

585
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,562
His Majesty has nothing to do with it.

586
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,541
Enough.

587
00:40:39,622 --> 00:40:40,942
You should return to the capital.

588
00:40:41,926 --> 00:40:43,482
I should send you off.

589
00:40:43,668 --> 00:40:44,918
There's no need.

590
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:47,340
After the things are delivered

591
00:40:47,462 --> 00:40:48,802
and the message is sent,

592
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:51,229
I will be safe.

593
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:53,482
Even the Black Cavalry came to kill you.

594
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:55,868
They are not killing me.

595
00:40:57,301 --> 00:40:59,034
They are reminding me.

596
00:40:59,253 --> 00:41:01,560
Are you that confident? Wasn't that an attempt to kill you?

597
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,985
I won't die.

598
00:41:03,822 --> 00:41:05,182
I'm afraid I can't

599
00:41:06,085 --> 00:41:08,122
protect all those under me.

600
00:41:09,774 --> 00:41:11,174
I'm not Mei Zhi Li.

601
00:41:12,157 --> 00:41:13,477
If I die,

602
00:41:14,413 --> 00:41:15,663
there is no way

603
00:41:16,653 --> 00:41:17,974
a history book can be written.

604
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,321
If His Majesty wanted to give you a reminder,

605
00:41:27,345 --> 00:41:28,965
he could just tell you right in the face.

606
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:30,239
Why did he need to do this?

607
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:32,522
Do I need to tell you that?

608
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:35,367
It was a reminder

609
00:41:36,573 --> 00:41:38,042
and also a threat.

610
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,082
What do you think of His Majesty's move?

611
00:41:42,454 --> 00:41:44,362
His Majesty is unpredictable.

612
00:41:44,477 --> 00:41:45,727
He makes good moves.

613
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,157
Good moves?

614
00:41:47,717 --> 00:41:50,962
The moves are all the same.

615
00:41:51,806 --> 00:41:53,212
If you manage the six ministries

616
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:54,632
and hold the military authority,

617
00:41:54,757 --> 00:41:57,282
you can also make such a good move.

618
00:41:57,363 --> 00:41:59,082
You can be softer when you say that.

619
00:41:59,221 --> 00:42:01,922
The most brilliant thing about His Majesty

620
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:06,562
is that no one can predict his next move.

621
00:42:07,084 --> 00:42:08,564
You had His Majesty's help

622
00:42:08,645 --> 00:42:10,322
in your fight against Prince Cheng Ze.

623
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:12,438
That was why the Spring Imperial Examination happened

624
00:42:12,462 --> 00:42:14,882
and brought out the fraud cases.

625
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:16,202
The fraud cases

626
00:42:16,525 --> 00:42:18,482
brought me out into the open.

627
00:42:19,158 --> 00:42:23,998
That was how His Majesty achieved his goal of abolishing the chancellor.

628
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:27,390
His Majesty takes advantage of others' strength to do his deeds for him.

629
00:42:27,414 --> 00:42:30,813
All his intentions are hidden.

630
00:42:32,189 --> 00:42:34,749
Fan Xian, you must remember.

631
00:42:35,414 --> 00:42:38,373
Never trust His Majesty completely.

632
00:42:39,108 --> 00:42:40,589
Never think

633
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:44,725
you've predicted all his moves before the final moment.

634
00:42:47,893 --> 00:42:49,402
You make it sound like

635
00:42:50,093 --> 00:42:51,962
I'm going to go against His Majesty.

636
00:42:53,652 --> 00:42:56,762
This is out of your control.
