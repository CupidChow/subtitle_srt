00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:30,948
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,029 --> 00:01:34,099
(Episode 15)

3
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,760
Am I wrong to give my things to others?

4
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,727
I'm not the one who decides that.

5
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,040
The imperial court is investigating corruption

6
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,882
to rectify the officials' behavior and uphold the kingdom's law.

7
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,519
At a time like this,

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,122
I dare not accept any gifts.

9
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,049
Your Majesty,

10
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,922
can I explain this?

11
00:02:06,904 --> 00:02:08,033
Your Majesty,

12
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,694
does the jewelry look familiar to you?

13
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:16,040
It is a reward from Your Majesty.

14
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,572
Your Majesty

15
00:02:17,653 --> 00:02:20,173
always rewarded me handsomely for my mere contributions.

16
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,200
I'm very grateful.

17
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,020
I'm humbled as well.

18
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:27,820
You gave my gift to other people.

19
00:02:28,614 --> 00:02:29,734
What is the meaning of that?

20
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:31,015
He's my junior.

21
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,880
I can't give him anything else.

22
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:40,602
What about Chen Manor?

23
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:42,215
I'm living in Chen Manor temporarily.

24
00:02:42,254 --> 00:02:44,456
- Is the house's deed not under your name? - No.

25
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,880
Your Majesty. This is a common trick.

26
00:02:46,986 --> 00:02:48,363
They don't put the deeds in their name

27
00:02:48,387 --> 00:02:50,440
and say the place is rented.

28
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:52,599
However, it's hard to say if you investigate it.

29
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:55,150
President Chen, can you explain

30
00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:56,613
whom you borrowed Chen Manor from?

31
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,999
It's the property of the royal family.

32
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,490
His Majesty

33
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,216
granted me temporary residence at the place.

34
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,839
I have some savings as well.

35
00:03:05,926 --> 00:03:08,086
The source of my fortune

36
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,930
can all be traced.

37
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,722
Fan Xian, are you satisfied?

38
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:16,409
I'm satisfied. That's all for my complaint.

39
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,282
- Lai Ming Cheng. - Your Majesty.

40
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,639
What are you complaining about Fan Jian and his son?

41
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,599
Your Majesty.

42
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,336
The Fan family is involved in the Moon Embracing Pavilion case.

43
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,720
As an official,

44
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,519
establishing a brothel is not right.

45
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:42,480
The Fan family is unable to discipline their child.

46
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:43,904
It ruins the officials' reputation.

47
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,591
Fan Jian and his son should take responsibility.

48
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,679
I think someone died as well.

49
00:03:51,494 --> 00:03:55,295
Your Majesty, Prince Cheng Ze is involved in the murder.

50
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,280
I want to talk about the cases one by one.

51
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:00,568
Fan Jian.

52
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,119
- Yes. - What do you want to say?

53
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,230
Your Majesty,

54
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,842
my second son, Fan Si Zhe, is naive and rude.

55
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:10,089
He was tricked

56
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,936
and is indeed the owner of Moon Embracing Pavilion.

57
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,119
I failed to educate my son well. I have nothing to say about that.

58
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,359
Thankfully, my son stopped in time and regretted his actions.

59
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,279
He has already sealed Moon Embracing Pavilion.

60
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,400
I've also punished him according to the family law

61
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,040
and chased him out of the capital

62
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,759
to a desolate place

63
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,082
to cultivate his body and mind.

64
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,719
The law of the kingdom comes first

65
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,079
before the family's rules.

66
00:04:30,206 --> 00:04:33,486
My son, Fan Si Zhe, is not an official.

67
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,922
Although opening a brothel is inappropriate,

68
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,200
it's not against the law.

69
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,560
In that case,

70
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,320
do you think all the officials

71
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,400
have no family

72
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,760
and relatives?

73
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,119
If everyone can do as they wish

74
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,439
and abuse their position,

75
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,202
the imperial court of the Qing Kingdom will be ashamed.

76
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Your Majesty.

77
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,910
As the father and elder brother respectively,

78
00:04:58,005 --> 00:04:59,966
Fan Jian and Fan Xian

79
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:03,336
should both take responsibility!

80
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,839
How should they take responsibility?

81
00:05:05,982 --> 00:05:07,442
Demote them as a strict punishment.

82
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
Chancellor Lin.

83
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,833
Your Majesty.

84
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,068
- What do you think? - I don't get it.

85
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,921
Isn't there a murder case at Moon Embracing Pavilion?

86
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:31,997
The case hasn't been solved yet.

87
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,882
Why are we talking about family rules now?

88
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,600
I agree.

89
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,922
After all, human lives are more important.

90
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
You are right.

91
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,680
Human lives are more important and there's no evidence.

92
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,682
We will talk about

93
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,520
the Fan family's matter at a later date.

94
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Your Majesty.

95
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,840
I wanted to discuss matters in order

96
00:05:58,936 --> 00:06:00,336
starting from the least serious.

97
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,082
We can talk about the murder case first.

98
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,240
Lord Fan,

99
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,440
what are you planning?

100
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,120
You are the chief inspector of the Overwatch Council

101
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:10,878
but you complain about your president.

102
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:12,823
I'm investigating corruption.

103
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,410
Lord Xin, I'll complain about you too if you are corrupt.

104
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,360
I'm just joking. Let's watch on.

105
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,920
Everyone knows.

106
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,959
The three murderers of Moon Embracing Pavilion

107
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,055
were captured by the Overwatch Council after the murder.

108
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,239
Later, Fan Wu Jiu

109
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,082
assassinated the murderer outside the Judicial Bureau.

110
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,090
According to our investigation, Fan Wu Jiu

111
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:37,641
was Prince Cheng Ze's retainer.

112
00:06:37,736 --> 00:06:39,741
I, Lai Ming Cheng, am complaining about

113
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,122
Prince Cheng Ze under the suspicion of silencing the witnesses.

114
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,842
I was careless

115
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,562
and mistrusted a traitor.

116
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,242
However, I can't take responsibility for silencing the witnesses.

117
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,040
Fan Wu Jiu has admitted

118
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:06,486
that he did all the crimes himself.

119
00:07:07,248 --> 00:07:09,047
I was deceived as well.

120
00:07:10,242 --> 00:07:12,002
It was too late for me to regret my actions.

121
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,472
Censor Lai.

122
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:24,407
The law of the Qing Kingdom is about witnesses and evidence.

123
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:26,959
Exactly.

124
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Your Majesty.

125
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,242
The Censorate was blessed by Your Majesty

126
00:07:32,332 --> 00:07:34,573
to investigate corruption among the officials.

127
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,920
We have some clues now.

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,920
After a detailed investigation, we found 15 names

129
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:43,854
belonging to the capital's corrupt officials on the previous list.

130
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,322
Your Majesty, please take a look.

131
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,759
Your Majesty,

132
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,039
after Fan Xian returned from Northern Qi,

133
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,680
he mentioned

134
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,879
the smuggling of Prince Cheng Ze and Princess Yun Rui's

135
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,880
with Northern Qi.

136
00:08:13,086 --> 00:08:14,526
If it was true,

137
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,360
where did the money go?

138
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,360
These 15 officials

139
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,519
possess a fortune from an unknown source.

140
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,999
Moreover, all of them are related to Prince Cheng Ze.

141
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,565
I have a question.

142
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,000
Did Prince Cheng Ze

143
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,440
use the money obtained from smuggling

144
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,440
to bribe the officials?

145
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,762
Ridiculous!

146
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,279
Your Majesty,

147
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,479
I request

148
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,262
a reinvestigation of the smuggling

149
00:08:52,343 --> 00:08:55,282
between Prince Cheng Ze and Princess Yun Rui with Northern Qi.

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No.

151
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,050
Your Majesty, please think twice.

152
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,027
There's no evidence in the smuggling case.

153
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:17,626
It's all an assumption.

154
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,719
The case ends here.

155
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:30,581
Your Majesty,

156
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,442
the evidence might be before our eyes.

157
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,599
Fan Wu Jiu is Prince Cheng Ze's retainer.

158
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:38,282
If we interrogate Fan Wu Jiu again,

159
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,282
we can find out the truth about the murder case

160
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,320
and also clues about the smuggling.

161
00:09:44,553 --> 00:09:46,762
Your Majesty, please approve the request.

162
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:47,479
Investigate it!

163
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:50,176
He's right. We must investigate it! I fully support this decision!

164
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,442
I also support the interrogation of Fan Wu Jiu.

165
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:53,617
With Censor Lai here,

166
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:56,216
we will find the truth about the murder at Moon Embracing Pavilion

167
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,999
and prove my innocence.

168
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Your Majesty.

169
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,350
I also have something on my mind

170
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,880
that I must say.

171
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:15,975
Say it.

172
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:20,511
Minister Fan said Moon Embracing Pavilion

173
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:22,031
has been closed down.

174
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,750
I'm worried indeed.

175
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:27,479
Moon Embracing Pavilion has dozens of courtesans and workers.

176
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,416
They are the people of the Qing Kingdom as well.

177
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,936
What will happen to their livelihood now that the place is closed?

178
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,210
Where do they go?

179
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,450
I think

180
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,999
the Moon Embracing Pavilion incident

181
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,480
is caused by the Fan family.

182
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:41,079
The Fan family should take responsibility for these people as well.

183
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:42,213
He's right!

184
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,735
I will deal with Moon Embracing Pavilion's aftermath.

185
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,495
May I ask if you're going to do the same business?

186
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,040
It won't be a brothel, naturally.

187
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,440
Great.

188
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,730
Li Cheng Ze.

189
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:53,759
Hear my edict.

190
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,640
You are grounded for half a year.

191
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,479
- I... - To reflect on your mistakes.

192
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,450
Yes, Father.

193
00:12:07,641 --> 00:12:08,893
Fan Jian. Fan Xian.

194
00:12:08,974 --> 00:12:10,694
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

195
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,362
You will be fined half a year's wages

196
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,799
to serve as a warning to others.

197
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,560
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

198
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,480
Lai Ming Cheng.

199
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:26,769
Yes.

200
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,129
Censor Lai.

201
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
Are you satisfied now?

202
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Your Majesty.

203
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,525
Fan Jian and his son ruined the officials' reputation.

204
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,160
A fine of half a year's wage

205
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,640
is too lenient.

206
00:12:39,736 --> 00:12:41,256
It's difficult to convince the people!

207
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,879
What else do you want?

208
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
A demotion!

209
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,280
The family is not strict indeed

210
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,879
but their crimes are not that serious.

211
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:51,976
Your Majesty!

212
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,040
Please think twice, Your Majesty!

213
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,920
Are you forcing me to change my edict?

214
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,599
I dare not!

215
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,827
You dare not?

216
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,560
You dare do everything!

217
00:13:10,982 --> 00:13:13,142
Prince Cheng Ze has been grounded for half a year.

218
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:14,663
Are you not satisfied yet?

219
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,049
All right.

220
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,280
Everything has been concluded today.

221
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,049
Dismissed.

222
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,360
Your Majesty!

223
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:38,718
I'm not done with my complaint yet!

224
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,519
Your Majesty!

225
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:43,808
I'm not done with my complaint yet!

226
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,759
All right.

227
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,640
Who do you want to complain about?

228
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:49,759
Your Majesty.

229
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,999
I also want to complain about Chen Ping Ping.

230
00:13:54,655 --> 00:13:56,535
I'm not complaining about him for corruption

231
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,560
but having an unclear law.

232
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,999
I'm also not complaining about Chen Ping Ping alone

233
00:14:02,103 --> 00:14:04,982
but the whole Overwatch Council!

234
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,000
The Overwatch Council?

235
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,359
What is he doing?

236
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:09,929
He must be crazy.

237
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,520
- He has gone mad. - This is absurd.

238
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,289
What is he doing?

239
00:14:18,135 --> 00:14:20,839
Your Majesty, since the Overwatch Council's establishment,

240
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,080
there have been good and bad people in the department.

241
00:14:23,121 --> 00:14:25,960
Their actions have been presumptuous and unreasonable.

242
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,560
They are involved in

243
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,120
the imperial court

244
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,320
and foreign kingdoms.

245
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,839
The council is too powerful.

246
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,599
Your Majesty, is there a precedent of this

247
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,680
since ancient times?

248
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,450
How dare you!

249
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Your Majesty.

250
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,400
President Chen worked his heart out

251
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,482
and contributed a lot to the Qing Kingdom.

252
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,959
Without the Overwatch Council,

253
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,040
peace wouldn't have existed in the Qing Kingdom.

254
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
How dare you

255
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,962
complain about the Overwatch Council?

256
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:57,970
Yes! Even ancient customs might not be completely right.

257
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,880
But something huge

258
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,200
like the matters of the kingdom

259
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,615
should be handled by every ministry.

260
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,199
This is not just an ancient custom

261
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,640
but common sense as well.

262
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Your Majesty,

263
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,280
I request for all the Overwatch Councils' dossiers since its establishment

264
00:15:14,577 --> 00:15:17,056
to be handed over to the six ministries so they can be managed separately.

265
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,319
Are you saying

266
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,359
that you want the six ministries to be in charge of more responsibilities?

267
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:22,868
That's not all.

268
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,839
I want Chen Ping Ping to retire.

269
00:15:26,304 --> 00:15:27,442
What did he say?

270
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,240
It's a farce.

271
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,570
This is nonsense.

272
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,999
The officials still think the Overwatch Council

273
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,120
do more good than bad.

274
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:49,927
That means the six ministries are confused.

275
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,409
Censor Lai,

276
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,079
the Overwatch Council

277
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,520
has contributed a lot over the years.

278
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,799
But an unclear law

279
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,682
causes endless trouble in the future.

280
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,840
Your Majesty,

281
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,640
is Chen Ping Ping still under the kingdom law's control?

282
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:14,680
Are you saying that everyone else is confused

283
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,760
except for you?

284
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,200
Your Majesty, you must think twice.

285
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,202
Has this man always been so brave?

286
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,079
Censor Lai has always been someone

287
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,375
who complains about people whenever he catches them red-handed.

288
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:34,122
His Majesty can't say anything, right?

289
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,850
All right.

290
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,119
The Overwatch Council's case cannot be decided in a day.

291
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:43,962
I am a little tired.

292
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,719
That's all for today.

293
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,440
Your Majesty, I'm not done yet!

294
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,679
All right.

295
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,719
Who else are you complaining about?

296
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Your Majesty.

297
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,839
This is the last one.

298
00:17:04,476 --> 00:17:06,202
- Say it. - Your Majesty.

299
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:08,440
The Overwatch Council suppresses the six ministries

300
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,136
and its members' background is unclear.

301
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,840
This is just the situation on the surface.

302
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,136
To rectify the situation, we must deal with the problem's source.

303
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,959
The officials are responsible for the mistakes of the imperial court.

304
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,999
However, that's not the source of the problem.

305
00:17:19,117 --> 00:17:20,597
As the saying goes,

306
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:23,242
the subordinates follow their leader's bad example.

307
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,880
The last person I'm going to complain about is...

308
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,882
I'm going to complain about...

309
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,959
Say it. Say it bravely.

310
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,719
Your Majesty.

311
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,440
That's treason!

312
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,962
How dare you complain about His Majesty!

313
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:51,319
He's crazy.

314
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,920
He's crazy indeed.

315
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:08,977
Your Majesty.

316
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,282
Humans are not saints.

317
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,322
Everyone makes mistakes.

318
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,989
Someone who doesn't know his mistakes is foolish.

319
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,640
Someone who knows his mistakes without changing is a coward.

320
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,759
The foundation of the Qing Kingdom is not the Overwatch Council!

321
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,400
It is the officials

322
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:27,360
and a clear conscience.

323
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Your Majesty,

324
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,999
it's still not too late to make a change now.

325
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,320
Everyone in the world is wrong

326
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,479
and the officials of the six ministries are blind.

327
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,519
All of you heard that, right?

328
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,080
Censor Lai said

329
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,540
you were not the only ones who were wrong.

330
00:18:48,621 --> 00:18:51,002
I was wrong as well.

331
00:18:52,191 --> 00:18:53,710
Nonsense!

332
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:55,248
Lies!

333
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:57,519
How could you say that?

334
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:02,224
Your Majesty is courageous and extremely talented.

335
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:04,562
However, humans are not saints.

336
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:08,175
How can I know your mistakes and don't correct you?

337
00:19:08,285 --> 00:19:09,416
Your Majesty!

338
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:13,058
Lai Ming Cheng attacked and disrespected Your Majesty.

339
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:15,498
This man is presumptuous!

340
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:16,579
He is...

341
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,402
He is an animal!

342
00:19:58,189 --> 00:19:59,439
Your Majesty!

343
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,519
I can't hold it any longer.

344
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:08,258
Your Majesty has been racking his brains every day

345
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:11,759
for the sake of the Qing Kingdom's peace

346
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,082
yet this man

347
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,519
dares humiliate Your Majesty.

348
00:20:16,663 --> 00:20:18,442
I...

349
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,920
I'm in pain!

350
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:23,642
Your Majesty!

351
00:20:24,463 --> 00:20:25,863
Your Majesty!

352
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,162
Your Majesty's radiance

353
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,879
is brighter than the sun and the moon.

354
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,360
Your Majesty's grace is as great as our parents.

355
00:20:32,463 --> 00:20:34,025
When Your Majesty gets scolded,

356
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:37,959
it hurts more than my body being whipped!

357
00:20:38,046 --> 00:20:40,642
It hurts so much!

358
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:45,106
It hurts for me as well!

359
00:20:45,187 --> 00:20:46,187
Enough.

360
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,239
Your Majesty, Lai Ming Cheng's words are harsh to the ears

361
00:20:51,368 --> 00:20:52,727
but this is his responsibility

362
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:53,840
as a censor after all.

363
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:55,581
Your Majesty, please forgive him

364
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,602
and spare him so he can serve the kingdom.

365
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,479
I think so too.

366
00:20:59,632 --> 00:21:01,031
Lai Ming Cheng is absurd

367
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,920
but Your Majesty is magnanimous.

368
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,880
You will never stoop to his level.

369
00:21:05,023 --> 00:21:08,562
Reprimanding and punishing him is good enough.

370
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:10,390
I do see and hear

371
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:12,962
all your considerate thoughts.

372
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,559
President Chen.

373
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:17,239
Your Majesty,

374
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,202
I'm the one who is being complained.

375
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,199
I have no right to comment on this.

376
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:22,673
General Qin.

377
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,049
Yes.

378
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,511
Your Majesty, Lai Ming Cheng is muddled.

379
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,194
The Overwatch Council has contributed a lot to the Qing Kingdom.

380
00:21:32,218 --> 00:21:35,602
He doesn't understand Your Majesty's difficulties.

381
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:37,514
His position

382
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,522
should be demoted.

383
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,482
Chancellor Lin.

384
00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:48,671
I think

385
00:21:49,048 --> 00:21:50,842
everyone is right.

386
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,400
Everyone is right?

387
00:21:54,518 --> 00:21:56,518
Lai Ming Cheng committed a grave mistake.

388
00:21:56,622 --> 00:21:58,002
His crime is unforgivable.

389
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,279
However, everyone knows how magnanimous Your Majesty is.

390
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,830
It is reasonable to kill or punish him.

391
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,962
Your grace will decide whether to banish or use him.

392
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,479
I've considered it

393
00:22:11,912 --> 00:22:14,482
and think the crime of offending Your Majesty

394
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,802
should still be punished.

395
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,479
How he should be punished should be decided by Your Majesty.

396
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,569
I think

397
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,289
Lai Ming Cheng

398
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,279
makes a good complaint.

399
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,840
He made a good complaint.

400
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:33,080
He speaks bluntly

401
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:36,806
as expected from the best censor in the Qing Kingdom.

402
00:22:37,214 --> 00:22:39,456
He prioritizes the kingdom's matters regardless of self-interest.

403
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,360
All the officials should share his feelings.

404
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:46,799
I think I shouldn't punish him.

405
00:22:46,935 --> 00:22:48,574
I want to reward him.

406
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,600
Are you done?

407
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,359
Your Majesty.

408
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,080
I'm hurt and overcome with emotions right now.

409
00:23:03,342 --> 00:23:04,562
You got complained

410
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,722
and it hurts a lot for me.

411
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:10,999
However, having an upright official like Censor Lai

412
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,121
makes me feel emotional.

413
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,202
Right now,

414
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:18,039
my feelings are mixed with joy and sorrow.

415
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,479
I don't know if I should cry or laugh.

416
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:27,519
Enough.

417
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,239
I am thinking.

418
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,282
I am thinking about what I can reward him.

419
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:45,069
Your Majesty.

420
00:23:45,487 --> 00:23:46,602
Something present here.

421
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,319
The jewelry Fan Xian accused me of gifting.

422
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:50,912
President Chen, you are too narrow-minded.

423
00:23:50,936 --> 00:23:53,270
Will a censor of the Qing Kingdom

424
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:55,951
be interested in money?

425
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,241
- Chancellor Lin. - Your Majesty.

426
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:02,797
Since ancient times,

427
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:07,559
what does a censor care most about?

428
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,999
A censor reprimands the emperor bluntly

429
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,319
to leave his name in history.

430
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,350
Leaving his name in history?

431
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:19,799
Flogging.

432
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,790
Flogging can make them leave their names in history.

433
00:24:31,023 --> 00:24:32,623
Your Majesty, please think twice.

434
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:35,479
Historically, emperors who reward a flogging

435
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,202
might receive criticism.

436
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,080
I know if a censor is flogged,

437
00:24:44,175 --> 00:24:48,855
I won't end well in the historian's books.

438
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,758
I will take this loss

439
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,842
and grant him his wish!

440
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,240
Everyone.

441
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,959
Learn from him.

442
00:25:05,696 --> 00:25:08,577
Your Majesty is not muddled! I am muddled!

443
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,871
Your Majesty!

444
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:12,723
Censor Lai made contributions to investigating corruption after all!

445
00:25:13,032 --> 00:25:14,762
You protect him so much.

446
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:15,909
All right.

447
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:19,279
You will supervise Censor Lai's punishment.

448
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,799
Fan Xian, His Majesty has issued his edict.

449
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:43,682
I accept!

450
00:25:57,966 --> 00:25:59,686
Where's Eunuch Hou? Where's Lai Ming Cheng?

451
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:00,727
I don't know.

452
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,160
Where's Eunuch Hou? Where's Lai Ming Cheng?

453
00:26:08,264 --> 00:26:09,362
I don't know.

454
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:10,682
I don't know.

455
00:26:19,004 --> 00:26:20,919
Fan Xian has been ordered to supervise the punishment!

456
00:26:20,943 --> 00:26:23,062
Where is Lai Ming Cheng being flogged?

457
00:26:35,987 --> 00:26:38,282
Where's Eunuch Hou? Where's Lai Ming Cheng?

458
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,400
Lord Fan,

459
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,440
why are you here?

460
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,200
His Majesty asked me to supervise his punishment.

461
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,002
I don't need it.

462
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,002
How many more times will he be flogged?

463
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,082
Besides asking you to supervise the punishment,

464
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,644
does His Majesty have any more orders?

465
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,480
No.

466
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,562
That means he doesn't plan to stop.

467
00:27:36,046 --> 00:27:38,096
Stop the flogging! I'll ask His Majesty!

468
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:40,018
Lord Fan.

469
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,562
It's too late.

470
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,351
Lord Fan, we've arrived at the Overwatch Council.

471
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:19,239
I think President Chen is waiting for you.

472
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,762
I don't feel like meeting anyone.

473
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,200
You've never been to this room.

474
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,722
People seldom get to come inside this room.

475
00:30:05,557 --> 00:30:08,238
This treasure is crucial to the eight bureaus.

476
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:10,401
All keys of the eight bureaus regardless of size

477
00:30:10,488 --> 00:30:12,762
are sent here immediately.

478
00:30:13,695 --> 00:30:15,642
The areas are differentiated by colors.

479
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,640
I can also send a secret order from here as soon as possible.

480
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,082
Your mother left this treasure to me.

481
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,039
What's wrong?

482
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,609
Are you in a bad mood?

483
00:30:58,348 --> 00:30:59,709
I don't understand.

484
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:03,920
Why was Lai Ming Cheng flogged to death?

485
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,469
In the past, I was told

486
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
that it was fine to scold His Majesty in his face.

487
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,400
His Majesty is magnanimous.

488
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:13,838
Not only is His Majesty fine with being scolded to his face,

489
00:31:13,862 --> 00:31:15,943
but His Majesty will even laugh at it.

490
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:18,239
Why did he flog Lai Ming Cheng to death this time?

491
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,681
It would be fine even if he complained about His Majesty.

492
00:31:21,354 --> 00:31:23,954
However, something that provokes His Majesty cannot be mentioned.

493
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,800
Is it the Overwatch Council?

494
00:31:25,887 --> 00:31:29,367
It's the Qing Kingdom's grace.

495
00:31:31,502 --> 00:31:32,862
In that case,

496
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:35,077
were all censors who dared complain

497
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,402
about the Overwatch Council dead?

498
00:31:37,492 --> 00:31:39,545
Many censors complained about the Overwatch Council.

499
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:41,495
Lai Ming Cheng was the first to be flogged to death.

500
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,137
How was Lai Ming Cheng different from the other censors in the past?

501
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:45,521
Did Lai Ming Cheng go to find you?

502
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,960
He did.

503
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,242
A mutual investigation.

504
00:31:49,353 --> 00:31:50,434
Looking at the dossier

505
00:31:50,515 --> 00:31:53,235
while the Overwatch Council investigates corruption is not a secret.

506
00:31:56,295 --> 00:31:57,535
That was why His Majesty did that?

507
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:00,640
The Overwatch Council is independent from the six ministries because

508
00:32:00,782 --> 00:32:03,463
to prevent some people from extending their authority.

509
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,490
I shouldn't agree with him.

510
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,319
I caused his death.

511
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,920
It wasn't you.

512
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,160
It didn't matter whether you agreed to it or not.

513
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,480
When Lai Ming Cheng decided to choose you

514
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,759
and went to find you,

515
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,799
his fate had already been sealed.

516
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,369
Finding me

517
00:32:26,582 --> 00:32:27,943
is the reason for his death?

518
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,369
Try to think again.

519
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,680
Why did His Majesty ask you to overwatch his punishment?

520
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,120
Do you still appreciate Lai Ming Cheng?

521
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
Yes.

522
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,690
Do you know?

523
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,200
When the censors of the Censorate

524
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,959
collected Lai Ming Cheng's body,

525
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,602
all of them hated you.

526
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,202
From today onward,

527
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,402
everyone from the Censorate

528
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:02,440
will not be friends with you.

529
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,110
You want to take over the Imperial Treasury.

530
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,039
You want to take over the Overwatch Council.

531
00:33:13,008 --> 00:33:15,202
There has never been an official

532
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,802
with such a heavy responsibility.

533
00:33:21,295 --> 00:33:24,162
I can only be a lonely official.

534
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,042
Divine might is unpredictable.

535
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,482
His Majesty's thoughts are deep.

536
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,809
You must

537
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,722
remember these words.

538
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,880
Working with the Overwatch Council,

539
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,559
complaining about the Overwatch Council,

540
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,080
and coming to find me.

541
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,759
These are the cause of his death.

542
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:54,082
This ruler of ours

543
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,479
cannot accept

544
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,719
someone who is out of his control.

545
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,039
But I don't get it.

546
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:05,122
Don't the law and the Overwatch Council

547
00:34:05,215 --> 00:34:07,254
exist for the sake of the people of the kingdom?

548
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,039
Which is more important between the people and His Majesty?

549
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,069
You must bury these words deep in your heart

550
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,133
and not say them

551
00:34:14,214 --> 00:34:15,735
from today onward.

552
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:25,063
I know the answer.

553
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,570
I won't ask anymore.

554
00:34:34,557 --> 00:34:35,837
There are always some people

555
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,799
who take a different path from His Majesty.

556
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,719
My mother?

557
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,859
She's dead.

558
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
Yes.

559
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,002
Your mother is already dead.

560
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,600
But the path is always there.

561
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,880
Go home.

562
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:12,122
It's raining heavily.

563
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,610
Get changed

564
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,640
and warm your body.

565
00:36:40,446 --> 00:36:41,446
Xian.

566
00:36:42,518 --> 00:36:44,879
There's no rush in studying. Take a break if you're tired.

567
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,200
That won't do.

568
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,760
I still have many books to memorize.

569
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,760
These are all my books.

570
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,839
Yes. They are all your books about medicine.

571
00:36:52,037 --> 00:36:53,718
I was wondering why my books went missing.

572
00:36:53,868 --> 00:36:56,301
- Why did you feel like studying medicine suddenly? - I want to help you.

573
00:36:56,325 --> 00:36:57,325
Help me?

574
00:36:58,616 --> 00:36:59,759
Father pretended to be sick.

575
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,960
Thankfully, you poisoned him to avoid the crisis.

576
00:37:02,165 --> 00:37:03,242
Later, I asked around

577
00:37:03,407 --> 00:37:05,271
and found out that poison theory is also medicine theory.

578
00:37:05,295 --> 00:37:06,482
So, I'm studying medicine.

579
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,799
If you are not around while someone is pretending to be sick,

580
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:09,872
I can do it.

581
00:37:11,693 --> 00:37:13,653
- Studying medicine is tough. - I'm not afraid.

582
00:37:13,694 --> 00:37:15,482
I've memorized half of these books.

583
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:16,929
It's not urgent.

584
00:37:17,786 --> 00:37:19,802
Xian, why don't you give me a test?

585
00:37:19,969 --> 00:37:21,628
No need. You can memorize them on your own.

586
00:37:21,652 --> 00:37:22,892
I'll just sit here for a while.

587
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,480
Xian,

588
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,562
are you all right?

589
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:42,079
I'm fine.

590
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,682
I'm just feeling annoyed.

591
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,160
I came here to calm myself down.

592
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,442
Why don't you tell me about it?

593
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,042
There's nothing to tell.

594
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,120
It's only the matters at the imperial court.

595
00:37:56,422 --> 00:37:57,422
Xian,

596
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:59,640
why don't you stop being an official?

597
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:02,559
What can I do then?

598
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:04,202
You can do anything you want.

599
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,760
Traveling every day is good.

600
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:08,042
What if I run out of money?

601
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,289
I can support you.

602
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:10,730
I'm studying medicine.

603
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,199
I've asked around. Studying medicine makes good money.

604
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:15,788
- You support me? - Yes. And Wan Er as well.

605
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,200
I can support both of you.

606
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,329
- Are you trying to make me happy? - I'm serious.

607
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:23,331
I'm really being serious.

608
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,519
All right.

609
00:38:31,471 --> 00:38:32,830
If there's one day

610
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,799
when I lose everything and have nowhere to go,

611
00:38:36,907 --> 00:38:37,989
I'll rely on you.

612
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,350
It won't happen.

613
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,050
If it does,

614
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:42,802
I'll protect you.

615
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,809
It's a promise.

616
00:38:46,466 --> 00:38:48,306
You're a puppy if you don't keep your promise.

617
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,389
Memorizing books is not enough if you want to study medicine.

618
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,133
Wait for me. Let me find something for you.

619
00:38:55,824 --> 00:38:58,162
(Fan Residence)

620
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,719
You need to see blood if you want to study medicine.

621
00:39:13,158 --> 00:39:14,478
Cut its stomach

622
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:15,776
before closing its wounds.

623
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,840
- With this? - This is so much better.

624
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,200
When my teacher taught me,

625
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,530
I had to cut up dead bodies.

626
00:39:25,152 --> 00:39:26,402
Cutting it when it's alive?

627
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:28,560
That hurts so much.

628
00:39:30,422 --> 00:39:32,462
Chloroform, an anesthetic made by the Third Bureau.

629
00:39:32,543 --> 00:39:33,783
It's guaranteed to be painless.

630
00:39:38,322 --> 00:39:42,149
(Moon Embracing Pavilion)

631
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:43,642
Everyone, look closely.

632
00:39:44,222 --> 00:39:46,282
These are your indentures.

633
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,639
It's really an indenture.

634
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,999
Why does he have it?

635
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,282
I don't know.

636
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,682
From now on,

637
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,602
you are only selling your talent.

638
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,600
However, you are all free.

639
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:59,329
- Free? - Free?

640
00:40:02,606 --> 00:40:04,567
Only perform without selling our bodies?

641
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,799
Will people still patronize us?

642
00:40:10,502 --> 00:40:11,657
Indeed.

643
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,960
The future is unpredictable.

644
00:40:14,534 --> 00:40:17,413
That is why Lord Fan allows all of you to decide if you want to leave.

645
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:21,719
Can we leave now?

646
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,079
Of course.

647
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
Be my guest.

648
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,449
Are we really leaving?

649
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,439
What about both of us?

650
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:35,959
There's nothing on us now. Let's go.

651
00:40:35,983 --> 00:40:37,082
Let's go.

652
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,790
Lord Fan can order us to stay.

653
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,239
There's no need to let us make our choice.

654
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,119
We are already used to

655
00:40:45,229 --> 00:40:46,722
having other people decide our fates.

656
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,799
He said he didn't like it.

657
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,759
Lord Fan also said

658
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:57,919
all of you should decide your fate.

659
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:00,080
Decide our fates?

660
00:41:01,886 --> 00:41:03,442
I want to stay and give it a try.

661
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:05,039
All right.

662
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:08,713
Let's welcome Miss Sang Wen to Moon Embracing Pavilion!

663
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,177
I also want to stay and give it a try.

664
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:11,362
Me too.

665
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,522
Me too.

666
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,202
It's our first time deciding our fates.

667
00:41:14,425 --> 00:41:16,282
We are willing to believe in Lord Fan.

668
00:41:16,494 --> 00:41:20,853
We are willing to stay.

669
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:28,840
Feather duster!

670
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,200
Fragrance sachets!

671
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,240
Take a look! Feather Duster!

672
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,479
We have everything!

673
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:34,879
Come and take a look!

674
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,120
Freshly cooked lamb soup!

675
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,312
Come and try it!

676
00:41:49,393 --> 00:41:51,633
Freshly cooked lamb soup!

677
00:41:51,744 --> 00:41:52,994
Sure. Give me a bowl.

678
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:02,785
Lord Fan.

679
00:42:03,295 --> 00:42:04,962
Something's not right.

680
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,962
They are here to stop me.

681
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:15,197
Why don't we take a detour?

682
00:42:15,278 --> 00:42:16,408
Keep going.

683
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,759
Since they are here, I won't avoid them.

684
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,400
Sure.

685
00:42:26,568 --> 00:42:28,922
- Take a look. - Come and take a look.

686
00:42:36,536 --> 00:42:37,536
Make way!

687
00:42:37,617 --> 00:42:38,736
Move!

688
00:42:38,817 --> 00:42:39,817
- Move! - Run!

689
00:42:39,898 --> 00:42:40,898
Move!

690
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:45,680
Who is this?

691
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,839
The one inside the cart, come out!

692
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,360
Lord Fan,

693
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:53,962
these people come from an impressive background.

694
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:57,319
They are either from a duke's family or a marquess' family.
