00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:30,968
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,054
(Episode 10)

3
00:01:41,432 --> 00:01:42,703
What's this?

4
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,042
A seat granted by His Majesty.

5
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,587
Even the crown prince is standing. Who is he?

6
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:53,526
The chief councilor, General Qin Ye.

7
00:01:53,796 --> 00:01:55,882
The chief councilor, huh?

8
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,002
- So, he's the top military officer.   - That's right.

9
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:00,639
Every soldier we have in the Qing Kingdom

10
00:02:00,736 --> 00:02:02,816
is under General Qin's disposal.

11
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,642
He's not wearing any armor.

12
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:07,682
That's unnecessary. This is a court session.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,242
If so, who does this empty seat belong to, then?

14
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Salute.

15
00:02:16,084 --> 00:02:18,482
Don't do this. I don't deserve it.

16
00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:20,442
They're not bowing to you.

17
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,562
Stop sleeping.

18
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,002
All of them are watching.

19
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:07,562
Chancellor Lin, you're here.

20
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,642
I wasn't sleeping.

21
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:11,162
I was awake.

22
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:20,682
(Lin Ruo Fu, Chancellor)

23
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,480
So, Uncle is that mighty?

24
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,562
He's the head of all officials.

25
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:30,696
Lord Fan, you...

26
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,440
This is my position.

27
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,689
I'll stand here.

28
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,950
Your position is over there.

29
00:03:36,031 --> 00:03:38,591
You should stand there. I won't join you.

30
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:44,238
- Where's the throne?   - What?

31
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,842
Why isn't this the throne?

32
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,042
Why did you drag me here?

33
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,399
His Majesty thought the throne was uncomfortable.

34
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,762
That's why he changed it.

35
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,602
He's quite willful, huh?

36
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,042
Lower your volume.

37
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,202
His Majesty said

38
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,962
the seat doesn't matter.

39
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,000
What matters is the person sitting above it.

40
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:10,722
His Majesty's words do make sense.

41
00:04:11,365 --> 00:04:13,122
His Majesty's words always made sense.

42
00:04:19,662 --> 00:04:23,143
So, besides His Majesty,

43
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:24,749
only the two of them can sit, huh?

44
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,839
Three of them.

45
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,242
There are only two empty seats.

46
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,882
You're right.

47
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,882
Were you waiting for me?

48
00:05:04,495 --> 00:05:05,979
What act are you guys staging now?

49
00:05:06,094 --> 00:05:07,522
What do you mean?

50
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,608
Did you teach Fan Xian how to write his self-defense statement?

51
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:12,174
It was his own idea.

52
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:14,082
Did you not instigate him at all?

53
00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:15,206
No.

54
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,602
I don't trust you at all.

55
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:26,562
You know that it's difficult for me to speak with my identity.

56
00:05:27,391 --> 00:05:30,042
However, the Censorate is infuriated.

57
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,562
You should speak up for him later.

58
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,082
Why are you keeping quiet?

59
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,722
I can't speak up for him.

60
00:05:41,712 --> 00:05:42,952
Not even a single word.

61
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,642
Stop pretending.

62
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,639
Thank you.

63
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,082
Put your back into it.

64
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:04,162
Has General Qin always been like this?

65
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,119
Can you stop teasing the old general?

66
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,282
I'm just asking. Can't I do so?

67
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,209
Fan Xian.

68
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
That's me.

69
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,522
You are?

70
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,162
I've read your poem collections.

71
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,682
I admire your flair too.

72
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:23,162
I didn't write them.

73
00:06:23,902 --> 00:06:25,042
I know.

74
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,842
A deity appeared in your dream

75
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,482
and taught you how to write them.

76
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,762
There's no deity.

77
00:06:30,878 --> 00:06:32,202
I come from a different era.

78
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:34,679
All educated individuals should know

79
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:36,402
how to manifest illustrious virtues.

80
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,399
How could you not know that?

81
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,042
No matter who's your backer,

82
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:45,882
and no matter how amazing your literary talent is,

83
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,522
Today, I must uphold the law and eradicate evil.

84
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,040
You are?

85
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,286
This is the left censor-in-chief,

86
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,082
Lai Ming Cheng.

87
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:56,642
Your Highness.

88
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:59,442
Lord Lai is the top official within the Censorate.

89
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:02,562
Both his character and knowledge are truly impressive.

90
00:07:05,221 --> 00:07:08,781
Lord Lai, you should reserve your strength for the main event.

91
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,362
Your Highness, you must be joking.

92
00:07:12,285 --> 00:07:13,886
We'll know who's loyal and who's treacherous

93
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:15,762
in the court session later.

94
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,329
There's no issue with his character.

95
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:24,842
It's just that he's inflexible.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,198
If not, he wouldn't have remained in the Censorate all his life.

97
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:30,102
How do you plan to deal with the situation?

98
00:07:30,222 --> 00:07:32,463
I'm an honest person. I'll deal with it honestly.

99
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,442
An honest person, huh?

100
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,522
I like that.

101
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,159
Greetings, Your Highness.

102
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:51,002
Cheng Ze, please spare the formalities.

103
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:54,402
It'll damage our bond if you stay too courteous.

104
00:07:55,247 --> 00:07:58,447
Your Highness, your words have warmed my heart.

105
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,487
As long as it doesn't burn it.

106
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,280
- That cooled down my heart.   - That was quick.

107
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:04,842
Your Highness, we encourage each other.

108
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:13,102
Why hasn't President Chen arrived yet?

109
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,479
I don't believe this.

110
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,120
You're no longer young, you know?

111
00:08:19,696 --> 00:08:22,410
- Now, you can't even push me up the steps.   - As if!

112
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,600
What are you hiding in your wheelchair?

113
00:08:24,695 --> 00:08:25,858
It's so dense!

114
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,282
Divine soldiers.

115
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,162
I can never trust your words.

116
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:54,132
This won't do. I need to get help.

117
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:56,014
- Wait here.   - No need for that.

118
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,570
Help has arrived.

119
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
President.

120
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,162
Your Highness, you're here too.

121
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:13,402
Let me push him.

122
00:09:16,414 --> 00:09:18,682
You blocked my steed when we first met.

123
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,922
Why are you digging up old debts now?

124
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,640
I knew you were bold before this.

125
00:09:22,836 --> 00:09:24,282
I never expected you to be this bold.

126
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:27,239
You're going against the Censorate alone. That's gutsy of you.

127
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,679
Your Highness, are you here to enjoy the show too?

128
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,922
Isn't that obvious?

129
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,802
- Cheng Ru.   - Cheng Ru.

130
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,520
What's with all the sweat?

131
00:09:44,623 --> 00:09:46,122
Don't do anything stupid later.

132
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,699
Don't worry. I'm not a lunatic.

133
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,042
What's going on?

134
00:09:58,926 --> 00:09:59,929
His Majesty will arrive soon.

135
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,085
Lord Fan, hurry and return to your position.

136
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,829
Remember, don't move casually.

137
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,362
How many times will they ring the bell?

138
00:10:06,984 --> 00:10:08,162
Hurry up.

139
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
Everyone,

140
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:51,522
I assume you all have heard about

141
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:53,351
the incident with the Censorate.

142
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:58,442
Have you all read Fan Xian's defense booklet?

143
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,882
You guys haven't read it, huh?

144
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,640
Read it carefully.

145
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:26,160
Read it thoroughly.

146
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:36,759
Lai Ming Cheng.

147
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,159
Yes, Your Majesty.

148
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,002
Who are you trying to impeach here?

149
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:45,762
I'm impeaching Fan Xian, a law official,

150
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,962
for accepting bribes

151
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,962
and disregarding the law!

152
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
Fan Xian.

153
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,922
- Yes, Your Majesty.   - Do you confess your crime?

154
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,280
I have no crime to confess.

155
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,240
Accepting bribes and disregarding the law?

156
00:12:01,327 --> 00:12:02,962
I have no idea where that came from.

157
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
Lai Ming Cheng.

158
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,040
The Vegetable Inspection Office bribed the First Bureau.

159
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,959
Fan Xian took the bribe in public.

160
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,240
We have many witnesses of his crime.

161
00:12:12,343 --> 00:12:13,703
This is absolutely true.

162
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:15,281
Do you confess your crime?

163
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,560
I didn't take any bribes. I'm innocent.

164
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:18,759
Fan Xian,

165
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,400
I have both witnesses and evidence of your crime here.

166
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,722
How dare you still deny it?

167
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:24,983
I didn't take any bribes. How should I confess?

168
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,802
Your Majesty, please allow me to summon the witnesses here.

169
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:31,842
Spare yourself from the trouble.

170
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,922
Who was the one who tried to bribe him?

171
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:37,442
It was Eunuch Dai.

172
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,557
Summon him.

173
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:41,842
Summon Eunuch Dai.

174
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,390
Summon Eunuch Dai.

175
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,842
Summon Eunuch Dai.

176
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,399
Chen Ping Ping.

177
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,202
Yes, Your Majesty.

178
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,682
Fan Xian works for the Overwatch Council.

179
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,682
How do you explain yourself?

180
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,680
Your Majesty, the Overwatch Council is under you too.

181
00:13:03,863 --> 00:13:05,072
No favoritism will be practiced

182
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,240
in front of the law.

183
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:11,079
If so, do you think Fan Xian looks like an unlawful individual?

184
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
He does.

185
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,562
But...

186
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,002
Your Majesty, to be honest,

187
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,122
even since I took over the Overwatch Council,

188
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,402
everyone looks like an unlawful individual to me.

189
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,722
Listen to what he's saying.

190
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,000
What nonsense is he talking about?

191
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,359
Precisely.

192
00:13:42,764 --> 00:13:44,844
Everyone looks unlawful to you?

193
00:13:44,975 --> 00:13:46,242
Indeed.

194
00:13:50,905 --> 00:13:52,554
Let me take a look, then.

195
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,082
Do you think Chancellor Lin looks like one?

196
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:37,192
He looks exactly like one.

197
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,522
How could Chancellor Lin look like an unlawful individual?

198
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,202
That's nonsense.

199
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,082
President Chen,

200
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,162
you have sharp eyes.

201
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:50,202
I have poor vision. Sorry for that.

202
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,322
Chancellor Lin,

203
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,442
President Chen was just joking with you.

204
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,562
Your Majesty, I love to joke around.

205
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:03,487
You two are too close to Fan Xian.

206
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,162
Your words don't count.

207
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
General Qin.

208
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,762
Yes, Your Majesty.

209
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:14,479
Do you think Fan Xian looks like an unlawful individual?

210
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,802
Your Majesty,

211
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,640
fighting in war is the only thing I know.

212
00:15:19,782 --> 00:15:21,462
I know nothing else.

213
00:15:23,474 --> 00:15:24,682
However,

214
00:15:26,863 --> 00:15:29,082
I don't think he looks like one.

215
00:15:29,163 --> 00:15:30,163
But why?

216
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,602
Fan Xian went to Northern Qi as our diplomat.

217
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,200
He raised the Qing Kingdom's flag in another state.

218
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:42,122
Even soldiers like us were impressed with his feat.

219
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,322
- Indeed.   - He's right.

220
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,922
I've also heard about that.

221
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:52,202
A talented youth like him

222
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,599
doesn't look like a crook.

223
00:15:56,878 --> 00:15:58,482
Thank you, General Qin.

224
00:16:00,646 --> 00:16:03,045
I'm just speaking the truth.

225
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:06,682
I heard that

226
00:16:07,506 --> 00:16:10,082
you even seduced the Saintess of Northern Qi.

227
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:17,937
Great job!

228
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,842
General Qin, that's just a rumor!

229
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:24,522
But it might be true.

230
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:25,920
Uncle!

231
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,402
That's not true!

232
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:34,390
I was just saying.

233
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:36,402
Please don't take it to heart.

234
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:38,922
Understood.

235
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,602
Isn't that Eunuch Dai?

236
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,750
My shoe fell off.

237
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:05,882
Let me put on my shoes first before I go to the court.

238
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
I...

239
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,599
I...

240
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,360
If you cause disorder in the court,

241
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:14,399
all of us will be implicated too.

242
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,719
He's truly bold.

243
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:40,890
That's right.

244
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:42,375
He actually did that.

245
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,522
I'm Eunuch Dai.

246
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:58,282
Greetings, Your Majesty.

247
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,553
Lai Ming Cheng.

248
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:06,802
Eunuch Dai,

249
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,962
please read this.

250
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,722
This is the testimony.

251
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:23,482
The First Bureau sealed off the Vegetable Inspection Office.

252
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:25,642
Eunuch Dai, you rushed there

253
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,780
and bribed Fan Xian with 3,000 taels.

254
00:18:29,055 --> 00:18:30,055
Eunuch Dai,

255
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:32,362
do you admit your crime?

256
00:18:32,926 --> 00:18:34,162
Wait, I...

257
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,920
- But...   - How could one give out bribes

258
00:18:37,126 --> 00:18:38,566
in public?

259
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:42,722
It doesn't make sense, don't you think?

260
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,482
He gave him a sealed letter.

261
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:47,519
If so, how would you know that he bribed him with money?

262
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,360
Fan Xian opened the letter.

263
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,080
Not only that,

264
00:18:51,183 --> 00:18:53,103
but he also told everyone there about the amount.

265
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,400
All of the witnesses saw what happened.

266
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,680
He's daring enough to take bribes in public.

267
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,562
We can see that Fan Xian

268
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:07,175
is truly arrogant!

269
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:10,970
Why are you staring at me?

270
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,482
He's asking you.

271
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,359
Answer him.

272
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,640
Eunuch Dai,

273
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,442
we have concrete evidence of your crime.

274
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:21,057
You have to think twice before you speak.

275
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,559
Eunuch Dai,

276
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,759
don't panic. It's just 3,000 taels.

277
00:19:28,647 --> 00:19:30,842
The Vegetable Inspection Office is under the Imperial Harem.

278
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,522
You won't be affected by such charges.

279
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,122
3,000 taels?

280
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,882
3,000 taels is only the tip of the iceberg!

281
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,002
Your Majesty,

282
00:19:47,105 --> 00:19:51,082
the Censorate has done our investigation diligently.

283
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,042
The Vegetable Inspection Office has committed many misdeeds.

284
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:56,282
We acquired evidence of their crime easily.

285
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,160
The Vegetable Inspection Office had exploited vegetable farmers.

286
00:20:01,392 --> 00:20:02,912
They stopped at nothing.

287
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:04,722
And, Eunuch Dai was the cause of everything.

288
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:08,122
He has more than two private manors outside the city.

289
00:20:08,235 --> 00:20:10,722
And, he even used the price to set up a trap for vegetable farmers.

290
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:12,640
Some of them were forced

291
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,482
to sell their children away because of him.

292
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,751
Some even sold their daughters to brothels because of him.

293
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,922
He has committed unpardonable crimes.

294
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,842
His actions infuriate even the heavens!

295
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:27,402
The people call them the Extortion Office in secret.

296
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:33,229
Lord Lai, you're generous with your words.

297
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,471
I just don't know if your evidence is solid enough.

298
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:38,040
I have plenty of solid evidence.

299
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,682
Your Majesty, please take a look.

300
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:47,246
Lord Lai.

301
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
Chancellor Lin.

302
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,719
Laws in the Qing Kingdom are strict.

303
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,942
The Ministry of Justice, Court of Judicial Review,

304
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:00,762
and the magistrate offices, we all uphold our own duties.

305
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:03,151
Even if one of the subjects is breaking the law,

306
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,230
we should investigate them according to the law.

307
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:08,522
How could we present the evidence

308
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:11,642
to His Majesty as it is?

309
00:21:12,055 --> 00:21:13,055
Chancellor Lin,

310
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:16,366
are you saying that I shouldn't review the fold?

311
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,390
Your Majesty, you're the ruler of the kingdom.

312
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:21,160
There's nothing you shouldn't review.

313
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:23,927
However, as I lead the Six Ministries,

314
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:26,679
I'm responsible for sharing your burden with you.

315
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:28,320
Your Majesty, if you're troubled because of this,

316
00:21:28,423 --> 00:21:29,962
and if this continues,

317
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:32,231
I'm afraid the Six Ministries will slack off,

318
00:21:32,822 --> 00:21:34,642
and no one will respect the law.

319
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:36,520
You have a point.

320
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:39,650
I should not review the fold.

321
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,602
Chancellor Lin, you're wrong.

322
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:46,120
Firstly, the Vegetable Inspection Office is under the Imperial Harem.

323
00:21:46,302 --> 00:21:47,762
His Majesty should pass righteous judgment.

324
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,119
Secondly, the Censorate is responsible for impeaching unlawful subjects.

325
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:55,159
We're not overstepping our boundary by presenting evidence to His Majesty.

326
00:21:55,286 --> 00:21:56,805
There's a third point, right?

327
00:21:56,935 --> 00:21:58,024
Thirdly,

328
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,439
Chancellor Lin, the Six Ministries are under you.

329
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:04,510
I'm impeaching Fan Xian for this case.

330
00:22:04,687 --> 00:22:06,046
As everyone knows,

331
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,482
Fan Xian will be your son-in-law soon, Chancellor Lin.

332
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,959
You should try to avoid suspicion.

333
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,559
So, Lord Lai,

334
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:22,122
you're worried that I might practice favoritism?

335
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,887
Everyone practices favoritism.

336
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,482
Chancellor Lin is upright and just.

337
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,242
You think he'll practice favoritism?

338
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,682
I'll never believe it.

339
00:22:30,843 --> 00:22:32,522
Me too.

340
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:35,402
Your Majesty,

341
00:22:35,743 --> 00:22:37,982
Lord Lai has a point.

342
00:22:38,255 --> 00:22:39,922
Your Majesty, you should pass judgment

343
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:42,842
to the Vegetable Inspection Office's case.

344
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:45,082
I trust your judgment.

345
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:49,642
But I don't trust my own judgment.

346
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,082
Lai Ming Cheng.

347
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,562
- Yes, Your Majesty.   - Show it to him.

348
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,519
I know my fault now!

349
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:09,522
Your Majesty, please spare me!

350
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:12,079
I'm willing to give up all my assets

351
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,722
and atone for my mistakes!

352
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
Your Majesty,

353
00:23:17,711 --> 00:23:18,962
he has confessed his crime.

354
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:21,122
He's done for.

355
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,042
Take him away.

356
00:23:28,694 --> 00:23:31,159
Your Majesty, please spare me!

357
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,439
Please spare me!

358
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,922
Please spare me!

359
00:23:35,061 --> 00:23:36,821
Your Majesty!

360
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:44,079
Lord Fan, how do you feel

361
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,882
after witnessing that?

362
00:23:46,695 --> 00:23:48,882
That Dai fellow is truly atrocious.

363
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,962
Lord Lai, you rid the world of a great evil. The people will remember you.

364
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:54,962
Since it has come to this,

365
00:23:55,615 --> 00:23:56,732
do you confess your crime?

366
00:23:56,813 --> 00:23:58,093
What crime have I committed?

367
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,679
Do you dare to say that you didn't take the 3,000 taels?

368
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:01,769
I did.

369
00:24:02,544 --> 00:24:04,762
- That means he's confessing to his crime.   - Wait.

370
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,521
Lord Lai, are you saying that I accepted the bribe

371
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,442
just because I took the 3,000 taels?

372
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:11,082
Do you dare to say otherwise?

373
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,049
Lord Lai,

374
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,239
how dare you slander a prince?

375
00:24:25,573 --> 00:24:26,773
What nonsense are you talking about?

376
00:24:26,854 --> 00:24:29,454
I took the bribe in public back then, right?

377
00:24:29,543 --> 00:24:32,920
That's precisely why we have concrete evidence of your crime!

378
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,282
Let me ask you this, then.

379
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:36,160
Wasn't His Highness there as well?

380
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:37,287
His Highness?

381
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,002
His Highness was there?

382
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,722
His Highness was there.

383
00:24:44,936 --> 00:24:46,442
If I did break the law,

384
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,350
why didn't His Highness impeach me after so long?

385
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,279
Lord Lai said I accepted bribes,

386
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,999
yet His Highness acted as if he saw nothing.

387
00:24:56,102 --> 00:24:59,682
Doesn't that mean His Highness was in cahoots with me?

388
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:03,082
- This...   - How dare you slander a prince?

389
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:04,950
You deserved to be executed!

390
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:06,802
Why would His Highness be there?

391
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,166
I was at the Vegetable Inspection Office back then.

392
00:25:22,774 --> 00:25:23,774
You.

393
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,922
Did you see him taking the bribe?

394
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,679
Yes, I did. Just like what Lord Lai had said,

395
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,239
he broke the law by taking the 3,000 taels.

396
00:25:32,342 --> 00:25:34,183
I should've impeached Fan Xian as well.

397
00:25:35,648 --> 00:25:37,362
If so, why didn't you do so?

398
00:25:38,056 --> 00:25:39,402
It's because I trusted you.

399
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,842
Fan Xian impressed the world with his talent.

400
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:45,758
He was known as the poetic genius not long after coming here.

401
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,439
And, he holds an important post in the Overwatch Council.

402
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:49,144
He has a bright future ahead of him.

403
00:25:49,225 --> 00:25:50,962
No matter how I think about it, it didn't make sense

404
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,562
for him to destroy his future for 3,000 taels.

405
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,360
If I knew this was his true nature, I would've impeached him.

406
00:25:56,463 --> 00:25:58,663
However, he took the bribe in public.

407
00:25:58,903 --> 00:26:00,103
I was perplexed.

408
00:26:00,236 --> 00:26:02,359
I thought he had an ulterior motive.

409
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,962
Therefore, I tried to wait it out.

410
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:07,282
Excellent words.

411
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,322
Your Highness, you took the words

412
00:26:10,686 --> 00:26:12,088
right out of my mouth.

413
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:27,630
Maybe you took the risk because you thought

414
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:29,278
3,000 taels was a small sum!

415
00:26:29,413 --> 00:26:30,464
Ridiculous!

416
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,039
The people in the capital might not even save up to ten taels per year!

417
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,640
To them, 3,000 taels

418
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,282
is a sum so huge that it's unimaginable.

419
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:39,800
As officials,

420
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,564
we should obey the law and understand the people.

421
00:26:41,645 --> 00:26:43,442
Lord Lai, I can't believe you actually said that.

422
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,562
That was utterly disappointing.

423
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,120
But you did take the 3,000 taels!

424
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,279
- That's right.   - You took it!

425
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,442
Yes, you're right.

426
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:00,022
Lord Lai, have you gone fishing before?

427
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,482
Do you think you can catch a fish

428
00:27:01,563 --> 00:27:02,842
with no bait?

429
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,840
So, you took the bribe on purpose

430
00:27:06,055 --> 00:27:08,242
so that the Vegetable Inspection Office could take the bait?

431
00:27:08,325 --> 00:27:09,496
To be honest,

432
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:12,038
I've taken their misdeeds to heart long ago.

433
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:15,202
Lord Lai, I intend to rid the kingdom of all evil just like you.

434
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,120
We're bonded by an unspoken affinity.

435
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,640
Look at him!

436
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,600
Lord Fan has a silver tongue indeed!

437
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,322
I'm just stating facts.

438
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:28,375
So, you say that you were investigating them as well?

439
00:27:28,566 --> 00:27:29,776
Do you have any concrete evidence, then?

440
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:33,142
I handed the 3,000 taels to President Chen right after taking it.

441
00:27:33,223 --> 00:27:35,863
I've also told him that I intend to investigate them.

442
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:40,519
Really?

443
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
That's right.

444
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:45,286
Doesn't that make this a misunderstanding, then?

445
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:48,400
This was a misunderstanding from the start.

446
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,119
President Chen,

447
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,202
it's not that I don't trust you.

448
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,640
But I have one more question.

449
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:02,759
Lord Fan,

450
00:28:03,102 --> 00:28:05,342
since you said it was a misunderstanding,

451
00:28:05,453 --> 00:28:09,532
why didn't you explain yourself in the defense booklet

452
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,279
when I impeached you

453
00:28:12,463 --> 00:28:14,302
back then?

454
00:28:15,063 --> 00:28:18,303
Lord Lai, I didn't dare to explain myself over there.

455
00:28:18,487 --> 00:28:19,487
But why?

456
00:28:21,642 --> 00:28:23,268
The Vegetable Inspection Office is just a small department.

457
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:24,870
They are not bold enough to do that.

458
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,880
And, there are plenty of corrupt individuals in the court.

459
00:28:40,573 --> 00:28:43,716
So, you suspect the Censorate too?

460
00:28:43,797 --> 00:28:45,159
It's more than just the Censorate.

461
00:28:45,326 --> 00:28:46,576
From the lowest officials

462
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,442
to the highest imperial relatives,

463
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:50,202
I don't dare

464
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:52,202
to trust any of them.

465
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,522
Since you're investigating a case of corruption,

466
00:28:59,016 --> 00:29:02,456
why do we not see the bribe you took

467
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,759
even after so long?

468
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,109
I'm afraid the Vegetable Inspection Office would've been at large

469
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,918
had it not been for the Censorate.

470
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,559
It's because I hesitated.

471
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,682
What did you hesitate about?

472
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,120
It's our duty to investigate corruption.

473
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,195
But the issue is, how long can we keep up the investigation

474
00:29:20,276 --> 00:29:22,202
- and how deep can we go?   - Are you afraid?

475
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:24,254
I'm not afraid. I'm just worried.

476
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:28,802
Clean and honest governance is the foundation of our officialdom.

477
00:29:28,957 --> 00:29:30,717
Since we're receiving His Majesty's grace,

478
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,640
how can we indulge ourselves in rest?

479
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,202
Lord Lai, does that represent your stand or the Censorate's?

480
00:29:36,286 --> 00:29:40,246
Serving the kingdom is the duty of the Censorate.

481
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,402
If the Overwatch Council doesn't dare to investigate something,

482
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,562
the Censorate will!

483
00:29:45,968 --> 00:29:48,122
The Censorate doesn't fear the things

484
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:50,799
that the Overwatch Council fears!

485
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,759
That was impressive.

486
00:29:54,862 --> 00:29:56,582
Listen to him.

487
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,362
Chen Ping Ping.

488
00:29:58,543 --> 00:30:00,463
I'm truly ashamed.

489
00:30:01,356 --> 00:30:05,197
The Overwatch Council has been negligent all these years.

490
00:30:06,326 --> 00:30:08,447
You need to give me an account.

491
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,279
Your Majesty,

492
00:30:11,094 --> 00:30:12,482
during this period,

493
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,400
we uncovered corrupt officials in all kinds of departments.

494
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,431
And some have wide implications.

495
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:21,398
Initially, I want to put them aside.

496
00:30:21,503 --> 00:30:22,673
But today, it seems like

497
00:30:24,175 --> 00:30:28,242
we should hand such a responsibility to the Censorate.

498
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,039
So, President Chen, you prepared that name list long ago?

499
00:30:32,126 --> 00:30:34,526
Coincidentally, I managed to prepare it by today.

500
00:30:34,653 --> 00:30:36,402
So, you were waiting for this moment, huh?

501
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:38,989
If the Censorate isn't willing to take it,

502
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,802
the Overwatch Council won't force them.

503
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,202
So, you guys already uncovered the corrupt officials?

504
00:30:44,606 --> 00:30:48,526
If so, the Overwatch Council could've just dealt with them, am I right?

505
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,840
Why are you guys outsourcing your tasks?

506
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,042
That's why I said it has wide implications.

507
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,202
Seems like the Overwatch Council is afraid.

508
00:31:01,302 --> 00:31:02,802
It's not that we're afraid.

509
00:31:04,054 --> 00:31:07,175
It's just that it takes up time and energy.

510
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:12,362
Some officials aren't here, yet they have close ties with the capital.

511
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:13,769
Some are even

512
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,320
connected to the princes.

513
00:31:17,423 --> 00:31:20,143
If we want to investigate the case thoroughly,

514
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:24,122
it'll take up too much time.

515
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,840
The Overwatch Council has plenty of tasks to complete.

516
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,759
We don't have that much time and energy.

517
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,400
General Qin, since you already asked me that question,

518
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:43,880
does that mean you wish to take a look?

519
00:31:43,992 --> 00:31:44,992
Don't.

520
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,719
I'm illiterate.

521
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,360
I cannot understand it either.

522
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,160
I won't read it.

523
00:31:58,759 --> 00:31:59,759
Chancellor Lin?

524
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:21,082
No one dares to take it!

525
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:22,839
Your Majesty!

526
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,642
The Censorate is willing to take the name list.

527
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:29,922
How can we stand back when we need to serve the kingdom?

528
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,602
Your courage is commendable.

529
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:34,402
You should talk after reading it.

530
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,282
Your Majesty! I have something to say!

531
00:32:58,627 --> 00:32:59,758
Your Majesty,

532
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:01,719
Lord Lai's courage and loyalty are truly admirable.

533
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:03,031
They break our hearts.

534
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,799
However, if the princes are truly involved as well,

535
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,762
I'm afraid Lord Lai isn't able to bear this heavy burden!

536
00:33:08,902 --> 00:33:10,362
We have the law!

537
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,962
Why can't I bear this heavy burden?

538
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,442
We'll be clearing the imperial family's name

539
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,400
by investigating the truth.

540
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,322
If the princes are truly involved in this...

541
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,560
Lord Lai, please consider your own position first!

542
00:33:21,647 --> 00:33:23,082
Do not act recklessly!

543
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,362
Your Majesty,

544
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:34,319
even if the princes are involved,

545
00:33:35,023 --> 00:33:38,602
the Censorate will get to the bottom of this!

546
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:41,557
The imperial censors descend from the heavens,

547
00:33:41,638 --> 00:33:43,042
and they fear no imperial relatives.

548
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,519
They're here to eradicate treacherous officials

549
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,202
for the prosperity of the kingdom.

550
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:49,966
The Qing Kingdom is blessed indeed.

551
00:33:50,413 --> 00:33:52,053
The imperial censors descend from the heavens!

552
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,602
The Qing Kingdom is blessed indeed!

553
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:57,797
Your Majesty, Lord Lai is truly the backbone of the kingdom.

554
00:33:57,878 --> 00:34:00,922
I'm willing to take back the painting I delivered to the Censorate.

555
00:34:01,317 --> 00:34:03,277
Do you think you can take it back at will?

556
00:34:03,422 --> 00:34:05,422
I shall apologize to the Censorate.

557
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:07,642
- Fan Xian.   - Yes, Your Majesty.

558
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,082
You wrote in your defense booklet that traitorous officials are in power.

559
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,922
I want to ask you this.

560
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,680
Who were you referring to?

561
00:34:22,565 --> 00:34:24,406
Naturally, it's all the corrupt officials in the world.

562
00:34:24,487 --> 00:34:27,207
I wasn't referring to the censors in the Censorate.

563
00:34:30,964 --> 00:34:33,002
- Lai Ming Cheng.   - Yes, Your Majesty.

564
00:34:33,598 --> 00:34:35,159
Do your job well.

565
00:34:35,303 --> 00:34:36,303
Your Majesty.

566
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:43,480
I hope I can return justice to the Qing Kingdom.

567
00:34:43,991 --> 00:34:46,350
I'm looking forward to it.

568
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,682
Chancellor Lin.

569
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:10,322
Uncle, let me help you.

570
00:35:10,574 --> 00:35:12,055
I'm not that old.

571
00:35:14,975 --> 00:35:18,082
Uncle, your authority in the court was extraordinary.

572
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,002
You tried to use him to do your dirty work, huh?

573
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,199
What?

574
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,000
You wanted to use the Censorate to investigate Prince Cheng Ze.

575
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,842
Uncle, I can't hide anything from you indeed.

576
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:34,799
Did Chen Ping Ping teach you that?

577
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,130
I figured it out myself.

578
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:41,439
Lai Ming Cheng is a great instrument indeed.

579
00:35:43,638 --> 00:35:46,928
But Uncle, I still have some questions.

580
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,080
The officials who spoke in the court session

581
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,080
weren't arranged by me.

582
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,880
It wouldn't have worked out that well

583
00:35:55,015 --> 00:35:56,535
if they didn't add fuel to the flame.

584
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,722
Do you wish to know

585
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,520
who they serve?

586
00:36:07,757 --> 00:36:08,847
Was it your arrangement?

587
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,409
But how did you know that I was targeting Prince Cheng Ze?

588
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:15,482
I've been the chancellor for many years.

589
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,442
It's not like I did nothing all these years.

590
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,922
Uncle, you won't be implicated

591
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,482
by their involvement, right?

592
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,799
Who said they were under me?

593
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,482
They weren't under you?

594
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,439
Who were they under, then?

595
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:34,719
Cheng Ze!

596
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:37,729
Cheng Ze, slow down.

597
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:39,682
Your Highness, what do you need?

598
00:36:40,424 --> 00:36:42,664
The court session was lively today.

599
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,082
Cheng Ze, what do you think?

600
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,562
Lord Lai was pretty gutsy.

601
00:36:47,526 --> 00:36:50,642
The existence of the Censorate was pointless all these years.

602
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,802
I'm sure all those imperial censors had enough.

603
00:36:53,777 --> 00:36:56,442
If not, they wouldn't take up the task of investigating corrupt officials.

604
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,642
But speaking of which,

605
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,922
investigating corrupt officials is a good thing.

606
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:03,802
It's good as long as it doesn't involve personal feuds.

607
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:06,282
Personal feuds?

608
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:07,922
What do you mean?

609
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:13,282
Cheng Ze, could it be that you already predicted the list of names

610
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,602
inside the name list?

611
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,002
I have no idea.

612
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:24,242
We should still reflect on our own actions.

613
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,040
As princes,

614
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,962
we should be wary of officials who try to get close to us.

615
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,920
We mustn't bring shame to the imperial family.

616
00:37:31,023 --> 00:37:32,202
Cheng Ze, don't you agree?

617
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,562
Your Highness, that was particular of you.

618
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:37,399
I was just expressing what I felt.

619
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,200
Look at the officials who spoke today.

620
00:37:39,303 --> 00:37:40,623
They said that the imperial censors descended from the heavens.

621
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,040
They were so excited and passionate.

622
00:37:42,288 --> 00:37:44,482
Those officials actually adopted a clear stand.

623
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:45,959
That's rare.

624
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:47,362
Do you know what that means?

625
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,929
That means fighting corruption is the will of the people.

626
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
What's wrong?

627
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,079
I'm impressed.

628
00:38:01,034 --> 00:38:02,203
Why do you say so?

629
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:04,282
You threw a bowl at a cook.

630
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:05,882
Your Highness, this plot of yours

631
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,202
is quite devious.

632
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,962
What did you say? Cook?

633
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,482
Your Highness, I'll surely remember

634
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,919
the lesson you taught me.

635
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,319
I will never forget about it.

636
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Your Highness.

637
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:33,602
Don't you think we should

638
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:36,002
help Lord Lai after this?

639
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,402
We?

640
00:38:37,823 --> 00:38:39,002
What do you mean?

641
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,479
Your Highness, over here.

642
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,759
Please.

643
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,957
Your Highness, since we belong to your faction,

644
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,878
naturally, we'll do our best to serve you.

645
00:38:53,989 --> 00:38:54,989
Wait.

646
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,720
Those fools in the Censorate insist on investigating the case themselves.

647
00:38:57,854 --> 00:38:59,214
We can just sit and enjoy the show.

648
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,640
Why should we join them?

649
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,082
What are you staring at?

650
00:39:07,036 --> 00:39:09,042
Your Highness, didn't you arrange for them

651
00:39:09,123 --> 00:39:11,082
to speak during the court session?

652
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,242
Who are you referring to?

653
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,202
Those who instigated Lord Lai to take up the task.

654
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,959
Those who said the imperial censors descended from the heavens.

655
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:20,242
Who said I arranged for them to do so?

656
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,559
Don't they belong to your faction?

657
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:25,200
Wait, what do you mean by that?

658
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,642
They've always been in your faction.

659
00:39:26,723 --> 00:39:28,044
If so, how could I have no idea?

660
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,482
That makes sense.

661
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,280
You see,

662
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,202
there are plenty of officials in your faction.

663
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,889
However, these officials have easy jobs.

664
00:39:39,047 --> 00:39:40,162
They're quite useless.

665
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,282
Maybe they didn't have the chance to see you yet.

666
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:46,042
Do they truly belong to my faction?

667
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,682
Yes, that's true.

668
00:39:58,183 --> 00:39:59,682
Why did they come out and speak, then?

669
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,080
Didn't you arrange for it?

670
00:40:02,207 --> 00:40:03,648
Why should I?

671
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,762
Why did they have to speak at that moment?

672
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:11,242
No wonder Cheng Ze said I threw a bowl at a cook.

673
00:40:12,036 --> 00:40:13,475
A cook?

674
00:40:13,616 --> 00:40:14,882
What cook?

675
00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:16,722
The ones from the Vegetable Inspection Office?

676
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:29,042
So, the crown prince's faction follows your will too?

677
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,962
It's not that hard to make them heed my will.

678
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:33,762
Uncle, you're truly impressive.

679
00:40:33,975 --> 00:40:35,522
Not as impressive as you.

680
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,602
You've returned for some time.

681
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,482
Even so, you didn't visit Wan Er at all.

682
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,162
What's wrong?

683
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:43,762
Did the Saintess of Northern Qi forbid you to visit her?

684
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,362
Uncle,

685
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:48,783
you mustn't believe in those rumors.

686
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,482
That saintess and I...

687
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,842
My relationship with Wan Er is...

688
00:40:54,622 --> 00:40:56,462
You know my character the best.

689
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,682
Don't explain yourself to me. Explain yourself to Wan Er.

690
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,200
It's not that I don't want to visit Wan Er.

691
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,159
But I have plenty of affairs to attend to after my return.

692
00:41:02,269 --> 00:41:03,509
I had no time.

693
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,840
That's not an excuse.

694
00:41:05,456 --> 00:41:07,866
Uncle, I do have bitter reasons behind my actions.

695
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,922
It has nothing to do with the Saintess of Northern Qi.

696
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,602
She's been waiting for you.

697
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:19,642
If so, I'll visit her tonight.

698
00:41:20,033 --> 00:41:21,322
Tonight?

699
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,162
Not tonight.

700
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,922
I'll visit her during the day when I'm free.

701
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,842
You better marry her while I'm still around.

702
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,562
You scared me.

703
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,042
Your body is sturdier than mine.

704
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:49,042
The world is unpredictable.

705
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,282
Fan Xian was pretty capable.

706
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,360
Did you teach him that?

707
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,882
No, he figured it out himself.

708
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,962
It's kind of impressive for him to figure this out at his age.

709
00:42:14,645 --> 00:42:16,561
Fan Xian never let us down

710
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:18,162
ever since he came to the capital.

711
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,962
Is your leg okay?

712
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,710
My leg is sore from standing too long.

713
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,280
- I'm fine.   - It's okay.

714
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:29,055
I'll grant you a seat in the court next time.

715
00:42:29,162 --> 00:42:31,562
Your Majesty, please don't. I don't deserve it.

716
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,562
Has Fan Xian entered the family ancestral hall?

717
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,882
That's good too. With that temper of his,

718
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,122
he shouldn't pray to your ancestors first.

719
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,039
It doesn't matter if he enters the ancestral hall or not.

720
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:45,402
His surname is still Fan.

721
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,880
As for the troubles he got into,

722
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,282
I'll educate him on it.

723
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,439
If he does get in trouble, I'll bail him out.

724
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:52,839
Your Majesty, that's how he is.

725
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,120
Your Majesty, you're the only one who can tolerate his temper.
