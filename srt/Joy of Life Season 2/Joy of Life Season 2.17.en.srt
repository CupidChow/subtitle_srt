00:01:25,025 --> 00:01:30,951
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:34,114
(Episode 17)

3
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,840
I didn't burn Shijia Town to the ground.

4
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,840
However, he's still a survivor of Shijia Town.

5
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,896
Fan Xian is still keeping an eye on your past dealings with Northern Qi.

6
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,440
If so, all the more we can't kill him.

7
00:01:43,724 --> 00:01:46,684
Since you already found out, I'm sure the Overwatch Council knows as well.

8
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,679
Just let him investigate the case.

9
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,999
I'm also curious about the perpetrator

10
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,175
who burned the town to the ground.

11
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,799
Where is he?

12
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,999
Tongfu Inn.

13
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,480
The First Bureau has surrounded the place in secret

14
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:04,526
in case someone tried to assassinate him.

15
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:06,442
Deng Zi Yue is still very meticulous.

16
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:10,133
Hold on. Which inn was it?

17
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:11,526
Tongfu Inn.

18
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,636
What is the manager's name?

19
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,280
Tongfu Inn...

20
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:19,259
I think the manager's surname is Tong.

21
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,922
Male or female?

22
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,002
Male, I think.

23
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,760
If you want a female,

24
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:27,482
I can get one for you.

25
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:29,766
Go away. I don't want anything.

26
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:35,261
You may leave.

27
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:36,799
- Godfather. - Shut up.

28
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:38,519
A scholar should have character.

29
00:02:38,643 --> 00:02:40,936
- Your son, I... - You ingratiate yourself like a fly or a dog.

30
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,079
He Zong Wei.

31
00:02:42,174 --> 00:02:43,735
I'm considered too soft-hearted

32
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,602
if I don't beat you out of my place.

33
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,880
A scholar cannot become a dog

34
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,642
and shouldn't become a dog.

35
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:52,642
- I really respect... - Get lost!

36
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,729
I, your son, am leaving.

37
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,589
He is swearing loyalty toward you.

38
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,959
I still have my pride.

39
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,842
I dare not take in someone like him.

40
00:03:18,352 --> 00:03:20,162
I hope the scholars of the kingdom

41
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,122
are not like him.

42
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:25,962
Someone like him is rare.

43
00:03:26,446 --> 00:03:29,402
Young people are usually arrogant.

44
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,849
I hope so.

45
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:34,488
Qi Nian, we'll go to Tongfu Inn later

46
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,482
to meet the only survivor.

47
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,000
Whether the innocent lives lost at Shijia Town

48
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,591
can be vindicated

49
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,833
depends on him.

50
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:58,368
(A scholar cannot become a dog)

51
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,000
(and shouldn't become a dog.)

52
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:03,853
Speaking is easy

53
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,082
but it's tough to act.

54
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,320
Yogurt!

55
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,799
Delicious yogurt!

56
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:15,002
- Please stay here. - Let's gather again.

57
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,243
- Let's gather again. - Be careful on your way back.

58
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,402
Lord Fan, you're here.

59
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,162
Let's speak in private.

60
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,359
Lord Fan.

61
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,689
Is Shi Chan Li staying here?

62
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,840
Yes. He is staying in a four-man bedroom.

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,878
There are also three exam candidates staying with him.

64
00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:42,152
These are their names.

65
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:49,031
Yang Wan Li, Cheng Jia Lin, Hou Ji Chang.

66
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,576
We are checking their backgrounds

67
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,162
and will soon obtain the results.

68
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:53,528
Lord Fan,

69
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:55,316
this is the detailed record of Shi Chan Li's conversations

70
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,820
and actions since staying in the inn.

71
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,130
Please take a look.

72
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,802
You even investigated this?

73
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,762
I'm preparing for the unpredictable.

74
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:03,362
It might be useful to you.

75
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,359
He even drank wine?

76
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,319
He had a nice chat with the candidates and drank a few cups.

77
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,680
He's only a decent drinker.

78
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,082
Are they not at the inn now?

79
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,359
Yes.

80
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:16,143
They are at the exam hall.

81
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:18,536
There are many days left until the exam.

82
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,922
Why did they go to the exam hall?

83
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:21,935
They are building walls.

84
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,930
Building walls?

85
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,449
Put some effort.

86
00:05:28,878 --> 00:05:29,974
Carry and place them lightly.

87
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:31,642
- Slowly. - Sure.

88
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:39,242
Lord Fan, look. These are the Spring Imperial Examination candidates.

89
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,610
What are they doing?

90
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:43,679
Repairing the exam hall for the Ministry of Rites.

91
00:05:43,703 --> 00:05:45,202
Repair the exam hall?

92
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,039
Isn't that the work of builders?

93
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,398
Why did they get scholars to do it?

94
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:49,672
Indeed.

95
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:52,661
It was a suggestion by the Minister of Rites, Guo Zheng.

96
00:05:52,976 --> 00:05:54,962
He said we have many scholars

97
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,759
who come from different backgrounds.

98
00:05:56,812 --> 00:05:58,213
Prices in the capital are high

99
00:05:58,294 --> 00:06:00,322
and poor scholars have a tough time living here.

100
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,468
Instead of letting builders earn the money,

101
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:05,245
he suggested the scholars earn it instead.

102
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,559
Indeed.

103
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,679
Participating voluntarily allows them to feel how majestic the exam hall is

104
00:06:10,806 --> 00:06:13,407
and also make money to sustain their livelihood.

105
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,520
Looking at it like this,

106
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,962
this minister

107
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,719
empathizes with the people.

108
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,562
Lord Fan, that man is Minster Guo.

109
00:06:27,842 --> 00:06:29,082
Lord Guo

110
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,922
is even doing things himself?

111
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,839
Why isn't he moving at all?

112
00:06:36,071 --> 00:06:37,321
He's stuck there.

113
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,850
There's an artist here.

114
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,719
Indeed.

115
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,461
Repairing the exam hall is a contribution.

116
00:07:19,624 --> 00:07:21,017
He has to draw a portrait to remember it.

117
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,640
Some officials of the imperial court have a hobby like this.

118
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,089
Interesting.

119
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,070
Lord Fan, let's go back and make a portrait ourselves.

120
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:34,576
Where's Shi Chan Li?

121
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,962
Lord Fan, that man is Shi Chan Li.

122
00:07:45,742 --> 00:07:47,282
Is he having his portrait drawn too?

123
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,519
I don't see an artist anywhere.

124
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,842
The guards are not strict.

125
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:56,559
The guards are protecting the minister.

126
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:58,162
No one cares about these scholars.

127
00:07:58,243 --> 00:07:59,493
I need two more men here.

128
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:06,966
He Zong Wei.

129
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:16,230
Do you want to become an official?

130
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:23,478
If you can be successful,

131
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,959
are you willing to put your life in danger?

132
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,242
May I know who you are?

133
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,722
Everyone, be careful.

134
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,450
Chan Li.

135
00:08:41,517 --> 00:08:42,767
You are...

136
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:44,630
Chan Li, did you forget about me?

137
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:45,904
We've met.

138
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:47,624
Have we?

139
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,359
Are you staying in Tongfu Inn?

140
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,880
- Yes. - In a four-man bedroom?

141
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:52,020
That's right.

142
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:53,846
Your hometown is in Shijia Town at the border.

143
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,159
- Why do you know everything? - You told me.

144
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,562
I told you?

145
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,550
We had a chat when you were drunk that day.

146
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,802
Were you there that night?

147
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:05,643
In the outhouse.

148
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:07,735
I was drunk that night.

149
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:08,977
I can't remember.

150
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:10,855
Are you short of money?

151
00:09:10,962 --> 00:09:12,242
I'm not rich indeed.

152
00:09:12,393 --> 00:09:13,882
We share the same trouble.

153
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,608
- Hou Ji Chang. - Your name is...

154
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,970
Chan Li.

155
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,722
Is this your friend, Chan Li?

156
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,160
We both live in Tongfu Inn.

157
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:26,505
We met each other before.

158
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,362
Aren't you going to introduce him?

159
00:09:30,382 --> 00:09:32,102
This is Ji Chang who shares a room with me.

160
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,720
Hou Ji Chang.

161
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,882
Greetings, Ji Chang. My surname is Fan.

162
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,962
Fan? Greetings, Mr. Fan.

163
00:09:39,174 --> 00:09:40,922
It's fate that we live in the same inn.

164
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,355
Am I disturbing your conversation?

165
00:09:43,436 --> 00:09:44,596
Not at all.

166
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,031
Just now,

167
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:49,799
I saw Chan Li spacing out with a brick in his hands.

168
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,129
I was wondering why.

169
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,889
I saw it too.

170
00:09:53,836 --> 00:09:56,482
Chan Li, what did I tell you before we came here?

171
00:09:56,652 --> 00:09:57,942
I saw you sitting there without moving

172
00:09:57,966 --> 00:09:59,646
and staring at the bricks from over there.

173
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,802
Minister Guo is watching.

174
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,958
Even if you are tired,

175
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,158
you still need to pretend that you are working hard.

176
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,599
I'm not tired.

177
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,640
I just find the bricks weird.

178
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,162
How are the bricks weird?

179
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,202
Look.

180
00:10:20,215 --> 00:10:21,465
These are

181
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,442
old bricks we removed.

182
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,120
This is a slab of new brick

183
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,922
that we will be using.

184
00:10:27,263 --> 00:10:28,513
So?

185
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,080
New brick.

186
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:32,578
Old brick.

187
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:34,962
Can you hear the difference?

188
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,199
The old brick sounds like knocking on iron.

189
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,360
Iron?

190
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:42,442
This is a slab of good metal brick.

191
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:44,762
Metal brick is very expensive.

192
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:46,562
The new bricks that we are going to use

193
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:48,504
are normal bricks.

194
00:10:48,945 --> 00:10:50,195
Look.

195
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:52,122
The pillars that are removed

196
00:10:52,557 --> 00:10:54,682
are made from Phoebe Zhennan trees.

197
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:57,602
Look at the logs used to replace them.

198
00:10:58,605 --> 00:11:01,320
What are these? Logs.

199
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,570
They are ordinary. Extremely ordinary.

200
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,439
So, I don't understand.

201
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,440
The Ministry of Rites is repairing the exam hall

202
00:11:07,483 --> 00:11:09,002
but why are the materials used

203
00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:10,277
worse than before?

204
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:12,002
Chan Li, how do you know these?

205
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:13,677
I have many peers in my hometown.

206
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:15,838
I've seen them myself so I won't make any mistakes.

207
00:11:15,964 --> 00:11:19,482
Chan Li, you mustn't mention this again.

208
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:20,813
Why?

209
00:11:22,126 --> 00:11:25,606
The repair is supervised by Minister Guo himself.

210
00:11:31,136 --> 00:11:32,549
More reason for us to inform Minister Guo

211
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:33,962
in case he has been scammed.

212
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:36,021
This has nothing to do with us.

213
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:38,805
The best thing to do is to turn a blind eye to it.

214
00:11:38,886 --> 00:11:40,562
- But... - Trust me.

215
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,932
Why are we turning a blind eye to it?

216
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:47,456
Replacing good ones for something worse is the work of a corrupt official.

217
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,190
We are scholars with virtue and morals.

218
00:11:49,271 --> 00:11:51,602
- How can we turn a blind eye to it? - Softer!

219
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,817
Don't blame them. They always do this.

220
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,910
You can stop my mouth

221
00:11:59,991 --> 00:12:01,510
but you can't stop these...

222
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,570
I beg you.

223
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,882
Let me finish.

224
00:12:08,926 --> 00:12:11,089
- Mr. Fan, have some water. - Thank you.

225
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:12,536
Let me introduce him.

226
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,088
He is Yang Wan Li from Quanzhou.

227
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,617
He is quite famous back in his hometown.

228
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:17,150
He got a top spot in his village exam.

229
00:12:17,174 --> 00:12:19,535
Among the four of us, he is the most talented in learning.

230
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,450
Wan Li, nice to meet you.

231
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,850
Nice to meet you.

232
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,762
- I'm going to report it. - You should study less.

233
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,522
Even if you're exposing them,

234
00:12:32,662 --> 00:12:34,912
who will listen to something we say?

235
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,199
I heard Lord Fan is now...

236
00:12:37,294 --> 00:12:38,544
Do you know Lord Fan?

237
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:42,882
- I can know him. - Does Minister Guo know Lord Fan?

238
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,282
- Naturally. - Between the two of you, who is closer to Lord Fan?

239
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,640
Minister Guo.

240
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,168
Both of them manage the Spring Imperial Examination together.

241
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:51,625
If they had already been colluding together,

242
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:53,042
what would you do?

243
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,432
I get what you mean.

244
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,809
You mean

245
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,242
Lord Fan and Minister Guo

246
00:13:00,824 --> 00:13:02,801
are in cahoots.

247
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,602
I didn't mean that.

248
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,889
- What did you mean? - I mean...

249
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,869
Endure this and don't mention it again.

250
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,590
Why are we studying if we are going to endure something like this?

251
00:13:13,956 --> 00:13:15,116
If you want to care about it,

252
00:13:15,197 --> 00:13:16,562
now is not the time.

253
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:18,082
When is a good time then?

254
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,602
Wan Li, let me ask you.

255
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,722
Why do we come to the capital?

256
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:26,469
- To become an official. - Why do we work at the exam hall?

257
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,855
- To become an official. - Have you become one now?

258
00:13:28,948 --> 00:13:31,199
- No. - If you want to care about this,

259
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:33,842
you need to endure until we become an official.

260
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:41,451
Why should a scholar end up like this?

261
00:13:41,475 --> 00:13:42,842
Because we are ordinary.

262
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:46,082
Farewell.

263
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:48,122
- Wan Li. - Wan Li.

264
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,488
He's supposed to be a scholar but he acts like a brute.

265
00:13:56,191 --> 00:13:58,610
Ji Chang, you said

266
00:13:58,696 --> 00:14:01,207
coming to work here is for the sake of becoming an official as well.

267
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:02,642
What did you mean?

268
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,079
It's nothing.

269
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,562
We are poor

270
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:07,362
so we are just making some money.

271
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:10,160
Apart from money, Ji Chang also told us

272
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,160
about the important thing about working here.

273
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,400
- Chan Li. - It's fine.

274
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,753
- Chan Li. - We are all scholars.

275
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:16,255
- Chan Li... - We need to share information.

276
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,280
Ji Chang said we didn't come here to work

277
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,640
just for money.

278
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,402
We are also here to show our faces.

279
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,559
Show your faces?

280
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,160
Scholars who come to work

281
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,162
will leave our names in the booklet.

282
00:14:26,472 --> 00:14:28,473
Minister Guo is here.

283
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:29,722
The best thing

284
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:32,239
is to let Minister Guo remember our names.

285
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,649
Remember our names?

286
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,490
Mr. Fan, look.

287
00:14:42,918 --> 00:14:44,598
There are so many exam candidates.

288
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:46,162
If he can remember our names,

289
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:48,082
that means we've left an impression.

290
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,839
Perhaps he might take a closer look

291
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:52,082
while going through our paper.

292
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,682
Ji Chang, you are farsighted.

293
00:14:56,743 --> 00:14:59,082
Otherwise, some people like us

294
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,282
won't have a chance to be chosen.

295
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:03,893
Aren't you tested for your talents in the exam?

296
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,361
Talent is useless.

297
00:15:05,892 --> 00:15:07,013
We have lowly identities.

298
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:08,694
What does it have to do with identities?

299
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,362
Mr. Fan, you know nothing.

300
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:13,503
How many candidates are there in every Spring Imperial Examination?

301
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:15,962
More than ten thousand perhaps.

302
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:19,522
However, there are only a handful of people who will be chosen.

303
00:15:20,934 --> 00:15:22,334
There are so many rumors out there.

304
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,495
The important officials will choose a few.

305
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,520
The palace chooses a few.

306
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:28,292
The imperial academy chooses a few before famous scholars are chosen.

307
00:15:28,316 --> 00:15:30,135
How many of the rest can be chosen?

308
00:15:30,277 --> 00:15:32,502
They start to choose people before the exam even begins?

309
00:15:32,526 --> 00:15:35,058
The rich scholars with a background can meet the officials

310
00:15:35,148 --> 00:15:36,398
to swear loyalty first.

311
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:38,162
Since they will be working together in the future,

312
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:41,522
they must promote one of their own.

313
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,063
What's the use?

314
00:15:43,144 --> 00:15:45,864
Isn't it about one's talent and knowledge when it comes to the exam?

315
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:47,302
Having someone to take care of you

316
00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:49,845
is better than a brain full of good ideas.

317
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,733
If what you say is true,

318
00:15:51,814 --> 00:15:53,534
that means this Spring Imperial Examination

319
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,122
is a place where the officials can choose their dogs.

320
00:15:56,343 --> 00:15:57,922
Wan Li, mind your words.

321
00:15:58,561 --> 00:16:00,320
Be careful of your life.

322
00:16:02,356 --> 00:16:04,846
Mr. Fan, you too. Just forget what you heard

323
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:06,454
and don't bring trouble to yourself.

324
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:11,442
The result is decided before the exam

325
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:13,322
and the exam is just a formality.

326
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,442
Isn't that cheating?

327
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:18,322
- It is! - Not so loud.

328
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,682
I'm thinking as well.

329
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,402
If that's really the case,

330
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,190
why is no one complaining?

331
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,568
Who can they complain to?

332
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:29,378
The one in the court

333
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,280
is still an official?

334
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,479
Where's the fairness?

335
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,799
- What? - Fairness.

336
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,362
There's no such thing.

337
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:36,693
Without fairness,

338
00:16:36,922 --> 00:16:38,202
the Spring Imperial Examination

339
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,730
is just a farce.

340
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:41,863
Perhaps

341
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,882
we might be able to change everything

342
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,122
when we are chosen.

343
00:16:50,396 --> 00:16:51,646
Where's Cheng Jia Lin?

344
00:16:51,742 --> 00:16:53,416
He's knocking rocks at the rear courtyard.

345
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,690
I ordered him

346
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,722
to keep his mouth shut.

347
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,042
Now that I think about it,

348
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:00,642
it's so meaningless.

349
00:17:01,135 --> 00:17:02,522
I'm going back to work.

350
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:04,019
Chan Li.

351
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,120
Be careful of your words and actions.

352
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:12,802
Mr. Fan,

353
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,490
help me out.

354
00:17:17,605 --> 00:17:18,855
Hou Ji Chang,

355
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,042
you are great.

356
00:17:20,137 --> 00:17:21,642
You've made so many trips alone.

357
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:24,215
- It's what I should do. - You've worked hard.

358
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:26,832
Why don't you take a break? You haven't taken a sip of water.

359
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:28,387
It's fine. It's what I should do.

360
00:17:28,523 --> 00:17:29,718
Are you sure?

361
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:31,061
Let me help you with a few more trips.

362
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:33,122
Sure. That's good enough.

363
00:17:33,193 --> 00:17:35,482
- Is that good enough? - Yes.

364
00:17:35,594 --> 00:17:38,002
- Should I... - No.

365
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,700
Mr. Fan, here.

366
00:17:40,782 --> 00:17:42,362
- Have a pastry. - No need.

367
00:17:42,443 --> 00:17:44,414
- Save it for yourself. - I'll buy you a drink next time.

368
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,407
- Sure. - Thank you.

369
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,202
- Lord Fan? - Minister Guo, do you recognize me?

370
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,802
I've seen you at work in the imperial court.

371
00:18:18,286 --> 00:18:19,482
Well...

372
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,159
You are the main invigilator of the Spring Imperial Examination.

373
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:26,301
- Don't call me Lord. - Lord Fan, you have a bright future ahead of you.

374
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,602
You will be successful one day.

375
00:18:28,887 --> 00:18:30,137
Lord Fan,

376
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,042
why did you come to the exam hall?

377
00:18:32,718 --> 00:18:34,878
I was passing by and wanted to meet you, Minister Guo.

378
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:37,544
I want to know you as well, Lord Fan.

379
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:38,830
Quick. Sit down.

380
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:40,161
There's no need.

381
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,402
Minister Guo, I only have one question.

382
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:43,617
Please tell me.

383
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:45,402
The repair of the exam hall

384
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:48,119
uses low-quality goods to replace the good old ones.

385
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,320
Do you know about that?

386
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,042
They are not low-quality.

387
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,082
They are all durable.

388
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:00,842
That means you know about it, Minister Guo?

389
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,722
Isn't it a joke

390
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,242
if I say I don't know?

391
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:08,415
Did the Minister of Revenue provide funds?

392
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:09,769
Of course.

393
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,416
Without funds from the Minister of Revenue, who would begin work?

394
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,600
After purchasing these durable materials,

395
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:16,543
how much money do you have left, Minister Guo?

396
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,759
I think there's still some balance left.

397
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,962
The metal bricks and Phoebe Zhennan pillars removed

398
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,080
are not cheap.

399
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,642
The materials removed are in the warehouse of the Ministry of Rites.

400
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,519
The remaining money has also been recorded in the ledger.

401
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,519
I know you are ambitious

402
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,802
and wants to fight corruption.

403
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,322
I praise your actions

404
00:19:35,495 --> 00:19:37,334
and will never be corrupt.

405
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:38,815
This time,

406
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:40,193
there's not a single cent

407
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:43,769
that comes into my pocket in the repair of the exam hall.

408
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,541
I have a clear conscience.

409
00:19:47,636 --> 00:19:49,442
Lord Fan, if you don't believe me,

410
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:51,478
you can investigate in detail.

411
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:53,295
The Ministry of Rites will cooperate with you.

412
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:55,077
- The money is recorded in the ledger? - Yes.

413
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:57,581
- The old materials are in the warehouse? - Nothing is lost.

414
00:20:01,888 --> 00:20:03,640
I don't get it then.

415
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,520
Minister Guo, what are you planning to achieve

416
00:20:07,747 --> 00:20:11,802
- by doing this? - As the Minister of Rites,

417
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,762
I can't do nothing in my position.

418
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,880
As an official,

419
00:20:15,968 --> 00:20:18,122
we should do more work.

420
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,970
I get it.

421
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,279
Repair is work.

422
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,609
Work

423
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,682
is your political achievements.

424
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,250
Political achievements.

425
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,200
A great term.

426
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,200
I've never heard of it.

427
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,696
Political achievements.

428
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,440
You even drew portraits of yourself.

429
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:46,642
It's proof of what I've done.

430
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:49,722
It's a good souvenir for the future.

431
00:20:49,817 --> 00:20:51,322
What about the money you saved?

432
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,815
There are many people in the Ministry.

433
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,880
It's difficult to feed the family.

434
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:58,560
Buying wine and meat for them during festivals is justifiable.

435
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,350
- What do you think? - What about the materials in the warehouse?

436
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:03,454
We are upright officials.

437
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,999
Our residences have cracks and leaks.

438
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,490
They need to be repaired.

439
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,958
Using the materials in the warehouse.

440
00:21:11,982 --> 00:21:13,382
It complies with the rules

441
00:21:13,463 --> 00:21:14,922
and not against the law.

442
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:16,882
It's all within the rules.

443
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:18,296
Definitely.

444
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:20,943
As an official for so many years,

445
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,118
you are clear about the rules of the imperial court, Minister Guo.

446
00:21:25,903 --> 00:21:27,282
As an upright official,

447
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:29,442
I still need to survive.

448
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:32,586
Are you not afraid that these scholars will find out?

449
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,642
It's no use even if they find out.

450
00:21:35,215 --> 00:21:36,880
If they get chosen to become an official,

451
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:38,975
you'll be in trouble if they make a complaint.

452
00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:41,630
Lord Fan, I told you

453
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,882
it's all in compliance with the rules.

454
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,571
Besides, the people out there

455
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:48,092
won't be chosen.

456
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,890
What do you mean?

457
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,722
In the Spring Imperial Examination, the names on this list

458
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,080
will be disqualified.

459
00:21:58,519 --> 00:21:59,769
Why?

460
00:22:00,534 --> 00:22:03,210
These scholars are cunning.

461
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,120
Why did they come and work here?

462
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:08,159
They just want to leave an impression on me.

463
00:22:08,382 --> 00:22:10,502
How can we accept scholars

464
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:12,202
who are opportunistic?

465
00:22:12,591 --> 00:22:13,840
Can't they even think about it?

466
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:17,362
The most important thing for a scholar is a noble character.

467
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:19,802
Someone like me

468
00:22:19,998 --> 00:22:22,198
will never accept these flies and dogs.

469
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,842
Is there a retainer of yours

470
00:22:33,094 --> 00:22:34,642
among these scholars?

471
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,802
I just want to give these scholars

472
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,080
a way out.

473
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:41,047
Lord Fan, character is important.

474
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:52,513
Just like me.

475
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:55,766
I believe in your character unconditionally.

476
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,440
I have no objection

477
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:01,039
to what you do.

478
00:23:01,158 --> 00:23:02,408
I'll follow your orders.

479
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,282
Hou Ji Chang!

480
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,322
You are so impressive.

481
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,002
Yes, Hou Ji Chang.

482
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,487
You are so hardworking.

483
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:17,522
It's what I should do.

484
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:19,742
Why are you so good, Hou Ji Chang?

485
00:23:19,838 --> 00:23:22,078
You've been doing a thousand trips at least!

486
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,922
You're so amazing, Hou Ji Chang!

487
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:29,759
Hou Ji Chang!

488
00:23:29,854 --> 00:23:31,842
Let's change sides.

489
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,600
Hou Ji Chang!

490
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,560
It's not cheap

491
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:19,095
for these scholars to rent a room in the capital.

492
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,559
The ones from poor families

493
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,440
are trying to make some money.

494
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,200
There are many of them indeed.

495
00:24:27,544 --> 00:24:28,704
Indeed.

496
00:24:28,785 --> 00:24:30,722
Everyone who studies

497
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,840
is in the capital now.

498
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,499
There's even a candidate of his age?

499
00:24:45,523 --> 00:24:47,402
I'm sure he participated in many exams.

500
00:24:48,294 --> 00:24:50,174
They came with hope every time.

501
00:24:50,472 --> 00:24:51,922
It's a fierce competition.

502
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,290
There will always be someone who can't get their wish.

503
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,680
For them,

504
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,353
what is the Spring Imperial Examination?

505
00:24:58,377 --> 00:25:00,962
It's a grace from the kingdom.

506
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:02,494
What else?

507
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,962
It's the opportunity to change their fates

508
00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:08,042
as you mentioned.

509
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:09,529
Yes.

510
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,640
Studying hard for years

511
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,162
just for this opportunity.

512
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,640
An opportunity that is supposed to be fair.

513
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,581
Have you heard about the cheating at the Spring Imperial Examination?

514
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:28,990
Look at that fat pigeon.

515
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:31,842
It's from the Overwatch Council. It's not for long-distance flying.

516
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:33,144
I don't have anything.

517
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:35,225
- Otherwise, I would've... - Don't interrupt me.

518
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,882
I was simply asking.

519
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:38,522
Just simply answer me.

520
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,202
I'll just simply talk about it, Lord Fan.

521
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,322
Before the Spring Imperial Examination,

522
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:51,695
many scholars have visited officials

523
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:53,442
to swear their loyalty.

524
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,769
These people

525
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:58,682
have their future decided without even taking the exam?

526
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,410
The exam

527
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,242
is just a formality.

528
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:38,840
What about them?

529
00:26:38,951 --> 00:26:40,201
Fate is

530
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,602
not on their side.

531
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,840
Does the Overwatch Council not know this?

532
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,442
They know a little.

533
00:26:46,683 --> 00:26:49,403
Isn't it used to watch the officials? Why aren't they investigating?

534
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,839
Those who can accept disciples

535
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,239
are true big shots.

536
00:26:54,632 --> 00:26:55,762
It's not easy to investigate them.

537
00:26:55,786 --> 00:26:58,002
Some are even afraid to investigate them.

538
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,600
It has been an unspoken rule for years.

539
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,800
Everyone is used to it.

540
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,319
However, this is

541
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,602
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for them.

542
00:27:05,943 --> 00:27:08,863
There's a quota for the exam as well.

543
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,250
This is unfair.

544
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:48,762
- What was that inn called? - Tongfu.

545
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,802
- Did Fan Xian go there? - He did.

546
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,936
The person wasn't there, so he went to the exam hall.

547
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,799
To find that man. What's his name?

548
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,210
Shi Chan Li.

549
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,760
They met each other.

550
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,490
However, they didn't talk much.

551
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:01,762
Our men watched from afar

552
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,999
and said Shi Chan Li didn't show any pain.

553
00:28:04,503 --> 00:28:06,302
I don't think he knows

554
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,002
about Shijia Town's annihilation yet.

555
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,911
He didn't tell him anything?

556
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,600
Why did he go there then?

557
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:13,882
Right.

558
00:28:15,207 --> 00:28:16,457
A trip in vain.

559
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,922
I wonder what Fan Xian

560
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,762
is thinking.

561
00:28:32,981 --> 00:28:35,162
Lord Fan, what are you thinking about?

562
00:28:35,303 --> 00:28:36,842
It's nothing much.

563
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,722
The examination begins in a few days.

564
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:42,032
How can Shi Chan Li do the exam

565
00:28:42,113 --> 00:28:44,473
when he finds out his hometown is gone at a time like this?

566
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,849
Let's wait.

567
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,950
The First Bureau is guarding the place.

568
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:52,600
Let's decide what we should do after the exam.

569
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:56,091
Lord Fan,

570
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,802
you are different indeed.

571
00:29:01,582 --> 00:29:02,785
How so?

572
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,640
Other officials

573
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,882
won't care about this.

574
00:29:08,318 --> 00:29:10,159
We still need to see them as humans.

575
00:29:14,722 --> 00:29:17,042
(Fan Residence)

576
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:27,320
Have we arrived?

577
00:29:27,447 --> 00:29:29,282
You should come outside and take a look.

578
00:29:37,728 --> 00:29:39,409
It's to show respect for Lord Fan.

579
00:29:39,536 --> 00:29:41,802
Please accept it.

580
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,482
- Isn't that Xin Qi Wu? - That's right.

581
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,439
Some of them look familiar.

582
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:47,808
I've seen them in the hall.

583
00:29:47,973 --> 00:29:49,653
All of them are wearing plain clothes now.

584
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,559
It's not nice if they wear an official's uniform.

585
00:29:52,873 --> 00:29:55,593
My thoughts are clearly written inside.

586
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:56,962
Farewell.

587
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:59,682
Lord Fan doesn't accept gifts. He doesn't!

588
00:29:59,763 --> 00:30:02,042
He really doesn't. Just take it back!

589
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,289
Make way.

590
00:30:05,121 --> 00:30:06,847
We can't accept the gifts!

591
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:09,402
- He's coming. - Stop it! We are just servants.

592
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:10,574
Stop giving gifts.

593
00:30:10,655 --> 00:30:12,454
Farewell.

594
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,562
I'll leave them here.

595
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,282
Please pass it to him!

596
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,802
This is all for the Spring Imperial Examination.

597
00:30:26,144 --> 00:30:27,394
Indeed.

598
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,642
Let's go. We'll enter through the back door.

599
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,479
Your Highness, something's not right.

600
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,202
Why is the Fan Residence empty?

601
00:30:58,551 --> 00:31:00,255
We entered through the back door after all.

602
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:01,999
It still can't be empty.

603
00:31:02,086 --> 00:31:03,336
What does it mean?

604
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,410
It means

605
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,286
there's a change in the Fan Residence.

606
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,962
It means we've never been here before.

607
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:15,802
Where is Fan Xian's courtyard?

608
00:31:16,137 --> 00:31:17,387
Why don't we search the place?

609
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:52,809
Just leave it here.

610
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,640
Return from where we came from and wait for me outside.

611
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:35,168
It's spinning.

612
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,160
Dear,

613
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:38,498
the crown prince is visiting.

614
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:40,362
Why did you ask all the servants to leave?

615
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:42,242
Did he enter through the back door?

616
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,202
Regardless, isn't he still the drown prince?

617
00:32:45,735 --> 00:32:48,122
It's fine if you ask the servants to leave

618
00:32:48,231 --> 00:32:49,470
but shouldn't you meet him?

619
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:50,880
He's not here for me.

620
00:32:50,983 --> 00:32:52,402
I shouldn't meet him.

621
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:01,882
What is the most important word

622
00:33:01,963 --> 00:33:03,602
in a political scene?

623
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,170
Which word?

624
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,690
Stability.

625
00:33:07,394 --> 00:33:09,988
Care for our own and not mind other people's business.

626
00:33:10,082 --> 00:33:11,880
We should meddle less

627
00:33:11,975 --> 00:33:13,774
in other people's matters.

628
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,880
Dear,

629
00:33:18,118 --> 00:33:21,198
why does the crown prince visit

630
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:22,559
to see Fan Xian?

631
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:24,282
What else?

632
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:26,142
The Spring Imperial Examination begins soon.

633
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,970
He's here to greet him.

634
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:30,922
Why did he use the back door?

635
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,602
Think about it yourself.

636
00:33:36,008 --> 00:33:37,451
It can't move anymore.

637
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,369
Oh no!

638
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,919
Your Highness, are you here to wreck my house?

639
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,282
Fan Xian, sorry.

640
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,202
It stopped spinning just now.

641
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,442
I tried to help it but perhaps

642
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,162
I used too much force.

643
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:34,542
Well... How much is it? Why don't I compensate you?

644
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,322
I was joking. You should come out, Your Highness.

645
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,050
Sure.

646
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,759
Your Highness, what makes you visit in person?

647
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,159
Do you want to hear the truth or a lie?

648
00:34:48,278 --> 00:34:49,528
Anything's fine.

649
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:51,879
I'm here to advise you to stop fighting.

650
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:53,153
Whom did I fight?

651
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,839
You fought Cheng Ze

652
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,440
and got him grounded for half a year.

653
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,599
Do you think I'll feel well as his brother?

654
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,089
I'm here to persuade you.

655
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,849
Is this a lie?

656
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,482
Can my lie be any worse?

657
00:35:07,646 --> 00:35:08,767
What about the truth?

658
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:10,129
The truth?

659
00:35:14,176 --> 00:35:15,574
Coming!

660
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:20,280
Did someone call him?

661
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:21,617
You got your wish now.

662
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,650
The truth.

663
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,882
You made Cheng Ze suffer.

664
00:35:27,094 --> 00:35:29,135
I'm very happy because of that.

665
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:32,317
So, I came here to give you some gifts.

666
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,320
Your Highness, you don't see me as an outsider.

667
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,730
Those who go against Cheng Ze are not an outsider for me.

668
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,440
However, I don't know what you like.

669
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:41,369
I prepared everything including jewelry and precious herbs.

670
00:35:41,895 --> 00:35:43,922
Thank you, Your Highness. I like them all.

671
00:35:45,565 --> 00:35:46,815
I like that!

672
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:06,922
Your Highness, I'm sure you are not here to send gifts.

673
00:36:08,484 --> 00:36:09,791
My main purpose is to send gifts.

674
00:36:09,815 --> 00:36:12,205
- Main purpose? - There's one more little thing.

675
00:36:12,886 --> 00:36:14,136
How little?

676
00:36:16,781 --> 00:36:18,262
A few names.

677
00:36:21,156 --> 00:36:22,572
In the Spring Imperial Examination,

678
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:26,569
you are in charge of sealing the exam papers, right?

679
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,759
Help me keep an eye on these names.

680
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:33,839
What do you want me to do, Your Highness?

681
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,130
Nothing.

682
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,055
Not doing anything while sealing the papers

683
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,329
is good enough.

684
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,610
There's nothing else. I'll be leaving.

685
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,879
My servants were supposed to do this.

686
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,079
Later, I figured you were one of my own

687
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,642
and I missed you so I came on my own.

688
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:52,642
It shows my sincerity as well.

689
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:54,602
Your Highness is really sincere.

690
00:36:54,891 --> 00:36:56,896
There's someone from Shijia Town who is still alive?

691
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,170
You even heard about that?

692
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:01,399
This is related to Cheng Ze's smuggling.

693
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:03,215
Naturally, I care about it.

694
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,929
What happened after that?

695
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,240
He is a candidate. I haven't told him yet.

696
00:37:07,366 --> 00:37:09,646
I wanted to wait until the exam was finished.

697
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,170
Do it according to your plan.

698
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,559
I'll be leaving.

699
00:37:15,662 --> 00:37:17,952
There's no need to send me off. I can find my way out.

700
00:37:18,461 --> 00:37:20,381
Just go in the opposite direction of the arrows.

701
00:37:35,484 --> 00:37:36,643
Lord Fan,

702
00:37:36,724 --> 00:37:38,497
someone from Chancellor Lin's residence sent a letter

703
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:40,521
asking you to visit him.

704
00:37:50,717 --> 00:37:52,190
(Chancellor Lin's Strategist, Yuan Hong Dao)

705
00:37:52,214 --> 00:37:53,464
Chancellor,

706
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,160
do you think this is fine?

707
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,610
Yes.

708
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,369
Uncle.

709
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,842
Don't stand on ceremony.

710
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,240
Come.

711
00:38:21,374 --> 00:38:22,624
Help me take a look.

712
00:38:24,774 --> 00:38:26,024
Recently,

713
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:28,436
I'm starting to grow more gray beard.

714
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,570
A little.

715
00:38:32,952 --> 00:38:34,842
Why don't you help me pluck some of them?

716
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:36,762
Me?

717
00:38:37,246 --> 00:38:38,802
It's hard to do it myself.

718
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:40,289
It hurts.

719
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:03,072
Come. More.

720
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,170
Do it.

721
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,962
Come. Keep going.

722
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:18,722
Pluck it.

723
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,790
Stop. Stop it.

724
00:39:23,401 --> 00:39:24,802
Uncle,

725
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:26,762
I don't think it hurts that badly.

726
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:29,846
I can't suffer and I'm afraid of pain.

727
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:32,242
If you're afraid of pain, just cut it.

728
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,962
It'll still grow after cutting.

729
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,162
Plucking will get rid of it once and for all.

730
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,762
That's all for today.

731
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:44,202
Chancellor,

732
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:47,282
- this guy has a clean background. - Sure.

733
00:39:52,441 --> 00:39:53,691
Fan Xian,

734
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,090
look.

735
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,162
Does my beard

736
00:39:58,686 --> 00:40:00,122
look tidy?

737
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:01,642
Exquisite.

738
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,769
Great.

739
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:07,326
Being an official is the same as being a person.

740
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:09,082
You need to care

741
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,320
about the details.

742
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,802
The most important thing

743
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,882
is not to show any flaws.

744
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:20,762
Uncle, what are you doing?

745
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,879
Da Bao likes to eat the red fruit.

746
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,480
I'm picking some good ones for her.

747
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,642
Da Bao eats quickly.

748
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:35,799
I'm afraid she might choke on the seed.

749
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,530
Lord Fan,

750
00:40:37,611 --> 00:40:39,211
Chancellor Lin

751
00:40:39,636 --> 00:40:42,197
doesn't trust servants to do this.

752
00:40:47,229 --> 00:40:48,562
Did the crown prince visit you?

753
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:51,608
News travels fast.

754
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:53,797
Did he give you a list of names?

755
00:40:53,894 --> 00:40:55,144
Yes.

756
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,560
He said I didn't have to do anything

757
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,240
while I seal the papers.

758
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:00,880
You don't need to do anything indeed.

759
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,378
Someone else will do it.

760
00:41:04,072 --> 00:41:05,553
Just turn a blind eye to it.

761
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:06,720
Turn a blind eye to what?

762
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,160
What else?

763
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:10,120
Let the chosen people

764
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,799
get chosen.

765
00:41:45,741 --> 00:41:48,342
The people are chosen when their papers are sealed?

766
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:51,682
The people who are on the list will definitely be chosen.

767
00:41:56,279 --> 00:41:58,042
What if the article is badly written?

768
00:41:58,214 --> 00:41:59,318
Won't people doubt the result?

769
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:00,821
There will always be a way.

770
00:42:01,407 --> 00:42:04,567
So, your position is extremely important.

771
00:42:04,766 --> 00:42:06,202
Do you know

772
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:09,223
how many names will be sent to your hands

773
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:13,061
by officials, noble families, and the royal family?

774
00:42:13,743 --> 00:42:14,743
I know.

775
00:42:14,862 --> 00:42:16,821
They came to send gifts recently.

776
00:42:17,237 --> 00:42:18,477
No one left names

777
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:20,758
but every box has a note inside.

778
00:42:21,278 --> 00:42:22,958
Those people are not important.

779
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:28,442
The important ones

780
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:31,042
are all here.

781
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,082
Why do you have it?

782
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:35,609
I stopped them

783
00:42:35,922 --> 00:42:38,642
and asked Hong Dao to filter them.

784
00:42:39,582 --> 00:42:41,183
Many names have been removed.

785
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,960
You just need to remember these people.

786
00:42:48,675 --> 00:42:50,014
Isn't this the Spring Imperial Examination?

787
00:42:50,038 --> 00:42:51,518
Can't they depend on their abilities?

788
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:53,542
These are not just names.

789
00:42:54,391 --> 00:42:56,111
They are also the ways of the world.
