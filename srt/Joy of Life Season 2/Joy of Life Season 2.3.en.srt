00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:30,984
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,065 --> 00:01:34,042
(Episode 3)

3
00:01:37,382 --> 00:01:38,532
What do you mean?

4
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,379
Lord Fan,

5
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,701
do you wish to investigate the Moon Embracing Pavilion?

6
00:01:42,725 --> 00:01:45,006
- Who did you hear that from? - I didn't tell her that.

7
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,495
Lord Fan, I don't think that you came back from the dead

8
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,909
and came to find me in such a place

9
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:50,962
because you fell for me.

10
00:01:51,949 --> 00:01:53,442
I'm just an ordinary girl.

11
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,997
Everything around me is ordinary

12
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:57,002
except for Moon Embracing Pavilion.

13
00:01:58,373 --> 00:02:00,762
What's not ordinary about Moon Embracing Pavilion, then?

14
00:02:00,843 --> 00:02:02,413
Although Moon Embracing Pavilion just opened not long ago,

15
00:02:02,437 --> 00:02:04,922
they've managed to recruit the best courtesans in the capital.

16
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,042
All of them are famous courtesans.

17
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,162
Each of the brothels had backers.

18
00:02:09,517 --> 00:02:12,322
Even so, none of them dared to refuse their recruitment.

19
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,802
That's not ordinary.

20
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,259
Miss Sang, may I ask you for a favor?

21
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,042
Lord Fan, I wish to ask you for a favor as well.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,150
That's negotiable.

23
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:27,941
If so, Lord Fan, you should keep the banknotes first.

24
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:29,885
Only then will I be able to bring up my request.

25
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:32,202
What kind of favor do you need?

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,200
Lord Fan, you should ask me first.

27
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,682
I won't bring up my request

28
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:38,613
if I can't help you out myself.

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,280
Miss Sang, you do have a great sense of self-awareness.

30
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:45,162
With an identity like mine,

31
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,562
I'll be beyond redemption

32
00:02:46,782 --> 00:02:48,182
if I don't have any self-awareness.

33
00:02:49,423 --> 00:02:51,143
Who's the owner of Moon Embracing Pavilion?

34
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:56,002
I don't know. I've never seen the owner

35
00:02:56,765 --> 00:02:58,455
ever since I joined Moon Embracing Pavilion.

36
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,776
Let me ask you another question, then.

37
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,151
Have you seen a pair of mother and son in Moon Embracing Pavilion?

38
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:03,895
The child is around six to seven years old.

39
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:06,853
I have not.

40
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,096
Lord Fan, I assume the people you're looking for

41
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,695
didn't join Moon Embracing Pavilion of their own accords.

42
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,322
No. They were abducted to this place.

43
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,282
We've never seen anyone

44
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,362
whom they've abducted here.

45
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,362
If there's a pair of mother and son here,

46
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:26,127
I assume they would be locked up in the same place as the rest.

47
00:03:26,151 --> 00:03:27,301
Where is it, then?

48
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,642
No one ever told us that before.

49
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,842
We don't even know

50
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,522
who's their latest victim.

51
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:41,162
A few days ago, one of the girls was harshly beaten.

52
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,642
She ran to the front yard and bumped into me.

53
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:45,933
If the pair of mother and son were abducted to this place,

54
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:47,325
I think she might've seen them before.

55
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:48,634
What's her name?

56
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,670
I don't know.

57
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,522
I think her surname is Jin. That's all I know.

58
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:55,326
Her father sells vegetables for a living.

59
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,522
Miss Sang Wen,

60
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,387
time to go.

61
00:03:58,864 --> 00:03:59,865
Got it.

62
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:01,606
I'll be there after changing my outfit.

63
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,270
Wait.

64
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,298
You haven't told me about your request.

65
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,442
Was my info useful?

66
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,820
Very.

67
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,520
I wish to leave Moon Embracing Pavilion.

68
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:22,722
It's dangerous for you to follow me now.

69
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:25,677
However, it's not that I can't bring you with me.

70
00:04:26,526 --> 00:04:27,676
But not now.

71
00:04:28,366 --> 00:04:30,042
I can never escape from this identity

72
00:04:30,215 --> 00:04:32,082
as long as my indenture is still here.

73
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,919
If so, I'll buy out your indenture.

74
00:04:35,383 --> 00:04:36,983
Lord Fan, I dare not ask you to waste your money.

75
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:38,562
I have enough to buy out my indenture.

76
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,642
I just wish for a chance at redemption.

77
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:42,862
You can't buy it out even though you have the money?

78
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,922
I was forced to sign the indenture through violent means.

79
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,696
They're forcing ladies to become courtesans now?

80
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,202
The owner of Moon Embracing Pavilion is quite influential, huh?

81
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:58,182
Don't tell people that you've seen me.

82
00:04:58,654 --> 00:04:59,882
Wait for me to rescue you.

83
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,882
I'm in no rush.

84
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,519
Lord Fan, we can talk about it once you've been revived.

85
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,109
Your Highness,

86
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:15,762
the name list of all individuals

87
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,199
who attended the memorial service

88
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:18,614
is here.

89
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:20,202
Fan Xian never showed himself.

90
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,959
Were there any movements in Wang Qi Nian's residence?

91
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:26,673
Not really.

92
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,842
I've also planted our men

93
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,402
at all corners.

94
00:05:34,182 --> 00:05:35,662
We only saw his wife and daughter.

95
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:37,002
He was nowhere to be seen.

96
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,270
Could it be

97
00:05:40,623 --> 00:05:42,423
that Fan Xian hasn't reached the capital yet?

98
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,042
- Should we wait a little longer? - We have no time.

99
00:05:46,143 --> 00:05:48,082
Lord Fan's death is known to all now.

100
00:05:48,342 --> 00:05:51,642
If he returns to the convoy now, it'll be difficult to catch him.

101
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,562
But he's not showing himself.

102
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,319
Wu Jiu,

103
00:05:57,406 --> 00:05:58,682
do you know

104
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:02,042
what's the most touching moment in the world?

105
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,682
To pass the imperial examination.

106
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,362
It's reuniting with one's family.

107
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:13,562
Do you know what's the prerequisite?

108
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,767
You have to have a family first.

109
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,082
You have to be separated first

110
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:17,372
before you can be reunited.

111
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,162
Wu Jiu, invite Wang Qi Nian's wife and daughter here.

112
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:23,442
I wish to witness their touching reunion.

113
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,630
Yes, Your Highness.

114
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,482
I'm waiting for that touching moment.

115
00:06:35,581 --> 00:06:37,642
Lord Fan, I've already inquired about it.

116
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,562
This is the street.

117
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,122
Later, Moon Embracing Pavilion's purchasing caravan

118
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,042
will pass by this road.

119
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,029
Remember,

120
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,962
there are two vegetable baskets on the last cart.

121
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,480
They aren't packed with vegetables.

122
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:53,962
You can hide in it.

123
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,882
- Are you sure about that? - Yes.

124
00:07:00,565 --> 00:07:01,715
They're here.

125
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,909
Lord Fan,

126
00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:06,322
do you have any spare changes?

127
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,882
Look at all the silver taels!

128
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:36,125
It's mine!

129
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,602
There are silver taels over there!

130
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:39,172
Go away! Don't steal my money!

131
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:40,842
This is mine!

132
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,720
To the west of the old fort,

133
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,132
as the story goes,

134
00:08:27,213 --> 00:08:30,202
at Chibi, Zhou Yu of the Three Kingdoms

135
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:31,959
summoned stones to pierce the sky,

136
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:33,442
waves to crash against the shore,

137
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:35,322
and snow drifts.

138
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,082
Excellent!

139
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,150
Get inside.

140
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:43,327
Hurry up.

141
00:08:43,414 --> 00:08:44,722
Mind my goods.

142
00:08:45,806 --> 00:08:47,242
Go inside. Over there.

143
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,842
Go inside. Be careful.

144
00:08:51,743 --> 00:08:52,893
Liu,

145
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:55,456
inspect all these carts thoroughly later.

146
00:08:55,537 --> 00:08:57,042
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

147
00:08:57,712 --> 00:08:59,082
Captain, take care.

148
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,322
(Old Man Jin, Vegetable Seller)

149
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,767
I met you before.

150
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,814
I don't know who you are.

151
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,562
You were on the stage before this, no?

152
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:35,482
Everyone, please give me another chance!

153
00:09:35,962 --> 00:09:37,162
Please give me another chance!

154
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,642
Please give me another chance!

155
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:40,250
Please give me another chance!

156
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:42,727
Do you wish to go inside that badly?

157
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:44,290
It's more important than my life.

158
00:09:45,704 --> 00:09:47,150
You're not young.

159
00:09:47,231 --> 00:09:48,381
You should mind your health.

160
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,669
It doesn't matter.

161
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,502
I'm fine with anything that happens to me

162
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,122
as long as I can see my daughter.

163
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,413
Your daughter is in Moon Embracing Pavilion?

164
00:09:59,437 --> 00:10:00,587
But why?

165
00:10:04,414 --> 00:10:06,122
Because of 500 taels.

166
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,679
Did you sell your daughter away?

167
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,002
I would never do that no matter how much of a scum I am.

168
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:14,282
My daughter did it to pay for the vegetable money.

169
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,722
She sold herself away.

170
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:19,894
Vegetable money? How on earth could someone spend 500 taels on vegetables?

171
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:21,878
It's the debt I incurred from selling vegetables.

172
00:10:22,437 --> 00:10:26,722
Eunuch Dai, who's in charge of purchasing vegetables, buys from me.

173
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,189
Wait.

174
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,882
Are you a vegetable seller?

175
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,602
- Is your surname Jin? - How did you know?

176
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,522
- Leave it over here. - Hurry.

177
00:10:35,831 --> 00:10:37,202
Mind the goods.

178
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,954
I'll get a chicken.

179
00:10:53,965 --> 00:10:56,102
As you were saying, you delivered vegetables to the palace, right?

180
00:10:56,126 --> 00:10:58,366
That's great. You'll have business no matter the season.

181
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:00,842
However, Eunuch Dai charges us extra as a sign of respect.

182
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,280
We have to pay him on every festive occasion.

183
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,762
On his last birthday,

184
00:11:05,986 --> 00:11:08,082
I had no money.

185
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:10,038
Eunuch Dai held a grudge against me.

186
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:13,483
After that, he kept complaining that my vegetables weren't fresh.

187
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:16,019
If so, wouldn't it be fine if you just stopped selling them to him?

188
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:17,862
If only that was the case.

189
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,202
If they're not fresh, he'll penalize you.

190
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:23,549
He'll say that you're disrespecting the imperial family.

191
00:11:23,573 --> 00:11:26,482
He penalized me every day. I had to owe him money.

192
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,122
In the end, my debt became 500 taels.

193
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,713
That's why my daughter did such a silly thing.

194
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,015
If so, can't you just stop delivering vegetables to the palace?

195
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,159
If you stop, that means you're deceiving His Majesty.

196
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:39,762
You'll still be executed for that.

197
00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:43,464
So, no one dares to file a complaint against Eunuch Dai?

198
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,642
I'm just a vegetable seller.

199
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:50,047
How can I file a complaint against him?

200
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,413
By using the law.

201
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:53,400
Eunuch Dai is the law.

202
00:11:53,495 --> 00:11:55,002
When my daughter sold herself away,

203
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,060
I didn't even get the banknotes.

204
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,135
Moon Embracing Pavilion gave Eunuch Dai the money immediately.

205
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,762
They said it canceled out my debt.

206
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,407
Seems like Eunuch Dai is quite close to Moon Embracing Pavilion.

207
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,242
Who knows? All of them are influential figures.

208
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:11,322
Since then,

209
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:14,595
I always wanted to go inside and visit my child.

210
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:16,722
I wanted to tell her

211
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,922
that I'm saving up money

212
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,602
and that I'll definitely get her out of there.

213
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,682
Open the back door. Let the caravan pass through.

214
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:27,422
Check the backyard and see if you guys missed out on anything.

215
00:12:27,503 --> 00:12:29,122
- I'll help you out. - Hurry!

216
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,029
Lord Fan.

217
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,242
This is all of my private stash.

218
00:12:47,343 --> 00:12:48,493
Please take them.

219
00:12:49,677 --> 00:12:51,802
- I can't just... - Please take them.

220
00:12:55,322 --> 00:12:57,562
But...

221
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,181
You don't need to kneel.

222
00:13:02,301 --> 00:13:04,501
You see, I'm using you too.

223
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:05,722
I'm not helping you out.

224
00:13:09,182 --> 00:13:11,442
I can't go inside even if I have the money.

225
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,082
You need an invitation before you can go inside.

226
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:16,522
Hurry! Don't fall behind!

227
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:18,162
Hurry up!

228
00:13:18,472 --> 00:13:19,622
Hurry up!

229
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,549
I'll deal with that for you.

230
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,100
It's said that suddenly Jibei is recaptured;

231
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,779
Weeds and trees in spring grow unkempt in town.

232
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,890
Flowers in this dark time bring me tears and pains.

233
00:13:35,456 --> 00:13:36,842
Birds chirp sad partings...

234
00:13:36,957 --> 00:13:39,042
Hey, that's the wrong poem.

235
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:43,402
We're going home accompanied by the green spring.

236
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,842
For three months, war breaks out time and again;

237
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:49,322
- Letters from home... - Why are you cheating?

238
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,802
That's nonsense!

239
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,202
Just get off the stage!

240
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,082
Lord Fan.

241
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,202
Your name lives eternally!

242
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,962
Why is this old man here again?

243
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,762
What is he up to this time?

244
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,642
He shows great momentum.

245
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:35,150
- He looks like he's doing something. - Yeah.

246
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,882
That was quick.

247
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,040
It does resemble his handwriting!

248
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,442
It does!

249
00:15:05,346 --> 00:15:06,506
It resembles his handwriting!

250
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:11,259
Excellent!

251
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:20,759
Excellent!

252
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,282
Excellent!

253
00:15:28,349 --> 00:15:29,572
He won all votes.

254
00:15:29,653 --> 00:15:30,973
He shall receive an invitation.

255
00:15:32,534 --> 00:15:34,042
Next.

256
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:36,375
Get on stage and show us how you mourn for him.

257
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,682
"Say Farewell to My Friend Dong."

258
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:42,842
A thousand miles...

259
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:45,751
A thousand miles...

260
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:50,042
Next. Get on stage and show us how you mourn for him.

261
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:58,082
(Moon Embracing Pavilion)

262
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:26,162
(Moon Embracing Pavilion)

263
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,762
Please head inside.

264
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,199
Lord Fan,

265
00:16:41,341 --> 00:16:44,362
he's truly fortunate to encounter you.

266
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,056
Eunuch Dai, the person in charge of replenishing the palace's vegetables,

267
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,282
have you heard of him before?

268
00:16:48,461 --> 00:16:51,122
I've only heard of Eunuch Dai of the Vegetable Inspection Office.

269
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,322
I have to go and see him later.

270
00:16:53,518 --> 00:16:56,202
I have to find out what the law looks like.

271
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,122
Lord Fan, if you wish to climb up the ranks,

272
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,922
you have to learn to be as humble as the dust in the light.

273
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,642
You have to learn how to keep one eye closed.

274
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,162
How could such a person

275
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:08,882
be known as the light?

276
00:17:09,574 --> 00:17:12,842
No matter if that's true or not, he does work in the palace after all.

277
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,082
Are affairs like Mr. Jin's actually common?

278
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,402
They're common folks, you know?

279
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,522
They're already used to it long ago.

280
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:27,042
Mom, I'm not sleepy. I don't want to take a nap.

281
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,242
You can have dinner again when you wake up.

282
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:33,122
Do we have meat tonight?

283
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,802
You can't just take meat all the time.

284
00:17:35,895 --> 00:17:37,282
I did take rice too.

285
00:17:37,566 --> 00:17:39,162
Yeah. Go to sleep.

286
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,870
Mother,

287
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,922
why did Father and Uncle Fan leave from the well?

288
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,722
Don't tell anyone about your father and Uncle Fan, okay?

289
00:17:53,563 --> 00:17:55,639
I know that. Mother, don't worry.

290
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,548
When I was playing with San Ya and the rest,

291
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,762
I told them Father was dead.

292
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,442
You didn't need to go that far.

293
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:07,421
Is Father back?

294
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,950
He doesn't need to knock on the door when he comes back.

295
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,842
Hide under the bed.

296
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,138
- My Lord. - Guys, please return.

297
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:06,643
Please come back earlier tomorrow.

298
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:08,342
Please go back. We have another session tomorrow.

299
00:19:08,366 --> 00:19:09,662
Guys, please go back.

300
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,892
That's all for today. We have another session tomorrow.

301
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,282
- Please go home. - Please go back.

302
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,242
Guys, please go home.

303
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,439
Please go back. Come back earlier tomorrow.

304
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,700
Guys,

305
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,282
that's all for today.

306
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:24,162
We'll continue the mourning tomorrow.

307
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,402
Go now.

308
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:40,122
Clean up that area.

309
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:41,341
Okay.

310
00:20:13,774 --> 00:20:14,924
He's out.

311
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,030
How did it go?

312
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,722
Regarding your request,

313
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:00,282
I already asked my daughter about it.

314
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:04,922
She said she already saw all the newcomers who were locked up.

315
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:07,922
None of them had a son.

316
00:21:08,582 --> 00:21:09,922
Don't worry.

317
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,122
The person you're looking for,

318
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,112
she's not in the Moon Embracing Pavilion.

319
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:17,282
If so, that means we ran out of leads.

320
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,509
Benefactor,

321
00:21:20,023 --> 00:21:23,122
you may give it a try tomorrow.

322
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:25,002
What do you mean?

323
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:27,042
My daughter said

324
00:21:27,423 --> 00:21:30,282
that they're lecturing the newcomers.

325
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:33,642
They said that the master would be coming tomorrow morning.

326
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,339
The owner of Moon Embracing Pavilion, huh?

327
00:21:35,363 --> 00:21:36,744
He's a mysterious figure.

328
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:38,722
No one knows who he is.

329
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,362
Benefactor, you have money.

330
00:21:40,518 --> 00:21:42,762
If you meet the master,

331
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,242
you can inquire about it from him.

332
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,790
What about your daughter? Why didn't she leave with you?

333
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,642
They said

334
00:21:56,736 --> 00:21:58,522
500 taels

335
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,402
was only enough for four hours.

336
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:04,642
They told me to spend time

337
00:22:04,797 --> 00:22:07,082
with my daughter with that amount...

338
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:14,402
How much were they asking for?

339
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,842
10,000 taels.

340
00:22:21,534 --> 00:22:26,442
I can never gather 10,000 taels in this lifetime!

341
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:31,082
And, your 500 taels,

342
00:22:32,526 --> 00:22:35,042
I failed to take them back too.

343
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:40,922
Not only did I fail to save my daughter,

344
00:22:42,141 --> 00:22:45,802
but I also wasted your 500 taels.

345
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:49,842
I'm so useless!

346
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:54,067
Don't do this!

347
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:55,602
- I'm sorry! - Don't do this!

348
00:22:55,687 --> 00:22:57,059
You've already done me a huge favor.

349
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,084
You don't need to return the 500 taels to me.

350
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,797
Regarding the 10,000 taels, I'll do something about it too.

351
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:02,178
Don't worry.

352
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,882
I'll go and sell my vegetables

353
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:13,842
so that I can repay your debt.

354
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,762
If only I can survive!

355
00:23:32,631 --> 00:23:33,781
My Lord!

356
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:35,202
Don't go there!

357
00:23:43,443 --> 00:23:46,189
- Get out of the way! - My Lord, come!

358
00:23:47,998 --> 00:23:50,566
Collect his corpse and report it to the authorities. It's an accident.

359
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,922
We'll pay however much we have to.

360
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,060
If you rush outside,

361
00:23:59,183 --> 00:24:01,162
you'll only alert them to your presence, My Lord!

362
00:24:01,326 --> 00:24:03,397
- Clean the floor. - Stop looking!

363
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,362
This concerns an innocent life.

364
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,095
How could a brothel do such a thing...

365
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:19,919
The owner of the brothel is the culprit here.

366
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,042
All of you, leave. Stop looking.

367
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,500
Go back.

368
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:25,442
He went in alive.

369
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,802
But he died when he came outside.

370
00:24:28,382 --> 00:24:30,122
Do you think there's any other possibility?

371
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:31,522
But we weren't inside

372
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:34,042
just now.

373
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:41,722
I'll definitely come here tomorrow.

374
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:43,722
I want to see

375
00:24:44,503 --> 00:24:48,042
who the master of Moon Embracing Pavilion is.

376
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:57,802
(Moon Embracing Pavilion)

377
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,842
What's with the heavy blow?

378
00:25:00,935 --> 00:25:02,562
The old man started it first.

379
00:25:02,653 --> 00:25:03,962
We had no choice.

380
00:25:04,078 --> 00:25:05,228
We had to defend ourselves.

381
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,550
Where's his daughter?

382
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:07,949
We're keeping an eye on her.

383
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,255
We don't want her to take her life.

384
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,350
Have you washed the blood away?

385
00:25:10,374 --> 00:25:11,522
Yes, ma'am.

386
00:25:11,946 --> 00:25:13,234
The road is as good as new.

387
00:25:13,315 --> 00:25:15,766
- We cleaned the interior and exterior thoroughly - Your waist.

388
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,940
As per your instructions.

389
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,562
We treat people sincerely and touch them with our intentions.

390
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,293
Does he have any other family members?

391
00:25:21,317 --> 00:25:23,482
No. He only has one daughter. She's here with us.

392
00:25:24,425 --> 00:25:26,202
Deliver some money to her.

393
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:28,442
Tell our men to look after her and console her.

394
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:29,802
Console her more.

395
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,519
Now that her father is gone, I'm sure she's disheartened.

396
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,482
But it also makes things easier for her, don't you think?

397
00:25:35,638 --> 00:25:36,788
Keep your butt straight.

398
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,722
Is your hand a chicken foot?

399
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:44,021
Tell that girl

400
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:46,882
we'll hold a funeral for her father.

401
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,100
Tell her to work hard

402
00:25:49,255 --> 00:25:51,322
and become a top courtesan in the future.

403
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:53,002
At least the old man will be happy

404
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:56,146
when he sees his daughter sweeping her tomb in the future.

405
00:25:57,215 --> 00:25:59,442
Madam Yuan, you're too kind.

406
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,402
Again.

407
00:26:07,327 --> 00:26:08,477
Where are your waists?

408
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:10,282
Raise your chest.

409
00:26:10,565 --> 00:26:11,715
Beautiful.

410
00:26:22,515 --> 00:26:23,665
My Lord,

411
00:26:24,654 --> 00:26:25,752
according to what Mr. Jin said,

412
00:26:25,776 --> 00:26:27,407
Eunuch Dai of the Vegetable Inspection Office

413
00:26:27,431 --> 00:26:28,991
is a jackal from the same lair as them.

414
00:26:29,286 --> 00:26:30,562
But don't worry.

415
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,619
We can investigate him

416
00:26:32,743 --> 00:26:34,242
once you've been revived.

417
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,870
What's the matter?

418
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:43,749
Dear?

419
00:26:47,222 --> 00:26:49,322
I searched the entire place. There's no one here.

420
00:26:49,605 --> 00:26:51,007
Could it be that she's visiting her relatives?

421
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:52,181
No way.

422
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:55,802
My wife knew that your return to the capital was a secret.

423
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:00,162
Ba Ba!

424
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:14,239
It's just like what happened to the Teng family.

425
00:27:14,582 --> 00:27:15,842
They're gone.

426
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,402
It must be Moon Embracing Pavilion!

427
00:27:28,142 --> 00:27:29,402
My Lord!

428
00:27:30,555 --> 00:27:32,282
It's pointless for you to go there now!

429
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:33,764
Their lives

430
00:27:34,637 --> 00:27:37,202
are much more important than mine!

431
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:39,858
- Calm down. Listen to me first. - What did you say?

432
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:42,349
Didn't I tell you that we had to leave

433
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,442
as soon as possible?

434
00:27:44,822 --> 00:27:47,282
If not, my wife and my daughter would be in danger.

435
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:48,762
Great.

436
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,360
Second Prince already captured them.

437
00:27:51,486 --> 00:27:54,878
How could I calm down at such a moment?

438
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:58,002
This morning, we saw them killing an old man

439
00:27:58,503 --> 00:28:00,802
right in front of our eyes!

440
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,562
The world is bright and peaceful.

441
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:10,722
All is well.

442
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:22,882
Qi Nian, I'll go now.

443
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,242
My Lord, take care.

444
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,562
Keep an eye on the affairs outside.

445
00:28:27,951 --> 00:28:29,101
Yes, My Lord.

446
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:32,922
Don't worry. I can definitely rescue them.

447
00:28:33,062 --> 00:28:34,562
My Lord, I trust you.

448
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:10,989
Fan Wu Jiu.

449
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,790
Your Highness.

450
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,962
You're actually reading every day?

451
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,362
You never resorted to this before.

452
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,399
The spring examination is nearing.

453
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,922
I have to prepare myself.

454
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,562
What? Do you plan to participate in it?

455
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:28,802
All intellectuals

456
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,559
want to pass the imperial examination.

457
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,870
Intellectuals, huh?

458
00:29:32,097 --> 00:29:33,857
Why are you carrying a sword with you, then?

459
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:37,362
I had no choice but to practice martial arts.

460
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:39,282
Actually, I was an intellectual

461
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,122
since young.

462
00:29:42,935 --> 00:29:44,162
That's great.

463
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:45,501
That's excellent.

464
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,562
At least you can devise strategies for me.

465
00:29:48,126 --> 00:29:50,122
Come, intellectual. Tell me something.

466
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,842
Why did Wang Qi Nian's wife and daughter

467
00:29:53,782 --> 00:29:55,962
vanish all of a sudden?

468
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,429
Your Highness,

469
00:30:02,311 --> 00:30:03,762
I was perplexed by it too.

470
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:05,842
Yesterday, I saw them entering

471
00:30:06,247 --> 00:30:08,642
the Wang Residence myself.

472
00:30:08,943 --> 00:30:10,242
But guess what happened

473
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,722
when I rushed inside?

474
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,590
They vanished.

475
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,802
Didn't they leave behind any traces?

476
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:21,842
I searched the entire place.

477
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:24,042
But I found no traces of them.

478
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:26,621
I feel scared now that I'm thinking about it.

479
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,639
It was as if I was dealing with spirits.

480
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:32,383
Could it be that Wang Qi Nian returned to the capital with Fan Xian

481
00:30:32,837 --> 00:30:34,322
and moved them elsewhere?

482
00:30:36,181 --> 00:30:37,802
After hearing that from you,

483
00:30:38,582 --> 00:30:39,842
everything does make sense.

484
00:30:40,078 --> 00:30:41,228
You fool.

485
00:30:42,661 --> 00:30:44,652
Your Highness, Wang Qi Nian seeks an audience.

486
00:30:44,848 --> 00:30:45,998
Who?

487
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,900
- Did you say Wang Qi Nian? - Yes, Your Highness.

488
00:30:47,924 --> 00:30:49,722
- Is he alone? - That's right.

489
00:30:51,255 --> 00:30:52,642
Interesting.

490
00:30:53,872 --> 00:30:55,762
- Let him in. - Yes, Your Highness.

491
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:14,242
Greetings, Your Highness.

492
00:31:14,703 --> 00:31:15,922
I'm Wang Qi Nian.

493
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:25,365
Where did you get this pear from?

494
00:31:25,389 --> 00:31:26,539
I bought it.

495
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,722
Do you want some fruits?

496
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,229
Fan Xian

497
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:41,082
faked his death in the convoy.

498
00:31:42,511 --> 00:31:45,042
Now, he's in the capital.

499
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,749
Really?

500
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,762
Great.

501
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:52,042
He actually managed to dupe me.

502
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,122
After returning to the capital,

503
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,202
he's been trying to locate

504
00:31:58,495 --> 00:32:00,482
the whereabouts of Teng Zi Jin's wife and son.

505
00:32:00,974 --> 00:32:02,162
Now,

506
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:05,522
he has already set his sights on Moon Embracing Pavilion.

507
00:32:06,472 --> 00:32:08,312
What kind of place is Moon Embracing Pavilion?

508
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,802
It's a brothel.

509
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,727
What has Moon Embracing Pavilion got to do with them?

510
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:13,901
That's not important.

511
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,002
Fan Xian found out

512
00:32:16,652 --> 00:32:18,332
that the master of Moon Embracing Pavilion

513
00:32:18,413 --> 00:32:19,722
was heading there today.

514
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,882
That's why he infiltrated the building.

515
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,139
Your Highness, if you head there right now,

516
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,920
you can expose his fake death to the world

517
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,402
and corner him.

518
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,202
Aren't you Fan Xian's trusted aide?

519
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:40,522
Lord Fan

520
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,762
did treat me

521
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,002
like a great friend.

522
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:48,402
I'm hugely indebted to him.

523
00:32:48,606 --> 00:32:50,002
Why are you betraying him, then?

524
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,722
Your Highness, I only hope

525
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,800
that you can release my wife and daughter

526
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,802
after the deed is done.

527
00:33:03,071 --> 00:33:04,522
So, you're doing it for your family.

528
00:33:05,487 --> 00:33:06,802
In my heart,

529
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,482
my wife and daughter are above all else.

530
00:33:21,248 --> 00:33:22,602
Can I trust you?

531
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:26,800
Okay.

532
00:33:26,907 --> 00:33:28,026
I promise you this.

533
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:29,939
You can take any of my men

534
00:33:30,078 --> 00:33:31,228
as long as

535
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,242
we can trap Lord Fan today.

536
00:33:33,343 --> 00:33:34,562
Thank you, Your Highness.

537
00:33:35,971 --> 00:33:39,002
Wu Jiu, we shall head to Moon Embracing Pavilion together.

538
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,590
Yes, Your Highness.

539
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:47,189
Follow me.

540
00:33:49,225 --> 00:33:50,434
Where are my shoes?

541
00:33:50,533 --> 00:33:51,802
Where are my shoes?

542
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:00,989
Your Highness.

543
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,879
You do live up to your name as Fan Xian's trusted aide.

544
00:34:19,895 --> 00:34:21,202
You forsook darkness for light.

545
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,842
Fan Xian won't let you off.

546
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,380
I have no choice.

547
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,550
Get up.

548
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:29,709
Get up!

549
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,802
You have a choice now.

550
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,080
Fan Xian's crime of deceiving His Majesty

551
00:34:36,222 --> 00:34:38,602
will be confirmed as long as we capture him today.

552
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,162
By then, you can join me.

553
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,522
I'll pay you as much as him.

554
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,072
Thank you, Your Highness.

555
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,242
If that's the case,

556
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,802
why don't we flip the table entirely?

557
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:52,282
Follow me to Moon Embracing Pavilion.

558
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,440
Your Highness, I'll follow your will.

559
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,722
Not bad at all.

560
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,882
Master doesn't come here often.

561
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:09,314
This is a rare chance for you all.

562
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,460
Show him everything you learned.

563
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,282
If he does take a liking to you,

564
00:35:15,423 --> 00:35:18,322
it'll be a chance for you to ascend to the top.

565
00:35:20,054 --> 00:35:22,682
However, I'll say this first.

566
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,082
If anyone commits a mistake

567
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,842
or gets into trouble,

568
00:35:27,217 --> 00:35:28,962
I'll remember it for the rest of my life.

569
00:35:32,176 --> 00:35:33,326
Ladies,

570
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,699
do your best.

571
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,030
Miss Sang,

572
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:47,042
you better sing well later.

573
00:35:47,391 --> 00:35:49,330
You mustn't sing gloomy songs.

574
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:50,682
Miss Meng, please don't worry.

575
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:52,002
I dare not do so.

576
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,402
You must smile more often.

577
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,110
That's the smile I want. It's great.

578
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,619
Ladies, you all must think about

579
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:08,282
how to serve him wholeheartedly.

580
00:36:08,878 --> 00:36:11,427
The brothel depends on you all now.

581
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,159
Mr. Wang,

582
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,562
be my chauffeur.

583
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:35,189
Your Highness!

584
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,479
Your Highness,

585
00:36:36,582 --> 00:36:38,602
please spare Lord Fan!

586
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:45,642
Why are you pleading for him now?

587
00:36:46,502 --> 00:36:48,442
I would never betray Lord Fan

588
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,040
if it weren't for the fact that I had to save my family.

589
00:36:51,294 --> 00:36:54,282
Don't worry. I'm not doing all of these so that I can kill him.

590
00:36:54,383 --> 00:36:56,042
Harmony benefits both sides after all.

591
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,122
Thank you, Your Highness.

592
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:03,174
Your Highness, to be honest,

593
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:06,562
I'm pretty good at riding carriages.

594
00:37:12,249 --> 00:37:15,638
(Moon Embracing Pavilion)

595
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:18,200
We've cleared both the front and back end of the street.

596
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,460
Please don't worry.

597
00:37:30,267 --> 00:37:31,603
Here he comes.

598
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,402
Master, greetings.

599
00:38:09,247 --> 00:38:10,802
Don't make any mistakes later.

600
00:38:11,015 --> 00:38:13,162
I'm sure you guys saw how the newcomers

601
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:14,722
were whipped.

602
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,390
Yes.

603
00:38:16,526 --> 00:38:18,882
It'll be terrible if the master

604
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:20,759
hears their wails.

605
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
That won't happen.

606
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:23,399
They're locked away in the backyard.

607
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,397
Someone is keeping an eye on them. They don't dare to make a sound.

608
00:38:25,421 --> 00:38:26,422
How would you know?

609
00:38:26,503 --> 00:38:28,871
I was chased away by the guards when I passed by the backyard.

610
00:38:28,895 --> 00:38:30,045
I saw them back then.

611
00:38:37,702 --> 00:38:39,403
I think they were all sold to the brothel.

612
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:41,880
Why would a brother need this many newcomers?

613
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,613
It's either they were duped into joining it

614
00:38:43,637 --> 00:38:45,202
or they were abducted here.

615
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:47,802
If not, why would they cry every day?

616
00:38:47,943 --> 00:38:50,882
Say, who exactly is this master?

617
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,159
He's so cruel.

618
00:38:52,293 --> 00:38:53,562
Stop spouting nonsense.

619
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:54,919
Our survival is more important.

620
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,962
Ladies, the master is here.

621
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:08,962
Over here, please.

622
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:14,394
- Master. - Master, you're here.

623
00:39:14,475 --> 00:39:16,562
- Please. - Why should I sit here?

624
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,280
- Try some grapes. - I...

625
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,420
- Try mine. - Try mine after this.

626
00:39:20,837 --> 00:39:21,917
- Enough. - Try this.

627
00:39:21,998 --> 00:39:23,426
Give it a try.

628
00:39:23,507 --> 00:39:25,297
- Give it a try. - That's enough!

629
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,282
What are you guys doing?

630
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:29,279
How can I have lunch if I eat all of these?

631
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:30,802
I'll check the accounts first.

632
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:34,100
Master, the ledger is ready.

633
00:39:34,214 --> 00:39:36,242
Why don't you check it after our banquet?

634
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:37,599
Where's the banquet?

635
00:39:37,689 --> 00:39:38,839
Is it this?

636
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:40,128
It's not ready yet, right?

637
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:41,780
I'll check the accounts first.

638
00:39:41,804 --> 00:39:42,954
Where are they?

639
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,550
Right now?

640
00:40:02,522 --> 00:40:03,922
(Fan Si Zhe, Fan Jian's Second Son)

641
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:08,522
Why are you still standing there?

642
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:09,759
Why aren't you guys leaving?

643
00:40:09,831 --> 00:40:11,122
You're blocking my light.

644
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,896
- You don't want any of them? - Can they check the accounts?

645
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,976
Or do they have numbers on their faces?

646
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,150
You don't want any songs?

647
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,800
What about a dance?

648
00:40:19,888 --> 00:40:22,362
Am I here to check the accounts? Or am I here to see them?

649
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,482
Make them leave. Okay?

650
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:50,962
What's with all these expenditures?

651
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:03,669
What are you doing?

652
00:41:03,815 --> 00:41:05,082
Why are you still here?

653
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,802
I have to keep you company.

654
00:41:07,693 --> 00:41:09,074
Keep me company? But why?

655
00:41:09,271 --> 00:41:10,342
I'm here to chat with you.

656
00:41:10,423 --> 00:41:12,122
- About what? - It's up to you.

657
00:41:15,943 --> 00:41:17,442
Don't try to pull this trick on me.

658
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,922
I know what you're up to.

659
00:41:19,216 --> 00:41:20,549
I'm checking the accounts here.

660
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:23,082
And, you're here to distract me.

661
00:41:23,276 --> 00:41:25,040
I'm sure something's wrong with the accounts.

662
00:41:25,064 --> 00:41:26,467
You're accusing me here.

663
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,280
If not, you should leave, then.

664
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,402
Go and rush the kitchen. I'm starving.

665
00:41:30,492 --> 00:41:31,972
I'm worried that you might be lonely.

666
00:41:32,006 --> 00:41:34,925
Look at all the ledgers that are waiting for me. Why would I be lonely?

667
00:41:35,006 --> 00:41:36,625
I'm the happiest man in the world now.

668
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:39,840
Isn't it boring checking the accounts alone?

669
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,148
What did you say?

670
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,630
You made me angry.

671
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:48,722
Is there anything more interesting than checking the accounts?

672
00:41:48,902 --> 00:41:50,602
Get out. I don't want you here.

673
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,162
How did I make him angry?

674
00:41:53,424 --> 00:41:55,002
You thought you did a good job?

675
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,030
Go.

676
00:41:58,838 --> 00:42:00,117
Find me if you need anything.

677
00:42:00,198 --> 00:42:01,348
I'll be fine.

678
00:42:03,082 --> 00:42:04,232
Go now.

679
00:42:06,603 --> 00:42:08,397
How dare she badmouth the ledgers?

680
00:42:08,565 --> 00:42:09,715
She's so annoying.

681
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,269
Fan Si Zhe.

682
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,162
Fan Xian?

683
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,880
I knew you were still alive!

684
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,402
Everyone said that you were dead.

685
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,935
Why does it feel like it's been a few years since I saw you?

686
00:42:45,959 --> 00:42:47,109
Lower your volume.

687
00:42:50,394 --> 00:42:52,562
Didn't you go to Northern Qi as a diplomat?

688
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,642
Why are you back before the convoy?

689
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,482
Did you get in trouble?

690
00:42:57,605 --> 00:42:59,445
Are you the master of Moon Embracing Pavilion?
