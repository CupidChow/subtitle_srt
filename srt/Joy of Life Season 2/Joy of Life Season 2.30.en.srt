00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:30,965
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:34,006
(Episode 30)

3
00:01:36,168 --> 00:01:38,042
You are Si Gu Jian's younger brother.

4
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,495
You finished using your poison smoke,

5
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,879
three crossbow bolts,

6
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:45,148
and the silver needles on your head.

7
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,350
You only have one dagger left.

8
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,162
What else are you trying to do?

9
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,482
The palace guards will be here soon.

10
00:01:57,398 --> 00:01:58,962
There's still time.

11
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:47,007
Fan Xian,

12
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:49,415
why does your internal energy become a mess suddenly?

13
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:23,908
What's wrong?

14
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,079
Your Majesty,

15
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,640
it's a bit troublesome.

16
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,559
Wasn't he stabbed once?

17
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,842
- There's poison on the blade. - Cure it.

18
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,977
I'm not sure what kind of poison it is.

19
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:35,802
I went to Fan Residence previously

20
00:05:35,932 --> 00:05:38,319
and noticed his condition where his breathing is a mess

21
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,242
and his meridians flow in reverse.

22
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,470
When I returned to the Imperial Hospital, I read many medicinal books.

23
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:45,879
That was when I determined

24
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:49,678
that Lord Fan's internal energy was out of control

25
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:52,379
and caused a reverse flow of his inner breath.

26
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
In this battle,

27
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,202
Lord Fan lost control of his internal energy,

28
00:05:57,407 --> 00:05:59,798
got injured externally, and got poisoned.

29
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,359
Everything is critical.

30
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,020
Moreover, his body is enduring everything.

31
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,842
Are you sure his internal energy is gone?

32
00:06:10,198 --> 00:06:11,397
I'm sure.

33
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,350
What will happen?

34
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,642
There's one way.

35
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,230
We need to find someone

36
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,790
who practices the same internal energy as him.

37
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,482
Let that man consume his internal energy

38
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,509
to rearrange Lord Fan's meridians.

39
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,442
Although the internal energy of that person will be damaged,

40
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,652
he will still save a life.

41
00:06:37,973 --> 00:06:39,812
A person with the same internal energy.

42
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:40,893
Yes.

43
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:42,363
You can't find another person

44
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,242
in this world.

45
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,150
It'll be difficult.

46
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,468
You can die with him then.

47
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
Your Majesty!

48
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,960
Find Ruo Ruo.

49
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,950
Everything comes down to your fate.

50
00:08:17,505 --> 00:08:19,802
This is Fan Jian's daughter, Fan Ruo Ruo.

51
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,482
Can I speak with you in private?

52
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:38,294
Miss Ruo Ruo, do you know medicine?

53
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,642
My brother taught me.

54
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,718
- Do you know how to cure poison? - I don't.

55
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,895
- What about treating the reverse flow of the internal energy? - No.

56
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,839
- How can you save him? - I can't save him.

57
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:47,678
The only one who can save my brother is himself.

58
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:49,613
What I can do is to wake him up.

59
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,350
What are you planning to do?

60
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,582
My brother told me

61
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,461
about a pressure point that makes people wake up.

62
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:10,788
How many people have you tried this method on previously?

63
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,080
None.

64
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,310
This is too risky.

65
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,705
Can he wake up

66
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,642
without using needles?

67
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,799
It's hard.

68
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,070
Don't hesitate.

69
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:53,422
- Leave! - Leave!

70
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,319
Hurry!

71
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
How is it?

72
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,710
He's one of our own. It's all right.

73
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,962
Fan Xian is awake.

74
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,280
He spoke in person.

75
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:16,675
These were his exact words.

76
00:10:16,912 --> 00:10:19,112
Summon Senior Leng from the Third Bureau to the palace.

77
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Good.

78
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,749
The white-robed swordsman who stabbed Fan Xian is missing.

79
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,389
I can confirm that he is in the capital.

80
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:30,095
Keep investigating.

81
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,640
That man

82
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,629
is Si Gu Jian's younger brother.

83
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,670
His Majesty's opinion won't be wrong.

84
00:10:39,349 --> 00:10:41,255
Someone with the skills of a ninth-ranked official

85
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,562
is hiding in the capital

86
00:10:43,135 --> 00:10:45,095
yet the Overwatch Council knows nothing about it.

87
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,149
That is why something's wrong.

88
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,562
I must find the answer.

89
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:55,360
He knows everything about the palace guards' distribution.

90
00:10:55,518 --> 00:10:57,787
What do you think this means?

91
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,240
There's a spy.

92
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,040
I've investigated this person's dossier.

93
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,559
What's the result?

94
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,919
It's blank.

95
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:13,596
This is illogical.

96
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,882
Someone like him must be documented somehow.

97
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,120
So...

98
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,722
So, I suspect

99
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,239
the assassin's spy is located within the Overwatch Council.

100
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:25,230
Only the supervisors and I

101
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,590
have the authority

102
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,640
to use the documents regarding Si Gu Jian.

103
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,029
Perhaps the spy

104
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,559
is a supervisor of the Overwatch Council?

105
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,282
President, I want to investigate this in secret.

106
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,202
Why are you eliminating me from the list of suspects?

107
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,199
Everyone has a chance to commit treason

108
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,119
besides you.

109
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
Why?

110
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,799
You are righteous.

111
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,360
- Keep investigating. - Yes.

112
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,362
I'm coming!

113
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:23,607
I'm coming!

114
00:12:30,262 --> 00:12:31,262
Fan Xian.

115
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:33,924
Senior Leng, didn't you take any poison today?

116
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,945
Thankfully, I didn't.

117
00:12:36,026 --> 00:12:37,545
Otherwise, it'll be bad.

118
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,149
Fan Xian, do you know what kind of poison you were hit with?

119
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,789
- Yes. - It can be cured then.

120
00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:45,005
The poison on the dagger

121
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,629
is niter vein poison.

122
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,109
That's Dongyi City's style.

123
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:54,470
The assassin is Si Gu Jian's younger brother.

124
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,629
Who cares about that? Let me cure you first.

125
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,880
Dongyi City

126
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:03,397
uses peculiar poison,

127
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,510
but it's not a challenge for the Third Bureau.

128
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:08,625
Why don't we try it first?

129
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,000
I trust him.

130
00:13:19,202 --> 00:13:21,286
This medicine is for consumption. I'll give you some for external use.

131
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,682
I need to grind it.

132
00:13:36,168 --> 00:13:37,722
The poison hasn't been cured.

133
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,960
It cannot be.

134
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,319
I think

135
00:13:42,663 --> 00:13:44,984
the poison has attacked the organs.

136
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,240
Attacked the organs? What can we do?

137
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,280
Actually, a surgery will do.

138
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,039
What is a surgery?

139
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,719
Cut the wounds open

140
00:13:53,837 --> 00:13:55,322
to clean the organs.

141
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:57,710
No one cures poison with that method.

142
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,900
Don't people die when you cut them open?

143
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,749
Doing nothing

144
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,402
will result in death as well.

145
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,640
This is something unheard of.

146
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,068
Who can do it?

147
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,202
We need someone

148
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,802
who has steady hands.

149
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:24,918
I'll do it.

150
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,470
I have the most steady hands here.

151
00:14:29,422 --> 00:14:30,802
It might be

152
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,682
a bloody scene later.

153
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Wan Er,

154
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,842
why don't you go out first?

155
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,480
I'll accompany you.

156
00:14:44,313 --> 00:14:45,602
How confident are you?

157
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:52,242
Gosh, you're not even confident yourself?

158
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,762
If we don't try,

159
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,539
I'll die for sure.

160
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,522
We must try it then.

161
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,799
Do it.

162
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Wait.

163
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,682
Before you begin,

164
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:21,722
there are a few things

165
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,602
that you need to prepare.

166
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:25,693
Say it.

167
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,762
Slowly.

168
00:15:34,855 --> 00:15:36,298
Operation bed.

169
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,880
Surgical lights.

170
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
What?

171
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,830
Full sterilization.

172
00:15:46,832 --> 00:15:49,482
Can all of you treat me better?

173
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,922
I'm going to be cut open.

174
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,880
At least,

175
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,230
you should clean the place.

176
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,400
All right.

177
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,029
There's something in this world called bacteria.

178
00:16:01,205 --> 00:16:02,205
Bacteria?

179
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,470
Bacteria that you can't see with the naked eye.

180
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,082
What bacteria?

181
00:16:09,286 --> 00:16:10,842
Stop talking and do as he instructs.

182
00:16:10,923 --> 00:16:12,082
All right.

183
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,480
Lie down.

184
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,759
Fan Xian,

185
00:16:32,902 --> 00:16:35,142
I wiped the place with Poison-burning Powder many times.

186
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:38,236
I also smoked the place with Soul-evading Incense a few times.

187
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,642
I've cleaned the whole place.

188
00:16:40,741 --> 00:16:44,772
I think the thing you mentioned is gone now.

189
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
I made the medicine.

190
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,042
Strychnos won't do.

191
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,202
I'll fall asleep.

192
00:16:55,488 --> 00:16:57,517
How can we cut you open if you don't fall asleep?

193
00:16:57,847 --> 00:16:58,926
I can't sleep.

194
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,402
I must direct

195
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,880
the surgery.

196
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,722
Can't you do it yourself?

197
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,562
I only cut fruits before.

198
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,880
Senior,

199
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,150
use chloroform.

200
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
All right.

201
00:17:15,337 --> 00:17:18,007
Since ancient times,

202
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,882
no one has dared do this.

203
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:23,602
We will set a precedent today.

204
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,042
You need to wipe Ruo Ruo's sweat.

205
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,162
She's the surgeon.

206
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
Fan Xian.

207
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Let's begin.

208
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:04,160
It's all right. Let's begin.

209
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,240
Fan Xian.

210
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
Don't be nervous.

211
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,682
- Careful! - Fan Xian!

212
00:18:10,763 --> 00:18:12,227
Are you all right?

213
00:18:13,374 --> 00:18:14,374
I'm fine.

214
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:16,442
I'm fine.

215
00:18:29,718 --> 00:18:31,587
Why aren't you moving?

216
00:18:33,268 --> 00:18:34,522
Do it vertically.

217
00:18:34,998 --> 00:18:36,762
Your hand is steady.

218
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,604
I've only cut fruits before.

219
00:18:38,735 --> 00:18:40,362
It's all right. That's good enough.

220
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:42,238
- Don't be afraid. - I'm not afraid.

221
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,390
I don't know how thick is the human skin and flesh.

222
00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:45,958
I don't know how to cut.

223
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,162
I should've gotten you a pig.

224
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,882
What should I do?

225
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Fan Xian.

226
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:16,402
Continue.

227
00:19:29,945 --> 00:19:31,115
Let's go back.

228
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,000
If he feels sleepy,

229
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,240
ask him to go back to sleep.

230
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,940
Fan Xian saved his life.

231
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,319
How can he sleep?

232
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:54,962
I'm not sleepy.

233
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,988
Mother, will Fan Xian be fine?

234
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,119
This is...

235
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,162
Why is he bleeding so much?

236
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,430
A good person will be helped by Heaven.

237
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,309
Dear, have some tea.

238
00:20:49,903 --> 00:20:51,242
I'm not thirsty.

239
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:54,029
Listen to your own voice.

240
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,162
It's hot.

241
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,400
It's fine.

242
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,119
Dear,

243
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,309
if you are worried, go to the palace to visit him.

244
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:12,519
I can't.

245
00:21:12,717 --> 00:21:14,236
He's your son.

246
00:21:14,317 --> 00:21:15,988
He's in the palace.

247
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,309
I can't enter if no one summons me.

248
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,722
Not even if he's your son?

249
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,442
It's exactly because he is my son

250
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,839
that I can't do that.

251
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,602
There are so many imperial physicians.

252
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:28,005
Why did he ask for Ruo Ruo to treat him?

253
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,922
He'll be fine.

254
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,309
He will surely be fine.

255
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,920
It's hot!

256
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,202
What's going on?

257
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,162
His Majesty's orders.

258
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:55,842
Fan Xian is injured and shouldn't be disturbed.

259
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,824
Crown Prince and the rest should return and come again another day.

260
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:01,442
How is his injury?

261
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:04,282
He has been cut open.

262
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,002
Fan Xian is...

263
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:07,962
Lord Fan

264
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,359
is happy.

265
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:10,869
Happy?

266
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,190
He has been cut open.

267
00:22:12,271 --> 00:22:13,271
Why is he feeling happy?

268
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,309
What is he laughing at?

269
00:22:36,596 --> 00:22:38,238
Chloroform was used.

270
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,722
It is a hallucinating agent.

271
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,762
He is probably hallucinating.

272
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:00,482
Fan Xian, your wound is bleeding.

273
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:04,458
Cure the poison.

274
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,602
Stop the bleeding.

275
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:13,882
Next, sew me up according to how I taught you.

276
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:18,762
Don't be nervous.

277
00:23:18,903 --> 00:23:19,943
I trust you.

278
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,599
All right.

279
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:25,562
Sew him up?

280
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,681
- With what? - A needle.

281
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,920
What threads do you use? Cotton or flax thread?

282
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:32,159
- Mulberry fiber threads. - Mulberry fiber threads?

283
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:34,686
- How do you make it? - Sew the skin and flesh with threads

284
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,255
made from the fiber of the mulberry tree root after removing its bark.

285
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:38,962
Finally, they will grow together.

286
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,279
Just like this.

287
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,950
How do you do that?

288
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:44,402
Let Ruo Ruo focus on treating him.

289
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:46,202
She'll explain about it in detail later.

290
00:23:46,574 --> 00:23:48,642
Yes. I was careless.

291
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,749
Save him first.

292
00:23:58,184 --> 00:23:59,362
Wan Er.

293
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,359
What's wrong? Do you feel unwell?

294
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:11,642
You look prettier

295
00:24:12,607 --> 00:24:13,922
in your usual way.

296
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,390
Library.

297
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:28,540
Ice cream.

298
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,602
Class is over?

299
00:24:30,872 --> 00:24:32,361
Hey, help me

300
00:24:32,655 --> 00:24:35,097
take my attendance later. Let me sleep for a while.

301
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:41,029
That's...

302
00:24:42,926 --> 00:24:44,962
Your Majesty, President Chen requests a meeting.

303
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,642
The class teacher is here.

304
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,882
Your Majesty?

305
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,242
Why are you so fair?

306
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:04,642
What does it mean?

307
00:25:05,023 --> 00:25:06,413
For the win!

308
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:30,959
Your Majesty,

309
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:33,406
we've investigated the background of the three assassins.

310
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,400
Fan Xian is now in Guangxin Palace.

311
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:37,477
He is being cut open now.

312
00:25:38,231 --> 00:25:39,935
If this medical technique can be passed down,

313
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:42,828
it'll be a blessing for the Qing Kingdom.

314
00:25:45,686 --> 00:25:47,555
It's strange.

315
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,359
Without such a serious injury,

316
00:25:50,524 --> 00:25:53,393
Fan Xian won't show this ability of his.

317
00:25:58,214 --> 00:25:59,441
He's the same as his mother.

318
00:26:03,116 --> 00:26:04,437
Do you think

319
00:26:04,518 --> 00:26:06,827
Fan Xian possesses other abilities?

320
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:09,799
If he has any, he will offer them to His Majesty.

321
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:10,911
Is that so?

322
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,740
He would sacrifice his life to save you.

323
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,670
What is more important than his life?

324
00:26:19,294 --> 00:26:20,294
You are right.

325
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:21,407
Come in.

326
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:35,759
Say something.

327
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,029
His condition is more stable.

328
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,722
I didn't sew him up wrongly.

329
00:28:09,678 --> 00:28:10,678
Young Lady Fan,

330
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:13,867
this medical technique can even defeat spirits and deities.

331
00:28:14,437 --> 00:28:15,517
Forgive me for being blunt,

332
00:28:15,597 --> 00:28:19,188
but I hope you can teach this incredible technique

333
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:21,199
for the sake of the people of the Qing Kingdom.

334
00:28:23,573 --> 00:28:24,773
I will ask him

335
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:26,398
when Fan Xian wakes up.

336
00:28:29,054 --> 00:28:30,496
I'll wake him up now.

337
00:28:30,983 --> 00:28:33,023
Do you think it's right to do that with his injury?

338
00:28:33,836 --> 00:28:35,569
I'm sorry.

339
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,602
Look how muddled I am.

340
00:28:37,773 --> 00:28:39,853
I'm only thinking about the medical technique.

341
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:41,563
Enough. Keep the things.

342
00:28:41,813 --> 00:28:43,964
- Sure. - Let Fan Xian rest well.

343
00:28:44,574 --> 00:28:45,842
Here you go.

344
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,200
- Let Lord Fan rest well. - Go.

345
00:28:50,327 --> 00:28:52,920
I'll deliver the medicine tomorrow.

346
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:54,167
What's there to learn?

347
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:03,760
Your lips.

348
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:11,882
I was nervous and bit my lip.

349
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,280
Me too.

350
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,549
The surgery is over,

351
00:29:22,038 --> 00:29:23,562
but I'm just starting to feel afraid.

352
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:12,359
Dear, urgent report from the palace.

353
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,559
Fan Xian's condition is stable. He is no longer in a critical condition.

354
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,879
As expected.

355
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,520
Look how panicked you are.

356
00:30:30,636 --> 00:30:31,957
I've told you

357
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,347
that we must be steady

358
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,509
when we do things.

359
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,520
Everything's fine now.

360
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,829
The most difficult obstacle

361
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
is over.

362
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:46,480
Dear, I should visit him in the palace.

363
00:30:46,561 --> 00:30:47,884
How can he have no one to take care of him?

364
00:30:47,908 --> 00:30:50,303
Since Ruo Ruo and Wan Er are there, it won't make a difference.

365
00:30:50,327 --> 00:30:51,327
No.

366
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:54,509
Why not?

367
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:57,518
Fan Xian bowed to me during his wedding.

368
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:59,150
I am his mother.

369
00:31:45,214 --> 00:31:47,524
Wan Er and Ruo Ruo are resting at the side palace.

370
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:49,799
I asked them

371
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:51,922
not to look after you by your side.

372
00:31:52,089 --> 00:31:53,599
It was tough for them.

373
00:31:53,718 --> 00:31:55,198
What a coincidence that you are here.

374
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,282
I just woke up.

375
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,749
What's the effect of chloroform?

376
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,442
The Third Bureau

377
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,870
already gave me the right answer.

378
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,719
I came after calculating the right time.

379
00:32:10,158 --> 00:32:11,561
How do you feel now?

380
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,002
It hurts.

381
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,279
What else?

382
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,082
My internal energy is gone.

383
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,082
Your meridians are a mess

384
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,122
and your internal energy has dispersed.

385
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,400
Luckily,

386
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,039
your life is saved.

387
00:32:44,144 --> 00:32:45,376
Can my internal energy be recovered?

388
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,282
Ku He's unique technique,

389
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:48,638
Heaven's Path,

390
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,082
apparently has the ability

391
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,800
to restore one's foundation.

392
00:32:53,881 --> 00:32:56,201
- Can it be taught to someone outside the clan? - Never.

393
00:32:59,296 --> 00:33:00,962
It gives me hope at least.

394
00:33:04,466 --> 00:33:07,026
There's a result regarding the assassination at Xuankong Temple.

395
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:08,561
His Majesty said

396
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,522
you must be informed immediately.

397
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,589
I need to listen to this.

398
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:19,319
One.

399
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,562
The guard was

400
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,382
a Hu person outside the border.

401
00:33:23,406 --> 00:33:25,567
- He didn't seem like one. - He has Qing's blood.

402
00:33:26,155 --> 00:33:27,295
His face cannot be distinguished.

403
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:28,775
How did he become a guard at the palace?

404
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,910
When the Qing Kingdom battled the Hu people,

405
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,870
Qing had the advantage. The Hu people sent a team to the capital

406
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,519
to surrender.

407
00:33:36,646 --> 00:33:37,807
It failed.

408
00:33:38,168 --> 00:33:39,808
The Qing Kingdom wins a majestic victory,

409
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:41,560
and the Hu people left the border.

410
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,679
That man stayed in the capital since then.

411
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,093
Time passed,

412
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:48,442
and he became a guard in the palace for some reason.

413
00:33:48,523 --> 00:33:50,176
Who handled the procedure of his entry to the palace?

414
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,719
That man is already dead. It is a mystery.

415
00:33:52,817 --> 00:33:54,095
He didn't act for so many years.

416
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,242
He didn't get a chance.

417
00:33:55,396 --> 00:33:58,598
There are too many guards. It's difficult to get close to His Majesty.

418
00:33:58,696 --> 00:33:59,792
It was a coincidence this time.

419
00:33:59,816 --> 00:34:00,897
What about the eunuch?

420
00:34:03,173 --> 00:34:05,817
- He is closely related to you. - I don't know him.

421
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,509
Your mother's death back then

422
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:10,559
caused a massacre in the capital.

423
00:34:10,662 --> 00:34:14,093
Every person involved was killed by the Black Cavalry in one night.

424
00:34:14,254 --> 00:34:17,085
The eunuch is a descendant of Duke Wang from back then.

425
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,479
He was rescued by a servant

426
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,590
and returned to the capital after he grew up.

427
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,829
He castrated himself to become a eunuch.

428
00:34:23,016 --> 00:34:24,122
Just to get revenge?

429
00:34:31,777 --> 00:34:33,002
A grudge

430
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:35,150
is the most stubborn force.

431
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:38,402
It grows in a person's heart

432
00:34:38,926 --> 00:34:40,682
and grows stronger as time passes.

433
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,479
In the end, it becomes

434
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,749
the only theme

435
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,442
in one's life.

436
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,240
It sounds like

437
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,949
you resonate with this.

438
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,829
I'm just analyzing

439
00:34:55,062 --> 00:34:57,058
the assassins' thoughts.

440
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:59,042
How was the dagger hidden?

441
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,350
Three years ago, he was in charge of cleaning Xuankong Temple.

442
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,829
He hid the dagger back then

443
00:35:04,998 --> 00:35:06,719
and finally had the time to use it.

444
00:35:06,893 --> 00:35:08,373
What about the white-robed swordsman?

445
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,482
His Majesty has a good eye.

446
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,720
This man is Si Gu Jian's younger brother.

447
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,200
Was it really Si Gu Jian this time?

448
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:18,269
It was not Si Gu Jian this time.

449
00:35:18,431 --> 00:35:20,141
Si Gu Jian killed everyone

450
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,959
except his younger brother.

451
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:24,406
The only person who wants to kill Si Gu Jian in this world

452
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,280
is his brother.

453
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,110
Do the three of them know each other?

454
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,282
They don't.

455
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,400
There are no connections.

456
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,760
They worked well together.

457
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,131
It was a coincidence. There were no discussions and no conspiracies.

458
00:35:38,155 --> 00:35:39,719
The three of them don't know each other

459
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,162
and took turns to assassinate.

460
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,869
They began plotting at the same time

461
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,979
and ended in an assassination.

462
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:47,101
This is a scheme of God.

463
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,122
It cannot be predicted

464
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,359
and cannot be replicated.

465
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,710
A scheme of God.

466
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,162
Such a coincidental

467
00:35:55,335 --> 00:35:57,484
and perfect scheme

468
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:59,922
cannot be planned by a normal person.

469
00:36:00,455 --> 00:36:01,937
A normal person can't plan it,

470
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,040
but you can.

471
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,510
You can't say that.

472
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,909
I'm not that great.

473
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,079
Even if I am...

474
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,082
The one who stabbed me was Shadow.

475
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,949
I've seen Shadow fight.

476
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,602
When he used his sword,

477
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,522
it was hard to predict.

478
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,359
Without using his sword,

479
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,640
his flaws appear.

480
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,070
A scheme of God?

481
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,359
Is God

482
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,469
sitting in a wheelchair?

483
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,949
Stop looking around. I just woke up.

484
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:15,200
I couldn't hide anyone here.

485
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,842
Only the two of us are here.

486
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,429
You are too reckless.

487
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,282
You have no internal energy

488
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,962
and you are seriously injured.

489
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:29,070
If I really set up the trap,

490
00:37:37,102 --> 00:37:38,425
what can you do?

491
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,642
Was it you?

492
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,999
I only sent Shadow.

493
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,562
The rest

494
00:37:44,023 --> 00:37:45,322
was all an accident.

495
00:37:45,446 --> 00:37:46,686
You wanted to kill me?

496
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:47,879
Not me.

497
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,879
Shadow has always wanted to fight Wu Zhu but he didn't get a chance.

498
00:37:50,966 --> 00:37:53,395
You are Wu Zhu's disciple so he doesn't mind fighting you.

499
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:56,095
That attack was an accident.

500
00:37:57,126 --> 00:37:59,077
You suddenly lost your internal energy.

501
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:01,442
He could not stop in time.

502
00:38:04,142 --> 00:38:05,932
It was an accident, right?

503
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,802
It was definitely an accident.

504
00:38:23,588 --> 00:38:25,122
You were trying to kill His Majesty?

505
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:28,602
His Majesty trusts me.

506
00:38:29,144 --> 00:38:31,438
- There was no reason for me to kill him. - I have to ask you why.

507
00:38:31,462 --> 00:38:33,743
What is the most important thing about being an official?

508
00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:35,318
Loyalty.

509
00:38:35,832 --> 00:38:37,392
Helping His Majesty solve his problems.

510
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,190
Let me think about this.

511
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:43,229
Assassinating His Majesty

512
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:44,796
is helping him solve his problem?

513
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:47,400
Does His Majesty have a death wish?

514
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:48,807
Do you still remember the fire?

515
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,320
Hurry! Put out the fire!

516
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,079
Hurry! Move faster!

517
00:38:52,174 --> 00:38:53,482
We can find the background

518
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:54,840
of the three assassins,

519
00:38:54,972 --> 00:38:57,806
but the fire cannot be traced

520
00:38:57,887 --> 00:39:00,127
after everyone in the Overwatch Council investigated it.

521
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,869
More interestingly, when the result was reported,

522
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,122
His Majesty did not question it

523
00:39:05,221 --> 00:39:06,652
and let it go.

524
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,119
His Majesty set the fire?

525
00:39:08,247 --> 00:39:10,397
His Majesty never makes any move without a purpose.

526
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:12,482
The fire was not enough.

527
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:14,638
That was why Shadow had to stab him.

528
00:39:14,734 --> 00:39:16,014
What do you mean not enough?

529
00:39:17,749 --> 00:39:19,580
There was a fire and an assassination.

530
00:39:20,269 --> 00:39:21,882
What is the result he wished for?

531
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,042
The assassination of Xuankong Temple

532
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:26,949
shocks everyone.

533
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,082
Someone must take responsibility

534
00:39:29,222 --> 00:39:30,613
for this.

535
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,120
That is the result.

536
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,999
- Gong Dian? - The commander of the palace guards

537
00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:06,241
failed to protect His Majesty.

538
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:08,013
His crime deserves death.

539
00:40:16,741 --> 00:40:18,202
Take care, Your Majesty!

540
00:40:18,638 --> 00:40:19,638
I am

541
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,002
leaving!

542
00:40:26,071 --> 00:40:27,111
Gong Dian is killed?

543
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,522
Sent away from the capital

544
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,162
and banished to Dingzhou.

545
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,002
He was sent to the border army.

546
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:40,638
I don't get it.

547
00:40:40,727 --> 00:40:41,967
His Majesty did so many things

548
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,842
just to get rid of Gong Dian?

549
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,670
He is Ye Zhong's junior.

550
00:40:46,229 --> 00:40:47,229
Ye Zhong

551
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,749
sent eight reports to apologize.

552
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,842
His result is the same as Gong Dian.

553
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,919
He was banished to Dingzhou last night

554
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,239
to join the border army.

555
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,869
The Ye family fell.

556
00:40:57,134 --> 00:40:58,725
That's what His Majesty wants.

557
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,562
That's not right.

558
00:41:00,943 --> 00:41:02,932
Ye Liu Yun is also from the Ye family.

559
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:04,886
Why does he need to offend the grandmaster?

560
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:07,740
Only His Majesty knows what he is thinking about.

561
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,882
One last question.

562
00:41:11,066 --> 00:41:14,292
Does His Majesty know that Shadow is Si Gu Jian's younger brother?

563
00:41:14,386 --> 00:41:16,426
No. His Majesty has ordered for him to be captured.

564
00:41:16,496 --> 00:41:17,870
How is it different from an assassination?

565
00:41:17,894 --> 00:41:19,522
For His Majesty's benefit,

566
00:41:19,819 --> 00:41:22,422
I don't mind giving His Majesty a shock.

567
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:23,936
You don't sound like a loyal official.

568
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,120
The result is more important.

569
00:41:25,165 --> 00:41:26,716
What if His Majesty got stabbed?

570
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:30,510
His Majesty won't die.

571
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,429
No one truly knows His Majesty's trump card.

572
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,950
Should I tell His Majesty about Shadow's identity?

573
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:43,551
- You can keep it a secret. - You shouldn't admit to it then.

574
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,240
You said

575
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,282
the assassin was Shadow.

576
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,389
You should keep this in your heart

577
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:55,680
and not ask me about it.

578
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,920
Yes.

579
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,261
If you set this all up,

580
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,119
I'd be dead when I asked the question.

581
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:03,400
Why did you still ask?

582
00:42:03,503 --> 00:42:05,959
I wouldn't ask if this is someone else.

583
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:08,070
I wouldn't answer as well if someone else asked.

584
00:42:12,142 --> 00:42:14,173
The assassination scheme of Xuankong Temple.

585
00:42:14,262 --> 00:42:15,613
That's the truth.

586
00:42:20,653 --> 00:42:21,933
Recuperate well.

587
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,540
What did Chen Ping Ping tell you?

588
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,079
Your Majesty,

589
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,879
he told me

590
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,962
the identity of the three assassins.

591
00:42:51,246 --> 00:42:52,246
What else?

592
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,670
He also told me

593
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,759
that you might be the one who set the fire.
