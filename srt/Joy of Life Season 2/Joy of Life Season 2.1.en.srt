00:01:31,043 --> 00:01:34,002
(Episode 1)

3
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,971
Professor Ye, I have revised my paper again.

4
00:01:54,055 --> 00:01:55,402
I know you don't like reading electronic versions.

5
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:56,762
Leave it there, I'll take a look.

6
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:00,513
Professor Ye.

7
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:01,870
Is Fan Xian dead?

8
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:03,922
(Professor Ye, University Professor)

9
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,120
Professor Ye, you have to go to the academic exchange tomorrow.

10
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,722
You can't keep skipping it.

11
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,682
Got it, thank you.

12
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:37,497
By the way, Professor Ye, is Fan Xian truly dead?

13
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:11,638
How can I help you?

14
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:14,489
Professor Ye, is Fan Xian really dead?

15
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:27,202
Have you finished your paper?

16
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,442
Not yet, I'm still working on it.

17
00:03:34,657 --> 00:03:36,592
- Professor Ye. - I don't know!

18
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,951
What do you not know?

19
00:03:43,446 --> 00:03:44,566
Zhang Qing?

20
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:45,888
It's me.

21
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,762
You finally showed up.

22
00:03:48,212 --> 00:03:49,312
What's with me?

23
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:52,042
Is Fan Xian dead or not?

24
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:55,922
Since you stopped updating, everyone keeps asking me the same question.

25
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:57,569
What happened to Fan Xian lying there?

26
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,720
Is he dead or not?

27
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,122
If he's not dead, what should he do next?

28
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:02,562
I've drafted it.

29
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,682
You're the first person I want to show.

30
00:04:08,312 --> 00:04:09,412
I remember,

31
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:11,162
before you stopped updating,

32
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,129
Fan Xian was stabbed.

33
00:04:13,215 --> 00:04:15,341
- Yan Bing Yun. - So, is he dead?

34
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,350
Professor Ye, the library is about to close.

35
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:38,075
(Joy of Life Season 2)

36
00:04:45,964 --> 00:04:47,419
You've thought about it all night.

37
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,522
What's your choice?

38
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,842
It's not about what I choose.

39
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,282
It's your turn to choose.

40
00:04:54,535 --> 00:04:55,882
Ask yourself.

41
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,442
Are you sure you can kill me here?

42
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:04,248
Lord Fan!

43
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:06,082
(Fan Xian)

44
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:17,322
This is my decision.

45
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:34,002
(So, is Fan Xian alive or dead?)

46
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:36,482
(How can the protagonist die here?)

47
00:05:36,823 --> 00:05:38,386
Your Majesty!

48
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,282
Your Majesty, something terrible happened!

49
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,362
Your Majesty, Fan Xian is dead!

50
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:50,602
Your Majesty!

51
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,002
Something terrible happened!

52
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:21,751
President!

53
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,999
- President! - Quick, don't bother about me.

54
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:27,369
Gather all members of the Overwatch Council.

55
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,779
- Hurry up. - Yes, sir.

56
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,960
Go quickly!

57
00:06:43,576 --> 00:06:47,802
(Fan Xian has passed away.)

58
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:53,322
The envoy sent a message back.

59
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,042
Fan Xian fell ill and passed away on the way back to the capital.

60
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:02,000
His body has already been cremated.

61
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,489
Summon Chen Ping Ping!

62
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:18,202
What's happening?

63
00:07:18,452 --> 00:07:21,122
- What's going on? - I have no idea.

64
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:27,082
What happened?

65
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:31,462
President, what happened?

66
00:07:33,615 --> 00:07:35,576
(Chen Ping Ping, President of the Overwatch Council)

67
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,122
Fan Xian is dead.

68
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:38,776
(Yan Ruo Hai, Head of the Fourth Bureau of the Overwatch Council)

69
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,602
All hell is going to break loose.

70
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,202
Stay here.

71
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:43,802
Wait for my news.

72
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:51,842
(Fan Jian, Minister of Revenue)

73
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:15,004
Where is my son's body?

74
00:09:15,926 --> 00:09:17,026
I don't know.

75
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:19,002
You don't know?

76
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:22,362
How dare you say you don't know!

77
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,416
You were the ones who made him take over the Overwatch Council!

78
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,282
You were the ones who forced him to go on a mission to Northern Qi!

79
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,722
You were also the ones

80
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,562
who withdrew the Black Cavalry

81
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,442
and made him risk his life!

82
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,282
Now he's dead,

83
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,371
and all you can say

84
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,442
is

85
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,162
You don't know?

86
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,621
You don't want him,

87
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,683
but I do!

88
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,949
I want to take my son home!

89
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,482
Give me back my son!

90
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:08,402
I've hidden him all his life.

91
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,602
I can't let him die for no apparent reason!

92
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:17,282
He was a human being,

93
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,602
not a chess piece.

94
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,271
I'll give my life for his.

95
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,671
Fine, then die now!

96
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,899
I can't.

97
00:10:30,707 --> 00:10:31,807
What?

98
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:33,682
Are you afraid of death?

99
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,842
One life

100
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:40,922
is too little.

101
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,202
Before I die, I must

102
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,842
ensure justice is served.

103
00:10:50,104 --> 00:10:51,682
Those who owe him their lives,

104
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,922
I'll take them all with me.

105
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,988
Sirs, please stop arguing here.

106
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,340
Where is His Majesty?

107
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,480
His Majesty will not see you.

108
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:15,856
Wasn't it His Majesty who summoned me?

109
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:17,162
Yes.

110
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,442
Upon hearing of Fan Xian's death, His Majesty was in extreme sorrow

111
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:24,360
and so he urgently summoned President Chen.

112
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:26,122
What about now?

113
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:27,331
Now,

114
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,362
after reading a second pigeon post,

115
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,282
His Majesty fell silent.

116
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,442
He refused to see anyone.

117
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:36,922
Second post?

118
00:11:46,077 --> 00:11:47,922
(Second Prince's Residence)

119
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,482
(Li Cheng Ze, Second Prince)

120
00:12:09,657 --> 00:12:10,997
Your Highness!

121
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:13,057
(Fan Wu Jiu, Prince Cheng Ze's Guard)

122
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:27,402
Top secret.

123
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,042
It's Xie Bi An's pigeon,

124
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,482
news about Fan Xian.

125
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,700
Read it for me.

126
00:12:31,853 --> 00:12:33,353
- This... - It's okay.

127
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,580
I trust you.

128
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,562
His Majesty ordered me to pass this to you.

129
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,682
Yan Bing Yun?

130
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:52,785
(Yan Bing Yun stabbed Lord Fan from behind, causing his immediate death.)

131
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,731
He's from the Overwatch Council.

132
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:26,682
I didn't expect

133
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,802
Fan Xian to die like this.

134
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,938
Fan Xian opposed the prince.

135
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,079
It will surely cause chaos in Qing.

136
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:36,522
I had no personal grudge against him.

137
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,640
I killed him for the sake of the Qing Kingdom.

138
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,040
For the sake of the Qing Kingdom?

139
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,882
Then why cremate him?

140
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,362
Fei Jie is his master.

141
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:46,936
Mr. Fei's medical skills are as good as his poison skills.

142
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,322
Once Fan Xian dies, he will surely conduct an autopsy.

143
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,380
There's no way we can hide the fact that he died from a sword wound.

144
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,922
But without a body,

145
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,162
how will you explain it to the world?

146
00:13:56,307 --> 00:13:57,947
Just say he died of severe illness

147
00:13:59,408 --> 00:14:01,242
due to acclimatization.

148
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,799
Xie Bi An said Fan Xian was dead.

149
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,082
The body has been cremated.

150
00:14:12,673 --> 00:14:14,122
Xie Bi An killed him?

151
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,180
No.

152
00:14:16,424 --> 00:14:19,104
Yan Bing Yun stabbed him from behind and succeeded in the ambush.

153
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,722
Yan Bing Yun killed Fan Xian?

154
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,162
The body was indeed burned.

155
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,259
Why?

156
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,962
You don't trust me?

157
00:14:47,356 --> 00:14:48,456
No.

158
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,490
I just wanted to

159
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,162
keep something as a memento.

160
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:03,200
How could it be Yan Bing Yun?

161
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,759
You think it doesn't make sense too?

162
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:08,082
Yan Bing Yun always puts the Qing Kingdom first.

163
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,762
He values the law above all.

164
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,599
Given Fan Xian's status,

165
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,122
no matter what happened,

166
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,002
Yan Bing Yun should have brought him back to the capital for trial.

167
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,002
How could he have killed him?

168
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:23,242
Even the Tiger Guards' message doesn't add up.

169
00:15:23,688 --> 00:15:24,962
That's right.

170
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,402
The Tiger Guards were ordered by His Majesty to protect Fan Xian.

171
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,402
If Yan Bing Yun had really killed him, Gao Da would have apprehended him.

172
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:37,322
How could he possibly send back such news?

173
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,642
Is there something wrong with the news?

174
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:54,282
Could it be

175
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,482
a fake death?

176
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,379
That's possible.

177
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,082
Why would this kid fake his death?

178
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:04,642
Why do you think he did this?

179
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,682
The reason doesn't matter anymore.

180
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,362
At this moment, Fan Xian

181
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,809
is beyond redemption.

182
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,180
His Majesty?

183
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,849
This is treason.

184
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:26,242
No, Fan Xian would never die so easily.

185
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:28,663
But this is indeed Xie Bi An's handwriting.

186
00:16:28,743 --> 00:16:30,642
What would I do if I were Fan Xian?

187
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:34,042
Fake my death and escape.

188
00:16:35,156 --> 00:16:36,236
Where would he go?

189
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:37,682
Naturally, the capital.

190
00:16:37,853 --> 00:16:39,722
He values relationships deeply.

191
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:41,936
He wants to deceive everyone and hide his tracks.

192
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,994
Unfortunately,

193
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:45,282
even if he turns to ashes, I could still recognize him.

194
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:47,922
What is this?

195
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,322
Fan Xian's ashes.

196
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,211
- Where are you going? - To see His Majesty and beg for mercy.

197
00:16:54,235 --> 00:16:56,835
He refused to see us just now. Going again won't change anything.

198
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:00,762
What should I do then?

199
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,722
Suppress news of his death.

200
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:08,122
Don't let it spread.

201
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:09,482
Quite the opposite.

202
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:11,842
Make it big.

203
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,082
Fan Xian's death must have value.

204
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,329
Why is Your Highness so certain Fan Xian isn't dead?

205
00:17:19,446 --> 00:17:20,566
Wu Jiu.

206
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:22,242
Have I ever misjudged someone?

207
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,882
But he was killed and cremated in front of them.

208
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,772
How did he escape?

209
00:17:28,853 --> 00:17:29,879
I have no idea.

210
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,162
It's unpredictable.

211
00:17:31,672 --> 00:17:33,042
That's why it's a surprise.

212
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,442
That's what makes Fan Xian remarkable.

213
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:05,478
Take it back.

214
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,322
Let me look at this sword.

215
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,145
(Wang Qi Nian, Overwatch Council's Clerk)

216
00:18:15,105 --> 00:18:16,442
Where did the blood come from?

217
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:19,538
We can't let it die in vain.

218
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,591
Sir, try it.

219
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,769
- Chicken blood. - Chicken blood?

220
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,562
You foresaw this and anticipated this would happen?

221
00:18:29,888 --> 00:18:32,080
- I have good connections. - What do you mean?

222
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,322
Before I left the capital,

223
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,684
my senior from the Third Bureau gave me a lot of goodies.

224
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,619
Wait up!

225
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,800
Wait up!

226
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,482
Wait up, Fan Xian!

227
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,402
Fan Xian, come with me.

228
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,522
Come on.

229
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,106
What's wrong?

230
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:53,882
You two, stay on guard here.

231
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,722
What were you thinking?

232
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,304
Here, take it. I have something important for you.

233
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,282
- This is... - Look.

234
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,242
Fun, isn't it?

235
00:19:13,743 --> 00:19:15,722
This head goes in here, and exits here.

236
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,160
There's a blood bag inside.

237
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,680
You can control the amount of blood.

238
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,300
Interesting.

239
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,242
In enemy territory, danger is everywhere.

240
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:25,922
If necessary, you can fake your death.

241
00:19:36,398 --> 00:19:38,002
Who would have thought that

242
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,530
what we didn't use in Northern Qi would be used on our own people?

243
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,122
You haven't cleaned your face yet.

244
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,602
He did it on purpose to look like he was working hard.

245
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:47,117
It wasn't hard at all.

246
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,199
I am more than willing to serve you.

247
00:19:50,286 --> 00:19:52,537
I will risk my life for you.

248
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,322
Only you could come up with this.

249
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,842
You even prepared a fire.

250
00:19:57,294 --> 00:19:58,295
We had to burn it.

251
00:19:58,376 --> 00:20:00,336
Xie Bi An would definitely inspect it thoroughly.

252
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,490
It's all thanks to Qi Nian.

253
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,322
He had to dig a tunnel underneath and wait for me there.

254
00:20:06,403 --> 00:20:08,242
I'm here to pick you up.

255
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,802
It's such an honor.

256
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,082
That ashes...

257
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,762
Where did it come from?

258
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:16,082
You may not know,

259
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,402
but our envoy carried two carts of food on this trip.

260
00:20:20,524 --> 00:20:24,214
I found half a dried pork among them.

261
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,519
After burning this pork,

262
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,610
the size of the head matched yours.

263
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,240
My Lord, I was wrong.

264
00:20:30,321 --> 00:20:31,892
I shouldn't compare you to a pig.

265
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,599
No, that's not what I meant.

266
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,479
My Lord, if you're angry, you can kick me.

267
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,122
- Here. - Enough.

268
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:39,925
You're not as good at acting as Young Master Yan.

269
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:42,042
How can I compare to Young Master Yan?

270
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:45,019
Young Master Yan's acting was so real.

271
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,082
As a matter of fact,

272
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,882
there are still flaws.

273
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,442
What flaw?

274
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:54,002
If we want to burn a body to ash,

275
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,457
we can't do it in such a short time at that temperature.

276
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:57,962
But I thought about it. Xie Bi An is a swordsman.

277
00:20:58,141 --> 00:20:59,528
He probably isn't an expert in burning bodies.

278
00:20:59,552 --> 00:21:00,652
He wouldn't think of it.

279
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,799
Are you an expert at burning people?

280
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,679
He is skilled at burning anything.

281
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:09,129
I learned to roast chicken from him.

282
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:12,042
He is talented and wise.

283
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,322
He's proficient in everything.

284
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:15,770
It rhymes.

285
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:19,327
What's next?

286
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:20,548
What's the plan?

287
00:21:22,117 --> 00:21:24,546
If Teng Zi Jing's wife and kid, Fan Si Zhe,

288
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,522
and my teacher

289
00:21:27,582 --> 00:21:29,337
are all controlled by Li Cheng Ze,

290
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:30,842
I'm worried about them.

291
00:21:31,262 --> 00:21:32,562
You want to save them?

292
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,799
The convoy will move slowly.

293
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,200
I'll return to the capital first.

294
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:38,442
You're quite bold.

295
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,722
Can I ask you something?

296
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,562
What is it about?

297
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,569
Why did you choose to stand by me?

298
00:21:48,353 --> 00:21:50,553
Aren't you afraid of causing chaos in the Qing Kingdom?

299
00:21:54,641 --> 00:21:56,723
The Overwatch Council never bows to threats.

300
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:59,602
Our actions are always for the Qing Kingdom.

301
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,362
Li Cheng Ze is the prince of the Qing Kingdom.

302
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,882
As a prince,

303
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:07,402
he colludes with Northern Qi

304
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,882
and amasses wealth secretly.

305
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,362
His intentions are treacherous.

306
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,319
I am loyal to the Qing Kingdom

307
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,162
and His Majesty.

308
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,122
As for the prince...

309
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,320
- Wang Qi Nian. - Yes, My Lord.

310
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,442
Send a plaque to Young Master Yan.

311
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,722
What should it say on the plague?

312
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,042
Guardian of Qing.

313
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,619
Nice plaque.

314
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,479
- Master, have you heard about Fan Xian? - Yes.

315
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,439
Don't panic. It might just be a false rumor from far away.

316
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,242
We must remain calm.

317
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,802
I've already reprimanded them.

318
00:23:28,013 --> 00:23:30,675
The news isn't confirmed, yet they wanted to prepare for the funeral.

319
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:31,962
Isn't this ridiculous?

320
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:33,906
Do not stop the preparations for the funeral.

321
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,030
What?

322
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,198
Do what's necessary.

323
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:38,962
Continue as if he truly died.

324
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,522
Master, you must not take it seriously.

325
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,322
Xian is so young.

326
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,104
I don't believe he would just pass away.

327
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:47,667
Do as I tell you.

328
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:51,399
There's something suspicious about his death?

329
00:23:53,775 --> 00:23:55,138
Mourn deeply.

330
00:23:55,524 --> 00:23:56,642
I understand.

331
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,660
Right,

332
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,682
go check on Ruo Ruo.

333
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,518
She cared for Fan Xian the most.

334
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,042
I'm afraid she'll be devastated and get sick again.

335
00:24:06,543 --> 00:24:08,482
Ruo Ruo has always respected Fan Xian.

336
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,522
She must be crying terribly now.

337
00:24:19,403 --> 00:24:20,842
(Fan Ruo Ruo, Fan Jian's Daughter)

338
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:25,913
Hello, Aunt.

339
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,279
The freshly stewed gelatin and longan soup is very nourishing.

340
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,282
Remember to drink it later.

341
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,882
Ruo Ruo, what are you doing?

342
00:24:35,322 --> 00:24:37,522
I don't know what Fan Si Zhe is busy with every day.

343
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:40,559
He's not managing the bookstore, and the storeroom is damp and smelly.

344
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,961
I couldn't stand it, so I took the books out to air them.

345
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,882
Haven't you heard the news?

346
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,122
My brother's death? I've heard about it.

347
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,310
Then...

348
00:24:49,183 --> 00:24:50,359
Don't worry, Aunt.

349
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:51,559
Don't be sad.

350
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,682
Don't grieve too much either.

351
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,842
How come you're comforting me instead?

352
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,362
Because my brother isn't dead.

353
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,310
Did your father just visit you?

354
00:24:59,427 --> 00:25:00,527
No.

355
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,113
Why are you so certain your brother isn't dead?

356
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,644
Because my brother won't die.

357
00:25:04,725 --> 00:25:06,164
Everyone dies eventually.

358
00:25:06,245 --> 00:25:07,922
Yes, but my brother won't.

359
00:25:08,036 --> 00:25:09,077
Why?

360
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,497
Because I believe in him.

361
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:13,042
Ruo Ruo, do you really think so?

362
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,269
Yes.

363
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,842
Then I'm relieved.

364
00:25:16,145 --> 00:25:19,547
But Ruo Ruo, isn't your belief in your brother considered a blind faith?

365
00:25:25,605 --> 00:25:27,023
(Capital of the Qing Kingdom)

366
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:28,159
Qi Nian.

367
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,511
We're back in your turf.

368
00:25:29,592 --> 00:25:30,753
You have to look out for me.

369
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,490
You may not know,

370
00:25:32,571 --> 00:25:33,871
but ever since I worked for you,

371
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,307
my turf has been taken over by newcomers.

372
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:39,171
I'm worried we'd encounter some acquaintance who would recognize us.

373
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:44,770
Someone is indeed copying my old business of selling maps.

374
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,922
There's market demand.

375
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,500
What market?

376
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,360
Four taels!

377
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,279
Now they're auctioning maps.

378
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:54,869
- Four taels! - Five taels!

379
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,882
- Five taels! - Five taels?

380
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:58,909
No, let me see it.

381
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,552
What does a five-tael map look like?

382
00:26:05,365 --> 00:26:06,465
That's it?

383
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,109
It's too easy to cheat money now.

384
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,498
Don't cause trouble.

385
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:12,802
This is infuriating.

386
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:17,842
Go away!

387
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:21,606
What's happening? Everyone is praying here.

388
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,242
Let's pay our respects too.

389
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:29,002
Come on, get in line for incense.

390
00:26:29,632 --> 00:26:30,962
Give me some incense too.

391
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,199
Take it.

392
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,202
Line up for incense and pray.

393
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:38,136
There is a funeral outside the city gate and no one cares about it.

394
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,042
And everyone is praying here.

395
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,682
This family has significant influence.

396
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,082
Indeed.

397
00:26:46,031 --> 00:26:50,522
Though times change and events differ, my poetry has never been surpassed.

398
00:26:50,787 --> 00:26:52,268
Throughout the ages,

399
00:26:52,357 --> 00:26:55,282
the sorrowful have always been left with unfulfilled regrets.

400
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,759
These lines don't connect.

401
00:26:57,847 --> 00:26:58,947
Indeed.

402
00:26:59,177 --> 00:27:01,162
This is quite arrogant.

403
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,145
With you here, who dares claim their poetry is unsurpassable?

404
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,322
Don't speak ill of the dead.

405
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,719
The sorrowful have been left with unfulfilled regrets.

406
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,809
This is a sentimental scholar.

407
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,482
Do we have such a person in the capital?

408
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,042
I'll go over and have a look.

409
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:24,663
Though times change and events differ, my poetry has never been surpassed.

410
00:27:25,612 --> 00:27:28,562
The memorial tablet of Fan An Zhi, the backbone of the Qing Kingdom?

411
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,682
Also surnamed Fan. Who is Fan An Zhi?

412
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,122
It's me.

413
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,842
My Lord, your courtesy name is An Zhi?

414
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:38,602
Could it be someone with the same name?

415
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,002
Come on. Line up and follow me.

416
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,922
Everyone, please take a look here.

417
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,522
There is something special here.

418
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:49,022
When Lord Fan Xian first arrived in the capital,

419
00:27:49,116 --> 00:27:51,800
he got off his horse here and mourned the past by the roadside.

420
00:27:51,881 --> 00:27:53,522
You came by carriage?

421
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:57,242
Later, he met his beloved and formed a beautiful story.

422
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,290
Everyone, with the spring exams approaching,

423
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:05,089
praying here can ensure academic success and bless marriages.

424
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,126
Hurry up!

425
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:09,082
If you don't pray, how will you get married?

426
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:11,642
This will bless marriages?

427
00:28:11,888 --> 00:28:13,852
My Lord, calm down.

428
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:14,959
I'll tear it down.

429
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,560
Don't. It's your own memorial tablet.

430
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,279
Smashing it brings bad luck.

431
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:21,522
- What nonsense is this? - I don't know either.

432
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:29,002
(The memorial tablet of Fan An Zhi)

433
00:28:30,927 --> 00:28:32,842
This is livelier than Lunar New Year.

434
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,082
As expected of me.

435
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,239
Take a look.

436
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,535
Gather around, please take a look.

437
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:41,242
Lord Fan Xian once drank wine and tea and recited poems here.

438
00:28:41,324 --> 00:28:42,884
Come on, there are only 10 copies left.

439
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,136
- It's a limited offer. - Have you really been here?

440
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,762
It's a limited offer.

441
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,160
Lord Fan's handwritten fan, an out-of-print relic.

442
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,562
The handwriting is decent.

443
00:28:51,752 --> 00:28:52,842
Hamburger.

444
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,482
Lord Fan's original hamburger.

445
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:57,409
Hamburger.

446
00:28:58,288 --> 00:29:00,219
The man is full.

447
00:29:00,368 --> 00:29:03,328
Guest, Lord Fan has the same sachet, would you like one?

448
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:04,759
It smells like a five-spice duck.

449
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:06,024
What's the matter with you?

450
00:29:06,105 --> 00:29:08,295
Why would Lord Fan's sachet smell like a five-spice duck?

451
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,793
Sir, how about a collection of Lord Fan's poems?

452
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,082
If you don't want this, there's something better.

453
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,759
The final chapter of "Dream of the Red Chamber".

454
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:16,840
The ending is out?

455
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,815
What ending? The ending of "Dream of the Red Chamber" isn't written yet.

456
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,935
- Who are you fooling? - Unfinished? You...

457
00:29:21,016 --> 00:29:23,210
It's unfinished.

458
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:25,279
You look so poor! I bet you can't afford it.

459
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,442
Lord Fan's personally crafted poison.

460
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,840
It can kill all snakes, insects, rats and ants.

461
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,239
Don't sell poison.

462
00:29:32,326 --> 00:29:33,682
Don't sell Fan's poison.

463
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:38,052
Fresh yogurt!

464
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,290
It's delicious and flavorful, with many varieties.

465
00:29:40,371 --> 00:29:42,784
Lord Fan Xian had often visited and praised it highly.

466
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:44,162
Come and take a look.

467
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,432
My Lord, when will you take me to try it?

468
00:29:47,729 --> 00:29:49,586
Once I come back to life, you can have all the yogurt you want.

469
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:51,562
My Lord, you staged your death halfway through.

470
00:29:51,961 --> 00:29:53,922
It was supposed to be a secret.

471
00:29:54,095 --> 00:29:55,762
How did it spread?

472
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,922
Apart from us, only Li Cheng Ze knew best.

473
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,682
Prince Cheng Ze spread it?

474
00:30:00,952 --> 00:30:04,602
What could he hope to gain from this?

475
00:30:15,527 --> 00:30:17,647
I remember your house is nearby.

476
00:30:17,743 --> 00:30:19,002
Whose courtyard is this?

477
00:30:19,086 --> 00:30:20,202
It's also mine.

478
00:30:20,357 --> 00:30:21,597
Can they trace it to your name?

479
00:30:22,076 --> 00:30:23,176
No.

480
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,162
My Lord, please make yourself at home.

481
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,722
This courtyard originally belonged to a gardener.

482
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,562
He borrowed money from me,

483
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:35,802
but he couldn't repay it, so he used this courtyard as collateral.

484
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,442
Guess what this is.

485
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,842
Isn't this just a kiln?

486
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,602
This is the back door of my house.

487
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:52,329
I dug a tunnel that connects directly to my house.

488
00:30:52,447 --> 00:30:56,802
Even if someone disturbs us, I can come and go freely.

489
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:02,682
The news of Fan Xian's death shook the world.

490
00:31:02,976 --> 00:31:06,362
If we find this person in the capital now,

491
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:09,322
his crime of deceiving the emperor

492
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:11,722
will be confirmed.

493
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,210
(I have already assigned my men around Wang Qi Nian's house.)

494
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:25,104
(As long as Fan Xian appears, )

495
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,351
he can't escape from Your Highness.

496
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,362
Wang Qi Nian is Fan Xian's confidant

497
00:31:29,557 --> 00:31:30,899
and he's been staying in the capital for years.

498
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,162
Other than him,

499
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,122
Fan Xian has no one else to rely on.

500
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,762
My Lord, look.

501
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,842
The roads outside

502
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,719
extend in all directions, all leading out of the city.

503
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:46,842
If something happens, it's easy for us to escape.

504
00:31:46,923 --> 00:31:49,282
Impressive, it's a safe house.

505
00:31:50,064 --> 00:31:51,482
A safe house?

506
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:54,612
It's a fitting name.

507
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,602
But there's the Overwatch Council.

508
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:59,640
Fan Xian is the Chief Inspector of the Overwatch Council.

509
00:31:59,974 --> 00:32:01,534
If he returns to the Overwatch Council,

510
00:32:01,951 --> 00:32:03,962
it's not just a matter of deceiving the emperor.

511
00:32:04,783 --> 00:32:06,082
If that happens,

512
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,922
the outcome of this game

513
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,442
will be decided.

514
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,282
I don't recall the Overwatch Council having this custom.

515
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:20,042
It didn't.

516
00:32:20,926 --> 00:32:24,282
But ever since I had the honor of meeting you,

517
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,162
you have brightened my life.

518
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,682
But my life

519
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:31,762
has become truly thrilling.

520
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:33,059
Here, My Lord.

521
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,030
Have a seat.

522
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:42,970
Since we have this Safe House, we don't have to go to your house.

523
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,300
We can stay here.

524
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:45,642
No, My Lord.

525
00:32:46,271 --> 00:32:51,762
My wife helped settle the Teng family.

526
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,682
If we want to find them,

527
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,762
we still have to go back to my house

528
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,082
and find my wife.

529
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,442
Qi Nian.

530
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:02,042
Let's go at night.

531
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,722
We have to be careful.

532
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,402
Restrain yourself.

533
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,802
Lock the doors and windows,

534
00:33:12,135 --> 00:33:14,602
prevent fire and theft.

535
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,202
Lock the doors and windows,

536
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:21,930
prevent fire and theft.

537
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,442
It's good to be home.

538
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,498
What's that noise? An assassin?

539
00:33:44,831 --> 00:33:48,002
I set it up for my wife to guard against intruders.

540
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:52,562
But speaking of which, this exit in the well wall is quite unexpected.

541
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,082
My wife may be asleep.

542
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:00,402
Don't wake her, or she'll lose her temper.

543
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:02,922
Let's go to that room.

544
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,322
In that case, why don't we stay in the Safe House?

545
00:34:10,432 --> 00:34:13,362
That's my daughter's room.

546
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,642
I've been away for so long.

547
00:34:15,736 --> 00:34:17,682
I want to go over and see her now.

548
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:19,242
- Let's go. - Okay.

549
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,282
This place

550
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,162
has a knife tied to it.

551
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:32,762
Step over.

552
00:34:38,779 --> 00:34:40,900
Also... Here,

553
00:34:41,394 --> 00:34:43,402
here and there

554
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,522
are traps for deer.

555
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,482
Stepping here is safe.

556
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:56,842
My wife changed the trap.

557
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:01,802
My Lord, how about I carry you over?

558
00:35:48,568 --> 00:35:50,864
Is your father Wang Qi Nian?

559
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,762
I'm your father's best friend. Just call me uncle.

560
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,672
Is it for me?

561
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,120
Thank you.

562
00:36:16,487 --> 00:36:17,922
The porridge is ready.

563
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:19,322
The porridge is ready.

564
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,842
My mother is calling you for lunch.

565
00:36:22,984 --> 00:36:24,042
Okay.

566
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,309
Lord Fan.

567
00:36:38,464 --> 00:36:39,882
I am Qi Nian's wife.

568
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,139
Please don't call me lord.

569
00:36:41,238 --> 00:36:42,495
I had been in life and death situations with Qi Nian.

570
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:44,402
By rights, I should call you sister-in-law.

571
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:46,802
My Lord, please take a seat.

572
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,970
Qi Nian went out early to run errands for you.

573
00:36:51,063 --> 00:36:52,642
We don't have to wait for him.

574
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,450
He's so thoughtless.

575
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:56,762
He only told me this morning that you were here.

576
00:36:57,018 --> 00:36:58,255
I didn't prepare anything.

577
00:36:58,512 --> 00:37:00,155
This porridge is homemade. Hope you don't find it too plain.

578
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:02,442
Please don't say that. I'm the one troubling you.

579
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:07,659
There is meat.

580
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:09,933
That's great.

581
00:37:10,578 --> 00:37:12,202
- What's your name? - Ba Ba.

582
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,000
I didn't teach her that.

583
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,380
You misunderstand her, My Lord. It's her nickname.

584
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,602
Our daughter's name is simply "Ba".

585
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,769
Which character is it?

586
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:27,562
The character for "domineering".

587
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,540
Seriously.

588
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,490
Uncle, the egg fell.

589
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:37,699
Thank you.

590
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,810
I heard you have many romances in the capital.

591
00:37:44,866 --> 00:37:46,303
I swear to God, I have none.

592
00:37:46,384 --> 00:37:47,904
It's all false, just rumors.

593
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,760
- None at all? - None at all.

594
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,122
What about the princess?

595
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,882
The engagement with Wan Er is real, but everything else is false.

596
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,802
I believe you, My Lord.

597
00:38:00,216 --> 00:38:01,562
My Lord, have some porridge.

598
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:05,962
Uncle, don't drop it again.

599
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,522
I'll try my best.

600
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:21,687
The kid's name is quite special.

601
00:38:24,744 --> 00:38:27,802
Qi Nian chose it when I was first pregnant.

602
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,122
We didn't know it would be a girl.

603
00:38:30,229 --> 00:38:31,362
Why not change it?

604
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:33,802
A strong name brings a strong life.

605
00:38:33,888 --> 00:38:35,242
She'll grow up safely.

606
00:38:35,323 --> 00:38:36,763
It's a good name, with good meaning.

607
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,522
I also think my name is good.

608
00:38:46,456 --> 00:38:48,216
Mother, I'm sorry.

609
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,604
No talking while eating.

610
00:38:49,685 --> 00:38:51,922
I shouldn't talk while eating.

611
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:55,642
If you know you're wrong, correct it.

612
00:38:55,784 --> 00:38:58,322
I understand, Mother. I'll change.

613
00:38:59,348 --> 00:39:00,448
Get up.

614
00:39:02,897 --> 00:39:04,091
Please take your seat.

615
00:39:13,783 --> 00:39:15,015
I was teaching my daughter.

616
00:39:15,183 --> 00:39:16,546
Please make yourself comfortable.

617
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,980
President.

618
00:39:31,082 --> 00:39:33,330
- Where is Yan Ruo Hai? - He locked himself up.

619
00:39:38,284 --> 00:39:39,384
Go check on him.

620
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,602
- Leave it, My Lord. - Let me help you clean it up.

621
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:47,842
I heard from Qi Nian that you want to pay rent.

622
00:39:49,798 --> 00:39:51,282
Is that what he said?

623
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,661
One tael a day, to cover household expenses.

624
00:39:54,742 --> 00:39:57,330
- Is that true? - Yes, it's true.

625
00:39:57,447 --> 00:39:58,842
I have to pay rent.

626
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:01,682
Then there's no reason to make you do chores.

627
00:40:02,095 --> 00:40:04,322
Otherwise, it would break the rules.

628
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:06,362
My Lord, please take a seat.

629
00:40:07,945 --> 00:40:09,562
Ba Ba, keep Uncle company.

630
00:40:15,953 --> 00:40:17,042
Talk about what?

631
00:40:17,293 --> 00:40:18,522
Anything is fine.

632
00:40:19,004 --> 00:40:20,162
How old are you?

633
00:40:20,313 --> 00:40:22,362
I'm five years old. How old are you?

634
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:24,986
I'm way older than you.

635
00:40:25,111 --> 00:40:26,602
Are you an adult?

636
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:29,842
- Of course. - Then why do you sleep in my bed?

637
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:35,402
I'm just staying here for a while.

638
00:40:36,094 --> 00:40:38,842
- Do you like eating meat? - I do.

639
00:40:38,946 --> 00:40:41,026
Do you know what kind of meat is the most delicious?

640
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,362
- What kind of meat? - It's pork belly.

641
00:40:45,649 --> 00:40:48,010
- Fair enough. - Do you want to eat pork belly?

642
00:40:48,129 --> 00:40:49,882
- Yes. - Mother.

643
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:53,659
What's wrong?

644
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,602
Uncle wants to eat pork belly.

645
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:58,682
I'll make it for dinner.

646
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:01,162
No, I didn't...

647
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:07,322
All right, you've even managed to swindle meat.

648
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,642
Can you do me a favor?

649
00:41:08,723 --> 00:41:09,823
Okay.

650
00:41:10,075 --> 00:41:11,141
Do you have any paper at home?

651
00:41:11,165 --> 00:41:12,922
Get me a piece of charred wood too.

652
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,442
Ba Ba is just like her father.

653
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,322
We found Wang Qi Nian's traces in the city.

654
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:28,602
It seems, as the President expected,

655
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,442
Fan Xian is not dead.

656
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:32,042
And he has come to the capital.

657
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,642
Are you

658
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,562
waiting for Fan Xian to come to the Overwatch Council to see you?

659
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,562
He can't come here.

660
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,362
The Overwatch Council stands above all officials

661
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,384
and is the most important place in the Qing Kingdom.

662
00:41:44,408 --> 00:41:47,682
If he uses his authority as the Chief Inspector

663
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,442
for personal matters,

664
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:51,039
it's going to be a death sentence.

665
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,450
Didn't you say that His Majesty was furious?

666
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,249
Faking death is treason.

667
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,375
It's also a capital crime.

668
00:42:03,629 --> 00:42:06,082
He will die either way.

669
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,162
Yet you're still drinking porridge here.

670
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:12,922
I've done everything I could.

671
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:16,947
Can you save him?

672
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,799
The only one who can save him is himself.

673
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:24,162
What will happen if Fan Xian can't overcome this hurdle?

674
00:42:25,969 --> 00:42:28,002
If he can't overcome this,

675
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:30,642
I'm afraid you might never leave this place.

676
00:42:33,254 --> 00:42:34,715
I'm not important.

677
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,922
What matters is you.

678
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:40,522
If Fan Xian dies,

679
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,882
what will you do?

680
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:53,490
If Fan Xian really dies,

681
00:42:55,797 --> 00:42:57,882
many people will accompany him in death.
