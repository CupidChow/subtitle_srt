00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:31,003
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:34,007
(Episode 18)

3
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,281
Isn't this the Spring Imperial Examination?

4
00:01:39,305 --> 00:01:40,760
Can't they depend on their abilities?

5
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:42,962
These are not just names.

6
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,562
They are also the ways of the world.

7
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,179
Oh, Fan Xian,

8
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,602
the tree that stands out

9
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,282
is the one that gets knocked down.

10
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,722
It's good to be knowledgeable,

11
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:03,551
but it's more important to know how to be tactful.

12
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,679
You'll get used to it eventually.

13
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,729
Have you met Guo Zheng?

14
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,519
You know that too?

15
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,639
Guo Zheng used to be the Chief Imperial Censor.

16
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:33,031
After Guo You Zhi was imprisoned,

17
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:35,766
he temporarily took over the role of Minister of Rites.

18
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,600
There are many taboos in the Spring Imperial Examination.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,480
You should consult with him often.

20
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,720
I've met Guo Zheng once, but...

21
00:02:42,807 --> 00:02:45,846
You didn't quite get along.

22
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,735
Uncle, Guo Zheng led the renovation of the examination hall...

23
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,119
It's all according to regulations.

24
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:52,862
He's been an official for many years after all.

25
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,962
He knows all the rules inside out.

26
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,720
He knows how to use the rules to protect himself.

27
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,009
You will need to learn that too

28
00:03:01,457 --> 00:03:02,657
in the future.

29
00:03:02,753 --> 00:03:05,433
I know you feel uncomfortable about it,

30
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,962
but toughen up.

31
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,601
Once you get through the exam,

32
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,359
your future career prospects are limitless.

33
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,759
The crown prince went to see him?

34
00:03:25,937 --> 00:03:27,187
Sit.

35
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,409
Yes, Your Highness.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,072
After that, Fan Xian went to Chancellor Lin's residence.

37
00:03:32,096 --> 00:03:33,616
So, he's pulling strings.

38
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,810
Your Highness,

39
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,602
we have a few names too.

40
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,239
Should we send a list over as well?

41
00:03:40,368 --> 00:03:41,407
Not this year.

42
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,168
These are all scholars loyal to you.

43
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,239
We'll leave it to luck this year.

44
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,359
The traps are already set,

45
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,399
we can't jump in ourselves.

46
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:53,562
Do you think Fan Xian will follow the usual rules

47
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:55,766
in this Spring Imperial Examination?

48
00:03:56,506 --> 00:03:57,986
Who would dare to defy

49
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,519
years of established customs?

50
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,009
He's different.

51
00:04:09,062 --> 00:04:10,422
What others are accustomed to,

52
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,040
he might not be.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,082
Qi Nian.

54
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,759
Yes?

55
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,067
When I first heard about the corruption

56
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:56,491
in the Spring Imperial Examination,

57
00:04:58,252 --> 00:04:59,652
I was really motivated to eradicate

58
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:03,806
all the accumulated corruption

59
00:05:04,342 --> 00:05:06,542
and restore fairness for all the scholars.

60
00:05:07,213 --> 00:05:10,572
You truly care about the country and the people, My Lord.

61
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:14,202
But in just a short while,

62
00:05:16,093 --> 00:05:19,212
the crown prince and Chancellor Lin handed me a list.

63
00:05:22,686 --> 00:05:23,967
What can I do?

64
00:05:26,739 --> 00:05:28,162
To fight against Prince Cheng Ze,

65
00:05:29,054 --> 00:05:30,842
I need the crown prince's support.

66
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,180
And as for Chancellor Lin, it's even more complicated.

67
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:38,812
I'll be marrying Wan Er after the exam,

68
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:40,127
making us family.

69
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,813
I don't want to accept what they gave me,

70
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:45,653
but I can't refuse.

71
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:49,572
You have no choice, My Lord.

72
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,162
Do you know what Chancellor Lin said to me?

73
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,790
What did he say?

74
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:02,212
He said everyone is used to it,

75
00:06:05,853 --> 00:06:07,103
and I should just endure it.

76
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:12,168
If I endure it now,

77
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:15,853
I'll get used to it in the future.

78
00:06:18,637 --> 00:06:20,078
Everyone is used to it,

79
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:23,269
so why should I be the one to stick my neck out?

80
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,332
If I do so,

81
00:06:29,132 --> 00:06:30,962
I'll face opposition from all sides,

82
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:32,893
with swords and knives raining down on me.

83
00:06:40,372 --> 00:06:41,842
Maybe I should just put up with it.

84
00:06:47,077 --> 00:06:48,327
My Lord,

85
00:06:49,853 --> 00:06:51,212
you have a bright future ahead.

86
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:56,629
Why should I be the one to bear all the troubles?

87
00:06:56,653 --> 00:06:58,213
Why should I face betrayal and enmity,

88
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,602
and live in a world of torment?

89
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:00,893
Qi Nian,

90
00:07:00,973 --> 00:07:02,223
I'm just an ordinary man.

91
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:04,903
I'm not that special,

92
00:07:04,988 --> 00:07:06,442
I'm not that brave,

93
00:07:07,381 --> 00:07:08,901
and I'm not that righteous!

94
00:07:11,173 --> 00:07:12,423
My Lord,

95
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:14,562
as long as you have a clear conscience.

96
00:07:15,774 --> 00:07:17,482
My conscience is clear.

97
00:07:20,932 --> 00:07:22,613
My conscience is clear!

98
00:07:22,837 --> 00:07:24,322
I'm not the one at fault!

99
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:28,103
My Lord,

100
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:30,613
no one is arguing with you.

101
00:07:46,213 --> 00:07:47,463
My Lord.

102
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:50,851
Shi Chan Li and the gang haven't done anything out of the ordinary.

103
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:51,875
You...

104
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:53,511
I got it.

105
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:55,702
I just want to check.

106
00:08:00,653 --> 00:08:01,973
Let him go on his own.

107
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,813
Come, have some food.

108
00:08:23,173 --> 00:08:25,223
Study after dinner.

109
00:08:30,324 --> 00:08:31,574
Wan Li.

110
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:33,282
Who are you?

111
00:08:34,134 --> 00:08:35,384
Mr. Fan?

112
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,150
Why don't you take a seat at the table?

113
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,123
I brought my own food. It's not polite to take up a seat there.

114
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:45,390
- What are you... - I'm reading while eating.

115
00:08:45,414 --> 00:08:46,842
Why don't you read inside?

116
00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:48,935
Mr. Fan,

117
00:08:49,141 --> 00:08:51,282
the candles inside cost money.

118
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:52,854
Out here, it's free.

119
00:08:54,692 --> 00:08:56,092
So, you're a little tight on money.

120
00:08:57,221 --> 00:08:58,661
You're being too polite.

121
00:08:58,741 --> 00:08:59,991
I'm just plain poor.

122
00:09:04,173 --> 00:09:05,423
Waiter,

123
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:08,324
we'll have a roast chicken, a plate of beef, and a pot of wine.

124
00:09:08,653 --> 00:09:10,442
Sir, aren't you going to sit at a table?

125
00:09:10,972 --> 00:09:12,173
Why sit at a table?

126
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:13,518
Right here is just fine.

127
00:09:13,932 --> 00:09:15,002
All right.

128
00:09:27,812 --> 00:09:29,062
Mr. Fan,

129
00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:30,407
what are you...

130
00:09:30,565 --> 00:09:31,766
Each encounter is destiny.

131
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:33,143
Let's have a drink together.

132
00:09:33,812 --> 00:09:34,852
I can't accept this.

133
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:36,693
Just treat me back someday.

134
00:09:38,732 --> 00:09:39,982
This is not necessary.

135
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:42,292
I must thank you for this meal.

136
00:09:45,092 --> 00:09:46,342
Gentlemen,

137
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:48,982
enjoy your meal.

138
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:57,413
Sir, your dishes are all here. Enjoy.

139
00:09:57,493 --> 00:09:58,743
All right.

140
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:01,782
Excuse me.

141
00:10:01,863 --> 00:10:04,384
I haven't had meat in so long, I couldn't help it.

142
00:10:04,465 --> 00:10:05,584
This happens all the time.

143
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:07,242
- Then I... - Go ahead.

144
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:16,722
When we were in the examination hall, you said

145
00:10:16,893 --> 00:10:18,213
you wanted to become an official.

146
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:20,429
- Why did we come to the capital? - To become officials.

147
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,442
And why are we working in the examination hall?

148
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:23,912
Also to become officials.

149
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:26,046
Yes, I dream of it, even in my sleep.

150
00:10:26,187 --> 00:10:28,507
Is it to gain honor and glory for your ancestors?

151
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,722
No,

152
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,653
it's because I can't stand it anymore.

153
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:43,389
Mr. Fan, the imperial examination system is unfair.

154
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:44,663
Officials are corrupt,

155
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,040
people are starving outside,

156
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:48,001
and the court is embroiled in political strife.

157
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:49,453
Who in the world doesn't know that?

158
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,301
Yet no one says anything about it.

159
00:10:53,604 --> 00:10:54,924
Ji Chang advised me to endure it,

160
00:10:55,692 --> 00:10:58,188
but I think, if I choose to endure it even when the world is unjust,

161
00:10:58,212 --> 00:11:00,613
what's the point of all these teachings from the sages?

162
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:02,616
So, Mr. Fan,

163
00:11:03,373 --> 00:11:07,162
someone must break the silence, even if it means shedding blood.

164
00:11:07,452 --> 00:11:10,652
Look, if I were to achieve success in the exam,

165
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:12,682
wouldn't the bloodshed be more pronounced,

166
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:14,828
the impact greater,

167
00:11:14,932 --> 00:11:16,932
and the number of people who hear about it larger?

168
00:11:19,852 --> 00:11:21,102
I want to become an official

169
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:23,122
because I refuse to endure it.

170
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,373
Wan Li, your vision of being an official

171
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,602
would lead you to death.

172
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,922
A dead end indeed.

173
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:45,351
But Mr. Fan,

174
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:47,143
I've become a fool

175
00:11:47,838 --> 00:11:48,918
from studying too much,

176
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:50,173
stubborn in my beliefs.

177
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:51,503
Please forgive my foolishness.

178
00:11:54,773 --> 00:11:56,023
Wan Li.

179
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,576
- My Lord. - You've worked hard, Zi Yue.

180
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,457
Keep watching the inn for the next couple of days.

181
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:24,640
You didn't have to say that.

182
00:12:24,721 --> 00:12:25,971
It's my duty.

183
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,282
Qi Nian, let's go.

184
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:29,397
Back to the residence?

185
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:30,743
To the Overwatch Council.

186
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,714
You want to go to the Overwatch Council at this hour?

187
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:35,258
I want to read the inscriptions again.

188
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:36,792
What did I tell you?

189
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,201
He's always spontaneous.

190
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,383
I heard that.

191
00:12:40,732 --> 00:12:41,982
What can I say?

192
00:12:42,092 --> 00:12:44,722
This is called profound deliberation,

193
00:12:45,261 --> 00:12:47,402
wisdom as deep as the sea.

194
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,493
My Lord, you truly are extraordinary.

195
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:53,522
Goodbye.

196
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,453
Thoughts of you make one grow old,

197
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:26,882
time has suddenly grown late,

198
00:13:27,478 --> 00:13:29,602
abandon not the path once chosen,

199
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:32,282
work harder to earn a meal.

200
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:54,332
You're in charge of overseeing the copying of the names, right?

201
00:13:54,653 --> 00:13:57,453
When the time comes, take a look at these names for me.

202
00:13:57,773 --> 00:13:59,772
These are not just names.

203
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,602
They are also the ways of the world.

204
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:04,493
Those listed in this list

205
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:06,962
will all become useless manuscripts.

206
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:12,012
Look, if I were to achieve success in the exam,

207
00:14:13,932 --> 00:14:15,922
wouldn't the bloodshed be more pronounced,

208
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,980
the impact greater,

209
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:20,092
and the number of people who hear about it larger?

210
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:26,202
Actually, I know it too.

211
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,692
I have no chance of making it onto the list.

212
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,522
All the slots have been filled,

213
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:33,373
and there's no place left for us.

214
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:37,831
But what can I do? I'm just a poor scholar.

215
00:14:51,973 --> 00:14:53,362
Fan Xian, you see,

216
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:57,882
they've traveled thousands of miles to the capital,

217
00:14:58,206 --> 00:15:00,042
the Spring Imperial Examination

218
00:15:00,212 --> 00:15:02,082
is not just an exam for them,

219
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:04,453
it's like a ray of hope.

220
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:07,282
These are my favorite phrases.

221
00:15:09,653 --> 00:15:11,783
Get out of the way. You're blocking my light.

222
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:15,562
They can't afford to pay for candles,

223
00:15:15,677 --> 00:15:17,562
but still want to have light.

224
00:15:23,893 --> 00:15:25,143
Thank you.

225
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:33,245
When my mother was alive,

226
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:36,652
she wanted to change this world completely.

227
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:42,532
It wasn't just changing the world,

228
00:15:42,956 --> 00:15:45,077
your mother also wanted

229
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:46,722
to change people's hearts.

230
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,522
At that time,

231
00:15:48,932 --> 00:15:51,242
she was like a dazzling meteor,

232
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,100
and also like a blazing flame,

233
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:58,082
showing the people of the Qing Kingdom a different light.

234
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:00,202
But she still died.

235
00:16:00,422 --> 00:16:01,581
However,

236
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:03,462
that light left its mark.

237
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:05,294
Many people

238
00:16:05,493 --> 00:16:07,012
changed because of her.

239
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:10,082
Sometimes I often think,

240
00:16:11,165 --> 00:16:12,722
with my mother's abilities,

241
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:15,653
if she had chosen a different path back then,

242
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:17,053
she would still have lived well.

243
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:20,405
Yet she chose to burn everything and leave behind inscriptions.

244
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,320
But now,

245
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:24,772
there aren't many people who remember her.

246
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:29,248
Do you think she regretted it?

247
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:31,256
Absolutely not.

248
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:33,242
Even until her last moment?

249
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:36,001
I didn't see her at her last moment,

250
00:16:36,118 --> 00:16:39,357
but I believe Ye Qing Mei never regretted it.

251
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:41,263
Wasn't she afraid?

252
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,442
She was only afraid

253
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:46,676
that her light wasn't burning brightly enough.

254
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,482
I never thought that one day,

255
00:16:57,253 --> 00:16:59,013
I would become the one to pass on the flame.

256
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:04,042
- I want to make some trouble. - Sure, go ahead.

257
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:06,285
Whatever trouble you cause, I'll take the blame for it.

258
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:08,162
I can't let you bear the blame every time.

259
00:17:09,686 --> 00:17:10,926
What blame?

260
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,922
I have a better scapegoat.

261
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,493
A better scapegoat than me?

262
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:17,023
That's right.

263
00:17:17,655 --> 00:17:19,642
The best scapegoat in the world.

264
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:35,482
Fan Xian asked you to deliver a message to me?

265
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,733
I find it quite baffling myself.

266
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:41,802
After all these years,

267
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:45,122
I've never seen Lord Fan act in such a manner.

268
00:17:46,477 --> 00:17:47,727
What's the message?

269
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:49,722
He requests Your Majesty

270
00:17:49,812 --> 00:17:51,562
to summon him to the palace.

271
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,442
Summon him.

272
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,783
Yes, Your Majesty.

273
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,201
Fan Xian?

274
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:39,402
Lord Fan!

275
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:44,135
Commander Gong?

276
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:45,983
How may I help you?

277
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:49,791
What are you doing here at this late hour?

278
00:18:50,013 --> 00:18:51,532
His Majesty has summoned him.

279
00:18:51,852 --> 00:18:53,002
Now?

280
00:18:53,652 --> 00:18:54,902
According to protocol,

281
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:57,852
no court official should enter the palace at this hour.

282
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,623
His Majesty's orders are the protocol.

283
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,402
I'm just doing my duty. Please forgive me.

284
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:19,687
Your Majesty,

285
00:19:20,172 --> 00:19:21,453
Fan Xian is here.

286
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:23,406
What is he...

287
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:36,283
Your Majesty, I heard that you were injured by gunpowder a few days ago.

288
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:37,844
I've been worried about you.

289
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,922
So, I specially prepared some burn ointment for you.

290
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:43,362
Also, considering your daily worries over state affairs,

291
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,621
I've also prepared some calming and tonic medicine for you.

292
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:49,532
Take it after dinner every day.

293
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:51,623
The burn ointment is for external use.

294
00:19:53,253 --> 00:19:54,503
Is there anything else?

295
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:56,983
That's all.

296
00:19:58,332 --> 00:20:00,413
You say you were worried,

297
00:20:00,493 --> 00:20:02,253
but why don't I believe you?

298
00:20:02,444 --> 00:20:04,283
I've been injured for several days already,

299
00:20:04,372 --> 00:20:06,242
and you only showed up now.

300
00:20:06,493 --> 00:20:08,213
It took some time to make the ointment.

301
00:20:08,422 --> 00:20:09,622
Also,

302
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,622
if you wanted me to summon you,

303
00:20:13,132 --> 00:20:16,106
why go through such a big hassle to let others see?

304
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,562
Truly, nothing can escape Your Majesty's eyes.

305
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:22,842
All right, speak up. What do you want to tell me?

306
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,812
Your Majesty, do you trust me?

307
00:20:26,172 --> 00:20:28,002
Just say whatever you came to say.

308
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:30,389
Your Majesty, are you aware of the corruption

309
00:20:30,413 --> 00:20:31,813
in the Spring Imperial Examination?

310
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:33,718
Since I took on the role of Central Official,

311
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:35,533
I've been receiving numerous notes every day.

312
00:20:35,557 --> 00:20:36,918
These notes are filled with names,

313
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:38,249
and these names

314
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,690
are preselected by someone,

315
00:20:39,812 --> 00:20:41,812
earmarked for success in the exam.

316
00:20:42,412 --> 00:20:43,662
Keep going.

317
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:46,322
I would like to request fairness in this year's

318
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:48,082
Spring Imperial Examination.

319
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:49,973
If you want fairness,

320
00:20:50,238 --> 00:20:51,517
why come to me?

321
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:52,876
I'm afraid the implications are too deep,

322
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,802
and I alone cannot bear the responsibility.

323
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:56,013
In the entire Qing Kingdom,

324
00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:58,653
only Your Majesty can weather this storm.

325
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,835
Are you asking me

326
00:21:08,493 --> 00:21:09,772
to be your scapegoat?

327
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:11,223
Not for me,

328
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,062
but for the Qing Kingdom.

329
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:20,389
Why do you sound so much like Lai Ming Cheng?

330
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:26,996
Are you holding resentment about Lai Ming Cheng's death?

331
00:21:29,013 --> 00:21:30,092
Yes.

332
00:21:30,172 --> 00:21:31,562
You shouldn't.

333
00:21:31,773 --> 00:21:32,842
Yes.

334
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,242
You're quite candid.

335
00:21:41,172 --> 00:21:42,933
For your candor,

336
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,882
I'll be your scapegoat this time.

337
00:21:49,213 --> 00:21:50,292
Thank you, Your Majesty.

338
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,901
I shall take my leave now.

339
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:02,463
Apply the medicine

340
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:04,183
to me before you go.

341
00:22:09,934 --> 00:22:11,734
His Majesty summoned Fan Xian to the palace?

342
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,762
- At this hour? - If it wasn't urgent,

343
00:22:14,843 --> 00:22:16,878
His Majesty wouldn't have summoned him in late at night.

344
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,021
Are you sure?

345
00:22:18,102 --> 00:22:19,542
Gong Dian saw him with his own eyes.

346
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:20,972
Even he found it unusual

347
00:22:21,262 --> 00:22:23,143
and relayed the message immediately.

348
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:28,162
Does he know what was discussed?

349
00:22:28,243 --> 00:22:30,162
Gong Dian said even Eunuch Hou came out.

350
00:22:30,628 --> 00:22:31,878
What was discussed inside,

351
00:22:31,982 --> 00:22:33,341
no one else knows.

352
00:22:34,805 --> 00:22:36,646
Even Eunuch Hou came out.

353
00:22:39,372 --> 00:22:40,492
That's enough for now.

354
00:22:40,612 --> 00:22:44,012
Ask Gong Dian to stop finding out what they talked about.

355
00:22:45,316 --> 00:22:46,877
His identity is crucial.

356
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:48,941
Tell him that unless it's absolutely necessary,

357
00:22:49,589 --> 00:22:51,242
don't send any more messages to me.

358
00:22:51,812 --> 00:22:53,062
Yes, Your Highness.

359
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,802
I wonder what His Majesty

360
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:57,606
said to Fan Xian.

361
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,962
Whatever they talked about doesn't matter.

362
00:23:07,892 --> 00:23:10,213
Summoning him late at night and in private...

363
00:23:11,414 --> 00:23:13,202
His Majesty holds Fan Xian

364
00:23:16,172 --> 00:23:17,572
in too high regard.

365
00:23:27,256 --> 00:23:29,337
Your Highness,

366
00:23:29,517 --> 00:23:31,083
I'm really unable to handle this matter.

367
00:23:31,107 --> 00:23:32,722
I hope Your Highness can forgive me.

368
00:23:36,008 --> 00:23:37,322
I heard that His Majesty

369
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:39,842
summoned you to the palace yesterday.

370
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:41,783
Yes, that's true.

371
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,042
Did His Majesty give you any orders?

372
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:49,303
His Majesty

373
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,882
didn't say anything.

374
00:23:52,286 --> 00:23:53,682
He didn't say anything?

375
00:24:00,388 --> 00:24:01,882
I didn't ask anything either then.

376
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,540
Your Highness, everyone will have to rely on

377
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:07,282
their own abilities in this year's exam.

378
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,882
That's the way it should be.

379
00:24:43,854 --> 00:24:45,104
Lord Qin.

380
00:24:46,332 --> 00:24:47,582
Lord Fan.

381
00:24:49,325 --> 00:24:51,535
I knew you would take this path.

382
00:24:51,765 --> 00:24:53,962
- How? - You don't want anyone to see you.

383
00:24:54,148 --> 00:24:56,228
Doesn't this just prove that we're destined to meet?

384
00:24:59,812 --> 00:25:03,122
Lord Fan, I owe some favors from my time in the military.

385
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:05,362
I have a few names here,

386
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,402
please look out for them for me.

387
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:09,582
I'm sorry.

388
00:25:09,934 --> 00:25:11,013
It's just a few people.

389
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,122
Please help me spread the word.

390
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:15,515
- What word? - This year's exam

391
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:17,198
will be assessed on actual talents, not background.

392
00:25:17,222 --> 00:25:19,061
I will not take anyone's list.

393
00:25:21,182 --> 00:25:23,482
Did His Majesty summon you last night

394
00:25:23,803 --> 00:25:25,162
precisely for this matter?

395
00:25:25,493 --> 00:25:27,093
His Majesty didn't say anything.

396
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:29,002
Oh, I see.

397
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:32,492
Since His Majesty didn't say anything, I'm not guessing anything either.

398
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:44,442
Uncle, I'm really sorry.

399
00:25:44,535 --> 00:25:46,175
It's just that I must adhere to the rules

400
00:25:46,502 --> 00:25:48,182
regarding the Spring Imperial Examination.

401
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:51,092
Why did you do it?

402
00:25:51,187 --> 00:25:52,908
I have no choice.

403
00:25:56,396 --> 00:25:59,682
I know His Majesty summoned you to the palace last night.

404
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:05,722
Now everyone will assume that His Majesty

405
00:26:06,245 --> 00:26:09,725
instructed you to act in this manner.

406
00:26:11,245 --> 00:26:12,962
I know His Majesty.

407
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,562
With his methods,

408
00:26:15,693 --> 00:26:18,362
he would either swiftly eradicate all forms of corruption

409
00:26:18,505 --> 00:26:20,802
like a thunderstorm,

410
00:26:22,693 --> 00:26:25,642
or he would subtly

411
00:26:26,257 --> 00:26:28,122
manipulate behind the scenes.

412
00:26:29,292 --> 00:26:31,172
Even when his plan naturally comes to fruition,

413
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:34,469
he never lets anyone see through his true intentions.

414
00:26:35,773 --> 00:26:38,842
He would never hastily summon someone in the dead of night,

415
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,762
only to let things end so peacefully.

416
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,682
This isn't His Majesty's way.

417
00:26:44,763 --> 00:26:48,202
You're using him as a shield.

418
00:26:53,532 --> 00:26:55,292
Uncle, you know His Majesty so well.

419
00:26:55,412 --> 00:26:57,482
No one can truly understand him.

420
00:26:57,564 --> 00:27:01,522
Among all the kings in Qing Kingdom's history, he's the most inscrutable.

421
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:03,052
You're being too modest, Uncle.

422
00:27:03,076 --> 00:27:04,842
Don't change the subject. I'm asking you.

423
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,322
Why did you do it?

424
00:27:11,983 --> 00:27:13,562
Actually, I just want

425
00:27:14,373 --> 00:27:15,802
the Spring Imperial Examination

426
00:27:16,694 --> 00:27:18,122
to be fair and justifiable,

427
00:27:18,718 --> 00:27:20,122
even if it's

428
00:27:20,532 --> 00:27:21,782
just once.

429
00:27:22,757 --> 00:27:25,557
All the officials in the capital are watching the examination closely.

430
00:27:25,612 --> 00:27:26,730
Aren't you afraid?

431
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,411
Of course I am. That's why I'm making His Majesty take the blame.

432
00:27:29,493 --> 00:27:30,962
And I've seen through it, haven't I?

433
00:27:31,381 --> 00:27:32,762
If I were to expose it,

434
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:34,373
would you be able to deal with it?

435
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:36,134
Uncle, you're family.

436
00:27:36,215 --> 00:27:37,454
Please leave me a way out.

437
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,780
Why should I spare you?

438
00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:40,709
Because Wan Er won't marry anyone else but me.

439
00:27:41,462 --> 00:27:44,042
If you're gone, Wan Er can always find someone else!

440
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,722
You're right, Uncle. Please calm down.

441
00:27:46,876 --> 00:27:49,562
I don't know if it's fate or doom.

442
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:53,798
Why did Wan Er have to fall for you?

443
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:56,692
Well, I'm pretty outstanding, you know.

444
00:28:01,612 --> 00:28:04,373
You want to create a fair system for the Spring Imperial Examination.

445
00:28:04,524 --> 00:28:06,071
What's your motive?

446
00:28:07,158 --> 00:28:09,557
What can you gain from this?

447
00:28:13,964 --> 00:28:15,843
Actually, I understood

448
00:28:16,749 --> 00:28:18,188
what you said last time.

449
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:23,261
The tree that stands out is the one that gets knocked down.

450
00:28:24,053 --> 00:28:25,762
So, I had thought about

451
00:28:26,573 --> 00:28:28,882
swimming with the tide and doing what others do.

452
00:28:30,253 --> 00:28:31,503
What's wrong with that?

453
00:28:32,525 --> 00:28:34,602
For things I don't like, I could endure them

454
00:28:35,453 --> 00:28:36,733
and eventually get used to them.

455
00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:41,983
But I just couldn't do it.

456
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:45,279
I couldn't sleep at night.

457
00:28:46,556 --> 00:28:47,922
I'm tormented inside.

458
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:52,882
There is this word that keeps rolling around in my mind,

459
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,522
and I can't suppress it.

460
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:56,192
Which word?

461
00:29:01,892 --> 00:29:03,142
Well, unfairness.

462
00:30:10,422 --> 00:30:12,002
That's two words.

463
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,220
"Well" doesn't really count.

464
00:30:19,942 --> 00:30:21,402
We're scholars.

465
00:30:21,741 --> 00:30:24,482
We should be cautious with our words.

466
00:30:24,893 --> 00:30:26,322
I'll be more careful next time.

467
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:29,703
"Unfairness."

468
00:30:30,548 --> 00:30:32,282
So, it's all about that.

469
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:37,922
Do you believe

470
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:39,522
there's fairness in this world?

471
00:30:39,717 --> 00:30:40,917
Not absolutely,

472
00:30:40,998 --> 00:30:42,248
but relatively.

473
00:30:43,612 --> 00:30:44,862
What?

474
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:49,188
There's no absolute fairness in this world.

475
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,562
Just like some are born into wealth,

476
00:30:52,757 --> 00:30:54,117
while some are impoverished.

477
00:30:54,213 --> 00:30:55,613
Some have sharp intellects,

478
00:30:55,693 --> 00:30:57,087
while some appear foolish.

479
00:30:57,198 --> 00:31:00,162
And the Spring Imperial Examination is meant to provide everyone

480
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:03,276
with a relative fair chance to change their fate.

481
00:31:03,357 --> 00:31:05,842
If even this one chance is not fair,

482
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:08,402
how absurd would the world be?

483
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:24,382
All right.

484
00:31:26,172 --> 00:31:27,762
Let's make things fair

485
00:31:28,663 --> 00:31:30,202
in the capital for once.

486
00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:47,282
Go meet with Guo Zheng again.

487
00:31:47,502 --> 00:31:48,752
I've arranged it.

488
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,991
Ask him about the taboos and regulations of the examination in more detail.

489
00:31:53,952 --> 00:31:55,629
While you want to fight for fairness for them,

490
00:31:55,653 --> 00:31:57,292
don't let yourself fall into a trap.

491
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:05,573
Fan Xian,

492
00:32:06,853 --> 00:32:08,482
if the world

493
00:32:09,069 --> 00:32:10,522
is truly that absurd,

494
00:32:12,053 --> 00:32:13,973
what are you going to do?

495
00:32:16,693 --> 00:32:17,962
You don't need to answer.

496
00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:19,488
Ask yourself.

497
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:22,223
Go.

498
00:32:31,693 --> 00:32:32,943
Fairness...

499
00:32:58,757 --> 00:33:00,007
Lord Fan.

500
00:33:01,454 --> 00:33:03,602
Lord Guo, we meet again.

501
00:33:04,724 --> 00:33:06,763
I've been waiting for you, Lord Fan.

502
00:33:08,892 --> 00:33:11,482
Minister Guo, you're well-versed in the rules.

503
00:33:11,645 --> 00:33:12,828
I've come to seek your guidance

504
00:33:12,852 --> 00:33:15,413
on the rules of the Spring Imperial Examination.

505
00:33:15,557 --> 00:33:17,037
Chancellor Lin has told me about it.

506
00:33:17,172 --> 00:33:18,722
I'm not good enough to guide you.

507
00:33:19,365 --> 00:33:21,606
Lord Fan, with your intelligence,

508
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,820
you could've figured it out yourself.

509
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:27,150
I'm just providing additional information.

510
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,522
I've prepared it for you.

511
00:33:33,285 --> 00:33:35,245
Lord Fan, given your capability,

512
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:36,802
you're in charge of many tasks

513
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,516
during the Spring Imperial Examination.

514
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,621
Before the exam starts,

515
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:41,533
there's the task of inspecting the examinees.

516
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,530
During the three days of the exam, you'll need to

517
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:44,835
supervise and patrol the hall.

518
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:48,602
After the exam, you'll need to oversee the registration of names.

519
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,548
The Spring Imperial Examination is the most important event in our dynasty,

520
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,642
with numerous rules and taboos.

521
00:33:53,757 --> 00:33:55,838
There are too many to list verbally,

522
00:33:55,964 --> 00:33:57,642
so I've written them all down.

523
00:33:58,773 --> 00:34:00,893
All the detailed rules are included.

524
00:34:01,053 --> 00:34:03,642
As long as you take the time to look through them,

525
00:34:03,843 --> 00:34:07,283
you can ensure there are no oversights during the exam.

526
00:34:08,252 --> 00:34:10,452
How can I repay such a great favor?

527
00:34:17,341 --> 00:34:18,722
- Lord Fan. - Yes?

528
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:20,412
Come here, go over there.

529
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:23,666
This pillar...

530
00:34:27,228 --> 00:34:28,478
Straighten it.

531
00:34:30,292 --> 00:34:31,562
- Lord Guo. - Lord Guo.

532
00:34:33,092 --> 00:34:35,842
Lord Sun, the exam is coming. I'm busy.

533
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,829
- I'm busy. - I'll leave you be.

534
00:34:45,244 --> 00:34:47,042
You've worked hard, Lord Guo.

535
00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:51,207
Thank you.

536
00:34:53,732 --> 00:34:55,412
Now I'm just looking forward to seeing you

537
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:58,213
write your own book and establish your own school soon.

538
00:34:58,525 --> 00:35:00,405
I'll be content then.

539
00:35:01,454 --> 00:35:03,722
Thank you very much, Lord Guo.

540
00:35:04,252 --> 00:35:06,492
- I'll take my leave now. - Goodbye, Lord Fan.

541
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:21,402
How did it go?

542
00:35:22,861 --> 00:35:24,882
Didn't you hear us back there?

543
00:35:25,894 --> 00:35:28,453
Fan Xian is a highly skilled martial artist. To be cautious,

544
00:35:28,565 --> 00:35:30,325
I didn't dare to get too close to eavesdrop.

545
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:31,722
That's a pity.

546
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:35,796
You didn't see the deeply grateful look on Lord Fan's face.

547
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:38,468
I almost felt bad for him at that moment.

548
00:35:39,774 --> 00:35:42,014
What did you write in that booklet for him?

549
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:45,452
All the details about the various rules and regulations

550
00:35:45,878 --> 00:35:47,442
of the Spring Imperial Examination.

551
00:35:47,636 --> 00:35:50,767
I can't afford to make any intentional mistakes on written papers.

552
00:35:52,638 --> 00:35:53,888
You did right.

553
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:56,104
Fan Xian

554
00:35:57,053 --> 00:35:58,303
is very cautious.

555
00:35:59,406 --> 00:36:02,513
However, for significant events like the Spring Imperial Examination,

556
00:36:02,612 --> 00:36:06,093
there are inevitably some rules that shouldn't be written down.

557
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:07,524
Since they shouldn't be written,

558
00:36:07,572 --> 00:36:09,533
naturally, they had to be left blank.

559
00:36:10,316 --> 00:36:14,115
Please tell His Highness that with me around,

560
00:36:14,196 --> 00:36:17,562
I'll ensure that Lord Fan violates taboos during the exam.

561
00:36:17,688 --> 00:36:19,051
While it might not be a major offense,

562
00:36:19,075 --> 00:36:22,676
it will make scholars throughout the country keep their distance from him.

563
00:36:27,366 --> 00:36:30,202
Aren't you afraid of offending Chancellor Lin?

564
00:36:31,685 --> 00:36:33,242
Of course I am.

565
00:36:37,877 --> 00:36:40,037
But he doesn't have

566
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:42,589
any leverage over me.

567
00:36:43,855 --> 00:36:45,105
His Highness said

568
00:36:45,813 --> 00:36:48,173
that those were just old and useless ledgers from the past.

569
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:49,293
After the ban is lifted,

570
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,693
he'll personally come to express his gratitude to you and,

571
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:55,868
in passing, burn all those useless papers.

572
00:36:59,253 --> 00:37:00,503
Then His Highness

573
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:02,132
can just sit back and watch the show.

574
00:37:12,419 --> 00:37:15,722
(Fan Residence)

575
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:54,042
- Are they here? - They're in the room. Everything's arranged.

576
00:37:54,557 --> 00:37:55,637
Nobody saw them, right?

577
00:37:55,772 --> 00:37:57,602
They avoided everyone in the residence.

578
00:37:57,732 --> 00:38:00,183
Don't worry, nobody saw him.

579
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:12,013
They're starving.

580
00:38:13,053 --> 00:38:14,162
You're back.

581
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:18,042
I'm back.

582
00:38:18,692 --> 00:38:21,042
Returning from Northern Qi this time

583
00:38:21,156 --> 00:38:23,516
was truly a journey of hardships.

584
00:38:23,621 --> 00:38:26,762
Fortunately, Bao Kun and me are unparalleled duo.

585
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:28,588
No matter what obstacles we faced,

586
00:38:28,676 --> 00:38:29,837
we cleverly overcame them.

587
00:38:29,918 --> 00:38:31,260
That's how we managed to escape danger

588
00:38:31,284 --> 00:38:32,534
and return to the capital.

589
00:38:33,132 --> 00:38:34,762
You two seem to get along well now.

590
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:37,602
Heroes appreciate heroes.

591
00:38:41,893 --> 00:38:44,893
Young Master, now that you've returned home in glory,

592
00:38:44,973 --> 00:38:46,612
I must treat you to a meal and catch up.

593
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:47,853
Let's talk about what to eat.

594
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:49,157
- I'll treat you. - No, let me.

595
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:51,091
I'll treat you. Come on, Qi Nian!

596
00:38:51,172 --> 00:38:53,802
Young Master, you sound so energetic.

597
00:38:54,772 --> 00:38:56,202
What should we eat?

598
00:38:58,212 --> 00:38:59,462
I'll treat you.

599
00:39:03,212 --> 00:39:04,613
My undercover diary.

600
00:39:05,965 --> 00:39:07,215
You've worked hard.

601
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:10,282
He said you called me here to save my father's life?

602
00:39:10,504 --> 00:39:11,520
Here's the thing.

603
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:13,989
I'm in charge of overseeing the Spring Imperial Examination.

604
00:39:14,013 --> 00:39:15,442
What does that have to do with me?

605
00:39:15,748 --> 00:39:17,902
There are many taboos of the exam that I don't know about.

606
00:39:17,926 --> 00:39:20,892
- I don't know either. - But your father was the Minister of Rites.

607
00:39:22,197 --> 00:39:24,042
You want my father's help?

608
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,660
That's why I asked you to come back.

609
00:39:25,878 --> 00:39:28,042
Your father can only be at ease when he sees you.

610
00:39:28,822 --> 00:39:30,941
You're planning for the exam so early?

611
00:39:31,092 --> 00:39:33,453
Actually, when Prince Cheng Ze proposed I oversee the exam,

612
00:39:33,533 --> 00:39:35,573
I was already preparing strategies to deal with it.

613
00:39:35,612 --> 00:39:37,492
Now, it looks like the timing is just right.

614
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,830
You guys,

615
00:39:39,893 --> 00:39:42,228
- each more cunning than the other. - I'm just being meticulous.

616
00:39:42,252 --> 00:39:43,693
All right, spill it.

617
00:39:43,774 --> 00:39:45,162
How do you plan to save my father?

618
00:39:45,278 --> 00:39:46,358
I'll arrange it.

619
00:39:46,493 --> 00:39:48,508
I'll transfer him to the Overwatch Council's jail in a few days.

620
00:39:48,532 --> 00:39:49,892
Will you still be able to get him out then?

621
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:52,636
I'm the Chief Inspector of the Overwatch Council, what do you think?

622
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:57,958
But there's one thing you should know,

623
00:39:59,181 --> 00:40:01,802
your father's accusation of collusion isn't fabricated.

624
00:40:02,212 --> 00:40:03,522
I can save his life,

625
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,362
but returning to an official position

626
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:06,696
is out of the question.

627
00:40:07,813 --> 00:40:09,063
I understand.

628
00:40:09,486 --> 00:40:11,802
Just keeping him alive is good enough.

629
00:40:14,005 --> 00:40:15,205
I'll talk to my father

630
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:16,824
and make sure he tells you everything

631
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:19,308
he knows about the Spring Imperial Examination.

632
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,088
What's this?

633
00:40:25,228 --> 00:40:27,429
A booklet personally written by the current Minister of Rites.

634
00:40:27,453 --> 00:40:29,733
Many of the taboos of the exam are listed inside.

635
00:40:30,082 --> 00:40:32,442
- Then you don't need my father. - On the contrary.

636
00:40:32,685 --> 00:40:34,805
I need your father to go through this.

637
00:40:39,509 --> 00:40:42,950
You're worried there might be traps written here?

638
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,197
It's better to be cautious.

639
00:40:44,221 --> 00:40:45,319
Whether there are traps or not,

640
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:46,593
let your father judge.

641
00:40:47,637 --> 00:40:48,637
All right.

642
00:40:48,718 --> 00:40:51,242
- Let's go and save my father then. - There's no hurry.

643
00:40:53,454 --> 00:40:54,482
Si Zhe.

644
00:40:56,192 --> 00:40:57,602
Lower your voice.

645
00:40:58,566 --> 00:41:00,006
You've both taken a long trip here.

646
00:41:00,117 --> 00:41:01,238
You must be exhausted.

647
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:02,402
Take a few days to rest.

648
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:04,402
Be careful not to let anyone see you.

649
00:41:04,941 --> 00:41:06,191
Of course.

650
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:08,815
We'll be extremely cautious.

651
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,216
I'm relieved.

652
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:12,242
Come on.

653
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,910
First of all,

654
00:41:15,453 --> 00:41:17,002
welcome back home, both of you.

655
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:26,806
It's a little awkward, isn't it?

656
00:41:26,845 --> 00:41:28,282
The odor is a little too strong.

657
00:41:28,469 --> 00:41:31,282
Why don't you two go wash up? You both stink.

658
00:41:31,652 --> 00:41:33,453
- Do I stink? - You're all right.

659
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:34,882
Come on, I'll rub your back.

660
00:41:34,979 --> 00:41:36,682
Let's go, hurry.

661
00:41:48,229 --> 00:41:50,122
Why aren't there any guards here?

662
00:41:50,815 --> 00:41:52,362
Isn't that obvious?

663
00:41:54,084 --> 00:41:56,042
This is the Ministry of Justice's jail.

664
00:41:56,172 --> 00:41:57,573
You even have authority over here?

665
00:41:57,766 --> 00:41:59,562
I have some tricks up my sleeve.

666
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:02,376
Since you have such means,

667
00:42:02,457 --> 00:42:03,834
why don't you just get him out today

668
00:42:03,858 --> 00:42:05,258
instead of just bringing him food?

669
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:06,458
Don't worry.

670
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,869
It'll be easy once he's transferred to the Overwatch Council.

671
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,143
It'll just take a day or two.

672
00:42:10,806 --> 00:42:13,042
Relax, I won't deceive you this time.

673
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:16,202
You've deceived me several times before.

674
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,221
Bao Kun, why is it every time you speak to me, something feels off?

675
00:42:20,431 --> 00:42:21,562
Off?

676
00:42:22,981 --> 00:42:24,231
I've already washed up.

677
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:26,129
Just shut up.

678
00:42:50,996 --> 00:42:53,482
Son, I'm here to see you again.

679
00:42:57,566 --> 00:42:59,042
She got another one.
