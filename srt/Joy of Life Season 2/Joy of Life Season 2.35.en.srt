00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:30,959
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,082
(Episode 35)

3
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:36,962
Do masters always give such precious gifts?

4
00:01:38,249 --> 00:01:40,122
You are Ye Qing Mei's son after all.

5
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:44,401
My teacher said that this technique originally belonged to your mother.

6
00:01:44,536 --> 00:01:46,842
Now, it's simply returning to its rightful owner.

7
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,122
It seems my mother is everywhere.

8
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,562
You are fortunate.

9
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,870
I should thank you for your assistance earlier.

10
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,650
You shouldn't thank me.

11
00:01:56,747 --> 00:01:59,402
The real trump card was Shadow, who was hiding in the water.

12
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,904
Did you already know Yun Zhi Lan would come?

13
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,722
I didn't even know that Shadow was in Jiangnan, let alone Yun Zhi Lan.

14
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:08,245
You didn't know?

15
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:10,214
That's strange.

16
00:02:10,653 --> 00:02:12,644
The position of the ambush in the water was too perfect.

17
00:02:12,847 --> 00:02:15,318
Someone must have leaked the information.

18
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,479
I really didn't know. I'm more puzzled than you are.

19
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:20,402
Forget it, it's none of my business.

20
00:02:23,423 --> 00:02:24,703
Dig in!

21
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,482
How have you been since you got married?

22
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:33,289
Quite well.

23
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:36,402
That puts my mind at ease.

24
00:02:39,013 --> 00:02:40,562
Si Li Li wanted me to ask.

25
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:45,017
How is she doing?

26
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:47,000
- Don't ask.   - Who is Si Li Li?

27
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:50,159
For her, the greatest comfort is no longer hearing from you.

28
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:57,193
Why don't you figure out if this is duck or goose meat?

29
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,191
- You don't know her?   - I meant this.

30
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,122
Isn't this a chicken?

31
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,922
Salted chicken, right?

32
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,389
All right, run slower.

33
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:25,879
Don't fall.

34
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:28,162
All right, stop running.

35
00:03:33,524 --> 00:03:35,594
Mother, Lord Fan has arrived.

36
00:03:39,197 --> 00:03:41,122
Why didn't you inform me earlier?

37
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:44,046
I should have gone out to welcome him.

38
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:48,045
Lord Fan came alone?

39
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,179
Despite the chaos in Jiangnan, the Ming family remains safe, right?

40
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,562
The Ming family will protect Lord Fan to the death.

41
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,762
Go and greet Lord Fan.

42
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:03,682
Lord Fan.

43
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,520
Good kids, I didn't bring any sweets today.

44
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,957
I'll make it up to you later.

45
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,318
Now, off you go.

46
00:04:13,911 --> 00:04:15,082
Mother.

47
00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:17,084
Are you not done yet?

48
00:04:18,455 --> 00:04:20,606
Just a couple more bows and the ceremony will be complete.

49
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,640
My Lord, please have a seat.

50
00:04:24,743 --> 00:04:26,023
I'll keep you company for a while.

51
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,880
What is this ceremony?

52
00:04:35,957 --> 00:04:37,237
It's an adoption ceremony.

53
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,640
Adoption?

54
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,922
Yes.

55
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:44,556
He is of my clan, so he is like a cousin to me.

56
00:04:45,526 --> 00:04:47,917
From today, he will be adopted into my mother's household,

57
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:52,165
making him my younger brother in name,

58
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,999
even closer in relation.

59
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,762
He is lucky indeed,

60
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,722
having you witness the ceremony.

61
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,242
It's an honor for his family.

62
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,000
Please, have some tea.

63
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:09,566
All right.

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,322
The ceremony is complete. No need for more bows.

65
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,111
Come. Come on, get up.

66
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:17,425
Here, take it.

67
00:05:20,398 --> 00:05:23,642
From now on, we are brothers.

68
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:27,278
As your elder brother, I should show a token of appreciation.

69
00:05:30,718 --> 00:05:34,268
I'm getting old, not as thoughtful as you.

70
00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:39,122
If my mother has to worry about such small matters,

71
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,202
then I'm failing as the head of the family.

72
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,202
Look, Mother has spoken.

73
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,962
Take it quickly.

74
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,122
There are gifts for the children too.

75
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:52,953
Come.

76
00:05:53,094 --> 00:05:55,202
I have gifts for the children too. Come here.

77
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,842
Go ahead.

78
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,682
From now on, I am your uncle.

79
00:06:03,815 --> 00:06:06,496
I will make the decision from now on. I have the final say.

80
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,640
Did you hear that?

81
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,802
- Come, everyone gets something.   - Thank you, Uncle.

82
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:12,279
- Come.   - Thank you, Uncle.

83
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,732
Take it and buy some sweets.

84
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:15,093
Off you go.

85
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:21,042
Mother.

86
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,799
Now that family matters are settled,

87
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,919
let's get to business.

88
00:06:25,048 --> 00:06:26,398
You are the head of the family.

89
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,520
It's your call.

90
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,762
Lord Fan.

91
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:34,284
Please take the seat of honor.

92
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,400
Now that the ceremony is over, why are you still kneeling?

93
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,679
This morning at the dock,

94
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,800
I promised to give you an explanation

95
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,919
before nightfall.

96
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,390
My Lord, this person is the culprit who greedily issued the bounty.

97
00:07:27,985 --> 00:07:29,265
Him?

98
00:07:30,691 --> 00:07:31,971
The culprit?

99
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:36,282
Isn't he your newly adopted brother?

100
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:38,520
What was his motive? Greed?

101
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:39,990
Perhaps he wanted to curry favor.

102
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:43,762
Your journey south has disrupted certain interests.

103
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:45,802
He might just be a pawn.

104
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,840
Disrupted the Ming family's interests?

105
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,339
The Ming family is insignificant.

106
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,602
My Lord, the Three Great Workshops belongs to the royal family.

107
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,882
The Ming family is just a helper on errands.

108
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,119
All equipment, personnel, and management

109
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:05,125
are overseen by the Transport Department.

110
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:09,716
Even in trade, the profits ultimately go to Princess Yun Rui.

111
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,562
To put it bluntly,

112
00:08:11,735 --> 00:08:14,642
the Ming family are just the watchdogs.

113
00:08:14,974 --> 00:08:19,215
It doesn't matter to us who holds the leash.

114
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,439
- Isn't that right?   - Dogs bite.

115
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:22,815
Only stray dogs bite.

116
00:08:22,943 --> 00:08:25,092
Watchdogs

117
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,799
are loyal.

118
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:36,427
How about this, My Lord?

119
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,642
Today, I speak for the Ming family.

120
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,159
My Lord, you are here by royal decree, legitimate and proper.

121
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,479
The Ming family will fully support your reclaiming

122
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,870
of the Three Great Workshops.

123
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:55,002
Our head's promise is the Ming family's word.

124
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,724
Good.

125
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,962
Now that the explanation is given

126
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,269
and the stance is clear,

127
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,122
what do we do with him?

128
00:09:18,286 --> 00:09:20,756
Issuing an illegal bounty and attempting to assassinate an official

129
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,242
are capital offenses.

130
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:49,242
Lord Fan,

131
00:09:50,184 --> 00:09:52,562
the Ming family will never bend the law for the benefit of relatives.

132
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,562
Please administer justice against the criminal,

133
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,655
My Lord.

134
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,040
At least send the children away.

135
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:05,493
They are all watching this.

136
00:10:21,302 --> 00:10:24,042
If he is a criminal, why adopt him?

137
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,962
Though he deserves death,

138
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:28,842
the children are innocent.

139
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,430
By adopting them, after he is gone,

140
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:37,853
I can ensure they are cared for as my own grandchildren.

141
00:10:39,614 --> 00:10:42,481
He will not die with regrets.

142
00:10:43,223 --> 00:10:44,802
Mother's kindness is boundless.

143
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,360
If I were him,

144
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:49,046
I'd indeed rest in peace.

145
00:10:49,342 --> 00:10:50,622
Lord Fan.

146
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:53,664
Please administer justice.

147
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,762
- This is the culprit?   - Indeed.

148
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:09,762
Driven by greed?

149
00:11:09,926 --> 00:11:11,282
Yes.

150
00:11:11,568 --> 00:11:13,728
- Do you plead guilty?   - I plead guilty.

151
00:11:13,863 --> 00:11:15,573
If you plead guilty, you will die.

152
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:17,252
Please grant me this!

153
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,762
I refuse to do so.

154
00:11:21,036 --> 00:11:23,039
Whether you die or not will be determined after investigation.

155
00:11:23,143 --> 00:11:25,602
I will take you to the capital magistrate for a thorough investigation.

156
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,282
Brother.

157
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:39,282
Can you send the children away first?

158
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,140
Submit to the investigation and cooperate fully.

159
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:50,642
Don't worry about your family.

160
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:53,230
I will take care of the children.

161
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,710
There won't be any accidents.

162
00:12:00,883 --> 00:12:02,163
Servants.

163
00:12:12,388 --> 00:12:13,668
Escort him to the capital magistrate.

164
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:23,482
Lord Fan, watch out!

165
00:12:38,694 --> 00:12:39,842
This...

166
00:12:40,782 --> 00:12:42,422
So, he committed suicide to escape punishment.

167
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,482
Are you all right, My Lord?

168
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:47,380
Did any blood get on you?

169
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,908
You shielded me from it.

170
00:12:48,989 --> 00:12:50,362
How could I be stained?

171
00:12:56,228 --> 00:12:57,428
This...

172
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,330
If it doesn't wash out, I have to throw this away and get new clothing.

173
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:03,042
Such a waste.

174
00:13:03,302 --> 00:13:06,242
Look at this mess, what a waste of good food.

175
00:13:08,443 --> 00:13:09,522
My Lord.

176
00:13:09,724 --> 00:13:12,845
Are you taking the body back for an inquest?

177
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,805
He committed suicide to avoid punishment.

178
00:13:15,886 --> 00:13:17,682
Why would I need a corpse for interrogation?

179
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,149
In that case,

180
00:13:20,782 --> 00:13:24,942
I'll take my brother's body out for a proper burial.

181
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:26,762
I will be back soon.

182
00:13:43,821 --> 00:13:45,101
Lord Fan.

183
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,421
Your generosity in raising money to send the victims home is admirable.

184
00:13:51,822 --> 00:13:56,892
The Ming family mustn't fall behind in doing such noble acts.

185
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,319
Let's talk about good deeds later.

186
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,150
The blood isn't even cleaned up yet.

187
00:14:33,283 --> 00:14:34,442
Dear folks,

188
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,362
I've explained everything.

189
00:14:39,017 --> 00:14:41,657
The Ming family's good deeds can't be delayed.

190
00:14:43,274 --> 00:14:45,104
Let's all drink up.

191
00:14:45,831 --> 00:14:46,922
Drink up.

192
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,138
Master Ming.

193
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:54,602
Master Ming.

194
00:14:57,478 --> 00:15:00,149
These villagers have all volunteered themselves?

195
00:15:01,238 --> 00:15:02,482
Yes.

196
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,922
Why do so many of them look familiar?

197
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:07,741
They're all here for the sake of the Ming family.

198
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,719
Elder, please sit down.

199
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:13,162
Thank you, Master Ming.

200
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,199
Thanks for your hard work.

201
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,082
Ming Qing Da

202
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,522
thank all the villagers

203
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,402
on behalf of the Ming family.

204
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:37,882
Integrity is the pillar of character.

205
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:41,877
Dear folks,

206
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:45,226
the Ming family keeps its word.

207
00:16:55,117 --> 00:16:56,562
After this bowl of wine,

208
00:17:00,808 --> 00:17:02,522
your families

209
00:17:03,543 --> 00:17:05,402
will become part of the Ming family.

210
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,802
We can't promise much,

211
00:17:08,056 --> 00:17:10,002
but as long as the Ming family exists,

212
00:17:10,622 --> 00:17:14,002
we'll keep them well fed and clothed.

213
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:27,722
Folks.

214
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,682
See you in the next life.

215
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:35,038
Thank you, Master Ming!

216
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:38,602
Thank you for your great kindness!

217
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,119
There's much to say,

218
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,857
but the auspicious time has arrived.

219
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:54,045
Everyone,

220
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,830
farewell.

221
00:18:18,294 --> 00:18:21,004
Lord Fan, do you think it's clean now?

222
00:18:21,263 --> 00:18:23,292
It seems you've done this a hundred times.

223
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,398
Many have died in the family, right?

224
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:29,740
In large families, births and deaths are frequent occurrences,

225
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:31,167
so we've become accustomed to it.

226
00:19:02,478 --> 00:19:04,002
Make sure the numbers are correct.

227
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,599
Rest assured, Master Ming.

228
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,922
Including the one you brought, it's the exact number.

229
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,165
Have you made all the follow-up arrangements?

230
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,439
Yes, everything is arranged.

231
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,362
They all came willingly.

232
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,349
If not for the limited number of spots,

233
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:17,942
there would be many more willing to die.

234
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:20,909
After all, once their family is taken in by the Ming household,

235
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:22,438
their fortunes change.

236
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,941
It's beyond their wildest dreams.

237
00:19:25,696 --> 00:19:27,082
Hurry and load the carts.

238
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,879
Time waits for no one.

239
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,430
Yes, we'll send them to the Transport Department immediately.

240
00:19:45,313 --> 00:19:46,593
Such sin.

241
00:19:53,511 --> 00:19:54,791
Move faster.

242
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,760
Move faster.

243
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:35,661
Mr. Xie.

244
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,559
You were looking for me?

245
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:39,068
No, I wasn't.

246
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,279
Mr. Xie.

247
00:20:48,366 --> 00:20:49,646
You need to

248
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:51,318
open the windows frequently.

249
00:20:51,406 --> 00:20:52,686
This room needs more ventilation.

250
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,722
Mr. Xie, have a seat.

251
00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:04,769
Please have a seat.

252
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,000
I heard Fan Xian is here.

253
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:17,242
Yes.

254
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:22,402
My mother insists on giving him an explanation.

255
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:26,757
She says if the bounty issue isn't resolved soon,

256
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,242
our Ming family will face extermination.

257
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:34,092
Mr. Xie, to be honest, I've already tried to convince her.

258
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,482
Officially, I'm the head of the family,

259
00:21:38,943 --> 00:21:41,682
but my influence is limited.

260
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,680
My mother

261
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:47,242
calls the shots on everything.

262
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,469
Your mother's words aren't entirely wrong.

263
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:52,548
Mr. Xie, you misunderstand.

264
00:21:52,724 --> 00:21:55,162
One should act with integrity.

265
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,122
We mustn't be indecisive.

266
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,019
Since the Ming family has pledged allegiance to Princess Yun Rui

267
00:22:02,147 --> 00:22:03,402
and Prince Cheng Ze,

268
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:05,962
we cannot have further dealings with Fan Xian.

269
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,470
We must avoid suspicion.

270
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:09,678
It's good that you understand this principle.

271
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:11,069
I never forget it.

272
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
Don't worry, sir.

273
00:22:14,157 --> 00:22:15,717
The Ming family's dealings with Fan Xian

274
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,764
are merely superficial.

275
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,042
With my resolute nature,

276
00:22:21,412 --> 00:22:23,532
even if it costs the Ming family our lives,

277
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:25,043
I wouldn't give him a kind face.

278
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,482
Don't worry too much about it.

279
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,359
Let me give you some inside information.

280
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:33,670
In two days, Fan Xian will be dead.

281
00:22:33,774 --> 00:22:35,054
Two days?

282
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,282
What do you mean?

283
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:43,711
Princess Yun Rui has visited, and the matter is settled.

284
00:22:49,553 --> 00:22:50,833
Then...

285
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,016
Who will kill Fan Xian?

286
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,599
Don't ask too many questions.

287
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
Just wait for the result.

288
00:22:58,098 --> 00:23:00,082
I understand.

289
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:03,762
After hearing that,

290
00:23:04,054 --> 00:23:05,522
I'm completely relieved.

291
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,028
The head of the Ming family is really careless.

292
00:23:19,062 --> 00:23:20,882
A man just died over there,

293
00:23:21,592 --> 00:23:23,642
and you must be disgusted.

294
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,190
It's a bit cleaner here.

295
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:31,110
My Lord, you're raising funds and doing good deeds.

296
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,749
Despite the Ming family's difficulties,

297
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:37,627
we're willing to donate 200,000 taels to support the cause.

298
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,199
The leading family of Jiangnan faces difficulties?

299
00:23:42,317 --> 00:23:43,597
To be honest,

300
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,069
the Ming family was entrusted by Princess Yun Rui

301
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,069
to handle the sales of goods from the Three Great Workshops.

302
00:23:50,191 --> 00:23:51,661
It's constantly in deficit.

303
00:23:52,615 --> 00:23:56,045
The Ming family constantly injected funds to cover the losses.

304
00:23:56,783 --> 00:24:00,013
The goods of Three Great Workshops are all monopolized.

305
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,360
- How can you be losing money?   - Monopolized?

306
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:07,246
Monopoly means exclusive control of all the secret techniques.

307
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,559
But

308
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,519
there are too many unscrupulous merchants.

309
00:24:14,622 --> 00:24:16,253
It's hard to negotiate the price,

310
00:24:16,382 --> 00:24:18,693
and the supply is getting more and more expensive.

311
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:20,284
Besides...

312
00:24:23,518 --> 00:24:24,798
You all may excuse yourselves.

313
00:24:36,534 --> 00:24:38,962
Not to mention the money goes through Princess Yun Rui

314
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:42,922
before it goes into the treasury,

315
00:24:43,072 --> 00:24:45,802
so our internal treasury inevitably

316
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,110
faces deficits.

317
00:24:49,015 --> 00:24:50,885
Madam, you're saying that

318
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,282
Princess Yun Rui is profiting from this.

319
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:56,642
I didn't say that.

320
00:24:56,758 --> 00:24:59,038
Understood. You didn't say anything.

321
00:24:59,142 --> 00:25:00,422
I'll just infer.

322
00:25:03,438 --> 00:25:05,347
Fortunately, you are here.

323
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,789
The Three Great Workshops finally has hope.

324
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:13,670
I thought you might try to obstruct me on behalf of Li Yun Rui. Will you?

325
00:25:13,766 --> 00:25:15,682
Why would you say that?

326
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:18,642
The Three Great Workshops doesn't belong to the Ming family.

327
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:23,740
Who controls them makes no difference to us.

328
00:25:24,062 --> 00:25:27,891
A long delay in your journey south means trouble.

329
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:32,639
Tomorrow, I'll have Qing Da accompany you to the Transport Department

330
00:25:32,738 --> 00:25:34,242
to expedite the handover.

331
00:25:34,454 --> 00:25:38,733
Once the Three Great Workshops is rightfully under your control,

332
00:25:38,814 --> 00:25:40,364
there will be no further concerns.

333
00:25:40,597 --> 00:25:43,202
Tell me, what do you want?

334
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:50,189
Someone will need to oversee the Three Great Workshops in Jiangnan, right?

335
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,082
My Lord, what do you think?

336
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,839
Interesting.

337
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:03,589
This business is losing money every year,

338
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,950
yet you're eager to take it on.

339
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,282
It's about serving the kingdom.

340
00:26:11,318 --> 00:26:13,788
We don't care about personal gains or losses.

341
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:17,950
The Ming family's success isn't by luck.

342
00:26:19,975 --> 00:26:24,642
It's all thanks to the kingdom's prosperity and your good fortune.

343
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:45,917
What fine tea.

344
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,079
What fine tea.

345
00:26:58,342 --> 00:27:00,822
Why are you still here? Isn't Fan Xian waiting?

346
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,160
Entertaining Lord Fan is just a formality.

347
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:11,654
A quick greeting will suffice.

348
00:27:11,766 --> 00:27:13,046
Besides,

349
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:14,614
with my mother around,

350
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:17,617
there won't be any problems.

351
00:27:23,448 --> 00:27:25,882
Mr. Xie, please have some tea.

352
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,480
What's going on?

353
00:27:54,915 --> 00:27:56,082
This...

354
00:27:56,463 --> 00:27:58,012
What's going on?

355
00:27:58,183 --> 00:27:59,642
The sky is burning red.

356
00:28:00,031 --> 00:28:01,311
Didn't you see?

357
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:12,110
It looks like there's a fire.

358
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,509
Lord Fan.

359
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,682
This...

360
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,562
Lord Fan.

361
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,479
Something big happened.

362
00:28:21,582 --> 00:28:23,042
I sent someone to check.

363
00:28:23,324 --> 00:28:25,652
It seems that there was a fire in the Transport Department.

364
00:28:25,894 --> 00:28:28,160
- Imperial Treasury of the Transfer Department?   - Exactly.

365
00:28:28,263 --> 00:28:30,482
All the goods from the Three Great Workshops,

366
00:28:30,903 --> 00:28:34,322
along with the workers, are in the Transport Office.

367
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,121
But don't worry, My Lord.

368
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:37,642
Before reporting to you,

369
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,749
I already sent the entire Ming household to help extinguish the fire.

370
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:44,788
Master Ming, who do you think started this fire?

371
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,922
This

372
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:51,002
can't be an arson, can it?

373
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,599
After all,

374
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:56,150
burning down the Transport Department benefits no one.

375
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,190
Luckily, I'm at the Ming Residence tonight.

376
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:05,560
Otherwise, I might suspect the Ming family for arson.

377
00:29:05,671 --> 00:29:06,951
Lord Fan.

378
00:29:07,047 --> 00:29:08,838
Even if the Ming family had the courage of a bear,

379
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:11,002
- we wouldn't dare do such a thing.   - I know.

380
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,924
Of course, it wasn't the Ming family.

381
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,309
After all, I'm a witness.

382
00:29:19,445 --> 00:29:20,529
No.

383
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,082
It's hard to say about the entire Ming family.

384
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,280
After all, it's a large family with many members and deaths.

385
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:32,829
At least both of you are innocent.

386
00:29:37,391 --> 00:29:38,962
I swear by my honor,

387
00:29:39,374 --> 00:29:43,082
no matter what, I will help you uncover the truth.

388
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,162
The fire is so bright,

389
00:29:45,415 --> 00:29:46,695
it lights up the night.

390
00:30:07,192 --> 00:30:09,762
Moon Embracing Pavilion is no longer a brothel.

391
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,901
What's the use of running it now?

392
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,562
Our teacher thinks further ahead than us.

393
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:18,562
He hasn't mentioned what will happen to those girls.

394
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,639
He didn't say.

395
00:30:20,936 --> 00:30:23,285
He probably wants to decide after securing the Three Great Workshops.

396
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,960
Have you heard about the fire last night?

397
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,560
The Transport Department was burned to ruins.

398
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,122
The Three Great Workshops is gone.

399
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,042
The timing is too convenient.

400
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,122
It just so happened when our teacher came to Jiangnan.

401
00:30:36,392 --> 00:30:37,802
Without the Three Great Workshops,

402
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,882
the Imperial Treasury can't hold on any longer.

403
00:30:40,294 --> 00:30:41,645
It's too much of a coincidence.

404
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,039
I don't believe the fire will take place at such a convenient time.

405
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,110
Also, we found out the whereabouts of Yuan Meng in Jiangnan.

406
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:07,842
Aren't you going to capture her?

407
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,762
Our teacher has his own arrangements.

408
00:31:11,534 --> 00:31:13,042
It's a bit deep.

409
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:16,602
(Moon Embracing Pavilion)

410
00:31:26,054 --> 00:31:28,002
My Lord, I'm back.

411
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:29,562
It's so unlucky.

412
00:31:29,643 --> 00:31:32,562
I went around the fire site.

413
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,239
The warehouse of the Three Great Workshops is burned down.

414
00:31:36,334 --> 00:31:37,614
Nothing is left.

415
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:40,362
The cause of the fire is hard to determine.

416
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,442
- Where are the people?   - All dead.

417
00:31:47,077 --> 00:31:49,198
But I checked the number of bodies,

418
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:51,919
and it matches the number of workshop personnel.

419
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,280
Not a single one is missing.

420
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:56,901
In other words, there are no survivors.

421
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,039
I examined the bodies too.

422
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,682
I found something odd.

423
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:05,282
I checked two bodies in total.

424
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,199
There was no soot deep in their throats.

425
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:10,835
This means they were burned after they died.

426
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,309
But I didn't want to raise suspicion,

427
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:19,519
so I only checked those two.

428
00:32:19,614 --> 00:32:22,165
This fire wasn't an accident.

429
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,482
Are there any specific clues?

430
00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:27,112
Everything's burned clean. Nothing left.

431
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,480
No clues at all.

432
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,630
What do you think the Three Great Workshops represents?

433
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,960
Imperial Treasury and endless wealth.

434
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,630
So who benefits from burning them down?

435
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:41,319
No benefit

436
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,160
to anyone.

437
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,950
So this fire was just to burn down the name of the Three Great Workshops.

438
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,430
You mean, there's more to this.

439
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,975
Qi Nian, keep the back door secure.

440
00:32:59,056 --> 00:33:01,002
If there is something strange about this fire,

441
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,470
we'll get news soon.

442
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,682
I'll get right on it.

443
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:25,198
Fan Xian returned to his residence and hasn't left since.

444
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,559
He hasn't taken any action.

445
00:33:27,384 --> 00:33:29,402
- Where's he staying?   - Moon Embracing Pavilion.

446
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:32,120
It's the brothel in the capital.

447
00:33:32,254 --> 00:33:35,164
Yes, the Jiangnan branch of the brothel in the capital.

448
00:33:35,922 --> 00:33:37,962
I've never been there.

449
00:33:38,175 --> 00:33:39,764
It's just hearsay.

450
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:45,404
It seems even the righteous Lord Fan

451
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,950
can't resist the temptations of wine, women, and wealth.

452
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:53,749
I thought he would investigate this fire with great fanfare.

453
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:57,741
This fire burned everything thoroughly.

454
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,010
Even if he wanted to investigate, he'd have no leads.

455
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,029
I don't think he's easy to fool.

456
00:34:08,189 --> 00:34:09,859
Suspicion is inevitable.

457
00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:12,805
But logically,

458
00:34:14,126 --> 00:34:19,396
we have no reason to risk our family's destruction by setting this fire.

459
00:34:19,943 --> 00:34:21,223
Without motive,

460
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,900
suspicion won't fall on the Ming family.

461
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:25,775
That is impossible.

462
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:28,840
If it's discovered, the whole family would be executed.

463
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:30,708
The Ming family are not fools.

464
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,999
Why is it impossible?

465
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,082
Money can work wonders, Your Highness.

466
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,442
What does that have to do with setting a fire, Senior?

467
00:34:41,278 --> 00:34:43,962
- I'm playing black.   - Why are you playing black, Your Highness?

468
00:34:45,105 --> 00:34:46,522
Because you're the prince.

469
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:49,002
All right, let's see who goes first.

470
00:34:53,036 --> 00:34:55,799
I still think that fire was an accident.

471
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:57,599
But I think it was set by the Ming family.

472
00:34:57,691 --> 00:34:59,571
The Ming family has had a hand in the Three Great Workshops for years.

473
00:34:59,676 --> 00:35:01,739
With our teacher taking over, the Ming family wouldn't be happy.

474
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,420
But he has already arrived in Jiangnan.

475
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,359
Whether it's handed over or burned,

476
00:35:05,463 --> 00:35:07,082
they no longer belong to the Ming family.

477
00:35:07,568 --> 00:35:08,849
Why would they take such a risk?

478
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:10,522
It's a capital offense.

479
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:13,469
What if the warehouse had been emptied bit by bit by the Ming family?

480
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:15,242
Does that make sense?

481
00:35:19,922 --> 00:35:21,958
Teacher, I understand.

482
00:35:22,082 --> 00:35:23,959
The fire was set by the Ming family to mislead everyone.

483
00:35:24,093 --> 00:35:25,211
They wanted to transfer the Three Great Workshops

484
00:35:25,299 --> 00:35:27,002
and then monopolize the wealth.

485
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:29,309
How can they be so greedy for wealth?

486
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,959
And it caused so many lives.

487
00:35:31,043 --> 00:35:32,479
Don't they fear the laws of Qing?

488
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:33,634
That's the powerful Ming family of Jiangnan.

489
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,439
Why do you think so poorly of them?

490
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,240
It's not that I think poorly of them, Your Highness.

491
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,559
People die for money.

492
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:39,902
That's human nature.

493
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:41,842
You have no evidence. I don't believe it.

494
00:35:41,919 --> 00:35:43,682
- Does such a thing exist?   - Yes!

495
00:35:50,295 --> 00:35:51,762
Your Highness, you may not know this.

496
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:53,682
That's what happened to me,

497
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,830
and my hometown,

498
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:57,518
Shijia Town.

499
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,762
That's exactly how it got burned.

500
00:36:01,597 --> 00:36:03,922
The official disaster report said

501
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:06,322
it was a dry spell and an accidental fire.

502
00:36:07,558 --> 00:36:09,749
It was the whole town, Your Highness.

503
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,349
Everyone died.

504
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,789
Wouldn't they run?

505
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:18,749
They brushed it off as an accident.

506
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,720
I don't believe it.

507
00:36:22,757 --> 00:36:24,037
What do you think?

508
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,519
Do you think it was an accident?

509
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,720
Or man-made?

510
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:45,362
Sorry, Senior.

511
00:36:47,222 --> 00:36:48,682
I didn't know about that.

512
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:53,240
Sorry to bring up your painful memories.

513
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:09,722
There are many things you don't understand.

514
00:37:10,165 --> 00:37:14,276
Money can work miracles and dehumanize people.

515
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:17,682
What about Xie Bi An's side?

516
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,510
Xie Bi An had no suspicions either.

517
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:23,122
After all, rumors have been circulating for years that

518
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:24,839
you and I

519
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,479
are fighting over the position of the head of the family.

520
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,919
But in reality,

521
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:32,322
we are harmonious.

522
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,802
Princess Yun Rui wouldn't expect that

523
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,402
this time, we are working together

524
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,642
on such a grand scheme.

525
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:48,720
Make sure there are no mistakes at the fire site.

526
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:50,038
Don't worry.

527
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:53,915
Even if investigated, the blame will fall on Li Yun Rui.

528
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,160
After all,

529
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,122
during the fights of the powerful,

530
00:37:58,246 --> 00:38:01,637
who would pay attention to merchants like us?

531
00:38:03,927 --> 00:38:08,157
They say a thousand miles of dike can be destroyed by an ant's nest,

532
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,322
but who truly

533
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,590
watches the ants?

534
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:19,559
Get the large boats ready in a few days.

535
00:38:19,654 --> 00:38:21,005
Everything is ready.

536
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,122
But for now, the situation is too tense to make any moves.

537
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,316
Once everything is settled

538
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,760
and Fan Xian returns to the capital,

539
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,733
I'll use the boats to transport the goods and workers

540
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,799
out to sea.

541
00:38:35,895 --> 00:38:37,525
Beware of human mishaps.

542
00:38:37,725 --> 00:38:39,156
I've bribed two key officials.

543
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,550
They thought this grand scheme was arranged by Li Yun Rui.

544
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:47,200
The workers are obedient.

545
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,282
Once everything is out to sea,

546
00:38:51,311 --> 00:38:52,591
it'll all be settled.

547
00:38:55,273 --> 00:38:58,782
It seems you need me less and less.

548
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,070
You've arranged everything yourself.

549
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,162
All thanks to Mother's teaching.

550
00:39:07,622 --> 00:39:09,253
I have no credit at all.

551
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,080
My leg is getting worse.

552
00:39:15,414 --> 00:39:18,483
It's getting harder and harder to bend it.

553
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,940
I guess I'm just useless now.

554
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:31,322
Mother, why call yourself useless?

555
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,082
Come, let me carry you on my back.

556
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:54,653
You're getting more stable as the head of the family.

557
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:00,802
Without your guidance,

558
00:40:01,338 --> 00:40:05,002
being the head of the family is just an empty title.

559
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,990
What do you think is Jiangnan's biggest problem?

560
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,119
The Ming family.

561
00:40:11,214 --> 00:40:12,322
No.

562
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:16,162
Princess Yun Rui and Prince Cheng Ze.

563
00:40:16,395 --> 00:40:17,762
No.

564
00:40:18,344 --> 00:40:19,384
Who else could it be?

565
00:40:19,465 --> 00:40:22,369
Sometimes, the problem isn't a person, but...

566
00:40:22,481 --> 00:40:23,643
Human nature.

567
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:27,559
For so many years, the Ming family has dominated Jiangnan,

568
00:40:27,669 --> 00:40:29,442
leaving other merchants with no chance.

569
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:34,602
The Ming family is rich, but the counties are getting poorer.

570
00:40:35,086 --> 00:40:36,842
So the Ming family should be replaced.

571
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,202
Replacing them won't change anything.

572
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:41,372
In a few years, there will be a new Ming family.

573
00:40:44,335 --> 00:40:46,735
During my trip south, I heard a saying,

574
00:40:47,036 --> 00:40:48,700
if there's no Ming family, there will be another family.

575
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,560
The Three Great Workshops is like a treasure trove.

576
00:40:50,641 --> 00:40:53,312
Whoever controls them will become the next Ming family.

577
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,240
So the name of the Three Great Workshops doesn't matter.

578
00:40:57,327 --> 00:40:58,836
What matters is its essence.

579
00:40:59,133 --> 00:41:00,294
What essence?

580
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:03,063
It holds the most profitable craft inheritance in the world.

581
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:04,446
I know that.

582
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,642
Glass, sugar, cotton weaving, perfume, and more.

583
00:41:09,991 --> 00:41:11,271
They are all top secrets.

584
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:12,839
I want to release them.

585
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,040
Release what?

586
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:18,880
All the secrets of the Three Great Workshops.

587
00:41:18,983 --> 00:41:20,263
I'll let them all out.

588
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:24,550
Make them public? Where?

589
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:25,790
To all the shops in the world.

590
00:41:25,894 --> 00:41:27,174
Sharing the techniques.

591
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:31,042
Sell them at a high price to cover treasury debt.

592
00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:35,402
We will charge for it,

593
00:41:35,646 --> 00:41:37,356
but it's not for the treasury debt.

594
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:39,399
I never thought about selling it at a high price either.

595
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,325
Each trade will have a set fee.

596
00:41:41,422 --> 00:41:43,462
Shops that want to use it will pay an annual fee.

597
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:44,672
It's a steady stream of revenue.

598
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:47,420
This is called intellectual property.

599
00:41:52,535 --> 00:41:56,775
But won't that mean the imperial treasury's secrets are gone?

600
00:41:56,856 --> 00:41:59,389
But it will give hope to the people.

601
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:01,780
The Imperial Treasury belongs to the royal family.

602
00:42:01,878 --> 00:42:04,548
Aren't the people also belong to the royal family?

603
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,399
That

604
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,869
seems to make sense.

605
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:14,720
I chose intellectual property

606
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:20,269
because real wealth shouldn't belong to one family or a royal shop.

607
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:21,735
Rather,

608
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,160
we should advance together with the people and enrich the kingdom.

609
00:42:24,302 --> 00:42:28,612
If this path works, it might give weight

610
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,680
to those ignored lives.

611
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:34,242
Teacher,

612
00:42:35,046 --> 00:42:36,753
does Father know about this plan

613
00:42:37,503 --> 00:42:38,783
to enrich the people?

614
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,799
Get it done first, then report back to the capital.

615
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,039
Teacher.

616
00:42:47,134 --> 00:42:48,642
I think you should seek permission first.

617
00:42:48,724 --> 00:42:50,595
Doing something like this before seeking permission,

618
00:42:50,912 --> 00:42:52,221
I'm afraid

619
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:54,602
Father will get mad.

620
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:57,190
We mustn't be worried if we want to be successful.
