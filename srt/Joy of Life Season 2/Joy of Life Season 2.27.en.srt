00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:30,936
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,017 --> 00:01:34,082
(Episode 27)

3
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,040
What are you doing?

4
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,109
Since I have some spare time,

5
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,870
I thought I'd make a new shade of rouge.

6
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,600
Aren't these flowers you brought meant for Fan Xian?

7
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,960
He didn't want them.

8
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,799
So, I'll give them to you instead.

9
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,999
How generous of you.

10
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,372
I'm here to thank you.

11
00:01:51,453 --> 00:01:52,733
For what?

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,280
No matter what,

13
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,829
I didn't want anything to crop up during Wan Er's wedding.

14
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,749
You didn't tell her about the secret related to Lin Gong.

15
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,922
That's why I have to thank you.

16
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,309
Aunt Yun Rui, I didn't plan to say it even if you didn't tell me to do so.

17
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,949
I don't understand, then.

18
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,861
Are you going to negotiate peace with Fan Xian?

19
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,879
That's not the case.

20
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,267
His Majesty has great trust in Fan Xian.

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,359
Judging from the situation, he would still let him take over

22
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,709
the Imperial Treasury even if he doesn't marry Wan Er.

23
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,242
As for the secret related to Lin Gong,

24
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,949
we can only use it during life-or-death situations.

25
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,882
What's wrong?

26
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,389
Aunt Yun Rui, are you trying to negotiate peace with Fan Xian?

27
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,869
If that were the case,

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,989
there wouldn't be an extra 20 million tael debt in the ledger.

29
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:48,429
But it seems like the debt was given to him too early.

30
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,639
Everyone in the court is speculating

31
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,829
that Fan Xian would not take over the Imperial Treasury.

32
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
Continue.

33
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,806
Lord Fan is enjoying his success right now.

34
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,517
Why would he need to take over the mess?

35
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:14,989
That child may look like a normal person on the surface,

36
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,879
but only I know

37
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,510
that he's as crazy as me on the inside.

38
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,310
I'm in no rush to return to Xinyang.

39
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,400
I'll stay and see how it'll end up eventually.

40
00:03:26,443 --> 00:03:29,713
When it's necessary, I'll give him a push from the back.

41
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,439
When it comes to being crazy,

42
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,879
Aunt Yun Rui, I guess

43
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,240
we're on equal terms.

44
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,166
My Lord, if this doesn't work out,

45
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,617
I still have a private stash.

46
00:03:47,698 --> 00:03:49,242
I'll give you everything I have.

47
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,240
Can you bear to part with it?

48
00:03:51,754 --> 00:03:53,398
Of course not.

49
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:56,320
But if you feel embarrassed about it, you can write me an IOU.

50
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,559
We can see it as a loan.

51
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,919
Should we include interest, then?

52
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,319
Interest?

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,602
If so, I guess I'll give you a lower interest rate.

54
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:06,288
How dare I calculate interest with you, My Lord?

55
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,682
Qi Nian, it's fine. I appreciate your intention.

56
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,079
But I don't lack that money.

57
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,700
But My Lord, I'm trying to share your burden with you.

58
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:13,922
Young Master.

59
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,517
Someone outside said he was to deliver this to you

60
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:19,878
as per Shopkeeper Ye's instruction.

61
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,629
Shopkeeper Ye is efficient indeed.

62
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,962
My Lord.

63
00:04:38,513 --> 00:04:41,544
- President.   - You guys just came back from Qingyu Hall, right?

64
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:43,020
You found out already?

65
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:48,330
You also found out about his background, right?

66
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,402
President, I...

67
00:04:57,484 --> 00:05:00,239
I've been sick lately.

68
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,599
My ears,

69
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,109
they're failing me all of a sudden.

70
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,280
My eyes,

71
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,080
they're failing me as well!

72
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,879
I became deaf and blind out of the blue!

73
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,237
Look! It's acting up again!

74
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:14,797
President, look! I can't see now.

75
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:16,548
Enough already.

76
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:18,448
Wang Qi Nian,

77
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,608
regarding Qingyu Hall and his identity,

78
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:23,200
if you dare to tell anyone about it...

79
00:05:24,788 --> 00:05:27,413
Understood. I shall take my leave.

80
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,364
Understood!

81
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,549
I trust Qi Nian.

82
00:05:33,662 --> 00:05:35,012
Why did you try to intimidate him?

83
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,830
You were the one intimidating me.

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,710
- What did I do?   - You're not utilizing the help of Qingyu Hall.

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,764
What will you do about the Imperial Treasury's debt?

86
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,799
So, were you the one who arranged for Qingyu Hall to help me out?

87
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,999
The Imperial Treasury incurred a huge loss.

88
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,549
How could His Majesty not know about it?

89
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,559
So, it was His Majesty's arrangement.

90
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,879
Therefore, the palace can't afford to fork out the money.

91
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,669
It's the same for the Ministry of Revenue.

92
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,400
His Majesty had something in reserve.

93
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,869
He wanted to use Qingyu Hall

94
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,280
to help you take over the Imperial Treasury.

95
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,640
It's a huge gift.

96
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,350
But you returned it to him.

97
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:10,159
However, if we do so,

98
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,830
all the shopkeepers in Qingyu Hall

99
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,479
will be done for.

100
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,033
My mother wouldn't do something like that.

101
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,669
Therefore, I wouldn't do it either.

102
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:24,528
Your courage is commendable.

103
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,599
It's commendable.

104
00:06:27,943 --> 00:06:29,653
But where will you get the money from?

105
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,270
I have my own way of getting the money.

106
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:35,030
But before that, I'll go on a honeymoon trip.

107
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,119
A what?

108
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,559
A honeymoon trip.

109
00:06:51,774 --> 00:06:54,042
Your Majesty, Fan Xian has arrived.

110
00:06:57,015 --> 00:07:00,879
- Your Majesty.   - I heard that you'll be going on a honey...

111
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,880
A honeymoon trip. I'm here to apply for leave.

112
00:07:03,198 --> 00:07:04,558
- Where will you be going?   - Mount Cang.

113
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,522
- For how long?   - I haven't decided yet.

114
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,960
The longer the better.

115
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,922
Your Majesty, why is that the case?

116
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,922
There's one thing.

117
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,960
I'm afraid

118
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,030
there might be a change of plans.

119
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,999
Your Majesty, but my marriage...

120
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:33,997
It has nothing to do with that.

121
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,590
After giving it some thought,

122
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,842
I think you shouldn't

123
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,082
take over the Imperial Treasury.

124
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,799
Your Majesty, you think I can't fill the 20-million-tael hole?

125
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,669
It's over 20 million taels.

126
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,350
That's not a small sum.

127
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,309
Will you take over Qingyu Hall?

128
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,429
If so, there's no way for you to fill the hole.

129
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,922
The Ministry of Revenue has run out of money

130
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,350
after our battle against Northern Qi.

131
00:08:07,462 --> 00:08:09,933
Now, there are disasters everywhere.

132
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,879
The money in the Imperial Treasury

133
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:15,205
isn't used to cover the deficit of the Ministry of Revenue.

134
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,220
It also serves to relieve disaster and pacify the people.

135
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:21,629
Therefore, I think

136
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,599
you shouldn't

137
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,642
jump into the pit.

138
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,520
Fan Xian,

139
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:28,903
it's time for you to let go.

140
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,910
This isn't child's play.

141
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,029
It implicates all kinds of national affairs.

142
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,269
And, this is His Majesty's order as well.

143
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,962
That's right.

144
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,789
This is my order.

145
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,989
If so, all the more I can't let go of it.

146
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:52,279
Your Majesty, instructing me to take over the Imperial Treasury

147
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,880
was your order as well.

148
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,482
Your Majesty, your order represents the truth.

149
00:08:55,563 --> 00:08:56,799
How can it be changed that easily?

150
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,839
If so, how can you acquire the trust of your subjects

151
00:08:58,934 --> 00:09:01,004
and the people?

152
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,793
Therefore, I'll cover the Imperial Treasury's deficit.

153
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:05,640
I'll relieve all the disaster victims.

154
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,109
Your Majesty, your order

155
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,140
shouldn't be changed.

156
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,760
How dare you resist my order?

157
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,749
Your Majesty, I've already received your order.

158
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,294
If all the disaster victims were to come here...

159
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,765
I shall present you with my head.

160
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,909
That's an overstatement.

161
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,719
However,

162
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,710
you'll be demoted to a commoner.

163
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:44,681
No.

164
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,389
You shall be sent to prison.

165
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,629
Your Majesty, thank you for your grace.

166
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,629
I shall take my leave now.

167
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,029
Why don't you think again?

168
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:24,029
Where did he get all his confidence from?

169
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,989
Maybe it's from Mount Cang.

170
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,520
Mount Cang?

171
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,749
Maybe Ye Qing Mei left behind

172
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,190
a huge fortune for him.

173
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,789
Both she and her son are eccentric indeed.

174
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,199
I'll let him be.

175
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,880
Commander Jing, we meet again.

176
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,240
I'm the deputy commander.

177
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,159
My Lord,

178
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,710
it's our friend.

179
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,880
It's our friend indeed.

180
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,240
Under President Chen's order,

181
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,909
the Black Cavalry are to escort you to Mount Cang.

182
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,400
Commander Jing.

183
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,159
I'm the deputy commander.

184
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,559
It's the same thing.

185
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:43,159
Sorry for the trouble.

186
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,679
Let's depart.

187
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,602
We haven't figured out a solution to the Imperial Treasury's debt yet.

188
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,590
How could you be in the mood for a trip?

189
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,559
The more dire the situation is,

190
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,430
the more we should go on a trip.

191
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,470
Is there a hidden stash in Mount Cang?

192
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,040
There's no hidden stash in Mount Cang.

193
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,430
But I can think of a solution and attract money to Mount Cang.

194
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,679
How?

195
00:12:49,918 --> 00:12:51,268
Ruo Ruo, this is bad.

196
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,470
We're surrounded by the Black Cavalry.

197
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,029
Xian is the chief inspector.

198
00:12:55,471 --> 00:12:56,751
It's normal for them to be here.

199
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,550
So, they're here to protect us?

200
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:05,448
Ruo Ruo,

201
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:08,079
how did you become so strange

202
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,990
ever since Fan Xian appeared?

203
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,830
Initially, you were the top maiden of the capital.

204
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:15,599
You recited poems and read books.

205
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:17,037
What are you doing right now?

206
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,640
Why are you stabbing a toad?

207
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,640
This is a frog.

208
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,559
Isn't it the same? Why are you stabbing a frog?

209
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,664
What do you know?

210
00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:25,122
We call this dissection.

211
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,989
Ruo Ruo, must you do it in the carriage?

212
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,319
My hands will only be stable

213
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,679
if I practice this in the carriage.

214
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,065
- What's the use of mastering this skill, then?   - Xian taught me this.

215
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,002
He said all medical practitioners need to master this skill.

216
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:38,406
Are you trying to be a vet here?

217
00:13:39,543 --> 00:13:41,253
Do not speak when you're ignorant about the topic.

218
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,029
But Ruo Ruo,

219
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,830
Xian is something else too.

220
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,545
He and Wan Er

221
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,319
are here for a honeymoon trip, if I'm not mistaken.

222
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,710
Why did he take us with him?

223
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,760
You wish to know why?

224
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:03,208
If you wish to know,

225
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,600
go and ask him yourself.

226
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,922
Thanks for nothing.

227
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,590
Commander Jing, please stop for a moment.

228
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:16,945
Fan Si Zhe.

229
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,159
Come to my carriage.

230
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,199
Look at him.

231
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,760
All right. Let's go.

232
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:39,482
Wan Er.

233
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,402
Why are you pulling a long face?

234
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,079
My return from Northern Qi is confidential.

235
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:47,240
But everyone in the world will find out if he shouts for me like this.

236
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,400
My whereabouts have been exposed.

237
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,760
Do you think you can hide your return from the Overwatch Council?

238
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,002
There are no outsiders here. Don't worry.

239
00:14:53,471 --> 00:14:54,900
Is he controlling everything now?

240
00:14:55,038 --> 00:14:57,519
- Stop messing around. This is important.   - Go ahead.

241
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,741
Do you know why I told you to come to my carriage?

242
00:14:59,877 --> 00:15:01,000
I don't.

243
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,989
It's because your sister-in-law is worried about me.

244
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,959
I'll get off the carriage first.

245
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,559
Your sister-in-law is worried about the Imperial Treasury's deficit.

246
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,839
I have to give her peace of mind, right?

247
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,079
How can I do so?

248
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,642
By employing your help.

249
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:13,943
Don't use me as your excuse.

250
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,430
You were worried about me.

251
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,439
Didn't you intend to hold an auction

252
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,838
when I was getting married?

253
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,149
Now, it's your time to shine.

254
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,120
The opportunity was already over.

255
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,040
I wanted to put the guest invitation up for auction back then.

256
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,719
The wedding is already over. How can I still hold an auction?

257
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,880
Once we reach Mount Cang's manor,

258
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,319
you'll be responsible for arranging the venue

259
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,679
and the procedures.

260
00:15:33,252 --> 00:15:36,104
Okay! We'll hold another wedding for you in Mount Cang.

261
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:38,482
- Isn't that extortion?   - Don't listen to his nonsense.

262
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,839
Our wedding will only be held once.

263
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,760
This is a name list containing the names of all shop owners

264
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,149
in the capital.

265
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,950
Invite them to Mount Cang.

266
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,002
Why should they come?

267
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,402
Yeah. Why should we go there?

268
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,389
I don't understand either.

269
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,922
Why should we go there?

270
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,629
Let's gather at Mount Cang and admire the beautiful scenery.

271
00:16:06,777 --> 00:16:08,057
He does put it nicely, huh?

272
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,002
I'm sure all of you know

273
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,629
what he's intending to do.

274
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,109
The Imperial Treasury has a huge deficit.

275
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,389
Everyone in the capital knows about that.

276
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,820
A new broom sweeps clean.

277
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:24,530
Now, he's trying to sweep us.

278
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:26,776
I'll say the same thing.

279
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:29,341
Why should we head to Mount Cang?

280
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,909
I caught a cold today.

281
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,640
It's inconvenient for me to travel far.

282
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:41,885
He's the poetic genius.

283
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,280
He's an important official too.

284
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,322
Now that he's inviting us,

285
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,882
all of us have to go.

286
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,950
I'll be honest here.

287
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,509
Even if all of us are included,

288
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,439
do you guys think we can gather 20 million taels?

289
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:55,839
I don't have any money.

290
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,000
Not me either.

291
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,482
Even if you're penniless,

292
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,509
Lord Fan just got married not long ago.

293
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,309
We have to give him a wedding gift somehow.

294
00:17:04,444 --> 00:17:05,724
You're right.

295
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:07,799
We can go there.

296
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,670
We can prepare a wedding gift for him as well.

297
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:12,110
But as for the sum,

298
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,519
that depends on fate.

299
00:17:13,614 --> 00:17:15,564
That's right. We'll only prepare a wedding gift for him.

300
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,319
We'll prepare nothing else.

301
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,960
Everyone,

302
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,029
I already went to the Censorate.

303
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:27,655
All those impartial officials in the Censorate

304
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:30,039
were infuriated upon hearing this news.

305
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,562
They said they would submit a bloody memorial to the throne

306
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,279
and get rid of the crook

307
00:17:35,374 --> 00:17:36,762
if Lord Fan dares to extort money from us.

308
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,029
Guys, at least we don't need to fear him as much now.

309
00:17:39,152 --> 00:17:40,431
We can head to Mount Cang with peace of mind.

310
00:17:40,512 --> 00:17:42,982
Brother, you're thoughtful indeed.

311
00:17:44,224 --> 00:17:46,333
Were the officials in the Censorate

312
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,000
truly infuriated?

313
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,670
They were extremely infuriated.

314
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,670
They even had bloodshot eyes.

315
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,839
Guys, what do we call this?

316
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,110
- We call this a pleasant surprise from the heavens!   - That's right!

317
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,269
Fan Xian has gotten too full of himself.

318
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,273
Now, he's gathering all the merchants in the capital

319
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:08,198
so that he could extort money from them

320
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:11,562
- to cover the Imperial Treasury's deficit.   - That's right.

321
00:18:11,645 --> 00:18:13,919
Fan Xian is vicious and ruthless!

322
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,360
- That's right.   - This isn't a bad thing.

323
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,160
Fan Xian kept saying that he would eradicate corruption.

324
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,320
In the end?

325
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,519
He was a corrupt official himself!

326
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:25,110
- That's right!   - Serves him right!

327
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,759
Everyone, once we receive news from Mount Cang,

328
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,039
let's impeach him together!

329
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,560
That's right! Let's impeach him!

330
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,719
- We have to impeach him!   - Impeach him!

331
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:34,562
We have to work together

332
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,029
and get rid of this corrupt official for Qing Kingdom's sake!

333
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,162
- Get rid of him for Qing Kingdom's sake!   - Get rid of him!

334
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,999
Get rid of him!

335
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,960
- Bottoms up.   - Bottoms up.

336
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,301
Clean it thoroughly. There's dirt on it.

337
00:19:24,382 --> 00:19:26,002
I'll hold you accountable if our guests have diarrhea.

338
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:28,482
Chop all of these up.

339
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,839
Chop them thoroughly.

340
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,590
Seems like you're busy.

341
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,798
Xian, you're finally here. You invited so many guests.

342
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:37,041
I have to hire people to feed all of them.

343
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:38,479
That's why we're busy preparing food.

344
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,039
Not bad at all. This looks pretty organized.

345
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,082
Come. I have something for you.

346
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,522
Someone named He Zong Wei

347
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,642
told me to deliver this to you.

348
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,719
He said the Censorate has their eyes on Mount Cang now.

349
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,600
They said they would impeach you at any time. What should we do?

350
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,920
Have you delivered all of the invitations?

351
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,198
I have. Those merchants were planning to move out soon.

352
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:59,150
I think they'll reach here soon.

353
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,399
Xian,

354
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,759
be honest with me.

355
00:20:04,862 --> 00:20:06,173
Do you intend to rob them?

356
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,322
If so, we'll become bandits, you know?

357
00:20:08,403 --> 00:20:09,683
If not, how can we extort money from them?

358
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,160
We're not extorting money from them.

359
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,242
We'll make them hand their money to us of their own accord.

360
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,343
It's either they lost their minds or you lost your mind.

361
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,879
Sit down.

362
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,910
Si Zhe, coincidentally, you're quite gifted at doing business.

363
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:24,478
I'll tell you about the things I've learned.

364
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,916
- Tell me if it'll work or not.   - It won't.

365
00:20:25,997 --> 00:20:27,038
I haven't even spoken yet.

366
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:29,349
No matter what it is, it won't earn you 20 million taels.

367
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,430
Have you ever considered

368
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:36,029
the meaning of wealth?

369
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,680
I'm sure you've lost your mind.

370
00:21:05,278 --> 00:21:06,364
Shopkeeper Li.

371
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:08,772
- Shopkeeper Wang.   - Please.

372
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:10,360
- Shopkeeper Su.   - Shopkeeper Wang.

373
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,519
Come.

374
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,879
Please.

375
00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:15,122
- All of them are here.   - You guys are here.

376
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,800
- Shopkeeper Ma.   - Shopkeeper Liu.

377
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,600
- Good morning.   - Good morning.

378
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,800
- Please.   - Please.

379
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:21,880
- Let's go.   - Please.

380
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,230
I'm almost done.

381
00:21:30,446 --> 00:21:31,770
It's getting late.

382
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:32,913
I'll get ready to receive them.

383
00:21:32,994 --> 00:21:35,202
Xian, do you plan on

384
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,710
telling them that?

385
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:38,498
What do you think?

386
00:21:38,578 --> 00:21:39,625
This is a new concept.

387
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:42,162
It's also a redefinition of the meaning of wealth.

388
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,520
I don't think it'll work.

389
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,846
Did I not express myself clearly?

390
00:21:47,927 --> 00:21:49,207
Or could you not understand me?

391
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:51,122
You did express it clearly.

392
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,559
I did understand you as well.

393
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:54,807
It's outstanding and shocking.

394
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:56,769
- But it won't work.   - Why?

395
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:57,929
Xian,

396
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,522
you may understand the meaning of wealth,

397
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,522
but you don't understand the capital.

398
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:03,599
If you tell them about it in that manner,

399
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,870
I'll make a bet with you that they won't buy it.

400
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,678
- So?   - So, you may proceed first.

401
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,800
If it doesn't work out, you can call me.

402
00:22:10,911 --> 00:22:12,191
I'll help you out.

403
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,959
Are you that confident in yourself?

404
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,080
But you have to help me out.

405
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,560
You have to buy me some time.

406
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,120
I have to send my men back to the capital to acquire an item.

407
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,269
All right. I can definitely buy you some time.

408
00:22:22,459 --> 00:22:24,682
- But what are you going to acquire?   - That's a secret.

409
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,762
- Please, everyone.   - No one should fork out any money.

410
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,320
Everyone,

411
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,762
we must stick to what we agreed before.

412
00:22:40,846 --> 00:22:42,239
- No one should fork out any money.   - Keep your promises.

413
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,162
- Please, everyone.   - Please, everyone.

414
00:22:44,276 --> 00:22:45,920
Remember, stick to what we agreed upon.

415
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,679
- Please, everyone.   - Don't fork out any money.

416
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,802
Everyone, please stick to what we agreed upon.

417
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:53,442
You guys too. Don't fork out any money. Remember that.

418
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,722
- We can give him a wedding gift.   - Guys.

419
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:00,002
What were you whispering to them?

420
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:03,198
I told them to stand firm.

421
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:08,261
If Lord Fan wants to extort money from us using his wedding as an excuse,

422
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,039
giving him a wedding gift will be enough.

423
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:12,652
- He wants money? I don't have any.   - Me too.

424
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:13,741
All of us don't have any money.

425
00:23:13,822 --> 00:23:15,102
That's right.

426
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,799
What's going on?

427
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,039
- Why has the sky grown dark?   - What's going on?

428
00:23:29,882 --> 00:23:31,162
He's here.

429
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,399
Hello, everyone.

430
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:43,838
A pleasure to meet you all.

431
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:46,092
I am Fan Xian.

432
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,320
I know what you guys are thinking.

433
00:23:48,423 --> 00:23:50,372
That's why I'll make a disclaimer first.

434
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:53,061
My wedding is already over.

435
00:23:53,142 --> 00:23:54,973
I won't be taking any wedding gifts today.

436
00:24:01,295 --> 00:24:02,575
Of course,

437
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,269
I'm sure all of you are most concerned

438
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,642
about the Imperial Treasury's deficit.

439
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,430
I'll say this first.

440
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:09,590
Regarding the Imperial Treasury's deficit,

441
00:24:09,671 --> 00:24:11,981
whether in terms of law or reason,

442
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,710
I should be the one covering it.

443
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,682
If that's the case,

444
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,239
I guess we were worried for nothing.

445
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,719
Think again.

446
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:23,322
If that were the case,

447
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:24,880
why would he invite all of us to come?

448
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,240
Precisely.

449
00:24:26,944 --> 00:24:29,562
- Let's listen to him.   - I'm sure you guys are perplexed.

450
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:30,971
If that's the case,

451
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,077
why did I invite all of you guys here?

452
00:24:34,158 --> 00:24:35,244
That's right.

453
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,442
In this world, every so often,

454
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:42,242
a miracle beyond its time is born.

455
00:24:43,512 --> 00:24:45,842
Sometimes, it's a person.

456
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,482
Sometimes, it's an object.

457
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,440
Sometimes,

458
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,029
it might even be a concept.

459
00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:55,682
- What's a concept?   - Concept?

460
00:24:55,854 --> 00:24:58,205
I think it's a kind of thought.

461
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,920
A kind of thought?

462
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,162
Isn't it lucky for us

463
00:25:02,263 --> 00:25:05,002
to be able to witness the birth of a miracle

464
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,349
while we're still alive?

465
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,080
Therefore, I've invited all of you guys here

466
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,964
to deliver this fortunate moment

467
00:25:11,183 --> 00:25:13,653
to all of you personally.

468
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,670
All of you will get to witness

469
00:25:16,928 --> 00:25:18,522
the birth of a miracle.

470
00:25:21,048 --> 00:25:22,922
What is he up to again?

471
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,682
Look. What is he doing?

472
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:30,363
What is he doing?

473
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:35,402
You, great question.

474
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,882
What should we name this miracle?

475
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,722
Who asked him that question?

476
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,399
Please take a look.

477
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:49,162
That's right. It's called a treasury bond.

478
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:50,928
Treasury bond? What's that?

479
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:52,482
Treasury bond?

480
00:25:52,616 --> 00:25:54,519
- What is that?   - Belt? Whose belt?

481
00:25:54,603 --> 00:25:57,095
What belt? He said treasury bond.

482
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,537
Doesn't that word represent debt?

483
00:25:58,622 --> 00:26:00,052
It's treasury bond.

484
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:24,090
We met before this.

485
00:26:39,928 --> 00:26:41,208
Are you Mr. Wu Zhu?

486
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,079
Are you looking for Xian?

487
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,320
I'm looking for you.

488
00:26:44,407 --> 00:26:45,687
Me?

489
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:46,959
That's right.

490
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,039
Right now, everyone is in the main hall.

491
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:50,475
They're listening to Fan Xian.

492
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,399
The timing is just right.

493
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,760
Everyone,

494
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,589
so, what's the meaning of a treasury bond?

495
00:27:00,206 --> 00:27:02,196
As the name implies,

496
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:04,592
it's a bond of debt

497
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,959
given out by the treasury.

498
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,239
The treasury bond

499
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:10,364
can be seen as the Imperial Treasury's debt.

500
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:12,640
You see?

501
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,519
In the end, he still came back to the same topic.

502
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,879
He did.

503
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,270
As all of you know, I own Danbo Bookstore.

504
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:20,870
I've spent some effort

505
00:27:21,255 --> 00:27:23,485
and printed out the first batch of treasury bonds.

506
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,950
Each of these bonds

507
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,762
represents a portion of the Imperial Treasury's debt.

508
00:27:28,866 --> 00:27:30,959
The amounts and terms vary for each bond.

509
00:27:31,062 --> 00:27:33,213
And these differences in amounts and terms

510
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,402
correspond to different corresponding details.

511
00:27:36,518 --> 00:27:38,518
Of course, I won't explain the details

512
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:40,080
on stage.

513
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,430
The meeting will be written down and distributed to all of you.

514
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,589
Let's just talk about the important points.

515
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,439
With this,

516
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:48,640
you'll own a portion

517
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,479
of the Imperial Treasury's debt.

518
00:27:50,575 --> 00:27:52,646
What does that mean?

519
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,442
Let's take this bond as an example.

520
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,162
This bond is worth 5,000 taels.

521
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,362
That means you spend 5,000 taels

522
00:27:58,452 --> 00:28:00,560
to become one of the Imperial Treasury's debtors.

523
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,920
On the surface, you're paying the debt on the Imperial Treasury's behalf.

524
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,402
But in reality, you'll get back your money plus interest

525
00:28:06,514 --> 00:28:09,120
when the Imperial Treasury makes a profit in the future.

526
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,279
Not just that,

527
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:12,175
but these bonds are tradable and can be circulated.

528
00:28:12,256 --> 00:28:13,454
When it's necessary,

529
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:16,253
it can also be redeemed for cash early according to the rules.

530
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,160
Everyone knows what's going on.

531
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:20,439
He's just forcing us to cover the Imperial Treasury's deficit.

532
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,799
That's right.

533
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,242
All 20 million taels' worth of bonds are here.

534
00:28:25,655 --> 00:28:26,669
Bids will be accepted.

535
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,030
The one with the highest bid will make the purchase.

536
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,279
What does that mean?

537
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,999
That means if someone else offers 6,000 taels when you offer 5,000 taels,

538
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,042
that person will purchase the bond instead of you.

539
00:28:34,452 --> 00:28:35,465
That's ruthless of him.

540
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:37,349
He'll make more than 20 million taels here.

541
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,239
If so, what's the minimum number of bonds we need to purchase?

542
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:40,764
You purchase them of your own accord.

543
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,002
First come, first served. The sale ends when everything's sold out.

544
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,120
Of our own accord?

545
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,279
Only fools will buy it.

546
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,639
Precisely.

547
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,402
You guys may also ask me this question:

548
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,230
"I'm spending money to purchase these bonds

549
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,282
to cover the Imperial Treasury's debt.

550
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,910
So, what's in it for me?"

551
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:04,039
To answer that,

552
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,989
we have to answer the first question I asked you all.

553
00:29:06,139 --> 00:29:08,958
All of you are experienced merchants.

554
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,390
I have a question for you all.

555
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,029
What is wealth?

556
00:29:22,415 --> 00:29:24,044
This is wealth.

557
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,882
So, wealth consists of silver taels?

558
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,959
Both gold and silver taels are included.

559
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,319
You're wrong.

560
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,880
Gold and silver taels are only tools for you to measure your wealth.

561
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,240
They aren't wealth itself.

562
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,920
What do you mean by that?

563
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:38,239
The silver tael you were holding just now,

564
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,030
it was around one liang, right?

565
00:29:40,142 --> 00:29:41,242
Almost.

566
00:29:41,476 --> 00:29:42,756
How much rice can you buy with it?

567
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,399
Around two dan.

568
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:48,309
But there will be some fluctuations.

569
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,239
We have to view the prices in the rice shops every day.

570
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:53,430
That means we can buy two dan of rice

571
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,759
with one liang of silver tael in the Qing Kingdom today.

572
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:59,199
That's the standard of measurement.

573
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,950
Lord Fan, aren't you stating the obvious here?

574
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,759
I went to Northern Qi some time ago.

575
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:06,120
I assume all of you have heard about it.

576
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,560
My Lord, you dominated Northern Qi with your might.

577
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,989
You were the young hero, am I right?

578
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,160
In Northern Qi,

579
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,950
you can only buy one dan of rice with one liang of silver tael.

580
00:30:14,477 --> 00:30:15,757
You see?

581
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,430
One liang of silver taels

582
00:30:17,575 --> 00:30:20,056
has different values in Northern Qi

583
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,439
and the Qing Kingdom.

584
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,390
Northern Qi was defeated by the Qing Kingdom

585
00:30:23,495 --> 00:30:24,655
during our battle.

586
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:26,719
Naturally, the price of their rice would increase.

587
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,079
That's right.

588
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,360
Disasters and wars

589
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,430
will affect the prices of our commodities.

590
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:34,799
Guys, why don't you consider this?

591
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:37,390
What if you guys are in Northern Qi now?

592
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:39,390
How much of your so-called wealth

593
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,439
will be retained, then?

594
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,829
But the Qing Kingdom is flourishing right now.

595
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,320
We don't need to worry about that.

596
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,682
You're right.

597
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,549
I wouldn't even know about the existence of such a place

598
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:07,390
had you not brought me here.

599
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,762
I lived here before.

600
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,200
That's why I'm familiar with the place.

601
00:31:12,351 --> 00:31:14,471
Why weren't you looking for Xian this time around?

602
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,119
Do you fear death?

603
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,720
Of course I do.

604
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,962
What if you have to face death for Fan Xian's sake?

605
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,680
What's wrong with Xian?

606
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,719
I want you to protect him.

607
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,079
Is Xian in danger?

608
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,630
Someone might be trying to kill him.

609
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,013
That's fine.

610
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:29,470
Xian is a capable martial artist.

611
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:31,190
Besides, he has bodyguards.

612
00:31:32,076 --> 00:31:34,199
That's useless. They're not strong enough.

613
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:35,400
But he has plenty of bodyguards.

614
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,760
The number doesn't make a difference.

615
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:38,880
Is his assailant that powerful?

616
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,269
Who exactly is trying to kill him?

617
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:41,882
Me.

618
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:44,870
The Qing Kingdom has flourished for a long time with peace and stability.

619
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:48,701
That's the foundation of retaining the value of the gold and silver taels.

620
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,242
Therefore,

621
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,870
wealth is more than just gold and silver taels.

622
00:31:53,976 --> 00:31:57,765
It's closely related to the kingdom's fortune and strength.

623
00:31:58,008 --> 00:32:01,238
Guys, what do you all think about the kingdom's fortune, then?

624
00:32:01,335 --> 00:32:03,926
Naturally, the kingdom is prosperous

625
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:06,002
with wise rulers and intelligent subjects.

626
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,399
That's right.

627
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,800
The kingdom's fortune and strength

628
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,279
are the very foundation that sustains wealth

629
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:13,470
and even continuous growth in the future.

630
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,519
(Kingdom strength and fortune constitute wealth)

631
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:18,713
We can see that the Imperial Treasury will do well in the future.

632
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:21,069
Guys, you all should look into the future.

633
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:22,804
What if you guys possess the treasury bonds?

634
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:24,359
What does that mean?

635
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,000
That means

636
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,190
you all are long-term investors who'll never incur any losses.

637
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,829
This is too good to be true.

638
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:42,080
I think... Excellent.

639
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,082
Lord Fan, that was an excellent display.

640
00:32:44,189 --> 00:32:46,960
- You understood him, right?   - I...

641
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,037
I understand what he was talking about.

642
00:32:49,118 --> 00:32:51,119
Lord Fan, your words

643
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,320
were deafening

644
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,560
and enlightening!

645
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,920
That's right!

646
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,760
Guys,

647
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,789
do you all know who Lord Fan is?

648
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,748
He's an important official of the kingdom.

649
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,589
He's in the Overwatch Council.

650
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,390
And now, he has taken over the Imperial Treasury.

651
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:07,442
He already said so himself.

652
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,042
Don't you guys understand what he's trying to get at?

653
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,520
Lord Fan,

654
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:13,190
for your...

655
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,202
What was that again? Treasury bond?

656
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,639
I'll pay 200 taels for it.

657
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:18,922
You can take it as your wedding gift.

658
00:33:22,486 --> 00:33:24,183
Lord Fan has devoted so much effort

659
00:33:24,264 --> 00:33:26,190
to cover the Imperial Treasury's deficit.

660
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:27,400
He has done so much for us.

661
00:33:27,488 --> 00:33:29,517
How dare you give an offer of 200 taels?

662
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:32,079
My Lord, I'll fork out 500 taels.

663
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,789
- I'll buy it right now.   - All of us will buy it, then.

664
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,379
I'll fork out 300 taels.

665
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,060
Seems like all of us are excited.

666
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,039
Lord Fan, the treasury bond represents a debt, right?

667
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:52,280
But you don't need to repay us for it.

668
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,069
Yeah.

669
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,069
I'll fork out 5,000 taels.

670
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,882
What? 5,000 taels?

671
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,589
What is he thinking?

672
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,640
Did you guys

673
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,030
not understand what I was saying just now?

674
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,322
I understand now.

675
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,829
The kingdom's fortune is tied to you alone.

676
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,949
Supporting you is our unquestionable duty.

677
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:22,682
My Lord, did you not understand my intention?

678
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,442
I plan to donate 5,000 taels to your cause.

679
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,349
Seems like they didn't understand me at all.

680
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,922
I need a substitute for the second half.

681
00:34:32,284 --> 00:34:34,562
Wait. Let me reorganize what you said.

682
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,282
According to what you said,

683
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:38,630
you lost your memories in Jiangnan

684
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,999
and killed countless people because of it?

685
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,359
That's about it.

686
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,269
If so, is it possible

687
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,720
that you might not be the culprit?

688
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,280
That's possible as well.

689
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,280
If so, everything's fine, then.

690
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,349
However, if such a person does exist,

691
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:53,590
he should be as strong as me.

692
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,082
May I ask you a question?

693
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,599
How strong are you?

694
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,030
I can hold my own against a grandmaster.

695
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,240
You want me to protect my brother

696
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,760
and fend off a grandmaster?

697
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,829
I'm not telling you to fend him off. I'm telling you to kill him.

698
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,802
You have to kill a grandmaster.

699
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,230
Maybe you have to kill me.

700
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:13,042
- Mr. Wu Zhu, I don't know any martial arts.   - I know that.

701
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,860
How could a normal person fight against a grandmaster?

702
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:17,682
What do people rely on

703
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,080
to change the world?

704
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,680
Courage?

705
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,120
Intelligence?

706
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:27,919
Beauty?

707
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,999
And tools.

708
00:35:44,975 --> 00:35:46,802
This was meant for my brother.

709
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,999
Why do you have it?

710
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,519
I brought it here.

711
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,082
Did you steal it?

712
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:53,920
If I can no longer trust myself,

713
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:56,909
I need someone else to protect Fan Xian on my behalf.

714
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,710
So, the tool inside is capable of hurting a grandmaster?

715
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:08,602
Have a seat.

716
00:36:08,704 --> 00:36:10,534
Here, have a seat.

717
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:17,799
What is he doing on stage?

718
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:20,959
Everyone,

719
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,442
were the dishes to your liking?

720
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:26,869
Tell me if you don't like any of them.

721
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,371
I'll tell them to make something else.

722
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:31,118
Who's that?

723
00:36:31,503 --> 00:36:33,174
I think that's Fan Si Zhe.

724
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:35,829
Wasn't he kicked out of the capital due to his crime?

725
00:36:35,984 --> 00:36:37,373
Are you seeking death?

726
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:39,439
I don't know him.

727
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,479
All right. Just leave it here.

728
00:36:42,574 --> 00:36:43,802
You two may leave.

729
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:47,642
Firstly, let me introduce myself.

730
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,742
I'm a young merchant

731
00:36:49,823 --> 00:36:53,172
who's fanatical about doing business.

732
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,039
I heard that all kinds of merchants would be here today.

733
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:58,002
A lot of my seniors are here.

734
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,999
Initially, I wanted

735
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:01,802
to learn from your experiences.

736
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,562
But I never expected

737
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,959
my brother...

738
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,242
I mean, Lord Fan, who's famous throughout the kingdom,

739
00:37:09,376 --> 00:37:11,046
to deliver a speech

740
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:13,550
that has enlightened everyone here.

741
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:16,789
It serves as a wake-up call.

742
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,309
It was such an excellent speech.

743
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,562
I wonder what Lord Fan's brain looks like.

744
00:37:21,643 --> 00:37:23,082
I wonder what's inside.

745
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,190
How did he come up with all of these ingenious ideas?

746
00:37:25,716 --> 00:37:27,282
During his speech,

747
00:37:27,426 --> 00:37:28,906
he said wealth

748
00:37:28,987 --> 00:37:31,550
was more than the gold and silver taels we possess.

749
00:37:31,674 --> 00:37:33,638
The kingdom's fortune and strength

750
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:36,869
constitute continuous growth in the future.

751
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,947
That was such an excellent statement.

752
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:41,429
We've truly benefited from it.

753
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,199
I think you guys should think about it

754
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,479
and try to study it.

755
00:37:46,566 --> 00:37:50,237
You guys might discover a new field.

756
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:53,590
We are already deeply moved

757
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,469
and inspired.

758
00:37:56,947 --> 00:37:58,320
I think you guys can

759
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,680
experience more of such emotions.

760
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,990
Just now, Lord Fan asked you all a question.

761
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,200
If so,

762
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,230
I, a junior,

763
00:38:06,343 --> 00:38:09,412
will be asking you guys a question boldly as well.

764
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,999
Please go ahead.

765
00:38:11,086 --> 00:38:12,366
I'll proceed, then.

766
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:17,030
Who does the Imperial Treasury belong to?

767
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,710
The imperial family.

768
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:21,200
The imperial family, right?

769
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,519
If so, who owns the money in the Imperial Treasury?

770
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,240
The imperial family.

771
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,240
If so, the Imperial Treasury's debt...

772
00:38:27,335 --> 00:38:29,404
It will also be the imperial family's debt, then.

773
00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:30,855
Excellent words.

774
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,630
Guys, think about it.

775
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,710
If you do purchase the treasury bond,

776
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,630
doesn't that mean you're sharing the imperial family's burden with them?

777
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:41,389
To put it nicely,

778
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,840
those who purchase the treasury bonds

779
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,630
will be sharing His Majesty's burden with him.

780
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,230
This may sound disrespectful.

781
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,888
Please don't tell anyone else about this.

782
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:53,568
If you do purchase the treasury bonds,

783
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:56,710
doesn't that make you one of His Majesty's debtors?

784
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,080
Am I right?

785
00:38:58,433 --> 00:39:00,274
Please don't tell anyone that I said that.

786
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,230
Therefore, please think about it.

787
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:04,478
Once you purchase the treasury bonds,

788
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:06,362
what would other people think about you

789
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,760
when you do business out there?

790
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,280
Let's talk about the same trade here.

791
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,559
Would you do the trade with someone with a treasury bond

792
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,190
or someone without a treasury bond?

793
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,630
Therefore, the treasury bond serves to boost your confidence.

794
00:39:19,194 --> 00:39:20,682
He does have a point.

795
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,230
It does sound interesting when he puts it as such.

796
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,990
Mister, you're right.

797
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,630
Lord Fan was the one who came up with this brilliant idea.

798
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,402
As long as the people exist, the government will thrive.

799
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:34,309
I'm sure all of us admire

800
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,829
Lord Fan's graceful demeanor.

801
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:43,280
As long as the people exist, the government will thrive, huh?

802
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:44,442
That's right.

803
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,346
The opposite is true as well.

804
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:48,720
Are you guys worried

805
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,119
that my promise wouldn't count

806
00:39:50,214 --> 00:39:52,165
if I were to be toppled?

807
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:55,190
Lord Fan, please resolve our doubts.

808
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:56,919
Don't ask me that.

809
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,479
Ask him.

810
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:01,070
He's responsible for the second half.

811
00:40:02,297 --> 00:40:03,408
All right.

812
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:05,230
That's a good question.

813
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,230
Lord Fan, your answer was excellent too.

814
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:08,842
As long as the people exist, the government will thrive.

815
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:09,999
The opposite is true as well.

816
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,240
What does that mean?

817
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:12,639
That means if he's gone,

818
00:40:12,841 --> 00:40:15,241
who will you collect your debt from?

819
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,442
This may not sound pleasant,

820
00:40:16,523 --> 00:40:19,400
but if Lord Fan were to be toppled one day,

821
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,039
all of the money you've invested into the bonds

822
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,949
will go down the drain as well, am I right?

823
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,990
He's right about that.

824
00:40:26,332 --> 00:40:28,682
Guys, don't be anxious.

825
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,640
Please take a look.

826
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:36,562
(Eternal Union)

827
00:40:37,051 --> 00:40:38,882
I'm sure you guys knew

828
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,482
that His Majesty wrote these four words

829
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,190
and delivered it

830
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,599
to the Fan Residence

831
00:40:46,725 --> 00:40:48,005
during Lord Fan's wedding.

832
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,242
I'll ask you this.

833
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,469
Out of all the noble families in the capital,

834
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,030
which of them has ever received

835
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:59,070
a plaque with a phrase written by His Majesty himself before?

836
00:40:59,508 --> 00:41:00,948
- Is there one?   - No.

837
00:41:01,029 --> 00:41:02,430
Lord Fan is the only one.

838
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:03,547
He's the only one!

839
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:06,550
I'll ask you guys this. How do you read these words?

840
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:08,990
Eternal Union.

841
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,519
What's the meaning of eternal?

842
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,882
100 years.

843
00:41:12,157 --> 00:41:15,347
It cannot be considered 100 years even if it's only one year short.

844
00:41:15,526 --> 00:41:18,522
These words represent the pact

845
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:21,510
between His Majesty and Lord Fan.

846
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,590
It represents His Majesty's trust in the Fan family.

847
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,439
It's also an opportunity for you guys

848
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,949
to ascend to higher ranks in the future.

849
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:30,789
You guys should think twice.

850
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,590
This is the only opportunity you'll get.

851
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,079
You might have to wait until the next century to have a chance

852
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:39,349
to establish a connection with the imperial family next time.

853
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,282
Someone,

854
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,389
deliver the plaque back to the residence.

855
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:47,519
Thank you all for coming.

856
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:56,200
Everyone, we've already said

857
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,560
what we needed to say.

858
00:41:58,199 --> 00:41:59,280
It's getting late.

859
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,469
I'm afraid it's quite late for you to rush back to the capital.

860
00:42:01,969 --> 00:42:04,372
You guys can spend the night here if you don't mind.

861
00:42:04,453 --> 00:42:05,962
You guys can head back tomorrow.

862
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:07,762
As for the treasury bonds,

863
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,962
I'll keep my promise.

864
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,880
The sale ends when the treasury bonds are sold out.

865
00:42:12,961 --> 00:42:14,241
You may purchase them of your own accord.

866
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,400
Wasn't it locked?

867
00:42:25,055 --> 00:42:27,322
It was locked before this. I unlocked it.

868
00:42:28,425 --> 00:42:29,730
How do I use this?

869
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:33,882
It lacks a main component.

870
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:36,349
You'll only get the full item if you combine them.

871
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,479
Main component?

872
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,839
Combine them?

873
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:44,749
Why does it sound like a musket?

874
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,349
Mr. Wu Zhu, a musket won't do.

875
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,880
It's troublesome, hard to aim,

876
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,079
and inferior to bows and arrows.

877
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:51,439
I can't damage a grandmaster with this.

878
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:52,760
You can.

879
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,389
Does such a musket actually exist?

880
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:55,760
This musket is different.

881
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,040
It was brought here by Young Lady.

882
00:42:57,121 --> 00:42:58,211
From where?

883
00:42:58,287 --> 00:42:59,567
The Divine Temple.
