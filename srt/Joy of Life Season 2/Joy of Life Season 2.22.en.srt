00:01:25,242 --> 00:01:30,965
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:34,093
(Episode 22)

3
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,719
Do you plan to stand there all day long?

4
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,519
Don't pull a long face.

5
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,569
Young man,

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,250
you can't afford to be down.

7
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,999
Someone reported you to me.

8
00:01:47,165 --> 00:01:49,005
Was it about me silencing someone?

9
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:51,183
I've heard about it.

10
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,569
Did you do it?

11
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:02,398
If I really did it,

12
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,530
would you arrest me?

13
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:09,280
If you want to punish me,

14
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,880
you shouldn't come and see me now.

15
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,799
If you want to bend the law for your own benefit,

16
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
that's more reason for you not to see me.

17
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:21,258
Giving opportunities for scandals.

18
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,679
You might get complained.

19
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:29,701
If you are the one who killed them,

20
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,639
I won't be able to face Wan Er

21
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,945
if I arrest you myself.

22
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,399
But if I bend the law,

23
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:42,001
I won't be able to face my conscience.

24
00:02:44,895 --> 00:02:46,325
You are still

25
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:48,845
not cruel enough.

26
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:52,002
So, was it you?

27
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,362
In the last Spring Imperial Examination,

28
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,242
replacing one's name with another.

29
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:07,122
I do seem to recall that.

30
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,600
Seem?

31
00:03:08,742 --> 00:03:10,662
After all, it's nothing serious.

32
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,760
There was no need for me to do it.

33
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,600
So, did you arrange it?

34
00:03:17,742 --> 00:03:18,992
I didn't.

35
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,280
Governing a kingdom as you would cook a small fish.

36
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,930
How can you cook a small fish

37
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,802
if you keep overdoing it by murdering?

38
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,160
It's not worth it.

39
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,157
Do you think this is

40
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:35,082
- a false accusation? - It might not be necessary.

41
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:38,280
I've been on the political scene for many years.

42
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,602
I've had many proteges and acquaintances.

43
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:42,230
I can't even recognize them.

44
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,842
I don't know whether they are good or evil.

45
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,002
There must be bad ones

46
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,849
and stupid ones among them.

47
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:53,295
These are the people who were in charge of

48
00:03:53,383 --> 00:03:54,726
the Spring Imperial Examination back then.

49
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,411
If there was a murder, begin your investigation with them

50
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,402
and you might find something.

51
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,210
- Is it really not you? - Absolutely.

52
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,040
Did the victim's family find you in person?

53
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,349
Yes.

54
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,927
His Majesty just gave you the duty of the past examination's investigation

55
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,258
to you a few days ago,

56
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,686
and you have a murder case immediately.

57
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,678
What a coincidence.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,519
In that case,

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,800
these names

60
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,519
might not be good enough.

61
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,242
The case involves many people.

62
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,811
We will escort all of you to the Court of Judicial Review.

63
00:04:53,976 --> 00:04:55,057
When we arrive,

64
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:56,520
we will question you again.

65
00:04:56,668 --> 00:04:58,828
Remember. At the hall of the Court of Judicial Review,

66
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,922
there's no need to panic and overthink.

67
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,242
The Overwatch Council will be in charge.

68
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,889
- Understand? - Yes.

69
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,209
Yes.

70
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,463
Why are you pulling this?

71
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,322
I have nothing to do anyway.

72
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,722
President.

73
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,122
Ruo Hai, you're here.

74
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,850
What is it?

75
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,002
Do you know about Fan Xian's investigation?

76
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,490
I do.

77
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,562
Lin Ruo Fu has been the chancellor for many years.

78
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,242
He has many proteges.

79
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,440
A young man won't be enough to investigate him.

80
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:32,591
He already said

81
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,722
what you just mentioned.

82
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,759
The words we use

83
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:39,246
are almost identical.

84
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,009
Keep talking.

85
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,760
Lin Ruo Fu is Fan Xian's future father-in-law.

86
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,759
No matter what,

87
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,562
you shouldn't let Fan Xian investigate it.

88
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,442
Regardless of the result,

89
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:52,077
how will Fan Xian live with that in the future?

90
00:06:52,207 --> 00:06:53,607
I also said the same thing.

91
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,119
What else did you say?

92
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,450
I'm asking

93
00:06:56,687 --> 00:06:59,407
if you should get someone else to investigate Chancellor Lin's case.

94
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,759
There's no one else.

95
00:07:06,908 --> 00:07:08,158
What do you mean?

96
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,854
You are so free that you are playing with ropes.

97
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,850
Let me do it.

98
00:07:17,427 --> 00:07:18,548
Give me the case.

99
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:20,189
I'll investigate it for the young ones.

100
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,880
Why go through the trouble?

101
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,922
He's not from the Yan family.

102
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:28,932
You want him to take over the Overwatch Council.

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,250
Elders like us

104
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:32,482
should protect him more or less.

105
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,850
I think it works.

106
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,088
Someone from the Ministry of Revenue like you

107
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,182
should not meddle in the Overwatch Council's matters.

108
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:39,456
You can't take the case.

109
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:40,799
Why?

110
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,720
They appointed Fan Xian by name.

111
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:44,991
Isn't it the same no matter who investigates the case?

112
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,239
The Overwatch Council doesn't fool around.

113
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,239
Isn't asking Fan Xian to investigate Lin Ruo Fu

114
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,671
an act of fooling around?

115
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:53,008
He's right.

116
00:07:56,318 --> 00:07:58,039
Both of you agree with each other?

117
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,930
What is the reason?

118
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,360
The reason is simple.

119
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,200
Fan Xian must investigate this case.

120
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,305
I'm sure both of you understand

121
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,282
the might of Heaven's will.

122
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,810
This matter

123
00:08:15,102 --> 00:08:16,545
won't be able to save him.

124
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:48,618
How about a bowl of wontons?

125
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:50,522
- It's freshly wrapped? - Yes.

126
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,450
Take a seat.

127
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,714
Wontons.

128
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,362
Wontons. Hot wontons.

129
00:09:11,378 --> 00:09:13,002
Paper kites!

130
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:15,922
Take a look at newly-made kites!

131
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,082
Unruly woman!

132
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,042
Unruly woman!

133
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:30,082
Who are you to oppose Chancellor Lin?

134
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,842
Chancellor Lin was kind to me.

135
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,762
Today, I must repay his kindness.

136
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,090
Arrest him!

137
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,082
After him! Don't let him escape!

138
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,722
I feel so afraid.

139
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:05,567
It's so scary.

140
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,760
Lord Yan,

141
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,359
evidence of the assassination.

142
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,850
Are you injured?

143
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,882
The Overwatch Council is reputable.

144
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,122
With Lord Yan and everyone here,

145
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,599
the people are relieved.

146
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,842
Lord Yan, I think that was Yuan Hong Dao.

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,160
Chancellor Lin's protege.

148
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,490
Don't doubt yourself.

149
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,210
It's him.

150
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,002
Do people see others as pigs

151
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,239
in recent years?

152
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,090
You may leave.

153
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,716
Mr. Yuan tried to murder them during the journey?

154
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,574
It was an attempted murder.

155
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:05,665
The crime is confirmed.

156
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,520
Indeed.

157
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,362
Mr. Yuan has been my protege for many years.

158
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,482
I can't prove my innocence now.

159
00:11:19,558 --> 00:11:22,162
Why would Mr. Yuan do that?

160
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,280
I thought

161
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,359
you would ask me

162
00:11:28,318 --> 00:11:30,359
if I was the one who instructed it.

163
00:11:30,494 --> 00:11:31,854
You are not a fool.

164
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,800
How unexpected.

165
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,239
Mr. Yuan

166
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,082
has been hiding his identity

167
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,002
for so many years.

168
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,800
I didn't realize.

169
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,479
Who is he working for?

170
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,160
It's no longer important now.

171
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,490
- My Lord, where are we going? - Xinyang.

172
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:33,042
Keep going. Don't stop.

173
00:13:33,118 --> 00:13:34,282
Yes.

174
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,802
Headed to Xinyang?

175
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,522
Princess Yun Rui's territory?

176
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,842
Is Yuan Hong Dao a spy for Princess Yun Rui?

177
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,922
Fan Xian investigates the case and Princess Yun Rui sets a trap.

178
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,362
Regardless, other people did that.

179
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:23,280
It's not related to that person.

180
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,169
I'll assume

181
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,119
I didn't hear what you said just now.

182
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,522
Even if you hear it, I still won't admit it.

183
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,882
President.

184
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,002
Even the Black Cavalry is following.

185
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:43,893
Are you not going to arrest Yuan Hong Dao?

186
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:45,885
Chancellor Lin went to the palace.

187
00:14:47,313 --> 00:14:48,915
Fan Xian went as well.

188
00:14:50,282 --> 00:14:52,362
Why is he putting his nose in this matter?

189
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,239
He has no choice.

190
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,602
It seems like

191
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:00,402
Fan Xian is going to punish his own family.

192
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,719
Is he arresting Lin Ruo Fu

193
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,082
to meet His Majesty?

194
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,951
Lin Ruo Fu has been an official for many years.

195
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:07,522
He has many proteges.

196
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,280
In that case,

197
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,040
They will hate Fan Xian.

198
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,375
There's nothing to be afraid of.

199
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,944
Many people hate me too.

200
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,416
How old are you and how old is he? Can you even compare that?

201
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,690
There's no need to be afraid.

202
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,202
Chancellor Lin has seen decades of turmoil.

203
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,079
He understands everything.

204
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,409
In this situation,

205
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:32,762
can Chancellor Lin still protect himself?

206
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,320
He has a choice.

207
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,409
Fan Xian,

208
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,040
when we meet His Majesty later,

209
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:53,719
don't butt in no matter what I say.

210
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,479
Just ignore everything.

211
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,280
I don't think I should go in.

212
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:58,553
That won't do.

213
00:15:58,677 --> 00:15:59,927
You must be present.

214
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,799
If we could catch Yuan Hong Dao

215
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,790
and get him to admit that someone ordered him to do it,

216
00:16:03,814 --> 00:16:05,064
we might have a way out.

217
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:08,166
If the Overwatch Council wanted to catch someone,

218
00:16:08,494 --> 00:16:10,374
it would've already caught that person.

219
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,680
Both of you. I'm still here.

220
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:16,758
You can tell everything we said to His Majesty honestly.

221
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,160
That is how we show that we have nothing to hide.

222
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,479
Both of you, please talk about this in private.

223
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,006
A just person is selfless.

224
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:34,817
What did I tell you just now?

225
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,642
Later, I shouldn't interrupt

226
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:39,362
no matter what you say in front of His Majesty.

227
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,122
If His Majesty asks for your opinion,

228
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,122
just play dumb.

229
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:46,162
Chancellor Lin.

230
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,642
We are honest

231
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:49,074
and selfless.

232
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,233
Do you remember?

233
00:16:54,854 --> 00:16:56,495
You must watch

234
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,280
and learn from this act.

235
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,850
In the future,

236
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:03,935
you will be doing the play with His Majesty.

237
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,999
Your Majesty.

238
00:17:22,102 --> 00:17:24,302
Chancellor Lin and Lord Fan are here.

239
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,880
Quick! Offer a seat for Chancellor Lin.

240
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,400
Chancellor Lin, I've read many booklets.

241
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,959
The talents have been used correctly in the Qing Kingdom.

242
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,239
It is thriving.

243
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,719
This is all thanks to you.

244
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,239
You deserve all the credit.

245
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,049
Did I

246
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,080
make it fall?

247
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,080
Chancellor Lin,

248
00:17:58,175 --> 00:17:59,322
sit.

249
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,802
I'm old.

250
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,722
My eyes are blurred.

251
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,479
I accidentally offended Your Majesty.

252
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:13,959
Please punish me.

253
00:18:14,837 --> 00:18:16,398
I told you.

254
00:18:16,582 --> 00:18:18,522
Your contributions are indispensable.

255
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,600
You are innocent.

256
00:18:21,062 --> 00:18:23,303
Your Majesty, I can't repay you even if I die a hundred deaths

257
00:18:23,327 --> 00:18:26,408
with how you are treating me.

258
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,722
I'm talking about a hundred deaths

259
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,440
and not dying in vain.

260
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:38,202
Why are you talking about deaths for no reason?

261
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,609
The day

262
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:42,002
will still come one day for us.

263
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:44,659
Chancellor Lin, you are in the prime of your life.

264
00:18:45,743 --> 00:18:47,282
It's still too early to say this.

265
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,490
Chancellor Lin,

266
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,202
I'm afraid

267
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,650
you came here

268
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,202
for a different reason than usual.

269
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,410
Your Majesty,

270
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:11,545
I've committed a crime.

271
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,682
Stand up and tell me.

272
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,130
I have been

273
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:23,322
working hard all these years.

274
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,199
I'm physically and mentally exhausted.

275
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:29,391
Now, I'm full of gray hair and plagued with illnesses.

276
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,840
I cannot contribute to the kingdom with my body anymore.

277
00:19:33,635 --> 00:19:35,322
Doing nothing in my position

278
00:19:35,431 --> 00:19:38,151
makes me anxious somehow.

279
00:19:38,488 --> 00:19:41,642
Your Majesty, please allow me

280
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,120
to retire.

281
00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:51,210
Plagued with illnesses?

282
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,842
- Fan Xian. - Yes.

283
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,200
Do you think Chancellor Lin is telling the truth?

284
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,239
Your Majesty, I'm young and don't understand clearly.

285
00:20:05,326 --> 00:20:07,006
Didn't you study medicine?

286
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,631
I study poison.

287
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:11,115
- Do you know how to check his pulse? - Yes.

288
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:13,703
Come and check Chancellor Lin's pulse

289
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:15,368
to see what illnesses he has.

290
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,849
Your Majesty,

291
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,920
I guess I can.

292
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,522
What do you mean?

293
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,151
I can't sense anything abnormal from his pulse.

294
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,440
Old age is not a symptom.

295
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:00,849
Chancellor Lin.

296
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,840
Didn't you say you were plagued by illnesses?

297
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:14,762
I knocked the stool down.

298
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:17,042
Didn't Your Majesty see it just now?

299
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,400
My eyes can't see anymore.

300
00:21:20,206 --> 00:21:21,456
Fan Xian,

301
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,402
can you see from my pulse

302
00:21:23,597 --> 00:21:25,678
that my eyes don't work anymore?

303
00:21:25,774 --> 00:21:27,024
I can't.

304
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:31,242
I acted rudely in front of His Majesty.

305
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,082
If I don't have a vision illness,

306
00:21:33,183 --> 00:21:35,202
wouldn't it be a crime worthy of death?

307
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,039
After all,

308
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,002
I've served Your Majesty for many years.

309
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,239
I just hope I can be buried in my hometown when I die.

310
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,930
Chancellor Lin,

311
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,199
you've achieved many things.

312
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,750
If you leave,

313
00:21:49,862 --> 00:21:51,742
all the officials

314
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:54,360
might resign as well.

315
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,202
Your Majesty is wrong.

316
00:21:56,751 --> 00:21:59,871
I've held a high position

317
00:22:00,503 --> 00:22:02,822
and enjoyed a luxurious life.

318
00:22:02,974 --> 00:22:05,282
Serving the kingdom is what I should do.

319
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,640
How can I call it an achievement?

320
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:09,294
I am only lucky

321
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:11,602
to not make any mistakes.

322
00:22:12,338 --> 00:22:14,258
You have contributions so you can make mistakes.

323
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:16,349
They cancel out each other.

324
00:22:16,495 --> 00:22:18,701
I'm old. I can't afford to make any mistakes.

325
00:22:18,782 --> 00:22:21,861
Your Majesty, please grant my request.

326
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,519
I'm reluctant to see you go.

327
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:32,529
I will be grateful

328
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,999
to the point of crying.

329
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,646
If you leave,

330
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:39,479
who can become the chancellor?

331
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,200
Your Majesty

332
00:22:41,982 --> 00:22:44,781
should make this important decision.

333
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:47,880
I dare not give any opinion.

334
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,519
Among the officials in the imperial court,

335
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:54,309
there's no one else who's better than you

336
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,920
when it comes to knowledge and farsightedness.

337
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,999
Indeed.

338
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,039
If someone is better than me,

339
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,279
I won't be holding

340
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:06,562
the position of Chancellor for all these years.

341
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,442
If I say someone can take over my position,

342
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,242
what does it mean?

343
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,560
It means I don't have a good eye for talent.

344
00:23:16,671 --> 00:23:17,990
Which is why

345
00:23:18,534 --> 00:23:20,813
Your Majesty won't make a mistake

346
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,559
with your eye for talent.

347
00:23:23,663 --> 00:23:27,262
So, the position of Chancellor is still yours.

348
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,479
Unfortunately, I'm old.

349
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:33,959
There's no need to worry, Your Majesty.

350
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,602
After I retire,

351
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,442
Your Majesty can take your time to choose slowly.

352
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,120
I'm sure you can find the leader of officials

353
00:23:43,207 --> 00:23:44,966
who is most suitable for Your Majesty.

354
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,849
Chancellor Lin,

355
00:23:53,207 --> 00:23:54,762
you have many proteges

356
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,360
under you.

357
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,242
Which of them can be entrusted with important responsibilities?

358
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,362
Can you give me a list

359
00:24:02,471 --> 00:24:05,030
so I can promote one of them in the future?

360
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:08,442
I'm an upright official.

361
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,360
I don't do that.

362
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,479
Chancellor Lin, you know about this. Right?

363
00:24:15,848 --> 00:24:17,089
I dare not.

364
00:24:17,888 --> 00:24:21,402
Your Majesty's eye for talent is a lot better than mine.

365
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,680
I dare not.

366
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,842
When will you leave?

367
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,559
I'll leave the capital immediately.

368
00:24:32,464 --> 00:24:34,663
Fan Xian and Wan Er's wedding is coming.

369
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:36,080
Won't you wait for a while more?

370
00:24:36,161 --> 00:24:39,361
No. I'm eager to return home.

371
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,769
What a pity.

372
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,202
Chancellor Lin,

373
00:24:43,313 --> 00:24:47,103
are you going back home alone?

374
00:24:58,182 --> 00:25:00,142
As Your Majesty wishes,

375
00:25:00,223 --> 00:25:01,473
I will

376
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,239
return home alone.

377
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:08,202
My son is mentally handicapped.

378
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,039
The journey is far.

379
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,039
I'm afraid he might have an accident if we return home.

380
00:25:13,142 --> 00:25:14,392
So,

381
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,600
I won't be

382
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,559
bringing this child along.

383
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,089
Fan Xian,

384
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,282
Da Bao is close to you usually.

385
00:25:26,478 --> 00:25:28,797
I need to trouble you to take care of him.

386
00:25:28,885 --> 00:25:31,805
I'll find someone to send him to your house one day.

387
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,120
Of course, I won't treat you badly.

388
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,829
All his expenses is here.

389
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,160
That's not necessary.

390
00:25:39,334 --> 00:25:41,455
You mustn't deduct his meal expenses.

391
00:25:42,078 --> 00:25:44,879
His Majesty is the witness.

392
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:50,009
Chancellor Lin.

393
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,849
Let me send you off.

394
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,009
Your Majesty.

395
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,880
This wily old fox.

396
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,719
He is even setting up a trap before he leaves.

397
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,522
Uncle, are you going to retire?

398
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:44,322
What is the result

399
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:46,282
of Yang Wan Li's name being replaced

400
00:26:46,511 --> 00:26:48,082
on the roll of honor?

401
00:26:49,694 --> 00:26:51,242
The Minister of Rites, Guo Zheng,

402
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,962
has been banished to Jiangnan by His Majesty.

403
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,981
Only Guo Zheng is banished

404
00:26:56,062 --> 00:26:58,082
for cheating in the Spring Imperial Examination.

405
00:26:58,805 --> 00:27:00,966
Does it mean the investigation ends in nothing?

406
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,759
There's only one result.

407
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:06,999
Let you investigate the fraud cases from previous years

408
00:27:07,804 --> 00:27:10,217
and use the murder case to send me off.

409
00:27:10,694 --> 00:27:12,894
His Majesty's plan of wanting to replace the chancellor

410
00:27:13,023 --> 00:27:14,623
has been brewing for a long time.

411
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,602
So, every step he took

412
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,882
was for your sake?

413
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:38,662
It was prepared for me.

414
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,790
I was wondering

415
00:27:44,597 --> 00:27:48,118
why he made you the central official.

416
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:50,680
I finally get it now.

417
00:27:51,896 --> 00:27:54,936
The Spring Imperial Examination was organized for my sake.

418
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,319
Prince Cheng Ze thought he set you a trap,

419
00:27:57,431 --> 00:28:01,111
but His Majesty used Prince Cheng Ze for his own plans.

420
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,790
His Majesty used someone without leaving any traces behind.

421
00:28:05,775 --> 00:28:08,455
His Majesty's skill of using someone else for his own benefit

422
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,415
has reached perfection.

423
00:28:13,854 --> 00:28:15,855
You need to learn from him.

424
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,522
This is too difficult.

425
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,080
I might not be able to learn it.

426
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:25,200
It's actually not that hard.

427
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:26,800
Honestly speaking,

428
00:28:26,881 --> 00:28:28,361
being an official

429
00:28:28,671 --> 00:28:29,998
is like acting in a play.

430
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:32,759
The singing intent is true and has a stable mentality.

431
00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:34,383
That's all there is to it.

432
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:35,849
Let me give you a test.

433
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,200
Why did His Majesty

434
00:28:39,358 --> 00:28:42,239
want me to give him a list of names of my proteges and acquaintances?

435
00:28:44,907 --> 00:28:46,467
You've been a chancellor for many years

436
00:28:46,508 --> 00:28:47,758
and have a wide network.

437
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:48,920
Giving him a list

438
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,440
will make sure he avoids choosing people with your influence.

439
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:55,080
That is why I can't give him the list.

440
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,680
My network

441
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,042
is the foundation of my achievements.

442
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,202
As long as I don't hand over the trump card,

443
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:07,525
I will still have an opportunity to return to the capital.

444
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,442
Won't His Majesty question you by force?

445
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,680
What I meant was

446
00:29:13,873 --> 00:29:14,979
the interaction between the ruler and his officials

447
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,562
is like a game of chess.

448
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,015
When you play, have a stable mentality

449
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,482
but be ruthless when you play.

450
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:25,159
We know but we don't say it.

451
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,959
If you don't tell me,

452
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,260
I won't understand all of these.

453
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,319
Let me give you another test.

454
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,239
Why did I leave Da Bao here?

455
00:29:36,939 --> 00:29:39,309
- For my sake? - I've gathered many connections

456
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:41,719
over the years.

457
00:29:43,062 --> 00:29:44,462
After leaving,

458
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:47,559
my proteges might be unsatisfied with you.

459
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,840
After all, you were the one who caused this.

460
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,680
Something like this

461
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:57,120
is hard to explain.

462
00:29:57,697 --> 00:30:00,496
If Da Bao is in my home, there's no need for an explanation.

463
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,319
Your Majesty let you force me away

464
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:05,840
because he wants you to become a lone subject.

465
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,810
- I understand. - You understand nothing.

466
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,802
What His Majesty wants

467
00:30:22,943 --> 00:30:24,482
isn't what you want.

468
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:31,069
What is the most exciting thing

469
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,920
for officials like us?

470
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:38,160
Isn't it to go against His Majesty?

471
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,600
I lost my fight.

472
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,120
Next,

473
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,080
it's your turn.

474
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,882
Uncle, not so loud.

475
00:30:58,963 --> 00:31:01,682
Fine. I'm someone who is leaving.

476
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,559
It's all right if I laugh.

477
00:31:06,846 --> 00:31:08,526
What about the candidate's murder?

478
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,880
What murder?

479
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:12,080
There's no murder!

480
00:31:35,574 --> 00:31:37,602
He Zong Wei, receive the imperial edict!

481
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,640
On His Majesty's orders, as a scholar, He Zong Wei

482
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:52,406
is outstanding

483
00:31:52,534 --> 00:31:54,242
in terms of talent, virtue, and wisdom.

484
00:31:54,393 --> 00:31:55,919
This is extremely rare,

485
00:31:56,031 --> 00:31:57,830
and you are given a special order

486
00:31:57,927 --> 00:31:59,522
to become an official without an exam.

487
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:02,759
He will become a censor at the Censorate.

488
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:04,797
He will start immediately.

489
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:08,840
Long live Your Majesty!

490
00:32:09,431 --> 00:32:10,750
Do well.

491
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:13,642
His Majesty has high hopes for you.

492
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:18,442
I'm willing to work my heart out

493
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:20,402
and sacrifice my life

494
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,239
to serve His Majesty!

495
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,479
Everyone,

496
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:44,042
you may stand.

497
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:45,769
Stand up.

498
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,082
Stand up, everyone.

499
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,439
Let's go.

500
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,440
Let's go back. I'm so scared.

501
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,842
Lord Yan.

502
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,922
From now on, we are both officials,

503
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,329
Please take good care of me.

504
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,442
You should still go to the Court of Judicial Review.

505
00:33:06,077 --> 00:33:07,543
The Court of Judicial Review?

506
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:10,362
The trial of the murder case.

507
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:13,039
Have you forgotten?

508
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,679
We are not suing anymore, Lord Yan.

509
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,602
Are you underestimating the law?

510
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,650
Lord Yan, you've misunderstood.

511
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,089
Lord Yan,

512
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:26,462
the victim's widow is too sad.

513
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,202
She is too exhausted to continue anymore.

514
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,600
As Lord He mentioned,

515
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,722
I'm not suing anymore.

516
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,362
Look.

517
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:40,962
Human lives are at stake.

518
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,082
It's not child's play.

519
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:45,802
That's too serious, Lord Yan.

520
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:48,655
It's not against the law because the case hasn't been filed.

521
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:50,278
We only disturbed Lord Fan.

522
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:52,766
I will apologize to Lord Fan at his residence later.

523
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:55,202
Lord Yan, please forgive us.

524
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,559
Wontons! Hot wontons!

525
00:34:01,034 --> 00:34:02,284
Lord Yan.

526
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,529
Why don't I

527
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,042
make a complaint about myself

528
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,119
and ask His Majesty for punishment?

529
00:34:13,374 --> 00:34:14,624
How's that?

530
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,162
Are you going to forget about

531
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,236
the assassination attempt just now as well?

532
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:28,049
If we can forgive others,

533
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:29,802
we should be magnanimous.

534
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:31,911
What do you think?

535
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,073
Let's return to the First Bureau!

536
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,600
Farewell, Lord Yan.

537
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:33,242
Why did they leave suddenly?

538
00:35:35,117 --> 00:35:37,482
That means the negotiation at the capital is over.

539
00:35:37,795 --> 00:35:40,595
They followed us the whole way. I thought they were going to catch us.

540
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,522
If the negotiation fails, we will be captured.

541
00:35:43,705 --> 00:35:45,562
Does it mean that it's fine now?

542
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,570
We are fine today.

543
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,682
The future depends on fate.

544
00:35:58,188 --> 00:35:59,438
Ruo Hai.

545
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:00,682
The axle.

546
00:36:00,872 --> 00:36:02,122
The axle.

547
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,090
The axle is going to fall.

548
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:08,399
Can't you let someone else repair this?

549
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,119
I can't leave this to other people.

550
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:12,039
Do you think someone will steal it?

551
00:36:12,134 --> 00:36:14,242
Other people can't touch this.

552
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,639
Why?

553
00:36:15,789 --> 00:36:17,110
It hides a secret.

554
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,240
Isn't it a chair with two wheels installed?

555
00:36:21,327 --> 00:36:23,122
What kind of secret can it hold?

556
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,042
Lord Fan, can you give me a hand?

557
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:39,760
Is this good enough?

558
00:36:39,886 --> 00:36:41,136
Ruo Hai.

559
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,522
The other side.

560
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,090
- The other side. - Are you done?

561
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:47,000
I'll pay you a fee.

562
00:36:50,101 --> 00:36:52,142
Lord Fan, I need to trouble you again.

563
00:37:15,094 --> 00:37:17,615
Lin Ruo Fu's case is concluded just like that?

564
00:37:19,549 --> 00:37:22,931
As a chancellor for years, his influence is all over the imperial court.

565
00:37:23,012 --> 00:37:24,732
What would you do if you were in his shoes?

566
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,402
With an imperial court like this,

567
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:32,322
how could you still let Fan Xian take over the Overwatch Council?

568
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,010
He can handle it.

569
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:37,280
Ruo Hai.

570
00:37:37,406 --> 00:37:38,656
On top. Yes.

571
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,359
Do you know

572
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,282
who should retire next?

573
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:48,929
You can't retire.

574
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:52,332
Fan Xian has a weak foundation. You need to help him.

575
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,409
Lord Fan.

576
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,162
I still need you to help me hold this.

577
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,242
Lord Fan.

578
00:38:13,512 --> 00:38:15,482
I shouldn't have brought Fan Xian

579
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:16,929
to the capital.

580
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,560
This isn't something we can control.

581
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:32,202
President.

582
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:33,969
It's fixed.

583
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:41,482
Lin Ruo Fu was chancellor for a long time.

584
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:43,638
You are also the same.

585
00:38:43,727 --> 00:38:45,008
Haven't you thought about

586
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,762
leaving this place unharmed?

587
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,399
I still have unfinished business.

588
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,010
What is it?

589
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,602
I need to find your wages.

590
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:06,640
You play badly today.

591
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:11,289
Playing here

592
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:13,144
makes me panic.

593
00:39:25,311 --> 00:39:26,682
- Da Bao. - Father.

594
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:29,442
When you live in Fan Xian's house,

595
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,442
you must be good.

596
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,200
Remember to greet other people.

597
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:35,638
Don't worry. I will be good.

598
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,790
Tidy up your clothes.

599
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,363
You must keep yourself clean.

600
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,399
Don't quarrel with others.

601
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,359
If you feel aggrieved,

602
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,080
just tell Fan Xian and Wan Er.

603
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:50,928
Understand?

604
00:39:51,327 --> 00:39:53,935
Don't worry. Both of them will help me.

605
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,266
Da Bao,

606
00:39:55,766 --> 00:39:57,642
you might not understand

607
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,480
what I'm going to say next

608
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,520
but it's all right.

609
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,320
You just need to remember it in your heart.

610
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:06,366
Remember.

611
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,319
People change.

612
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,520
People change.

613
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,680
No matter what other people say,

614
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,794
don't believe them.

615
00:40:18,238 --> 00:40:22,119
You just need to believe in Fan Xian and Wan Er.

616
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:23,519
Understand?

617
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,359
I'll only believe Xian and Wan Er.

618
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:30,680
You can only call him Xian

619
00:40:30,991 --> 00:40:32,602
in private in the future.

620
00:40:33,054 --> 00:40:36,122
It's better not to call him Xian when others are present.

621
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:41,602
I'm afraid Fan Xian is not happy.

622
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:44,159
He won't, Father.

623
00:40:44,324 --> 00:40:46,844
Xian won't get angry because of that.

624
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,759
Of course, I believe in Fan Xian and Wan Er.

625
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,040
Otherwise, I won't...

626
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,640
But just in case...

627
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,439
I'm just saying this just in case.

628
00:41:03,576 --> 00:41:04,826
One day,

629
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:08,600
if they don't like you so much

630
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,680
and don't like to speak with you,

631
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,759
just try to be quiet.

632
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,839
Speak to yourself

633
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,042
and play with yourself.

634
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:22,439
Just stay there

635
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,640
and live slowly.

636
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,562
Just like playing a game

637
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,839
that tries to disturb someone as little as possible.

638
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:34,329
Understand?

639
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,799
Why?

640
00:41:37,614 --> 00:41:38,849
Father.

641
00:41:39,276 --> 00:41:41,516
Why do they not like me?

642
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,562
I don't think they will dislike you.

643
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,839
I'm just saying it just in case.

644
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,680
I understand.

645
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:53,642
People change.

646
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,000
Da Bao, you are so smart.

647
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,040
Even if that day comes,

648
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,719
it's all right.

649
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:06,682
In this world,

650
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,722
no one is born to treat you well.

651
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:16,160
No one in this world is born to treat me well.

652
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,799
I'm an exception.

653
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:21,642
You are an exception.

654
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,439
Yes.

655
00:42:23,581 --> 00:42:25,182
I am an exception.

656
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:26,919
You are an exception.

657
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:32,030
You are an exception!

658
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,610
Good.

659
00:42:40,245 --> 00:42:41,877
It's small and can be placed here.

660
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:43,126
Put it inside. Hurry.

661
00:42:43,222 --> 00:42:44,822
Go and bring Da Bao here from my father.

662
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,482
Leave a space for Da Bao.

663
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,570
Stop!

664
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,802
You can't touch this.

665
00:42:57,246 --> 00:42:59,002
Da Bao is inside this.
