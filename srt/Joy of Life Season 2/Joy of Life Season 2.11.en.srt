00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,990
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:34,000
(Episode 11)

3
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:36,695
It doesn't matter if he enters the ancestral hall or not.

4
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,002
His surname is still Fan.

5
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:40,819
As for the troubles he got into, I'll educate him on it.

6
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,040
If he does get in trouble, I'll bail him out.

7
00:01:43,156 --> 00:01:45,459
Your Majesty, that's how he is.

8
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,020
Your Majesty, you're the only one who can tolerate his temper.

9
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,122
I have been understanding and considerate toward all of you,

10
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,019
but

11
00:02:02,278 --> 00:02:04,082
who has been considerate toward me?

12
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,410
What does Your Majesty mean?

13
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,929
Fan Xian and Cheng Ze caused such a commotion in the court,

14
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,922
yet none of you even

15
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,882
tried to mediate.

16
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,620
Why?

17
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:29,012
They accuse him of smuggling, but they have found no evidence.

18
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:31,224
Instead, they turn to investigate corruption.

19
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,882
You're all assisting each other.

20
00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:36,122
Is it really about investigating corruption?

21
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,162
You are

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,162
investigating my son.

23
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:46,713
Do you think I have no regard for our family ties?

24
00:02:46,973 --> 00:02:48,744
I didn't say a word.

25
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,615
It was all Chen Ping Ping backing them up.

26
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,323
Your Majesty, I believe that

27
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:56,162
since this dispute has arisen, we might as well escalate it.

28
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,142
He is my son.

29
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,722
He is also the prince of the Qing Kingdom, Your Majesty.

30
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,985
Prince Cheng Ze has been intelligent since young.

31
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:10,042
He has managed the affairs for many years. Now he is fully fledged.

32
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,282
There's nothing wrong with him.

33
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,609
But there are many with ill intentions around him

34
00:03:17,726 --> 00:03:19,402
who should be cleared out.

35
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,699
Cleared out?

36
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:29,850
You are trying to clear out my son.

37
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:38,439
Only Fan Xian can help Your Majesty purge the corrupt officials.

38
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,886
I'm just worried he may not be valued once the threat is eliminated.

39
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,842
That won't happen, Fan Xian is smart.

40
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,202
He will only use others as tools.

41
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,362
You saw in the court today

42
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,663
how the crown prince's followers fanned the flames.

43
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,802
Fan Xian shouldn't be dragged into such conflicts.

44
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:54,557
It wasn't the crown prince.

45
00:03:54,638 --> 00:03:56,482
They were clearly the crown prince's men.

46
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,958
It wasn't the crown prince.

47
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,442
They work for the crown prince. If not him, then who?

48
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:05,762
The Qing Kingdom has strict laws.

49
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:09,209
I take pride in that.

50
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:14,482
What's that supposed to mean?

51
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,449
Today in the court, there was a sentence that displeased His Majesty.

52
00:04:31,744 --> 00:04:32,745
Which sentence?

53
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:35,364
Your Majesty, you're the ruler of the kingdom.

54
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:37,642
There's nothing you shouldn't review.

55
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:40,567
However, as I lead the Six Ministries,

56
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,321
I'm responsible for sharing your burden with you.

57
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:45,323
Your Majesty, if you're troubled because of this,

58
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:46,857
and if this continues,

59
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:49,322
I'm afraid the Six Ministries will slack off,

60
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:51,567
and no one will respect the law.

61
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,510
There is nothing wrong with those words.

62
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,242
The one who incited the crown prince's followers

63
00:05:00,824 --> 00:05:02,289
was Chancellor Lin.

64
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:05,922
He wants to provoke a fight between the princes.

65
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,762
But how does he

66
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:11,183
benefit from this?

67
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:13,233
He wants to see

68
00:05:13,951 --> 00:05:16,682
who the future ruler of the Qing Kingdom will be.

69
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,642
His vision

70
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,410
is too far-reaching.

71
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,210
It's not just about vision.

72
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,482
It's about overreaching.

73
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,522
Was the list of corrupt officials in the court

74
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:08,848
really compiled by the Overwatch Council?

75
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:10,319
Of course.

76
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:12,712
I guess the people on that list

77
00:06:13,357 --> 00:06:15,322
were not the Overwatch Council's primary targets

78
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,952
but were personally selected by you.

79
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,162
Your Highness is so smart.

80
00:06:27,623 --> 00:06:28,743
You admit it?

81
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,059
Why not?

82
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:32,456
It's our duty to root out traitors, regardless of affiliation.

83
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,689
My personal efforts are nothing more than a part of the Council's honor.

84
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:39,122
All those on that list are under my patronage.

85
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,362
You're really good at picking.

86
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,460
Your patronage?

87
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,682
Your Highness, please forgive me.

88
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,922
As you know, I haven't been in the capital for long.

89
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:56,824
If I may ask,

90
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,575
among the six ministries, nine courts, and various provincial offices,

91
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,362
where exactly does your personal patronage belong?

92
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:06,162
And what is their official rank?

93
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:12,122
Personal connections.

94
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,402
Just

95
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:15,601
friends.

96
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:20,731
That's fine.

97
00:07:20,812 --> 00:07:21,932
Your Highness, don't worry.

98
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,499
Having poor taste in friends does not violate the law.

99
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,362
I'm so glad to hear that.

100
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:28,565
Your Highness, please be more cautious in the future.

101
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,762
My carriage is ahead.

102
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,799
Walk with me a bit.

103
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:40,042
No problem.

104
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:43,179
Walking isn't against the law either.

105
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,410
In good conscience, ever since you came to the capital,

106
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:57,615
I've always admired you, even to the point of confiding in you.

107
00:07:57,886 --> 00:08:00,402
In what? I didn't catch those two words.

108
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:05,071
Even at this stage, I can still take a step back.

109
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,279
I don't mind that you investigate those on the list.

110
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:09,353
I hope it stops here.

111
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,522
One should not go too far.

112
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,682
Your Highness' statement about not going too far is going too far itself.

113
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:16,559
The method and scope of the investigation are in accordance with the law.

114
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:17,962
It cannot be negotiated.

115
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:20,762
If you don't believe me, ask the censors in the Censorate.

116
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:23,082
You're pushing me to death.

117
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:25,500
You didn't violate the law. What are you afraid of?

118
00:08:25,524 --> 00:08:27,444
- I'm not afraid of death. - You are so brave.

119
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:29,689
Everyone in the capital could die,

120
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,242
but not me.

121
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,794
Your Highness, mind your words.

122
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,962
Those who live forever and never die

123
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:50,162
are hard to kill.

124
00:09:01,718 --> 00:09:05,408
Lord Fan, you're in high spirits these days.

125
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:08,362
I abide by the law, so naturally I can live in peace.

126
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,258
It's just that you haven't been in the capital for long.

127
00:09:13,598 --> 00:09:15,202
If you've stayed for a longer time,

128
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:17,207
you will naturally gain more connections.

129
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,962
Your Highness is right.

130
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,722
I came late and had no connections.

131
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,122
Fortunately, I always have some official duties.

132
00:09:34,391 --> 00:09:36,840
No matter what, I won't be alone.

133
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:01,800
I know you sent Fan Si Zhe up north.

134
00:10:15,989 --> 00:10:17,562
Your Highness knows everything.

135
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:22,002
You are so cruel. It's freezing cold there.

136
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,842
How could you send your younger brother to suffer in Northern Qi?

137
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,510
I am soft-hearted and cannot bear to see siblings separated.

138
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:30,962
That's why I sent my men over.

139
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:34,472
By now, they should have brought him back.

140
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,554
Your Highness is sentimental.

141
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,479
If only you were more careful in choosing friends, it would be perfect.

142
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,922
My carriage is ahead.

143
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,362
No need to see me off.

144
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,203
Let's meet again when Si Zhe returns.

145
00:10:47,411 --> 00:10:49,442
- Goodbye. - We have plenty of time.

146
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,060
My Lord,

147
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,442
if they really bring back Young Master Si Zhe,

148
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,282
it would be troublesome.

149
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,959
- Bi An. - Yes, Your Highness.

150
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:35,375
You were right.

151
00:11:36,823 --> 00:11:39,162
- What? - There needs to be a response.

152
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:41,642
We can't appear to be weak.

153
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,240
What should we do?

154
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,510
I heard there was a murder in Moon Embracing Pavilion.

155
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:49,519
Moon Embracing Pavilion?

156
00:11:49,662 --> 00:11:50,882
No, there wasn't.

157
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,242
You just heard of it.

158
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,499
I understand.

159
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:01,802
(Moon Embracing Pavilion)

160
00:12:27,175 --> 00:12:28,762
Help!

161
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:30,442
Help!

162
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:36,058
Help!

163
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,386
Help!

164
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:49,764
What happened?

165
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:51,405
- Quick, let's check on her. - Hurry!

166
00:12:51,694 --> 00:12:53,994
- Let's go! - Go!

167
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,442
(Censorate)

168
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:02,002
According to the list,

169
00:13:02,294 --> 00:13:06,673
there are quite many corrupt officials in the capital.

170
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:16,082
They are all parasites that deserve the death sentence.

171
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:17,237
Do we really investigate?

172
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:19,130
As I look at the list,

173
00:13:19,326 --> 00:13:21,762
many of them have some connections with Prince Cheng Ze.

174
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,802
He's just a prince.

175
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:30,169
As censors, we should have the courage to even accuse His Majesty.

176
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,722
Investigate. Investigate thoroughly.

177
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,078
Let His Majesty see that

178
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:38,162
it's not only the Overwatch Council that can get things done.

179
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,679
There's been a murder!

180
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:41,041
There's been a murder!

181
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,420
There's been a murder!

182
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,738
- Where? - It's a brothel called Moon Embracing Pavilion.

183
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:49,360
Someone beat a courtesan to death at the entrance.

184
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:51,122
That's the Judicial Bureau's business.

185
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:52,722
It has nothing to do with us.

186
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:54,708
The manager of Moon Embracing Pavilion went missing.

187
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:56,463
But she left a letter to the Judicial Bureau,

188
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:59,177
saying that the owner of Moon Embracing Pavilion is Fan Si Zhe.

189
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:02,353
Fan Si Zhe?

190
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:04,801
Fan Jian's son?

191
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,282
Fan Xian's younger brother.

192
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,602
The Fan family runs a brothel?

193
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,642
It is said that they forced women into prostitution.

194
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:18,832
That courtesan's death might have something to do with this.

195
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,479
Has the Judicial Bureau looked into it?

196
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,442
Not just the Judicial Bureau, Fan Xian also went there in person.

197
00:14:23,523 --> 00:14:24,743
Fan Xian?

198
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,770
He's trying to interfere with the Judicial Bureau's investigation.

199
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,922
My Lord.

200
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,420
This woman

201
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,322
was beaten to death.

202
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,130
Many people witnessed it.

203
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,600
The coroner is on his way here.

204
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,760
There should be no deviation in the cause of death.

205
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,282
Also,

206
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,619
Yuan Meng is missing.

207
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,562
The Judicial Bureau is looking into it.

208
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,479
My Lord!

209
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,640
My Lord!

210
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,522
Yuan Meng left a letter,

211
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:10,495
saying that the owner of Moon Embracing Pavilion is Fan Si Zhe.

212
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,530
And that the Pavilion forced women into prostitution and often abused them.

213
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:16,802
This letter was also sent to the Judicial Bureau.

214
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:21,899
Who is the victim?

215
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,719
She's a courtesan from the Pavilion.

216
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:56,580
This is the girl from the Jin family.

217
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,360
Why is she in Moon Embracing Pavilion?

218
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,322
Didn't I give her a contract to release her from servitude and return home?

219
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:05,546
My Lord.

220
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,700
Once a girl enters such a place,

221
00:16:09,631 --> 00:16:12,921
she'll be branded by the brothel for life.

222
00:16:13,743 --> 00:16:15,882
Moreover, with Old Man Jin gone,

223
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:18,362
she has no family to return to.

224
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,002
The murderer

225
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:27,442
deliberately chose her.

226
00:16:27,757 --> 00:16:28,977
My Lord.

227
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:32,553
The guard who witnessed the crime said that

228
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,282
after the three men entered the Pavilion,

229
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,906
they never asked or selected anyone.

230
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,562
As soon as they saw Miss Jin,

231
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,099
they attacked her.

232
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,410
They didn't even ask who she was until they beat her to death.

233
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,482
They just randomly picked her?

234
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,660
Perhaps they didn't care who died.

235
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,339
Right there.

236
00:17:21,163 --> 00:17:22,383
Where is the murderer?

237
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,261
My Lord.

238
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,002
They left after the murder.

239
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,842
We're tracking their whereabouts.

240
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,642
Don't let the murderer leave the capital.

241
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:36,202
Don't worry, My Lord. We will never let these murderers escape.

242
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,460
Qi Nian.

243
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:42,109
Didn't I order you to have someone guard Moon Embracing Pavilion

244
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:43,722
and forbid anyone from entering?

245
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,442
I did, My Lord.

246
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,402
The murderers are extremely skilled.

247
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,330
They want to link this matter to you.

248
00:17:50,423 --> 00:17:52,362
We are totally defenseless.

249
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,882
Because in their eyes,

250
00:17:55,727 --> 00:17:57,682
human life is as insignificant as grass.

251
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,962
It doesn't matter who dies.

252
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,650
Heaven must be appalled.

253
00:18:12,111 --> 00:18:15,522
Deng Zi Yue, spare no effort in capturing Yuan Meng.

254
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,860
Yes, My Lord.

255
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:18,484
Running a private brothel

256
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:22,148
already damages the reputation of court officials and scholars.

257
00:18:22,357 --> 00:18:25,247
Now, they forced women into prostitution and caused a murder case,

258
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,842
it's intolerable.

259
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,242
I'll draft a report.

260
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,279
Report Fan Si Zhe?

261
00:18:33,388 --> 00:18:35,038
It's not just Fan Si Zhe,

262
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:37,528
but also Fan Jian and Fan Xian.

263
00:18:38,103 --> 00:18:40,922
The Fan family has committed such heinous acts.

264
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,082
There must be an explanation.

265
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,402
The corruption investigation is still ongoing,

266
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,181
and many people are already implicated.

267
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:49,183
Are we really going to drag the Fan family into this?

268
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:52,242
It is our duty to investigate all officials.

269
00:18:52,568 --> 00:18:53,682
Regardless of who they are,

270
00:18:53,763 --> 00:18:55,202
we will not back down.

271
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,042
The rain finally stopped.

272
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,002
I hate rainy days.

273
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:05,579
By the way,

274
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:07,282
what's the name

275
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,162
of the dead courtesan?

276
00:19:10,688 --> 00:19:12,082
I don't know.

277
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,762
Shall I go find out?

278
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,202
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

279
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,562
Who will remember her anyway?

280
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,380
Tell me,

281
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,242
how many ants

282
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,370
will die in this rain?

283
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,460
Your Highness, everything is arranged.

284
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,560
When those three murderers are captured, it will be the end of Fan Xian.

285
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,839
- Fan Xian. - What brings you here, Your Highness?

286
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:48,577
I swear to God,

287
00:19:48,702 --> 00:19:50,449
I really don't know where Yuan Meng went.

288
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,069
I have nothing to do with this matter.

289
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:54,160
Don't worry, I will investigate thoroughly.

290
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,460
I won't falsely accuse anyone.

291
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,660
Fan Xian.

292
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,762
I know you're investigating this case.

293
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,289
Could you please not mention my relationship with Yuan Meng?

294
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:06,482
After all, it's a murder case and my reputation is in jeopardy.

295
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,874
Fan Xian, wait a moment.

296
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,922
Please pass my message to Ruo Ruo.

297
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:12,854
Since our marriage was bestowed upon us,

298
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,402
I have never met Yuan Meng again.

299
00:20:14,638 --> 00:20:15,858
Your Highness.

300
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,442
Stop working for Li Cheng Ze.

301
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,322
I don't want the day to come when I have to personally arrest you.

302
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,322
- You wanted to see me? - I've heard about

303
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,320
the incident at Moon Embracing Pavilion.

304
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:05,767
I've caused trouble and implicated our family.

305
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:09,122
Why talk about being implicated? We're a family.

306
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,682
You've done nothing wrong. You don't need to apologize.

307
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:19,098
But don't worry, Fan Si Zhe was sent away in time.

308
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:21,254
There's absolutely no connection between him and the incident.

309
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:23,882
They are not trying to get rid of Fan Si Zhe.

310
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,882
Indeed.

311
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,522
Lai Ming Cheng from the Censorate is preparing another report.

312
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:35,040
- It's his job to do so. - You're not angry?

313
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,842
These censors from the Censorate

314
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,922
are actually not bad.

315
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,442
We could be friends with them.

316
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,602
How do you plan to respond to this accusation?

317
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,320
I won't respond.

318
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,922
Before the culprits are caught,

319
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,199
I won't attend the court.

320
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,682
It's unreasonable.

321
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,140
Dad.

322
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:55,739
Do you

323
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,562
trust me?

324
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:03,779
What do you think about Fan Xian's matter?

325
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,779
Be frank.

326
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,050
Is Your Majesty talking about Moon Embracing Pavilion incident?

327
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,339
Anything.

328
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,660
Okay.

329
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,380
I think

330
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,682
there's something fishy about it.

331
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:24,042
While the court is investigating corruption,

332
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,482
suddenly this Moon Embracing Pavilion incident popped up.

333
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,059
In my opinion,

334
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,722
it seems like a setup.

335
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,602
I can't hear you.

336
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:39,449
I believe it's a setup.

337
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,289
Do you really think so?

338
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,209
That day,

339
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,856
the people who cheered for Lai Ming Cheng in the court

340
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,850
were from your faction. Why?

341
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,759
Your Majesty.

342
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:02,074
I swear,

343
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,810
I didn't know about that.

344
00:23:03,952 --> 00:23:07,482
You're getting flustered over such a small matter.

345
00:23:28,522 --> 00:23:29,682
Come.

346
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:34,562
Sit.

347
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,579
Thank you, Your Majesty.

348
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,922
Are you seated firmly now?

349
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,129
Remember,

350
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:17,330
you must always handle matters with composure.

351
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:19,670
It's important to be composed in life,

352
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,259
but as a crown prince,

353
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,122
it's even more crucial.

354
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,002
Do you understand?

355
00:24:29,992 --> 00:24:31,763
Are you pretending not to understand?

356
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:34,819
Go.

357
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,722
Go back and ask your mother.

358
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:52,048
His Majesty asked you to come and see me?

359
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,140
Yes.

360
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,602
But even if His Majesty didn't,

361
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,162
I wanted to come and visit you too.

362
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:04,202
As a matter of fact, His Majesty

363
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,602
doesn't care whether you visit me or not.

364
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:10,001
In His Majesty's heart,

365
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,282
as his queen,

366
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,969
I am probably just a distant memory.

367
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:22,602
He asked you to come here

368
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:26,119
because he's afraid you didn't understand him.

369
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,032
Tell me.

370
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,868
What did he tell you?

371
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:37,829
What else can we say?

372
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,162
Fan Jian and his son got sick together.

373
00:25:40,256 --> 00:25:41,882
Who would believe this nonsense?

374
00:25:42,017 --> 00:25:43,202
No one believes it.

375
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:46,322
But they said they're ill, we can't force them to attend the court.

376
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,322
If this gets out, it will make us look too harsh.

377
00:25:50,673 --> 00:25:53,242
- What about Fan Si Zhe? - They said he's not in the capital.

378
00:25:53,423 --> 00:25:56,116
Where did he go? Find out for sure and bring him back for questioning.

379
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,282
We don't know where he went. They are ill and not seeing guests.

380
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:02,239
They can't stay sick forever.

381
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:04,282
So what should we do now?

382
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,579
Wait.

383
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,335
After all, the murderers of Moon Embracing Pavilion case

384
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,722
haven't been caught yet.

385
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:14,242
In the meantime, we'll continue investigating corruption.

386
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,082
We won't spare the Fan family or corrupt officials.

387
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,779
Yes, My Lord.

388
00:26:26,456 --> 00:26:29,056
The Moon Embracing Pavilion incident has spread among the people.

389
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,282
There are quite a few suspicions about the Fan family.

390
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,602
Yet, Fan Xian is known as a poetic genius.

391
00:26:34,781 --> 00:26:37,202
Many speculate there's more to this than meets the eye.

392
00:26:37,302 --> 00:26:38,782
It's nice to be able to write poetry.

393
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,372
- Should the murderers be caught? - No rush.

394
00:26:43,482 --> 00:26:45,962
Catching them too soon would seem too contrived.

395
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:52,002
The Fan family said they are sick.

396
00:26:52,207 --> 00:26:53,856
They are not seeing guests or attending the court.

397
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,002
This can't go on forever.

398
00:26:56,293 --> 00:26:58,533
Are they trying to delay until they catch the murderers?

399
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,882
But if they're ill, they need treatment.

400
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,220
Treatment?

401
00:27:02,613 --> 00:27:04,542
Get the best physicians from the Imperial Hospital

402
00:27:04,566 --> 00:27:05,786
to visit the Fan residence

403
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,220
and check on them.

404
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,879
Will they refuse to see the physician?

405
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,082
If they're really sick and refuse treatment,

406
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,882
it sounds a little unreasonable.

407
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,042
If they're found not to be sick,

408
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,360
they would be deceiving His Majesty.

409
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,380
I'll take care of it.

410
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,122
Why are you defending the Fan family?

411
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:36,202
Did he ever say he wanted to join your faction?

412
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,059
No.

413
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,689
But after all, he's going against Cheng Ze.

414
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,482
Let them fight it out.

415
00:27:46,023 --> 00:27:47,722
You just watch and stay out of it.

416
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:50,042
Why bother to get personally involved?

417
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,922
We're somewhat allies after all.

418
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,322
That's why he's saying this to you.

419
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,402
He asked about where you stand

420
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,122
because he wanted you to understand the details of their conflict.

421
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,002
He wanted you to sit firmly

422
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,449
because he didn't want you to interfere

423
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,722
even after comprehending the situation.

424
00:28:15,431 --> 00:28:17,153
Just sit on the sidelines

425
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,442
and watch them fight.

426
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,282
Only by staying aloof from things

427
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,921
can one embody the wisdom to navigate complex situations.

428
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,802
He's teaching you

429
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,962
how to be a crown prince.

430
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,562
Must he make people guess?

431
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,242
Can't he just say it directly?

432
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:39,682
The emperor's mind is deep and unfathomable.

433
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,819
As for

434
00:28:43,735 --> 00:28:46,985
those who supported Lai Ming Cheng in the court...

435
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:48,922
His Majesty actually knows

436
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,442
it wasn't my idea.

437
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:53,602
He just wanted to confirm it again.

438
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,642
Who else could it be?

439
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,723
After all, Fan Xian is Chancellor Lin's future son-in-law.

440
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,900
Lin Ruo Fu?

441
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,039
You figured it out?

442
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,339
I know about it.

443
00:29:11,712 --> 00:29:12,932
His Majesty

444
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,483
knows about it too.

445
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,810
You actually understood

446
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,842
His Majesty's advice just now.

447
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,122
You didn't have to ask me.

448
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,122
It's always a pleasure

449
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,890
to hear Mother's teachings.

450
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:35,322
Since you understood it,

451
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,900
why pretend to be confused?

452
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,082
Mother.

453
00:29:38,322 --> 00:29:39,722
Isn't it a sign of wisdom

454
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,642
for a crown prince to be a little obtuse?

455
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:47,602
You're the crown prince,

456
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,362
but you're also his son.

457
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,362
In fact, you look a lot like him.

458
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,482
People tend to harm their own kind.

459
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,842
How can you use that phrase here?

460
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,420
In my opinion,

461
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,460
this phrase

462
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,090
will apply sooner or later.

463
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,819
It's been hard for you.

464
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,642
I am the crown prince,

465
00:30:28,856 --> 00:30:30,522
residing in the Eastern Palace,

466
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,322
admired by all,

467
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,842
and envied by my brothers.

468
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,682
How is it hard?

469
00:30:44,364 --> 00:30:45,485
Zi Yue.

470
00:30:45,781 --> 00:30:47,202
Try one. Suit yourself.

471
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,522
My Lord's pastry

472
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:52,141
is delicious.

473
00:30:52,222 --> 00:30:53,442
Here, it's hot.

474
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,559
It's Ba Ba's favorite.

475
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,842
Come, sit down and eat.

476
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,103
- You don't have to. - Come.

477
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:10,519
Why aren't you eating? It tastes better when it's hot.

478
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,969
My Lord, I'm on duty.

479
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,162
I'll take it back for a more thorough taste.

480
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:18,929
Deng Zi Yue, you're still holding back.

481
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,242
You don't trust me?

482
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,002
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

483
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,100
I see.

484
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:27,802
You still want to see it.

485
00:31:28,014 --> 00:31:31,522
You want to see for yourself if I'm the person worth waking up for.

486
00:31:32,086 --> 00:31:33,762
- Get up. - Yes, My Lord.

487
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,202
Is everything in order in the First Bureau?

488
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,259
Everything is arranged.

489
00:31:42,838 --> 00:31:44,958
The colleagues in the First Bureau are itching to go.

490
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:46,227
They are all fired up.

491
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:48,009
Since your confrontation in the court,

492
00:31:48,144 --> 00:31:52,840
everyone has felt immense respect for you, especially me.

493
00:31:52,935 --> 00:31:55,602
I feel like I've found a guiding light.

494
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,880
They don't respect me.

495
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,960
They respect President Chen who is siding with me.

496
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:02,042
I'm too young to earn their respect.

497
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:07,764
Maybe for others, but I'm different from them.

498
00:32:08,923 --> 00:32:10,403
- How are you different? - You see,

499
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,242
your leveraging of the Censorate is truly brilliant.

500
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,122
You used the Censorate

501
00:32:17,633 --> 00:32:19,362
to combat corruption.

502
00:32:19,542 --> 00:32:20,762
That's genius.

503
00:32:20,934 --> 00:32:23,574
You're truly resourceful and full of strategies.

504
00:32:23,655 --> 00:32:24,984
Then eat this pastry first.

505
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,882
I think I'll go back and eat.

506
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,376
Pursuant to the rule of the Overwatch Council,

507
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,810
anyone on duty can't eat food from outside the office.

508
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:36,679
Is that the rule?

509
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:38,449
Are you afraid of breaking the rules?

510
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:39,819
Yes.

511
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,969
You've mastered all the bows and niceties,

512
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:47,370
but you're fixated on a rule that no one cares about.

513
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,642
Deng Zi Yue, you live a very contradictory life.

514
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,860
I'm foolish.

515
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:53,722
I'll eat at home.

516
00:32:54,287 --> 00:32:55,507
You...

517
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:58,282
Qi Nian, look at him.

518
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,449
If I tried to learn from him, you'd be fed up with me long ago.

519
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:04,722
We are both pillars of the kingdom.

520
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,539
Indeed.

521
00:33:08,348 --> 00:33:09,362
Xian.

522
00:33:10,226 --> 00:33:12,600
- Xian. - Catch your breath before you speak.

523
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,444
The imperial physician is here.

524
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:15,845
May I know which physician it is?

525
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,100
Who cares which one it is?

526
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:20,170
Xian, he said Prince Cheng Ze is worried about the Fan family's illness

527
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,439
and asked him to check on us.

528
00:33:21,554 --> 00:33:23,920
Aunt is leading the way to Dad's room.

529
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,719
- What should we do? - I'll go stop him.

530
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,019
Why would you stop him?

531
00:33:27,198 --> 00:33:28,418
He has to stop him.

532
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,600
Dad looks healthy.

533
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,999
It doesn't look like he's sick.

534
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:32,522
That's where you're wrong.

535
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,880
Are you upset that our Dad is not sick?

536
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,999
Xian.

537
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,002
Don't worry, Dad will be fine.

538
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,762
When it comes to illness, all you need is sincerity.

539
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,360
Physician Li.

540
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,479
It's not a big deal.

541
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,570
You don't have to come personally.

542
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,420
It's my duty to do so.

543
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,295
Come on, please come this way.

544
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:54,539
Mind the steps.

545
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:57,722
Madam, what are you looking for?

546
00:33:57,958 --> 00:33:59,247
Nothing.

547
00:34:03,503 --> 00:34:04,905
Is Minister Fan in the room?

548
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,610
Yes, he is.

549
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,940
I'll check on him.

550
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,959
Would you like some tea first?

551
00:34:11,046 --> 00:34:12,926
No need. Checking on his health is more urgent.

552
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,880
He didn't even come out to stop us.

553
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,402
At least say something.

554
00:34:17,152 --> 00:34:19,553
Nothing. This illness came on suddenly.

555
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,492
We're caught off guard.

556
00:34:21,718 --> 00:34:23,840
Diseases come on horseback. Madam, don't worry.

557
00:34:23,943 --> 00:34:25,163
I'll check on him.

558
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,922
Since the imperial physician is here, it seems the timing is about right.

559
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,042
Let's have the First Bureau leak the news.

560
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,540
Yes, My Lord.

561
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:45,362
He looks so bad.

562
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,122
Is he terminally ill?

563
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:48,594
Please calm down.

564
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,762
Xian, is Dad sick?

565
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,299
No. Dad is healthier than me.

566
00:35:08,438 --> 00:35:09,477
Then what should we do?

567
00:35:09,558 --> 00:35:11,150
What if the physician finds out something?

568
00:35:11,174 --> 00:35:12,824
If he's not sick, that's even worse.

569
00:35:13,456 --> 00:35:16,442
That's for sure, that would be deceiving His Majesty.

570
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:18,285
Ruo Ruo.

571
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,720
Think about it. If he's too unwell to attend the court,

572
00:35:20,817 --> 00:35:22,202
what else could it be

573
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,020
if not an illness?

574
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,620
Minister Fan.

575
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:46,849
Minister Fan, please stick out your tongue.

576
00:35:55,942 --> 00:35:57,842
Minister Fan, have a good rest.

577
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:07,002
Minister Fan is not sick.

578
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:09,079
Oh no.

579
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,482
He was poisoned.

580
00:36:11,643 --> 00:36:13,984
- Poisoned? - He was indeed poisoned.

581
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:16,299
That's good...

582
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:19,922
Goodness.

583
00:36:20,754 --> 00:36:22,242
Madam, you should be careful.

584
00:36:22,328 --> 00:36:24,848
Thoroughly investigate suspicious individuals in the household.

585
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:27,162
Yes, you're right.

586
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,122
Let's go. I also want to check on Lord Fan.

587
00:36:30,637 --> 00:36:31,677
You still want to see him?

588
00:36:31,718 --> 00:36:33,002
Since I'm here, might as well.

589
00:36:33,877 --> 00:36:35,097
All right then.

590
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,842
Did you poison Dad?

591
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:44,682
If we're going to act, we must be convincing.

592
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:47,958
- Does Dad know? - Of course. How could I keep that from him?

593
00:36:48,078 --> 00:36:49,298
He didn't say anything?

594
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,620
Poison?

595
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:56,559
Don't worry. I'm a professional at this.

596
00:36:56,662 --> 00:36:58,562
It's completely safe.

597
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,500
It just seems scary because it's very effective.

598
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,060
Smells good.

599
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,439
After all, it's for you.

600
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,256
I've specially formulated it for your tastes.

601
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,689
It's all about being gentle on the throat and effective.

602
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,202
Let me taste it first.

603
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:14,828
You can drink it when a physician really comes to our house.

604
00:37:14,852 --> 00:37:16,060
Or else, it will be wasted.

605
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:21,242
It really smells great.

606
00:37:25,734 --> 00:37:28,505
Dad really trusts you.

607
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,442
- Are you going to drink this poison? - Why would I drink it?

608
00:37:32,526 --> 00:37:34,486
The imperial physician will also come to see you.

609
00:37:37,305 --> 00:37:38,736
If I'm poisoned, no one would believe me.

610
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,002
Everyone knows I am Fei Jie's apprentice.

611
00:37:41,953 --> 00:37:44,402
Would everyone suspect you poisoned him?

612
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:45,679
That's impossible.

613
00:37:45,782 --> 00:37:47,944
A son poisoning his father? Who would believe it?

614
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,299
That's inhumane.

615
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,689
Am I scolding myself?

616
00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:55,935
Not exactly.

617
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,432
You're a poet genius.

618
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,119
A transcendent is not a human.

619
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:01,079
If you are not a human, you cannot be insulted.

620
00:38:01,424 --> 00:38:02,882
You're still insulting me.

621
00:38:03,842 --> 00:38:05,482
You can even smooth this over.

622
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:08,259
Fan Xian.

623
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,642
The physician is here!

624
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,602
Are you awake?

625
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,682
Thanks for your hard work.

626
00:38:17,718 --> 00:38:19,237
Thanks for your hard work!

627
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:21,162
You didn't even drink tea!

628
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,540
Fan Xian!

629
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:24,162
The physician is here!

630
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:25,682
Are you awake?

631
00:38:27,464 --> 00:38:28,684
Fan Xian!

632
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:31,209
Get up and greet the physician!

633
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,082
He's here to treat you!

634
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,060
Fan Xian.

635
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:39,990
Fan Xian.

636
00:38:40,138 --> 00:38:41,922
Madam, you may spare the formalities.

637
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,880
Lord Fan is ill.

638
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,345
He might have difficulty moving around.

639
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:47,002
Let's go inside.

640
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,122
Aunt, you're here.

641
00:38:55,983 --> 00:38:57,203
Fan Xian.

642
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,642
This physician came all the way from the Imperial Hospital to treat you.

643
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,380
Thank...

644
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,522
- Thank you. - My Lord!

645
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,001
My Lord!

646
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:08,922
You see.

647
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,400
You were supposed to rest in bed,

648
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,119
yet you insist on getting up.

649
00:39:14,216 --> 00:39:18,039
You said you need to be respectful to your aunt

650
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:22,153
and show appreciation to the imperial physician.

651
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:25,935
But why don't you think about your own health?

652
00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:29,042
Don't worry, he's still alive.

653
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:31,562
Please do what you can for him.

654
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,522
I will try my best.

655
00:39:35,511 --> 00:39:37,002
This pulse...

656
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,400
Is he poisoned too?

657
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,700
He's not poisoned.

658
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:42,162
Has Lord Fan been injured recently?

659
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,402
Has he?

660
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:47,259
What's wrong?

661
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,240
His energy is disordered.

662
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:51,823
It doesn't seem like an illness but more like a severe injury.

663
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,980
My Lord!

664
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:00,680
Have you eaten?

665
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,980
I haven't eaten yet.

666
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,882
Go home and eat.

667
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:09,992
He's got confused, right?

668
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,769
Who sent you?

669
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,060
Prince Cheng Ze.

670
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,399
Thank him for me.

671
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,362
I will pass on the message.

672
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:22,399
Aunt.

673
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,482
Make sure the physician eats before he leaves.

674
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:28,282
I'll inform the chef later.

675
00:40:29,002 --> 00:40:30,162
My Lord!

676
00:40:30,544 --> 00:40:32,562
Lord Fan is weak.

677
00:40:32,654 --> 00:40:34,784
Quickly move him to his room to rest.

678
00:40:34,944 --> 00:40:36,394
I'll write a prescription right now.

679
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:37,505
Okay.

680
00:40:37,592 --> 00:40:39,122
Thank you.

681
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,459
It's my duty.

682
00:40:42,222 --> 00:40:45,832
There are many good people in the Qing Kingdom.

683
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,562
Would you like to eat before you go?

684
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,819
To be safe, let's go over everything again.

685
00:41:00,165 --> 00:41:02,525
- Come. - Have you ever heard of Moon Embracing Pavilion?

686
00:41:02,974 --> 00:41:05,209
Yes. The one owned by Young Master Fan,

687
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,682
where someone was killed.

688
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,826
Someone saw that Yuan Meng was the manager of Moon Embracing Pavilion.

689
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,562
That's Madam Yuan from Liujing River.

690
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:17,282
I heard she's Prince Hong Cheng's lover.

691
00:41:17,903 --> 00:41:19,123
Everyone,

692
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,329
make sure to spread this news to every corner of the capital.

693
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,880
This is serious. I'm counting on you.

694
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,522
For the sake of the Qing Kingdom!

695
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,240
For the sake of the Qing Kingdom!

696
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,249
Hurry up.

697
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,339
We have limited time. Don't make any mistakes.

698
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:46,159
Is that really what he said?

699
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,273
Yes.

700
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,762
The physician reported back that

701
00:41:49,062 --> 00:41:51,343
Fan Jian was poisoned, and Fan Xian was severely injured.

702
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,882
He said, given his years of experience, he won't be wrong.

703
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:58,779
Fan Jian was poisoned

704
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:00,845
by Fan Xian.

705
00:42:00,926 --> 00:42:03,042
Fan Xian? No way.

706
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,060
See, you don't even believe it.

707
00:42:07,406 --> 00:42:08,686
How can we convince anyone else?

708
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,660
I get the poisoning,

709
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:17,362
but how did Fan Xian get injured?

710
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:20,859
My Lord,

711
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,769
are you really okay?

712
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,602
I'm fine. It's all an act.

713
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:27,119
What kind of act?

714
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,522
It means putting up a show.

715
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,042
A bit of sunshine will do me good.

716
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,050
Why isn't it sunny today?

717
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,642
Xian.

718
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,480
Here's the prescription from the physician.

719
00:42:48,845 --> 00:42:50,004
The prescription is fine.

720
00:42:50,085 --> 00:42:51,374
The physician knows his stuff.

721
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,842
How did you fool him?

722
00:42:54,076 --> 00:42:57,042
We practice martial arts. Pretending to be injured is a piece of cake.

723
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,028
Awesome.
