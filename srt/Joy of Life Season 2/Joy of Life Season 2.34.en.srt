00:01:25,082 --> 00:01:30,973
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:34,162
(Episode 34)

3
00:01:40,837 --> 00:01:43,347
How do we deal with this situation?

4
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:45,642
I will investigate it.

5
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,802
I'll definitely capture the person

6
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:53,047
who betrayed the clan.

7
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,910
Fan Xian is the key.

8
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,920
At this stage,

9
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,719
there's no choice.

10
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,440
We can only side with Li Cheng Ze and Li Yun Rui.

11
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,359
We must never give away

12
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,482
the Three Great Workshops.

13
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,202
- To whom? - To Fan Xian!

14
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,400
It can't be given to Li Yun Rui as well.

15
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,680
And Li Cheng Ze.

16
00:02:21,745 --> 00:02:23,122
We must let them

17
00:02:23,705 --> 00:02:24,985
fight against each other.

18
00:02:28,734 --> 00:02:30,014
That is how the Ming family

19
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:34,002
can survive in the crevices.

20
00:02:38,623 --> 00:02:40,362
We must grasp the Three Great Workshops

21
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:44,682
firmly in our hands.

22
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:51,137
Stop it.

23
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,590
Thank you, Mother.

24
00:03:05,255 --> 00:03:06,535
Return the needles to me.

25
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:49,311
I'll go now

26
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,242
and keep Li Cheng Ze in check.

27
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:55,509
He won't stay long.

28
00:03:55,863 --> 00:03:57,143
When he leaves,

29
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,199
Jiangnan

30
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,322
will still belong to the Ming family.

31
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,023
You are the head of the family.

32
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,510
You can make the decisions.

33
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,280
Yes.

34
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,799
Mother, please take a nap.

35
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,039
I won't

36
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,200
disturb you anymore.

37
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,082
Sorry to make you wait, Your Highness.

38
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,400
The Ming family is good at currying favors.

39
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,710
You even get food to be used as tributes.

40
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:04,322
However, you are lacking when it comes to manners.

41
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,242
Has the discussion ended?

42
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,722
Everyone from the Ming Family

43
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,629
swears loyalty to Your Highness.

44
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,520
There's no one else.

45
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,322
My mother took a nap.

46
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,719
Stand up.

47
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,239
Did she suspect you?

48
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:53,054
Not yet.

49
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,150
However, she asked me to investigate the whole clan

50
00:05:57,344 --> 00:06:00,562
to see who is swearing loyalty to you in secret.

51
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:04,449
We do need to think about this.

52
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,429
Let's see who is a suitable scapegoat.

53
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,360
I don't know the Ming family well.

54
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,189
Find someone from the branch family to become the scapegoat.

55
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,759
They are not enough.

56
00:06:19,854 --> 00:06:21,134
The scapegoats

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,710
should be my siblings.

58
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:32,642
We are not plants. We have emotions.

59
00:06:33,118 --> 00:06:34,398
When I think about it,

60
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,109
sending my siblings

61
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,950
to their death

62
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,030
makes me lament somehow.

63
00:06:50,654 --> 00:06:52,204
Treating people kindly is good.

64
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,270
I'll also be kind for a while usually.

65
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,040
However, giving them a good result

66
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:00,684
and making them seem as if they are grateful is good enough.

67
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,040
Yes.

68
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,092
However, you can't think too much.

69
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,200
Everyone has their own fate.

70
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,119
Take your time to lament it.

71
00:07:10,782 --> 00:07:12,184
I'm going back to the capital.

72
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,109
Your Highness, are you leaving?

73
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,520
The discussion is over. What else should I do?

74
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,919
But we still need you

75
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:21,038
to take charge here in Jiangnan.

76
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,598
The capital is keeping watch.

77
00:07:22,686 --> 00:07:24,319
If His Majesty knows I'm in Jiangnan,

78
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:25,718
everything will be over.

79
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,802
If Your Highness can't stay here for a long time,

80
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,158
what about Princess Yun Rui...

81
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:32,412
She's visiting other people. She can't come either.

82
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:33,962
Fan Xian is powerful.

83
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,520
Without both of you,

84
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,822
the Ming family alone might not be able to win against him.

85
00:07:37,846 --> 00:07:39,126
I'll leave Xie Bi An for you.

86
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,722
Understood.

87
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,882
I'll get Mr. Xie's advice

88
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,402
when I do things in the future.

89
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,562
No need. Just make your own decisions.

90
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,802
Losing to Fan Xian

91
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,238
is also normal.

92
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,439
Don't overthink. Protect the Three Great Workshops.

93
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,760
Just work hard.

94
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,879
Don't worry.

95
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,362
I won't go back on my promise.

96
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:09,362
When this is over, the Ming family will only have the head of the family.

97
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:10,859
There won't be an Old Lady.

98
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,799
Thank you, Your Highness.

99
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,167
Master, take a break.

100
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:23,189
- Have something to eat. - I have mantou.

101
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:24,762
There's Mantou here.

102
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:26,602
Take a break. Eat.

103
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,082
- Take it slow. - Everyone gets it.

104
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,002
- All of you get it. - Drink slowly.

105
00:08:35,443 --> 00:08:37,802
If you want more, I can get you another bowl.

106
00:08:37,903 --> 00:08:39,183
Can you give me another bowl?

107
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,520
- Of course. - Thank you.

108
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,880
Get him another bowl.

109
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,000
Eat slowly.

110
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,522
There's more here.

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,922
You have questions? Ask away.

112
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,879
Are you Lord Fan from the capital?

113
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,922
Yes. I am Fan Xian.

114
00:08:55,045 --> 00:08:56,325
Thank the heavens.

115
00:08:57,128 --> 00:08:58,408
Lord Fan,

116
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,120
wait here.

117
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,240
Everyone!

118
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,479
It's Lord Fan!

119
00:09:04,602 --> 00:09:06,199
We got the right boat!

120
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,439
Thank you!

121
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,802
Thank you, Lord Fan!

122
00:09:09,918 --> 00:09:11,428
Thank you, Lord Fan!

123
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,479
Thank you!

124
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,602
- Drink it slowly. - Thank you.

125
00:09:15,683 --> 00:09:18,402
I was afraid I would make a mistake

126
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:20,139
and trouble someone else.

127
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,482
How do you get a reward for hijacking boats?

128
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,749
Someone is watching on the shore.

129
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,162
We'll be rewarded

130
00:09:29,471 --> 00:09:30,922
as long as we destroy the boat.

131
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:32,933
In that case, you'll get money

132
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:34,294
when you return to shore?

133
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,550
All of us will be executed.

134
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:39,042
We can't go back.

135
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,479
Why do you still do this when you know you'll be executed?

136
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,160
We are robbing an official's boat.

137
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:46,677
We will surely die.

138
00:09:46,814 --> 00:09:48,284
I don't understand.

139
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,800
Don't all of you want the reward?

140
00:09:49,852 --> 00:09:51,732
Why do you need the reward if you're dead?

141
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:53,093
Don't worry.

142
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,362
Someone from the family will receive it.

143
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,602
We only hope they can be safe

144
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:01,482
and let them save more money.

145
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,310
If we return to Jiangbei,

146
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:06,947
there'll be hope for them.

147
00:10:07,142 --> 00:10:08,422
What about all of you?

148
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:09,783
Are you not going back?

149
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,522
We want to go back,

150
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,101
but can we go back?

151
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,079
We should

152
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,159
give our children

153
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,070
a way out at least.

154
00:10:21,635 --> 00:10:24,350
This is better than dragging them down.

155
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,400
Why didn't you make a complaint

156
00:10:26,487 --> 00:10:28,437
if you are going to die?

157
00:10:29,015 --> 00:10:30,295
What?

158
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:34,162
There was no need to rob our boat.

159
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:36,670
If you stop us and cry for injustice,

160
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:39,140
Lord Fan won't abandon all of you.

161
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,322
It's a calamity.

162
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,749
There's no injustice.

163
00:10:45,096 --> 00:10:46,376
Old Man.

164
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:48,328
The Ming family backed all of you into a corner.

165
00:10:48,352 --> 00:10:49,882
Don't you feel aggrieved at all?

166
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:51,162
My Lord,

167
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,679
you can't say that.

168
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:54,276
They saved us.

169
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,962
Without the Ming family,

170
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,149
we would've starved to death.

171
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,082
Forget about the Ming family.

172
00:11:00,163 --> 00:11:01,593
Why didn't you go to the officials

173
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,319
when you struggled to survive?

174
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:04,726
We don't blame them.

175
00:11:05,088 --> 00:11:06,678
We are not from Jiangnan.

176
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:09,400
They still need to protect their own no matter what.

177
00:11:09,518 --> 00:11:11,628
It's not wrong when you think about it, right?

178
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:14,482
After hearing what you said,

179
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,830
I think no one is wrong here.

180
00:11:18,455 --> 00:11:19,977
This is a calamity.

181
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,830
How is it wrong in any way?

182
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:24,360
Lord Fan.

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,280
Nothing's wrong, right?

184
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,079
Right.

185
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,122
Do you want power

186
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,722
or do you want her dead?

187
00:11:47,243 --> 00:11:49,643
My mother has been in charge of the Ming family for decades.

188
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,720
- She's a prestigious figure in the clan. - Understood.

189
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,802
Do you want to do it yourself?

190
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,602
We are closely related.

191
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:08,042
- It's best not to. - How particular.

192
00:12:22,062 --> 00:12:24,772
The mother swallow feeds its young. Its affection is deep.

193
00:12:25,182 --> 00:12:26,462
Tell me.

194
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,239
Which prioritizes relationships more

195
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:31,282
between humans and animals?

196
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:38,762
I like animals more.

197
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,282
Look.

198
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:08,842
I was too preoccupied with talking.

199
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,482
I need to get to work now.

200
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:12,202
They are watching.

201
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,922
I need to hit you once.

202
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:19,799
Sure.

203
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:21,222
Hit me.

204
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,584
I'm hitting then.

205
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,679
Let's take two steps forward.

206
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:30,167
They can see us more clearly.

207
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,149
I hope they can see this.

208
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,520
I'll hit you then.

209
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,362
Lord Fan,

210
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,830
why didn't you dodge?

211
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,642
Shouldn't I let you hit me twice?

212
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,079
I was just acting.

213
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,621
I even held up the rod just now.

214
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:59,642
Couldn't you just beat me to death?

215
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,282
Why were you all standing and watching?

216
00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:07,566
Lord Fan,

217
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:11,242
Jiangnan has many pirates.

218
00:14:11,504 --> 00:14:12,922
Your guards

219
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,439
are not that capable.

220
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:17,202
You need to find a few good ones

221
00:14:17,283 --> 00:14:18,563
to protect you.

222
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,040
Sure.

223
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,327
I'll get some better ones later.

224
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:22,631
You must change them.

225
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,122
I'll hit you again.

226
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,799
Remember.

227
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,882
Let them use blades

228
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,522
and do this for real.

229
00:14:49,726 --> 00:14:52,202
Why don't we have another bowl?

230
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,120
Then...

231
00:14:58,175 --> 00:15:00,256
That works too. Another bowl.

232
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,880
Thank you.

233
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,400
Thank you.

234
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:20,731
What if the Ming family doesn't exist in Jiangnan?

235
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,079
Lord Fan,

236
00:15:24,814 --> 00:15:26,094
it's the same.

237
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,922
Without the Ming family,

238
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:31,202
there are still the Zhang, Zhao, and Li families.

239
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,242
The Three Great Workshops

240
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,322
is a treasure trove.

241
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,722
The person who guards it

242
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,722
will become the next Ming family.

243
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:45,213
That's right.

244
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:47,496
If I return to the capital,

245
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:49,042
the result will still be the same.

246
00:15:49,814 --> 00:15:51,282
Without the Ming family,

247
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,322
there would still be other families.

248
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,360
- Qi Nian. - Yes, Lord Fan.

249
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:58,431
Give them some money and send them back to shore.

250
00:15:58,701 --> 00:15:59,777
Understood.

251
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:02,078
Don't stop accepting gifts. Take everything.

252
00:16:02,214 --> 00:16:03,442
Yes!

253
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,079
Lord Fan,

254
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,470
you're sending us back?

255
00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:08,878
Go back. Everything will be fine.

256
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:10,322
That won't do, Lord Fan.

257
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,310
We've attacked your boat.

258
00:16:12,584 --> 00:16:14,122
You didn't let them kill us

259
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:16,802
and even send us back.

260
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,162
What will become of your authority and dignity

261
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,701
as an official?

262
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,799
All of you

263
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,520
are our dignity as officials.

264
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,202
This is passed down in my family.

265
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,202
Stop.

266
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,000
Master Ming?

267
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,360
Yes.

268
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,370
Isn't that...

269
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,282
This is good.

270
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:08,850
Look.

271
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,202
Master Ming?

272
00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:17,682
Greetings.

273
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:21,322
I didn't expect him to be here.

274
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:24,602
Lord Zhao, this is costlier than mine.

275
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:25,968
Yes.

276
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:31,724
Master Ming, you are here too?

277
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,349
Lord Fan arrives in Suzhou today.

278
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:37,639
Even the magistrate is going to welcome his arrival.

279
00:17:37,735 --> 00:17:39,564
How can I be absent?

280
00:17:39,943 --> 00:17:42,263
Indeed. It's what we should do.

281
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,399
Almost every official from Suzhou is here.

282
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:48,775
It's to welcome him.

283
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:51,042
Lord Fan has been accepting gifts on his way

284
00:17:51,141 --> 00:17:52,452
and he's finally here today.

285
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,959
Suzhou cannot lose.

286
00:17:55,054 --> 00:17:56,334
Am I right?

287
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,562
Lord Fan!

288
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:05,682
How dare all of you come here when you're not officials?

289
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,576
These insolent civilians are more daring now.

290
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,910
Lord Fan!

291
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:11,146
Lord Fan!

292
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,936
Has Lord Fan gotten off the boat?

293
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,560
Get down!

294
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,780
That's the one!

295
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,611
That's Lord Fan's boat!

296
00:18:17,783 --> 00:18:19,922
- Get down. - Lord Fan!

297
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,722
Sorry.

298
00:18:26,343 --> 00:18:27,722
Sorry.

299
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,319
Lord Fan!

300
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,439
Lord Fan!

301
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:32,893
Lord Fan!

302
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,242
- Why isn't he here yet? - He's not here yet.

303
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,762
Are you here to welcome Lord Fan?

304
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,482
Yes.

305
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:45,359
Let me tell you. I couldn't sleep the whole night

306
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,880
when I heard Lord Fan was coming.

307
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:48,342
This incident has really blown up.

308
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:51,303
Do you know Fan Xian?

309
00:18:51,491 --> 00:18:52,541
I don't.

310
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:53,886
I idolize him.

311
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:55,742
His poems are great and he is a nice person.

312
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,599
What about you? You too?

313
00:18:58,113 --> 00:18:59,602
Don't you know him?

314
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,042
Should I know him?

315
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,322
I'm sure you are not from Suzhou.

316
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,719
No.

317
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,282
I am Xu.

318
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,962
I'm a bookkeeper in Fuchun County.

319
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,442
How dare a bookkeeper

320
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,390
come here?

321
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,842
As an official,

322
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,802
you must care about your appearance.

323
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,239
Your appearance is ridiculous!

324
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,599
Enough.

325
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:27,431
Are they all from Fuchun County?

326
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:30,402
No. They are officials from all over Jiangnan.

327
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:33,042
Are all of you even worthy to be here?

328
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,962
We have important matters.

329
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,722
What kind of important matters?

330
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,160
Let me tell you...

331
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,733
Lord Fan is here!

332
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,793
What are you doing? Get down.

333
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:46,952
Ridiculous!

334
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:48,313
Is that Lord Fan?

335
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:52,870
Look! It's Lord Fan!

336
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,182
He's finally here!

337
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,012
Greetings, Lord Fan!

338
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,922
Make way! Everyone, make way!

339
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,082
What are those?

340
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:33,962
There are cartloads of them.

341
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:42,128
This box

342
00:20:42,456 --> 00:20:43,898
is filled with jewelry.

343
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,749
It's from Yao Qing Lian, Perfect of Sha Prefecture.

344
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,221
This cart

345
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,759
carries gifts from officials on my way here.

346
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:00,485
The names of officials who gave me gifts

347
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,110
will be recorded.

348
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,042
There are so many!

349
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,959
I brought this cart from the capital.

350
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,501
It has 138,880 taels of silver.

351
00:21:29,302 --> 00:21:30,582
The money

352
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,200
is my expenses

353
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:33,743
and shows my ideals.

354
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,349
I have money

355
00:21:37,535 --> 00:21:39,082
so I'm confident.

356
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,926
These gifts given to me by officials

357
00:21:42,382 --> 00:21:43,662
are evidence of their crime.

358
00:21:51,448 --> 00:21:52,728
I wanted

359
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:55,359
to make complaints one by one according to the name list

360
00:21:56,294 --> 00:21:58,204
when I return to the capital.

361
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,710
But when I was on my way down south.

362
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,680
I saw a situation.

363
00:22:06,647 --> 00:22:09,397
I don't understand why all of you can't see it.

364
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:13,309
After I see the incident,

365
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,879
I changed my mind.

366
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,199
My 130,000 taels of silver

367
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,360
and the gifts given to me by the officials

368
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,679
will be used

369
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,741
to send the Jiangbei disaster victims back home.

370
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,760
Everyone,

371
00:22:30,158 --> 00:22:31,828
I just came to Jiangnan.

372
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,671
I'm not familiar with things here.

373
00:22:33,695 --> 00:22:34,975
I can't do this

374
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,670
on my own.

375
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,499
However, I'm worried

376
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:39,879
to leave it to all of you.

377
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:45,231
Don't ask why I'm worried

378
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,509
because I won't ask

379
00:22:47,622 --> 00:22:49,572
why all of you have the energy to welcome me,

380
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,202
but you couldn't see the suffering of the disaster victims.

381
00:23:00,621 --> 00:23:03,282
Let's save a bit of dignity

382
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,181
for each other.

383
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,882
Since I have my doubts about all of you,

384
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,069
I can only overstep my boundaries

385
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:16,973
and get someone else to do this.

386
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,366
Where are the officials of every county?

387
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,270
Here!

388
00:23:21,351 --> 00:23:22,882
I am here!

389
00:23:23,093 --> 00:23:26,374
I am here! I am Fuchun County's bookkeeper!

390
00:23:26,455 --> 00:23:27,735
At your service!

391
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,390
Greetings, Lord Fan.

392
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,509
My magistrate greets you.

393
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,278
Who is your magistrate?

394
00:23:38,398 --> 00:23:40,989
My magistrate is Lord Yang, Yang Wan Li.

395
00:23:41,168 --> 00:23:42,962
He is a student of yours.

396
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,509
Yang Wan Li has become a magistrate?

397
00:23:45,613 --> 00:23:46,893
He was just appointed.

398
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,309
He asked me to tell you

399
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:51,518
that you taught him to be a good person

400
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,759
and official.

401
00:23:52,862 --> 00:23:54,413
He hasn't forgotten a word.

402
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:58,150
It's all thanks to you

403
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:01,036
that the Jiangbei victims can have a chance to live.

404
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,600
Don't thank me.

405
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,959
These gifts were given by those officials.

406
00:24:05,062 --> 00:24:07,253
We must thank those officials.

407
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,910
Thank "Those Officials"!

408
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,310
I believe everyone here won't be stingy.

409
00:24:14,391 --> 00:24:16,580
We must thank these officials as well.

410
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,470
Thank "These Officials"!

411
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,440
The gifts

412
00:24:22,951 --> 00:24:24,421
were given by the officials.

413
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,122
Everyone,

414
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,110
we must avoid any suspicions.

415
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:30,522
So, I made the decision myself

416
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,907
and invited all the minor officials from various counties in Jiangnan

417
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:34,211
to gather in Suzhou.

418
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:36,560
Give the money to them

419
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,998
so they can be distributed to various counties to rescue the victims!

420
00:24:39,022 --> 00:24:40,302
Officials,

421
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,880
what do you think?

422
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,600
- This is good. - It's a good thing.

423
00:24:43,688 --> 00:24:45,356
It's a good thing!

424
00:24:45,437 --> 00:24:47,762
Lord Fan is meticulous.

425
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,247
All of us will do our best to help.

426
00:24:50,328 --> 00:24:51,781
Yes. We will do our best to help.

427
00:24:51,862 --> 00:24:53,772
Do our best to help.

428
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,722
Minor officials, come to the front.

429
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,642
Everyone,

430
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,162
you are not the same as them.

431
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,390
You are closer to the people.

432
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,762
I will leave the duty of distributing the money

433
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,309
to all of you.

434
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,829
We won't let you down, Lord Fan.

435
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,150
We won't let you down, Lord Fan!

436
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,989
I'll be saying this first.

437
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,719
If there are any greedy people

438
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,015
who are interested in embezzling,

439
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,319
I hope you can endure it.

440
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,390
You should ask yourself

441
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,589
if you can avoid the Overwatch Council's investigation.

442
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,960
What's your name?

443
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,110
I am Xu.

444
00:25:42,403 --> 00:25:43,722
I've prepared a ledger,

445
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:45,753
but all of you are the local officials.

446
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:47,790
Do your duties according to the situation of the county.

447
00:25:47,814 --> 00:25:48,895
Lord Fan, don't worry.

448
00:25:48,976 --> 00:25:50,256
We will complete our duties.

449
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,285
Everyone, if you want to participate,

450
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:56,197
I welcome all of you!

451
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,880
But don't give them to me.

452
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,039
Give the gifts to them.

453
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,762
That's all I'm going to say.

454
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:06,333
Forget the banquet.

455
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,359
All of you may leave.

456
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,880
I hope you know what's good for you.

457
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,789
Ming Qing Da, Head of the Ming family,

458
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,549
greets Lord Fan.

459
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:34,279
I heard about the Ming family of Jiangnan even when I was in the capital.

460
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,002
The Ming family's name

461
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,760
is nothing much.

462
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:42,039
Lord Fan, please wait.

463
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,322
Lord Fan,

464
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,760
this is my mother.

465
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,200
Are both of you here to welcome me as well?

466
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,562
The Ming family of Jiangnan

467
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,989
is here to ask you for punishment, Lord Fan.

468
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,639
What is your crime?

469
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,959
Lord Fan,

470
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,340
there's a rumor that the Ming family is offering a bounty.

471
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,069
We caused you a lot of trouble.

472
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:50,719
My mother and I

473
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,519
can only reduce our guilt a little

474
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:55,470
by coming here to ask for punishment.

475
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,241
- Rumor? - We are framed regarding the bounty.

476
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:01,349
The Ming family only learned about it

477
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,039
after it happened.

478
00:28:03,126 --> 00:28:05,006
Assassinating an official of the imperial court

479
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,879
is against the law of the Qing Kingdom.

480
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,120
If you are framed,

481
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,029
the case cannot be closed without a culprit.

482
00:28:12,077 --> 00:28:14,390
The Ming family will surely find the culprit

483
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:15,829
for you, Lord Fan.

484
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,242
There has to be a time limit.

485
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:28,039
Today.

486
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,150
If you are willing to visit us,

487
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,762
we will give you an explanation

488
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,190
before nightfall.

489
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,840
It's a promise.

490
00:28:35,936 --> 00:28:37,402
Everyone from the Ming family

491
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,549
awaits you, Lord Fan.

492
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,162
I'm looking forward

493
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:44,282
to the explanation today.

494
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,309
We won't disappoint you.

495
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,160
Stop pushing!

496
00:29:08,543 --> 00:29:09,823
What's your name?

497
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,922
- Stop pushing! - What's your name?

498
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,559
Sure!

499
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,600
You have a distinguished reputation.

500
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,240
It seems like the Ming family is going to swear loyalty to you.

501
00:29:20,381 --> 00:29:22,061
We mustn't simply conclude things.

502
00:29:22,142 --> 00:29:23,422
Let's wait and see.

503
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,359
What's this?

504
00:29:31,817 --> 00:29:34,282
You need to pay when you buy things on the streets.

505
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,402
Take it and have fun with it.

506
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,120
It's great.

507
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,670
Even Wan Li can help you.

508
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,240
He's not helping me but the victims.

509
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,642
Yes. You are right.

510
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,562
I just feel emotional.

511
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,200
Wan Li

512
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,162
has surpassed me now.

513
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,399
You can also save people.

514
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,262
The important thing is not one's identity

515
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:04,117
but how one behaves as a person.

516
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,522
I will remember your teaching

517
00:30:06,663 --> 00:30:08,082
and never forget it.

518
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,758
- I still have some questions. - Say it.

519
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,056
You don't believe the officials

520
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,841
so you let the minor officials distribute the money and keep records.

521
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,829
However, the minor officials might not be good people too.

522
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,950
If they take the risk

523
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,559
and take advantage of it?

524
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:23,924
These people became minor officials

525
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:26,400
to bridge the gap and become government officials.

526
00:30:26,526 --> 00:30:27,959
Letting them help the victims

527
00:30:28,054 --> 00:30:30,082
is not just a duty I gave them.

528
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,442
It is also an opportunity for them.

529
00:30:34,015 --> 00:30:36,965
So, they need to fulfill their duties well.

530
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,639
I've learned a lot.

531
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,320
Isn't this better for the officials who give gifts?

532
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,727
They were supposed to be arrested,

533
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:46,282
but now they've made a contribution.

534
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,880
Not making a complaint now doesn't mean I won't do it later.

535
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,430
I've taken down their names.

536
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:53,119
A reckoning.

537
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,599
I understand now.

538
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,359
Where's Qi Nian?

539
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,697
He went to the restaurant ahead to order food.

540
00:31:01,922 --> 00:31:04,184
He said you were showing off and didn't get to eat at the banquet

541
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:05,488
so you must be hungry.

542
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,922
I think he's the one who is hungry.

543
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,840
If we pay enough money,

544
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,322
we can clear the second floor.

545
00:31:32,403 --> 00:31:33,439
Here.

546
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,799
Try some yogurt.

547
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,110
These are exquisite in Suzhou.

548
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,150
They even add fruits to the yogurt.

549
00:31:46,903 --> 00:31:48,543
It's better than the ones in the capital.

550
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:58,069
There are many experts who come to find me.

551
00:31:58,615 --> 00:32:00,246
Really? Where?

552
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,839
Look.

553
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,559
That man. That man.

554
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,479
Over here.

555
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,322
That man. They are all experts.

556
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,519
Teacher,

557
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,602
why?

558
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:11,749
Both of them use swords.

559
00:32:11,985 --> 00:32:14,762
This man has a gun in his carrying pole.

560
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,319
This man

561
00:32:18,923 --> 00:32:19,950
doesn't carry a weapon.

562
00:32:20,031 --> 00:32:21,460
He uses punches.

563
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,789
He is an eighth-ranked expert at least.

564
00:32:25,415 --> 00:32:26,695
I've never seen

565
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,442
so many experts before.

566
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:30,402
Your Highness is quite something.

567
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:33,282
You are calm in a crisis. How brave.

568
00:32:33,629 --> 00:32:34,909
My teacher is capable.

569
00:32:35,192 --> 00:32:36,765
I'm sure it's all within his expectations.

570
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:37,962
Right, Teacher?

571
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,549
There are many unpredictable things in this world.

572
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:44,399
This man.

573
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,680
I didn't expect him.

574
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:05,190
This is a ninth-ranked expert.

575
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,430
He is even one of the best among the ninth-ranked experts.

576
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:11,749
Why is someone like him in Jiangnan?

577
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,710
He is not fishing.

578
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,440
This is swordsmanship.

579
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,589
A ninth-ranked swordsman?

580
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,322
There aren't many in this world.

581
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,720
This man is...

582
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,600
Master Ming!

583
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,014
Master Ming!

584
00:33:47,754 --> 00:33:49,567
Master Ming! Fan Xian is sitting leisurely in the restaurant.

585
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:50,871
Experts are surrounding him.

586
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,799
Put me down.

587
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,480
Mother.

588
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,039
Mother.

589
00:34:09,157 --> 00:34:11,668
Prince Cheng Ze left Xie Bi An here.

590
00:34:11,887 --> 00:34:13,207
He is not planning to do nothing.

591
00:34:13,638 --> 00:34:15,669
If Xie Bi An doesn't say anything,

592
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,322
we will be ignorant about it.

593
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,762
An ordinary person

594
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,949
probably can't kill someone with Fan Xian's identity.

595
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:30,749
There are always people in this world who don't care about identity.

596
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,749
Don't tell me it's the grandmaster.

597
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:40,402
He offended that man in Dongyi City.

598
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,080
Si Gu Jian?

599
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,680
If

600
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,402
He has been killed,

601
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,202
our preparation today will be in vain.

602
00:34:57,319 --> 00:34:58,802
Thinking about it in detail,

603
00:34:58,895 --> 00:35:01,645
if Si Gu Jian leaves Dongyi City,

604
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,030
it'll shock the world.

605
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,720
It's most probably

606
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,519
his disciple.

607
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,680
I wonder

608
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,879
who it is.

609
00:35:22,764 --> 00:35:24,044
Yun Zhi Lan.

610
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,869
Si Gu Jian's greatest disciple?

611
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,479
I saw him in Qinian Hall.

612
00:35:28,582 --> 00:35:30,533
His sword aura is the same. It's him.

613
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:34,710
Yun Zhi Lan is a difficult enemy.

614
00:35:35,815 --> 00:35:36,895
Lord Fan,

615
00:35:36,975 --> 00:35:38,962
let me in on something.

616
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:42,479
The expert who has been protecting you.

617
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:43,869
He's here, right?

618
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:45,400
There are no more experts left.

619
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,962
I only have the Black Cavalry.

620
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:48,922
The Black Cavalry is useless.

621
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,280
If there's a fight later,

622
00:35:50,391 --> 00:35:52,631
I'll take you away with my Qinggong.

623
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,119
Let's decide on a place.

624
00:35:54,237 --> 00:35:55,517
I'll go and find you later.

625
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,642
Your Highness is very brave indeed.

626
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,520
Teacher has been teaching me how to overcome different situations.

627
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:05,542
The first thing is to decide the priority.

628
00:36:06,054 --> 00:36:08,804
Which takes priority in this situation?

629
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,869
Yun Zhi Lan has a grudge against Teacher.

630
00:36:13,062 --> 00:36:14,342
This takes priority.

631
00:36:14,522 --> 00:36:15,971
I am the prince of Qing.

632
00:36:16,158 --> 00:36:19,118
If Dongyi City hurts me, they can't afford to bear the consequences.

633
00:36:19,237 --> 00:36:20,238
This is not a priority.

634
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:22,428
They dare not hurt a prince at least.

635
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,602
All right.

636
00:36:25,117 --> 00:36:26,722
Yun Zhi Lan.

637
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,711
I really want to fight you if I still have my internal energy.

638
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:33,682
Lord Fan, what did you say? Your internal energy is gone?

639
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:39,670
Qi Nian, I forgot to tell you.

640
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:41,526
During our journey south,

641
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,202
you have been our best fighter.

642
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:45,150
No way.

643
00:36:48,631 --> 00:36:50,152
Sticky rice cake!

644
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:51,835
Have some sticky rice cakes!

645
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,922
Why are you reeling before you hook a fish?

646
00:37:41,355 --> 00:37:42,434
Who...

647
00:37:42,654 --> 00:37:43,934
Who is she?

648
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,760
The Saintess of Northern Qi,

649
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,540
Haitang Duo Duo.

650
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,829
No wonder he didn't bring Wan Er here.

651
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:55,639
I made a mistake.

652
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:57,349
I'm sure he has a clear conscience.

653
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:02,642
You need to know your priorities when it comes to speaking.

654
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,082
This lady is...

655
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:37,999
The Saintess of Northern Qi, Haitang Duo Duo.

656
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,202
What are you looking at?

657
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:46,680
I'm looking at Jiangnan's scenery.

658
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,181
Let me make this clear.

659
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,202
This has nothing to do with me.

660
00:38:50,817 --> 00:38:52,097
I'm also curious

661
00:38:52,178 --> 00:38:53,818
about the reason for her appearance here.

662
00:39:32,965 --> 00:39:34,522
(Si Gu Jian's Disciple, Yun Zhi Lan)

663
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,802
Why don't I pay you back for the rod?

664
00:39:40,133 --> 00:39:41,722
The Saintess of Northern Qi

665
00:39:41,976 --> 00:39:43,522
is in the Qing Kingdom?

666
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,802
Can't I come here to travel?

667
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,519
What happens today

668
00:39:49,629 --> 00:39:50,909
is none of your business.

669
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:52,322
Move.

670
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,789
I've wanted to test the skills of a Si Gu Jian disciple.

671
00:39:56,407 --> 00:39:57,687
Why not do it today?

672
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:07,879
Shadow.

673
00:40:20,933 --> 00:40:22,213
They are flying so high.

674
00:40:32,295 --> 00:40:33,922
Experts below the ninth rank can leave.

675
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,640
Leave!

676
00:40:45,684 --> 00:40:46,787
You can't go upstairs!

677
00:40:46,868 --> 00:40:48,922
Move! I know the people upstairs.

678
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,320
She's one of our own.

679
00:40:56,423 --> 00:40:57,703
Miss, please come in.

680
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,159
Can I eat with you?

681
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:01,519
Please take a seat.

682
00:41:03,008 --> 00:41:04,438
They are...

683
00:41:05,105 --> 00:41:07,562
We are Lord Fan's students.

684
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:09,839
Sit.

685
00:41:10,104 --> 00:41:11,384
Here.

686
00:41:15,678 --> 00:41:17,242
They are clean. You can use them.

687
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:20,974
The dishes look exquisite.

688
00:41:22,806 --> 00:41:23,806
They taste good,

689
00:41:23,887 --> 00:41:25,167
but the portion is small.

690
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,930
Do you have something to do in Jiangnan?

691
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,122
Didn't you ask me to come here?

692
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,160
What do you mean?

693
00:41:41,468 --> 00:41:42,531
Didn't you write me a letter

694
00:41:42,555 --> 00:41:44,589
saying you want to exchange techniques from both kingdoms?

695
00:41:44,613 --> 00:41:45,749
I know you are in Jiangnan

696
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,110
so I've brought it to you.

697
00:41:47,491 --> 00:41:48,771
Hold on.

698
00:41:53,355 --> 00:41:54,635
Here you go.

699
00:41:55,823 --> 00:41:57,103
Heaven's Path?

700
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:00,510
Isn't this the secret technique of Bu He from Northern Qi?

701
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:03,159
I did write you a letter to exchange techniques,

702
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:04,240
but I didn't expect you

703
00:42:04,335 --> 00:42:05,964
to deliver it to Jiangnan in person.

704
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:08,320
You are righteous.

705
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,159
- I'll give you one later. - What?

706
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,519
My Overwhelming Internal Energy.

707
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:14,159
- Why are you doing this? - It's an exchange.

708
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:16,442
- I have to return a gift to you. - Fine.

709
00:42:18,807 --> 00:42:20,277
Thank you so much.

710
00:42:21,483 --> 00:42:23,495
It hasn't been that long since we met. Why are you so pretentious?

711
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:26,998
No. I know how precious Heaven's Path is.

712
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,901
I didn't expect you to give it to me with just one letter.

713
00:42:29,982 --> 00:42:31,262
Our relationship is really...

714
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,640
I heard you got married.

715
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,120
Think of it as a wedding gift.

716
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,280
This is too precious.

717
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:43,373
I think so too.

718
00:42:44,653 --> 00:42:47,016
I was reluctant but my teacher asked me to give it to you.

719
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,264
Master Ku He asked you to give it to me?

720
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:51,321
What else? Do you think I stole it for you?

721
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:54,510
Do masters always give such precious gifts?

722
00:42:55,967 --> 00:42:57,677
You are Ye Qing Mei's son after all.
