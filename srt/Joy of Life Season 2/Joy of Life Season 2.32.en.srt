00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:30,937
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,018 --> 00:01:34,003
(Episode 32)

3
00:01:34,865 --> 00:01:38,242
I heard that Ku He never imparted that technique to any outsiders.

4
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,722
I have to give it a try somehow.

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,510
Don't hide your knife up your sleeve.

6
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,060
You might cut yourself.

7
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,842
In fact,

8
00:02:02,282 --> 00:02:04,282
you don't have to tell me you are writing

9
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,719
to Miss Duo Duo.

10
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,400
But you asked,

11
00:02:08,654 --> 00:02:10,082
so I had to tell you.

12
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,240
Really?

13
00:02:12,786 --> 00:02:14,066
I promised you

14
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,999
that I'd never lie to you.

15
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,640
Wan Er,

16
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,350
is something bothering you?

17
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,829
Before my brother was killed,

18
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,030
did you already know

19
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,510
he was behind the assassination in Niulan Street?

20
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:08,876
Who was the man with Si Li Li that day at Zuixian Tavern?

21
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:11,922
It was the second son of the Lin family,

22
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,120
Lin Gong.

23
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:18,402
Yes.

24
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,199
Was it you

25
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,240
who killed him?

26
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,719
It wasn't me.

27
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:30,454
Do you know who the killer is?

28
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,790
- I killed Lin Gong. - Who gave you the right to kill him?

29
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,682
Young Lady Qing Mei.

30
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,919
I do.

31
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,562
Is it someone close to you?

32
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,061
Yes.

33
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,120
It's understandable that you had to defend yourself

34
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,362
because my brother was trying to kill you.

35
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,922
By right,

36
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:23,026
you didn't do anything wrong.

37
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,002
But living in this world

38
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,882
isn't just about what's right.

39
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,962
He was my brother.

40
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,242
I've been sick since I was a child

41
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,282
and couldn't go out.

42
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,960
He would come to the palace time and again to keep me company,

43
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,629
trying every way to lift my spirits.

44
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,282
Do you understand?

45
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,869
By right, I shouldn't hate you,

46
00:04:57,951 --> 00:04:59,762
but I can't help it.

47
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,799
I understand.

48
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,109
People have feelings.

49
00:05:14,262 --> 00:05:15,571
Why didn't you lie to me?

50
00:05:16,374 --> 00:05:17,785
Why didn't you lie to me for the rest of my life?

51
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:20,922
If you had said it, if you had lied to me, I would've believed you.

52
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,359
I only believe what you say.

53
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:23,794
No matter how much evidence was presented to me,

54
00:05:23,818 --> 00:05:25,082
I wouldn't have believed it,

55
00:05:25,163 --> 00:05:26,643
I would've pretended I didn't see it.

56
00:05:27,055 --> 00:05:29,405
Why didn't you lie to me for the rest of my life?

57
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,080
I'm sorry.

58
00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:02,097
Your Majesty,

59
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:04,852
please slow down.

60
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,549
This isn't in accordance with the rules.

61
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,600
If you would allow me to... I mean...

62
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,950
Your Majesty, may I announce your arrival first before you go in?

63
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:17,664
Please listen to me.

64
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,079
I must report

65
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,529
to His Majesty before you go in, don't I?

66
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,120
Your Majesty...

67
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,669
I've come to see you, Your Majesty.

68
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,482
It's rare to see you.

69
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,602
We haven't seen each other

70
00:06:51,706 --> 00:06:52,986
since the massacre years ago.

71
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:58,896
I seem to remember that you're afraid of the dark, right?

72
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:01,392
Your Majesty,

73
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:03,922
I fear the dark

74
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,842
because the cries of my family

75
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,002
echo in my ears.

76
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,400
I couldn't let go.

77
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,000
But now, I feel

78
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,633
it's time to move on.

79
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:24,322
Your Majesty,

80
00:07:26,232 --> 00:07:28,183
I have come to confess my sins.

81
00:07:30,092 --> 00:07:31,522
What sins?

82
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,363
Rebellion and disobedience.

83
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,802
Even though Your Majesty

84
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:43,242
slaughtered my entire family back then,

85
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:45,962
you still kept me

86
00:07:46,524 --> 00:07:49,082
in the position of Empress all these years

87
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:52,522
for old times' sake.

88
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:54,602
Instead of being grateful,

89
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,271
I harbored resentment for years

90
00:07:57,915 --> 00:07:59,826
and even avoided seeing Your Majesty.

91
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:02,538
Such heartlessness

92
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:06,145
is a sin that cannot be forgiven.

93
00:08:10,764 --> 00:08:13,155
Are you here to seek death?

94
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:16,104
My sins are unforgivable.

95
00:08:18,954 --> 00:08:21,345
Then why not hang yourself?

96
00:08:26,952 --> 00:08:28,232
Your Majesty,

97
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:29,995
that cannot be.

98
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:33,722
I am still the empress.

99
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:35,442
If I were to hang myself,

100
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:37,562
future historians would inevitably

101
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:39,376
add idle gossip.

102
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:43,602
Anything that tarnishes Your Majesty's reputation,

103
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:45,762
I would be guilty

104
00:08:45,995 --> 00:08:47,305
even in death.

105
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:51,529
I implore Your Majesty to first strip me of my title as Empress,

106
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,890
then decree my punishment.

107
00:08:57,914 --> 00:08:59,242
I can't let this go.

108
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:03,209
I know.

109
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:05,762
Whatever decision you make,

110
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:07,554
I understand.

111
00:09:22,274 --> 00:09:24,065
But I can't hurt you.

112
00:09:25,674 --> 00:09:26,954
I owe it to you.

113
00:09:32,075 --> 00:09:33,355
Who killed him?

114
00:09:33,794 --> 00:09:35,074
Give me a name.

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,549
Was it Mr. Wu Zhu?

116
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:40,995
You said

117
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:43,024
you grew up with him.

118
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:45,755
Yes.

119
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:47,355
So was my brother.

120
00:09:48,514 --> 00:09:50,264
If Mr. Wu Zhu was killed,

121
00:09:51,554 --> 00:09:52,834
what would you do?

122
00:09:55,514 --> 00:09:56,794
I would go mad.

123
00:09:57,195 --> 00:09:59,115
- I would seek revenge. - I would do the same.

124
00:10:03,115 --> 00:10:04,395
One last question,

125
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:07,023
when he killed him,

126
00:10:09,423 --> 00:10:11,173
was it on your orders?

127
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:17,314
- More or less. - More of less?

128
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:21,185
Mr. Wu Zhu wasn't by my side at the time,

129
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,114
and I intended to kill him myself.

130
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:24,394
I had already left the capital,

131
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:25,825
I was just a step behind.

132
00:10:27,195 --> 00:10:28,475
If he wasn't by your side,

133
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:30,755
then he acted on his own.

134
00:10:30,835 --> 00:10:32,871
It wasn't him, it was me. I wanted to kill him.

135
00:10:32,952 --> 00:10:34,232
It's different.

136
00:10:39,394 --> 00:10:40,674
I want to kill him.

137
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:42,864
I'm going to kill Wu Zhu.

138
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:46,811
Mr. Wu Zhu has fought with Ku He before.

139
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:48,674
He is as strong as a grandmaster.

140
00:10:48,754 --> 00:10:50,834
- I know. - I'm afraid you can't injure him.

141
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:52,194
I know that too,

142
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:53,914
but whether I can or cannot

143
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:56,384
doesn't mean I shouldn't try.

144
00:10:57,044 --> 00:10:58,873
Wan Er, I won't let Mr. Wu Zhu harm you.

145
00:10:58,954 --> 00:11:00,234
Likewise,

146
00:11:00,338 --> 00:11:02,007
I don't want you to hurt him either.

147
00:11:07,674 --> 00:11:08,954
I'm deeply disappointed.

148
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:14,715
I understand.

149
00:11:15,214 --> 00:11:16,525
In myself.

150
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:27,963
I can't believe it,

151
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,370
but when you said

152
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:34,135
you didn't order him to kill him,

153
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:37,122
I actually felt relieved,

154
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:40,922
because then I could direct

155
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:45,247
all my hatred toward Wu Zhu alone.

156
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,092
I couldn't bring myself to hate you,

157
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:51,882
so I'm disappointed in myself.

158
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:55,138
At that moment,

159
00:11:57,154 --> 00:11:58,504
I chose you

160
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:01,104
and betrayed my brother.

161
00:12:02,874 --> 00:12:04,154
Wan Er...

162
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:07,642
My goal to kill Wu Zhu

163
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,703
is between me and him,

164
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:11,675
it has nothing to do with you.

165
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:19,034
Say no more.

166
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:21,253
The one who told me this

167
00:12:21,835 --> 00:12:23,115
was Cheng Ze.

168
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:25,402
He wanted to use me to kill you.

169
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:28,977
Since he's made his move, he must have a follow-up plan.

170
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,722
I'm going back now.

171
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,362
If he comes looking for me again,

172
00:12:34,315 --> 00:12:35,922
I'll pry for information for you.

173
00:12:59,075 --> 00:13:00,355
Carry on.

174
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,642
As for the crime,

175
00:13:08,874 --> 00:13:11,384
Fan Xian was assassinated in Guangxin Palace.

176
00:13:11,568 --> 00:13:13,802
As the head of the harem,

177
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:15,762
I failed in my duty to oversee the palace.

178
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:18,122
It is only right

179
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:20,594
that I be held accountable for negligence.

180
00:13:25,463 --> 00:13:27,453
You have thought this through quite thoroughly.

181
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:30,602
I owe Your Majesty a debt

182
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:32,722
that I should have repaid long ago.

183
00:13:32,955 --> 00:13:34,235
Is there anything else?

184
00:13:38,663 --> 00:13:40,282
Before I die,

185
00:13:41,903 --> 00:13:43,562
I want to see Fan Xian.

186
00:13:48,475 --> 00:13:50,202
Although the grievances of the past

187
00:13:50,634 --> 00:13:52,225
are bygones,

188
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:55,472
this boy

189
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,877
was born without a mother.

190
00:13:59,195 --> 00:14:00,475
So...

191
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:04,568
So,

192
00:14:05,481 --> 00:14:07,282
I should apologize to him.

193
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:15,442
You want to apologize to him?

194
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,552
When a person is about to die,

195
00:14:20,137 --> 00:14:22,122
they should settle their grievances

196
00:14:22,703 --> 00:14:24,254
so they can depart peacefully.

197
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:29,242
Is there anything else you want to say?

198
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,315
Regarding the assassination in Guangxin Palace,

199
00:14:31,514 --> 00:14:33,224
Li Yun Rui cannot escape blame.

200
00:14:33,703 --> 00:14:35,512
Since my title as Empress is to be removed,

201
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,129
she should also be punished for her involvement.

202
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:45,630
I dare not deceive Your Majesty,

203
00:14:45,823 --> 00:14:47,933
this request is partly for justice,

204
00:14:48,435 --> 00:14:49,842
partly for personal reasons.

205
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:53,782
I relinquish my position

206
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:56,464
to dissolve Fan Xian's resentment,

207
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,082
so it won't put Your Majesty in a difficult position.

208
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,536
As for Li Yun Rui,

209
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:03,653
it will cut off the support for Li Cheng Ze.

210
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:08,513
This is also

211
00:15:09,177 --> 00:15:10,722
for the sake of the crown prince.

212
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,362
The crown prince is gentle and kind,

213
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:16,504
and values filial piety above all.

214
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,362
Besides respect for Your Majesty,

215
00:15:19,513 --> 00:15:21,362
he has no other intentions.

216
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:23,792
And of course,

217
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:26,122
the crown prince knows nothing

218
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:28,402
of my request today.

219
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:30,642
It is my own decision.

220
00:15:44,384 --> 00:15:45,439
Xian,

221
00:15:46,051 --> 00:15:47,442
I heard everything.

222
00:15:48,752 --> 00:15:50,922
Wan Er won't be able to harm Mr. Wu Zhu.

223
00:15:51,915 --> 00:15:53,195
I know,

224
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:56,602
and she knows it too.

225
00:15:56,976 --> 00:15:58,562
So she's doing this

226
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,042
more to punish herself

227
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:04,835
than to seek revenge.

228
00:16:07,212 --> 00:16:08,684
- What is that for? - Someone tried to assassinate you today,

229
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:09,922
I have to protect you.

230
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:12,519
When Wan Er was peeling the fruit, I was more nervous than her.

231
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,002
She's your sister-in-law.

232
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:16,351
This knife is just for precaution

233
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,562
Actually, I wanted to use this.

234
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:19,929
What good would that do?

235
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:23,758
I asked Senior Leng for some chloroform during your last treatment.

236
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:26,553
And you applied it on the needle?

237
00:16:26,806 --> 00:16:29,002
I tried it. It knocks someone out with just a prick. It works.

238
00:16:29,026 --> 00:16:30,706
- Who did you try it on? - Physician Li.

239
00:16:30,774 --> 00:16:32,656
That's ridiculous. How could you try it on Physician Li?

240
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,959
- He volunteered. - Why would he volunteer to let you prick him?

241
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:36,389
He wanted to learn your surgery skills.

242
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,248
He said chloroform would be useful in the future,

243
00:16:38,272 --> 00:16:40,352
and he wanted to experiment with the dosage himself.

244
00:16:40,395 --> 00:16:43,122
Ruo Ruo, you should learn from Physician Li.

245
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,650
He studies medicine to save lives.

246
00:16:44,766 --> 00:16:46,365
I'm also trying to save lives, Xian.

247
00:16:46,446 --> 00:16:47,714
I'm trying to save you.

248
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:49,115
I have guards protecting me.

249
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:51,555
But the guards didn't come in when Wan Er was with you just now.

250
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:53,488
The guards are meant to protect me against assassins!

251
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,582
The one who will hurt you may not be an assassin.

252
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,311
Don't be like this, you two.

253
00:17:03,818 --> 00:17:05,522
One wants to kill Mr. Wu Zhu,

254
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:07,509
the other is standing by with a knife.

255
00:17:10,754 --> 00:17:11,962
Xian...

256
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:17,502
- What are you doing? - You're too agitated.

257
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:18,964
Your wound might reopen.

258
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:20,362
I'm fine.

259
00:17:21,863 --> 00:17:23,202
You say you're fine,

260
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:24,737
but you're more anxious than I am.

261
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,488
Here, drink it.

262
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,482
I've only added a small dose.

263
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:43,332
It will just make you sleep soundly.

264
00:17:43,704 --> 00:17:46,454
Xian, you need to rest at ease now.

265
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:48,218
Stop worrying about protecting me.

266
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:52,689
I got it.

267
00:18:12,115 --> 00:18:13,606
If you see Mr. Wu Zhu...

268
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:15,922
I know. I'll tell him not to hurt Wan Er.

269
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:19,754
Ruo Ruo,

270
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,155
this matter

271
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:25,264
isn't over yet.

272
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:27,674
It's all right, Xian.

273
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,999
Stop thinking about it.

274
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:30,354
Go to sleep.

275
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,304
With Mr. Wu Zhu's skills,

276
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,922
he won't put you in a difficult spot.

277
00:18:35,343 --> 00:18:36,623
I hope so.

278
00:18:39,489 --> 00:18:41,522
As long as Mr. Wu Zhu is around...

279
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,855
When Mr. Wu Zhu isn't around,

280
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:04,665
I am your last line of defense.

281
00:19:05,634 --> 00:19:06,914
Don't worry,

282
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,962
no matter what happens,

283
00:19:09,043 --> 00:19:10,713
I'll be by your side protecting you,

284
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,514
never absent.

285
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,525
I will not remove you from your position as Empress.

286
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,751
As for Fan Xian, there's no need for you to see him.

287
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,442
I just want to atone for my sins.

288
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:55,278
You should live well.

289
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:09,007
What about the assassination in Guangxin Palace?

290
00:20:09,232 --> 00:20:12,842
Li Yun Rui has nothing to do with the assassination.

291
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,202
Who else in this palace but Li Yun Rui could have set it up?

292
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,282
You

293
00:20:27,257 --> 00:20:30,887
have exhausted the bond between us.

294
00:20:33,913 --> 00:20:35,193
We shall not

295
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:38,056
see each other again!

296
00:21:00,355 --> 00:21:01,522
Your Majesty,

297
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,765
I've heard

298
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:08,602
that those who possess everything

299
00:21:09,623 --> 00:21:11,442
ultimately end up with nothing.

300
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:45,354
Leave the capital?

301
00:21:45,463 --> 00:21:47,332
It's His Majesty's order.

302
00:21:48,327 --> 00:21:50,265
There must be a destination, then.

303
00:21:50,822 --> 00:21:52,413
His Majesty said you didn't get

304
00:21:52,494 --> 00:21:56,204
to admire the flowers due to the assassin attempt last time.

305
00:21:56,343 --> 00:21:59,322
His Majesty has ordered you to go again and admire them alone.

306
00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:01,617
Am I allowed to turn this down?

307
00:22:04,985 --> 00:22:06,553
He's always so spontaneous.

308
00:22:07,273 --> 00:22:09,433
Please lift me onto the carriage then. Thank you.

309
00:22:09,514 --> 00:22:11,234
Lord Fan is getting on the carriage!

310
00:22:11,352 --> 00:22:12,632
Yes, My Lord!

311
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,727
Coming right up.

312
00:22:22,395 --> 00:22:23,704
Who's coming right up?

313
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,623
Lord Fan is coming right up.

314
00:22:26,704 --> 00:22:27,984
Who am I then?

315
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:31,922
Easy there.

316
00:22:33,574 --> 00:22:35,733
Put him down gently.

317
00:22:36,345 --> 00:22:37,425
Gently.

318
00:22:37,543 --> 00:22:38,823
Gently.

319
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:08,122
Lift Lord Fan onto the carriage.

320
00:23:22,584 --> 00:23:24,962
My Lord, please come with me.

321
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,863
Where am I going?

322
00:23:36,687 --> 00:23:37,967
What's going on?

323
00:23:38,395 --> 00:23:41,074
From now on, he's Fan Xian, and I'm the fake one?

324
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,922
This combined with this

325
00:23:49,543 --> 00:23:50,682
is gentle,

326
00:23:51,048 --> 00:23:53,119
this and this

327
00:23:53,835 --> 00:23:55,145
are strong.

328
00:23:55,705 --> 00:23:58,591
Combining these three together,

329
00:24:00,721 --> 00:24:02,202
it's incurable.

330
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,482
Make way, please.

331
00:24:08,752 --> 00:24:10,032
Leave them the room.

332
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:14,082
- Do you need something? - I'm hiding.

333
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:16,402
Hang on, who has the ability

334
00:24:16,568 --> 00:24:18,719
to drive you here?

335
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,447
Fan Jian.

336
00:24:22,304 --> 00:24:24,482
He's getting older and more irritable.

337
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,801
It's better to avoid him.

338
00:24:26,904 --> 00:24:29,407
What does he want from you?

339
00:24:29,823 --> 00:24:31,103
Nothing serious.

340
00:24:31,412 --> 00:24:32,842
Fan Xian left the city.

341
00:24:33,456 --> 00:24:34,736
Fan Xian left...

342
00:24:35,044 --> 00:24:36,594
Didn't you say Fan Xian was injured?

343
00:24:36,728 --> 00:24:38,517
When Fan Xian was recuperating

344
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:42,447
a eunuch attempted assassination, but he's safe.

345
00:24:42,992 --> 00:24:45,821
How did news of the assassination attempt leak out of the palace?

346
00:24:46,647 --> 00:24:48,247
That's why Fan Jian is very worried now.

347
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:50,951
If His Majesty wanted to keep such news hidden,

348
00:24:51,108 --> 00:24:52,439
it wouldn't have leaked out.

349
00:24:58,712 --> 00:25:00,242
So, this is a setup, huh?

350
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,671
Fan Xian is the bait.

351
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,579
And who will this bait lure out?

352
00:25:07,404 --> 00:25:09,275
Fan Xian is injured.

353
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:11,206
And Lord Wu

354
00:25:12,697 --> 00:25:14,086
never showed up?

355
00:25:19,595 --> 00:25:23,665
Everyone says all Fei Jie knows is using poison.

356
00:25:24,943 --> 00:25:25,973
They're wrong.

357
00:26:12,115 --> 00:26:14,024
When Fan Xian was recuperating in the palace,

358
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,687
he was under layers of protection,

359
00:26:15,768 --> 00:26:17,397
it couldn't be safer.

360
00:26:17,935 --> 00:26:19,634
That's why Lord Wu didn't show up.

361
00:26:19,736 --> 00:26:22,842
But after the assassination attempt, and he's now leaving the city alone,

362
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:28,247
Lord Wu would surely protect him covertly.

363
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,518
So, this setup

364
00:26:32,595 --> 00:26:34,024
is to lure out Lord Wu.

365
00:27:22,913 --> 00:27:25,103
But there is one problem.

366
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,269
Only a grandmaster

367
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:30,464
is strong enough

368
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,375
to fight Lord Wu.

369
00:27:32,976 --> 00:27:35,486
Ye Liu Yun is in Jiangnan,

370
00:27:35,675 --> 00:27:37,825
Ku He hasn't headed south,

371
00:27:38,898 --> 00:27:41,368
- and Si Gu Jian... - Si Gu Jian is still in Dongyi City.

372
00:27:44,016 --> 00:27:46,647
Could it be the one in the palace...

373
00:27:48,195 --> 00:27:49,475
Wait, that's not right.

374
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,159
If the one inside the palace really wants to fight him himself,

375
00:27:54,185 --> 00:27:57,294
no one knows who will win or lose.

376
00:27:58,682 --> 00:28:02,112
If he were severely injured, the balance would be disrupted.

377
00:28:02,713 --> 00:28:06,183
His Majesty wouldn't take that risk.

378
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:09,115
You kept me here

379
00:28:09,195 --> 00:28:13,275
because I was getting too close

380
00:28:13,424 --> 00:28:15,533
to the truth.

381
00:28:16,234 --> 00:28:18,504
The murderer in Jiangnan

382
00:28:19,595 --> 00:28:21,345
isn't Lord Wu.

383
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:24,762
When he ambushed me,

384
00:28:24,882 --> 00:28:27,392
his weapon and techniques were similar

385
00:28:28,155 --> 00:28:30,145
to Lord Wu's.

386
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:33,951
He targeted the men from the Overwatch Council

387
00:28:34,055 --> 00:28:35,926
to draw out Lord Wu.

388
00:28:40,435 --> 00:28:42,073
His Majesty is willing to cooperate with you

389
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:44,097
in hunting down the betrayer of the Divine Temple.

390
00:28:59,234 --> 00:29:00,567
The envoy sent by the Divine Temple

391
00:29:00,591 --> 00:29:03,341
committed all those murders in Jiangnan just to hunt down Lord Wu.

392
00:29:04,395 --> 00:29:06,224
No wonder I lost track of him

393
00:29:06,675 --> 00:29:08,504
once he reached the capital.

394
00:29:10,955 --> 00:29:13,665
His Majesty must have erased his tracks.

395
00:29:16,031 --> 00:29:17,751
This matter has settled.

396
00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:20,383
Does His Majesty really want to kill Lord Wu that badly?

397
00:29:21,474 --> 00:29:23,825
If he does, why hasn't Hong Si Yang made a move?

398
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,800
Hang on,

399
00:29:27,592 --> 00:29:30,582
His Majesty and you wouldn't make such a mistake.

400
00:29:31,873 --> 00:29:33,153
In this setup,

401
00:29:33,433 --> 00:29:37,822
what His Majesty truly wants to see is mutual destruction.

402
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:43,991
That's why I say nothing escapes you.

403
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:49,408
President, I'm surprised you went along with this scheme.

404
00:29:49,898 --> 00:29:53,088
Can you really bear to watch Lord Wu meet his demise?

405
00:29:53,307 --> 00:29:54,802
Over these years,

406
00:29:54,955 --> 00:29:57,304
the Divine Temple has been searching for Wu Zhu,

407
00:29:57,701 --> 00:29:59,211
not just today.

408
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,980
Are you saying it's not just this time?

409
00:30:02,704 --> 00:30:04,682
Mutual destruction is impossible.

410
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:07,102
It will only end with...

411
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,120
You have to have faith in him.

412
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,562
President,

413
00:30:15,544 --> 00:30:17,375
there's something I don't understand.

414
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,167
Whose side are you really on?

415
00:31:07,745 --> 00:31:09,482
I went to the south looking for you,

416
00:31:10,155 --> 00:31:11,802
but you did not show up.

417
00:31:13,395 --> 00:31:15,115
You are the one killing people in Jiangnan.

418
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,301
I thought you would show up.

419
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:19,954
Why are you looking for me?

420
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,391
Come back with me.

421
00:31:22,336 --> 00:31:23,705
You are from

422
00:31:25,888 --> 00:31:27,088
the Divine Temple?

423
00:31:27,192 --> 00:31:28,472
You are redundant.

424
00:31:28,794 --> 00:31:30,194
You should not exist in this world.

425
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,640
Come back with me.

426
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:40,416
Fine.

427
00:31:42,288 --> 00:31:43,639
I have forgotten too much.

428
00:31:44,514 --> 00:31:45,794
Maybe I can recover

429
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:49,202
my lost memories at the Divine Temple.

430
00:31:56,754 --> 00:31:59,304
Ye Qing Mei must also return.

431
00:32:01,697 --> 00:32:02,977
She is dead.

432
00:32:03,902 --> 00:32:05,182
She has a son.

433
00:32:06,394 --> 00:32:08,002
This is a residual trace,

434
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:09,822
an error that should not exist.

435
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:13,274
Find him and bring him back to the Divine Temple.

436
00:32:15,706 --> 00:32:17,535
So, you do not actually know who he is.

437
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:20,642
The conclusion is abrupt and the pre-conditions are vague.

438
00:32:20,863 --> 00:32:22,553
Judging from the conversation,

439
00:32:22,856 --> 00:32:25,566
I should have already met Ye Qing Mei's son.

440
00:32:30,314 --> 00:32:31,594
The negotiation

441
00:32:32,435 --> 00:32:33,561
is over.

442
00:33:35,448 --> 00:33:37,131
You have chosen to return to the Divine Temple.

443
00:33:37,155 --> 00:33:39,154
This conflict is unnecessary.

444
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,509
Protecting him is my mission.

445
00:36:00,505 --> 00:36:01,682
Your Majesty?

446
00:36:02,672 --> 00:36:03,914
What is this place?

447
00:36:07,737 --> 00:36:10,362
This is a place you should have come to a long time ago.

448
00:36:11,915 --> 00:36:13,195
There's someone here

449
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:15,317
you need to see.

450
00:36:16,114 --> 00:36:17,394
Who?

451
00:36:17,955 --> 00:36:19,235
Come with me.

452
00:37:41,944 --> 00:37:44,482
You still look so young,

453
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:48,271
while I have aged.

454
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,610
Take a good look.

455
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:07,406
This is the only portrait your mother left behind when she was alive.

456
00:38:26,194 --> 00:38:27,474
At that time,

457
00:38:28,034 --> 00:38:30,264
she was like a dazzling meteor,

458
00:38:30,857 --> 00:38:34,527
and also like a blazing flame,

459
00:38:34,994 --> 00:38:38,264
showing the people of Qing Kingdom a different light.

460
00:39:39,803 --> 00:39:44,482
(Good Governance and Harmonious People)

461
00:40:05,766 --> 00:40:06,766
Your Majesty,

462
00:40:07,047 --> 00:40:09,487
Wu Zhu's skill far surpasses that of the Divine Temple Envoy.

463
00:40:09,848 --> 00:40:12,158
Even though we've used armor-piercing arrows and new bows,

464
00:40:12,182 --> 00:40:13,462
he still managed to escape.

465
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,080
Wu Zhu is severely wounded and his whereabouts are unknown.

466
00:40:16,184 --> 00:40:17,225
From what I've observed,

467
00:40:17,321 --> 00:40:19,910
only a grandmaster can defeat him.

468
00:40:28,994 --> 00:40:30,945
The Divine Temple Envoy

469
00:40:31,941 --> 00:40:33,890
is no ordinary mortal in flesh.

470
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:37,936
So what?

471
00:40:38,463 --> 00:40:39,892
He could still die.

472
00:40:42,835 --> 00:40:44,002
Burn him.

473
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:45,515
Yes, Your Majesty.

474
00:41:17,744 --> 00:41:18,882
Come.

475
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,110
Look at those chrysanthemums. Your mother planted them herself.

476
00:41:27,087 --> 00:41:29,797
The flowers at the Xuankong Temple were moved from here?

477
00:41:32,248 --> 00:41:34,682
You brought her along every flower-viewing activity?

478
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:36,389
She liked them.

479
00:41:36,888 --> 00:41:38,007
She liked flowers?

480
00:41:38,111 --> 00:41:41,341
She liked every living thing.

481
00:41:45,657 --> 00:41:47,807
Why does my mother in the portrait look so young?

482
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,790
That portrait was from when I first met her.

483
00:41:54,275 --> 00:41:55,555
That was how she looked like.

484
00:42:00,336 --> 00:42:01,784
Do you miss her a lot?

485
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,434
That's why...

486
00:42:06,435 --> 00:42:09,105
That's why I entrusted the Imperial Treasury to you

487
00:42:09,273 --> 00:42:12,503
because you are her flesh and blood.

488
00:42:13,554 --> 00:42:14,945
In this world,

489
00:42:16,514 --> 00:42:17,864
only you can take over it.

490
00:42:19,425 --> 00:42:20,705
Do I

491
00:42:21,783 --> 00:42:23,063
look like her?

492
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:25,481
You're not as beautiful as she was,

493
00:42:25,505 --> 00:42:28,015
but your inner qualities are very similar.

494
00:42:33,152 --> 00:42:34,623
I'm not as brave as she was.

495
00:42:36,647 --> 00:42:39,447
I remember she once told me,

496
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:42,174
being an emperor is not an easy job.

497
00:42:42,537 --> 00:42:46,447
It requires a strong heart and unwavering will.

498
00:42:46,528 --> 00:42:47,808
Therefore,

499
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:51,614
some things must be abandoned,

500
00:42:52,286 --> 00:42:53,566
including

501
00:42:54,776 --> 00:42:56,726
the most precious things.
