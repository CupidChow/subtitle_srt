00:01:25,242 --> 00:01:30,965
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:34,093
(Episode 21)

3
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:38,117
Don't call me Benefactor anymore.

4
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,090
Understood,

5
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,730
Lord Fan.

6
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,689
What do you understand?

7
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,450
From now on,

8
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,082
Lord Fan, I'll only remember your kindness by heart.

9
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,409
I will never bring it up

10
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,010
in front of anyone else.

11
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,290
Lead the way for now.

12
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,855
I have plenty of affairs to attend to.

13
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,129
My Lord, please.

14
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,059
Fan Xian brought up the issue of changing the name

15
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,762
on the roll of honor in front of His Majesty?

16
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,530
More than that.

17
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,682
His Majesty handed the past fraud cases to him.

18
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:37,682
However, the one on the roll of honor

19
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,600
is your protege after all.

20
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,442
Mother,

21
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,162
I think Fan Xian is right.

22
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,232
Since I didn't arrange for it, it'd come back to haunt me in the future.

23
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:48,896
If so, why don't I do things above board?

24
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,490
As for my proteges,

25
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,839
getting rid of a few of them won't affect me.

26
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,639
Although that's the case,

27
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,162
your dignity is still affected.

28
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:02,223
I don't have any dignity.

29
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,362
You're the crown prince.

30
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,560
That's precisely why

31
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,760
I can't afford to retain any dignity.

32
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,889
Where are the rest?

33
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:29,827
The rest?

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,374
Didn't you tell Zi Yue to take them with him to seal off the exam hall?

35
00:03:32,398 --> 00:03:34,157
Oh yeah. I'm so forgetful.

36
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:36,322
- Give it to me. - No, My Lord.

37
00:03:36,432 --> 00:03:39,364
I'm not tired yet. Let me carry them. They belong to the palace.

38
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:41,722
I need you to relay a message to Deng Zi Yue.

39
00:03:41,862 --> 00:03:44,822
We can't delay the result announcement of the Spring Imperial Examination.

40
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:47,557
What about the roll of honor, then?

41
00:03:47,703 --> 00:03:50,023
Naturally, we need to re-include Yang Wan Li's name in it.

42
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,119
Who shall do the correction, then?

43
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,889
Are you serious?

44
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,202
Wait. It's that wordy?

45
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:15,479
Why don't we just cross out this name

46
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,000
and add Yang Wan Li's name at the side?

47
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,682
Supposedly, that will do.

48
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:23,546
But it's the roll of honor after all.

49
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,759
I think it's inappropriate for us

50
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,282
to make amendments to it.

51
00:04:29,254 --> 00:04:30,737
You do have a point.

52
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,922
But, what if I write it incorrectly?

53
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,802
Qi Nian, you should look on the bright side.

54
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:40,362
What bright side is there for me?

55
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:43,616
For example,

56
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,576
Qi Nian, you're the only person who has copied

57
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,079
the roll of honor by hand since ancient times.

58
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,290
You do have a point.

59
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,449
But I...

60
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,440
No. What if I write it incorrectly?

61
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,850
Zi Yue, you should do it.

62
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:58,040
That won't do.

63
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,840
Lord Fan instructed you to do so.

64
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,799
No. Your handwriting is better than mine.

65
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,159
I'm also luckier than you.

66
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,680
At least I don't need to do this.

67
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,170
You...

68
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,665
Logically speaking, the Ministry of Rites was supposed to do this.

69
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,999
Lord Fan said

70
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,696
that the Ministry of Rites was responsible for

71
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,640
putting the roll of honor on display every year.

72
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,122
They're already tired of it.

73
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,319
This year,

74
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,240
the First Bureau will do it on their behalf.

75
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,680
Even so, I don't think the roll of honor needs to be this huge.

76
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,760
Lord Fan also said this.

77
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,175
This year's Spring Imperial Examination

78
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,000
focuses on fairness.

79
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,319
We're using a huge roll of honor

80
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:28,519
to announce to the world that fairness has been preserved.

81
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,999
If it's that important,

82
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,479
Lord Fan should be writing it personally.

83
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,042
Can you think before you speak?

84
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,758
Have you not seen his handwriting before?

85
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,985
You do have a point. If he writes it personally,

86
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:58,541
it'll bring us shame instead.

87
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,642
Besides,

88
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,682
Lord Fan is busy right now.

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,040
His Majesty already handed all the fraud cases in the past exams

90
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,558
to Lord Fan.

91
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,510
Lord Fan is investigating them right now.

92
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,279
All of those are old cases.

93
00:07:15,422 --> 00:07:16,902
I wonder how he can investigate them.

94
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,199
Can you shut up for once?

95
00:07:20,302 --> 00:07:21,943
What if I wrote the wrong thing?

96
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,669
I was just concerned about Lord Fan.

97
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,776
He's investigating it in the cell.

98
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,120
Cell? Which cell?

99
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,280
Cell in the First Bureau!

100
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:30,870
Can you stop talking now?

101
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,630
Take a look! Is it crooked?

102
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:47,280
Qi Nian, I can't tell.

103
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:49,231
You can't tell?

104
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,240
I truly can't tell.

105
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,202
I'll just proceed with it.

106
00:08:10,217 --> 00:08:16,160
(Yang Wan...)

107
00:08:20,982 --> 00:08:23,002
(Yang Wan Li)

108
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,322
What are you doing here?

109
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:42,697
Me?

110
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,520
I'm here to keep my father company.

111
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:47,878
No. I mean, how did you manage to enter our dungeon?

112
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:49,702
I told Wang Qi Nian about it.

113
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,255
Did Qi Nian allow you to enter just like that?

114
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,400
- At first, he didn't agree to it. - And then?

115
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,576
After that, I asked him this.

116
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,762
I asked him

117
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:59,102
whether or not my return to the capital was a covert operation.

118
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,882
- Of course. - He said the same thing.

119
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,655
After that, I told him this.

120
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:06,082
Since it was a covert operation, we don't want people to find out, right?

121
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:09,282
If so, isn't it suitable for me to remain in the dungeon?

122
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:10,657
What kind of nonsense is that?

123
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,375
You're actually making a point for once.

124
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,798
After that, I said this.

125
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,842
I said Fan Xian requested my father to help him out.

126
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,400
What if he wants to silence him after the deed is done?

127
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,360
It'll be inappropriate if I manage to escape.

128
00:09:23,503 --> 00:09:25,902
That's why I want to remain in the dungeon together with my father.

129
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:27,566
In the event that you want to silence us,

130
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,600
it'll be more convenient for both sides.

131
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,962
Father.

132
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,162
After that, Wang Qi Nian granted me entry.

133
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,529
Have some tea.

134
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,959
Aren't you afraid that I might silence him for real?

135
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,762
You aren't that kind of person.

136
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,241
- Do you have that much trust in me? - It's not about trusting you.

137
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,879
I just want to keep my father company.

138
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,522
Lord Fan, I want to thank you for transferring me

139
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,842
to the First Bureau from the Ministry of Justice.

140
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,482
This place is much more comfortable.

141
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,056
I'll release you in a few more days.

142
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,409
Don't worry. I won't silence you.

143
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,610
Actually,

144
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,878
I do know something about these cases.

145
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,250
Can I investigate them?

146
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,799
You can.

147
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,042
But...

148
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,160
So what if you do investigate them?

149
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:35,200
In the end, only a few individuals can tamper with the exam result.

150
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,559
The crown prince, the princes, Princess Yun Rui,

151
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,599
Chancellor Lin, President Chen,

152
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,030
and the Qin family, which occupies the Ministry of War.

153
00:10:42,054 --> 00:10:43,304
Out of all of them,

154
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,408
whom do you think you can press charges upon?

155
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:46,722
Don't worry. I'm not that dense.

156
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
I don't plan on toppling these major figures.

157
00:10:50,646 --> 00:10:52,246
Lord Fan, you're wise indeed.

158
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,839
Even if I can't deal with the masterminds,

159
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,280
I can deal with the errand boys.

160
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:06,319
Plenty of officials were mediators

161
00:11:06,461 --> 00:11:08,021
who embezzled funds during the exam.

162
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,250
If I operate on them,

163
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,999
at least those who intend to do the same will be fearful for some time.

164
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:17,239
This way, I can preserve some of the fairness.

165
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,160
The errand boys, huh?

166
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,679
Most of them are from the Ministry of Rites.

167
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,959
Do they have more clean officials or corrupt officials?

168
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,079
My Lord, how much money do you think a clean official should take?

169
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,255
Mr. Guo, please don't joke with me.

170
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,040
My Lord, you started joking with me first.

171
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,878
If so, I'll investigate all of them one by one.

172
00:11:37,902 --> 00:11:40,473
I won't let off those who have committed mistakes.

173
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,210
If that's the case,

174
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:45,129
I'll give you a name list.

175
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,560
These people are impatient.

176
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:50,119
It'll be easier if you start from them.

177
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,610
Sorry for the trouble.

178
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,868
Actually, for these cases,

179
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,482
the victims are the most important.

180
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,280
What victims?

181
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,280
The candidates who were maligned,

182
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,610
bribed,

183
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,119
and had their names changed.

184
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,079
Those are the victims.

185
00:12:09,182 --> 00:12:11,823
Since this is a case, you need plaintiffs.

186
00:12:13,918 --> 00:12:15,358
Mr. Guo, thank you for the reminder.

187
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:19,567
Don't thank me.

188
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,322
All the scholars in the world

189
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,242
should thank you instead, Lord Fan.

190
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:25,816
You flatter me.

191
00:12:26,216 --> 00:12:27,580
You're sweeping away fraud cases in the exam

192
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:29,885
and upholding justice for all scholars.

193
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:33,049
Words cannot express our gratitude.

194
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:48,482
- Who's looking for me? - He's at the entrance.

195
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:52,959
Xian!

196
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,289
Da Bao?

197
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,959
- Come inside. - Come out.

198
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:59,004
- Come inside. - Come out.

199
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:00,335
Just come inside.

200
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,144
Just come out.

201
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:03,386
I'll go out if you come inside.

202
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,679
I can't go inside. Just come out.

203
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,009
Hurry up!

204
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:11,402
Why didn't you go inside when I told you to?

205
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,876
I can't do that.

206
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,599
This is your workplace.

207
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:17,082
If I do something wrong inside,

208
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:19,422
people will laugh at you. You'll be embarrassed.

209
00:13:19,503 --> 00:13:21,155
Nonsense. No one dares to laugh at you.

210
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:22,245
- Come inside. - No.

211
00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:24,282
That won't do. I'm just here to visit you.

212
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,649
Who brought you here?

213
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,479
Yuan...

214
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,319
Mr. Yuan, huh? Is he alone?

215
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,359
Father can rest at ease with Mr. Yuan by my side.

216
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,823
- Of course. - Xian, are you free now?

217
00:13:37,926 --> 00:13:39,406
My father wants to have tea with you.

218
00:13:46,683 --> 00:13:49,499
Uncle could've just sent a messenger if he wanted to see me.

219
00:13:49,743 --> 00:13:51,423
Why did he make Da Bao come here?

220
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,470
Da Bao just misses you.

221
00:13:56,506 --> 00:13:58,322
Da Bao is a pure child.

222
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,802
People might bully him.

223
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,242
Lord Fan, please take care of him

224
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,970
in the future.

225
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,320
Seems like you're implying something.

226
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:12,760
My Lord, you're overthinking it.

227
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,359
I have some other matters to attend to.

228
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,999
Lord Fan, please send Da Bao

229
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:20,202
back to his residence.

230
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:21,935
You can go ahead.

231
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,690
Don't worry.

232
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,529
I'll look after Da Bao even if you didn't tell me that.

233
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:34,759
What's wrong with Mr. Yuan today?

234
00:14:34,902 --> 00:14:36,152
He's acting strange.

235
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,769
Maybe it's because

236
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,966
his candy is smaller than ours?

237
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,570
Maybe.

238
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,129
His Majesty

239
00:14:49,782 --> 00:14:52,782
told you to investigate the fraud cases in the Spring Imperial Examination.

240
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,879
The news spread this quickly, huh?

241
00:14:57,751 --> 00:14:59,162
To be honest with you,

242
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,000
all these years,

243
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,199
I did put quite a lot of names

244
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,680
on the roll of honor myself.

245
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,999
If you intend to investigate the case, you may start with me.

246
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:15,137
Don't stare at me.

247
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:17,682
I'm not testing you.

248
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,490
I'm being serious here.

249
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:23,959
How could you be serious about that?

250
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,157
News of this spread all over the capital

251
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:31,222
in an instant after you took over the task. What does that mean?

252
00:15:32,953 --> 00:15:35,158
That means His Majesty wants you to use the chance

253
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:36,599
to make a name for yourself

254
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:39,879
so that you can be ready before you take over the Imperial Treasury.

255
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,090
I know that.

256
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:44,863
President Chen gave me a reminder during today's court session.

257
00:15:45,302 --> 00:15:46,703
What will you do, then?

258
00:15:47,992 --> 00:15:49,735
Will you truly proceed with the investigation?

259
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,162
Who will you investigate?

260
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,240
No matter who you investigate, you'll get in trouble.

261
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,162
You'll make countless enemies if you're careless.

262
00:15:58,054 --> 00:15:59,494
If that's the case,

263
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,719
why don't you investigate me directly?

264
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,320
I'll prepare some individuals in advance.

265
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:05,878
I'll hand them to you by then.

266
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,037
Firstly, you can give His Majesty an account.

267
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,769
Secondly,

268
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,160
I can protect you.

269
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,640
We're members of the officialdom.

270
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,119
Excessive bravery will result

271
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,400
in an ominous outcome.

272
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,520
Uncle, you're just like a candle.

273
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,880
Come again?

274
00:16:26,006 --> 00:16:28,525
You burn yourself to light up my path.

275
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,013
Such nonsense.

276
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,640
What kind of twisted logic is that?

277
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,359
Uncle, I haven't had the chance to thank you yet.

278
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,560
You also helped me out during the Spring Imperial Examination.

279
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:46,602
You did a great job yourself.

280
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,520
You didn't even use

281
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:50,362
any of my arrangements.

282
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,879
But your intention is well appreciated.

283
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,250
My post

284
00:16:56,838 --> 00:16:58,351
is only below His Majesty.

285
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:02,282
Since I can protect you, I'll try to do it more often.

286
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,843
I have to give you some time.

287
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,959
Once you sprout and grow into

288
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,719
a huge tree, it'll be time for you to protect the Lin family.

289
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,569
I won't let you down.

290
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,400
You don't need to be that serious.

291
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:23,559
I won't retire from my post that quickly.

292
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,490
Don't worry.

293
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,519
No matter what kind of trouble you face, I'll be here for you.

294
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,719
Where did Mr. Yuan go?

295
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,624
I'm waiting for him to resume our game.

296
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,160
I can still win

297
00:17:40,878 --> 00:17:42,679
if I undo my previous move.

298
00:17:43,784 --> 00:17:45,867
Didn't Mr. Yuan go to attend to his affairs?

299
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,366
- What affairs? - I don't know.

300
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,162
- Didn't you arrange for it? - Is he seeing a guy or a girl?

301
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,799
How should I know?

302
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,039
That Mr. Yuan.

303
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,719
He may look like a decent person,

304
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,400
but I assume that he's a hypocrite.

305
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,479
Say, do you think he's keeping a mistress outside?

306
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,930
About that...

307
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,800
- Are you keeping a mistress, then? - No way!

308
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,983
Wan Er is the only girl I love.

309
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,207
- What about Si Li Li? - No.

310
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,338
What about Haitang Duo Duo?

311
00:18:13,373 --> 00:18:14,623
No.

312
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,802
What about Yuan Meng from Moon Embracing Pavilion?

313
00:18:19,176 --> 00:18:20,882
That's definitely not true!

314
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,680
She's the only one you deny, huh?

315
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:26,562
It's the same for the previous two!

316
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,202
Uncle, why are you setting me up?

317
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,200
You're finally here.

318
00:19:41,238 --> 00:19:42,488
Do you need to go that far?

319
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,759
Of course!

320
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,802
This is a giant roll of honor.

321
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:51,054
I dare not get even a single stroke wrong.

322
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,002
If only I could get some...

323
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,852
You're paying me that much for it?

324
00:19:56,953 --> 00:19:58,758
I feel much better now.

325
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,440
Are you done copying the entire thing?

326
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:03,920
Yes, My Lord.

327
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:07,402
I finally managed to put Yang Wan Li's name on it.

328
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,891
Good. Announce the result as usual tomorrow.

329
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,560
Wait. Aren't you going to take a look?

330
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,890
That'll be unnecessary.

331
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,562
- But this is a huge deal... - I trust you.

332
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,042
My Lord, after hearing that,

333
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,962
right now, I feel as if

334
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:24,922
I encounter a floating plank on a sinking boat

335
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,759
and a warm sun in the winter.

336
00:20:26,862 --> 00:20:28,842
Enough already. Stop buttering me up.

337
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:31,594
My Lord,

338
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,279
regarding the cases in Yinzhou you told me to investigate,

339
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:35,799
I've gotten to the bottom of it.

340
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,130
Back then,

341
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:40,160
the Chen family was massacred indeed.

342
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:43,009
Got it.

343
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,959
And, regarding your task in investigating the fraud cases,

344
00:20:48,286 --> 00:20:51,605
news of it has already spread throughout the capital.

345
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,160
Lord Fan, right now,

346
00:20:54,318 --> 00:20:56,678
you're a noble figure

347
00:20:56,782 --> 00:20:59,463
to all of the scholars.

348
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,782
You're just like a ray of eternal light.

349
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:05,879
You're exaggerating it.

350
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:07,582
But these rumors,

351
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,999
I think they started spreading from our bureau.

352
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:13,663
If so, that means President Chen was behind it.

353
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,362
It was His Majesty's order.

354
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,746
My Lord, say,

355
00:21:19,827 --> 00:21:22,198
is His Majesty trying to make you lead the literary circle

356
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,151
by using this opportunity?

357
00:21:26,638 --> 00:21:28,517
I can't tell at all.

358
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,600
I'm a lone subject,

359
00:21:32,168 --> 00:21:33,848
but he wants me to have such a reputation.

360
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,840
What exactly is His Majesty up to?

361
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,049
Qi Nian,

362
00:21:40,357 --> 00:21:43,317
I feel intelligent when I interact with people usually.

363
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,400
But when I encounter His Majesty,

364
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,440
I have no way of figuring him out.

365
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,890
Your Majesty,

366
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,000
Fan Xian has taken on the old fraud cases in the previous exams.

367
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,852
The witnesses can appear on stage at any time.

368
00:22:02,876 --> 00:22:05,836
Your Majesty, when do you think we should arrange for it?

369
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,015
Don't affect the result announcement.

370
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,202
Understood.

371
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,588
I shall act after the result announcement.

372
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:17,959
The affairs behind the old cases Fan Xian had taken on,

373
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,639
do you think he'll be able to handle them?

374
00:22:21,663 --> 00:22:22,913
He has no choice.

375
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,440
Aren't you guys going to help him out?

376
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,800
Your Majesty, you didn't issue an edict for it.

377
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,440
You're not a puppet.

378
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,369
Your Majesty,

379
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,369
I'm willing to be a puppet.

380
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:04,126
You tossed nine arrows.

381
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,199
You didn't hit the target even once.

382
00:23:06,975 --> 00:23:08,137
Fine.

383
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:09,758
I shall

384
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,310
grant you one more arrow.

385
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,200
You said you would obey all of my orders, right?

386
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,009
Here.

387
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,479
Now,

388
00:23:20,605 --> 00:23:21,686
I order you

389
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:23,642
to hit the target with this arrow.

390
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:27,849
But,

391
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,410
I'm not well-versed in this.

392
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,849
Do it.

393
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,569
Your Majesty,

394
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,089
I hit the target.

395
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,400
Look at the time.

396
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,400
President Chen, it's been tough on you.

397
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:22,880
President Chen, looks like you're in a great mood today.

398
00:24:22,983 --> 00:24:24,502
Eunuch Hou, you could tell too?

399
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:26,809
Excellent observation.

400
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,242
You flatter me.

401
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:29,600
Let me see you off.

402
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,999
It's fine. I know the way home.

403
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:58,290
A man with a woman's concern,

404
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:01,289
bonds,

405
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,080
all of those merely act as burdens.

406
00:25:13,473 --> 00:25:14,642
Calm down.

407
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,522
I'm sure your name is included when you're this knowledgeable.

408
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:19,009
Not at all.

409
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,362
Chan Li,

410
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:31,482
don't you think it's too late

411
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,930
for you to read the books now?

412
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,279
- You do have a point. - Chan Li.

413
00:25:38,374 --> 00:25:39,624
You're here.

414
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:41,399
Where's Cheng Jia Lin?

415
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,198
There are so many people here. I don't know where he went.

416
00:25:44,222 --> 00:25:45,742
It's fine. I'm sure he's here.

417
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:48,031
Guys, the Overwatch Council announced the result directly

418
00:25:48,055 --> 00:25:49,456
without the involvement of the Ministry of Rites.

419
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,880
This has never been seen before.

420
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,456
Lord Fan is rectifying the administration.

421
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,335
The state of Qing Kingdom will surely be renewed.

422
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:56,479
Yang Wan Li? Is that Yang Wan Li?

423
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,160
That's right. It's Yang Wan Li.

424
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,082
- Are you sure? - Wan Li.

425
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,039
I heard that the Overwatch Council is only announcing the result now

426
00:26:03,189 --> 00:26:05,162
because they want to add his name to the list.

427
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:06,396
It was him before this.

428
00:26:06,477 --> 00:26:07,734
But someone else took his place.

429
00:26:07,758 --> 00:26:09,160
Lord Fan thought it was unfair.

430
00:26:09,263 --> 00:26:10,722
That's why the matter blew up.

431
00:26:10,813 --> 00:26:12,063
So that's the case.

432
00:26:12,224 --> 00:26:13,263
No wonder.

433
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:16,002
- I knew it. - This has never been seen before.

434
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,410
This...

435
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,279
We shouldn't believe in such rumors.

436
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:22,232
So, Lord Fan went to see His Majesty all because of you.

437
00:26:22,313 --> 00:26:23,518
It's just a rumor.

438
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,959
Do you guys know who added Yang Wan Li's name

439
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,199
to the roll of honor?

440
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,800
Who was it? Was it Lord Fan?

441
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,999
It was His Majesty.

442
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:32,479
His Majesty did the amendment personally last night.

443
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,639
Who did you hear that from?

444
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,840
Everyone is saying that.

445
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,160
- Wan Li, I'm impressed. - That's a baseless rumor!

446
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,487
All of these are mere baseless rumors.

447
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:39,761
I'm ashamed.

448
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,922
Here it comes. Here it comes!

449
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,680
The official is here.

450
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,519
May all your wishes come true.

451
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:18,642
The result will be announced soon!

452
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:40,385
Don't you think the handwriting is crooked?

453
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:41,497
Who cares about that?

454
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:44,042
Seems like the result is fair this time around.

455
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,602
My name is on it!

456
00:27:46,683 --> 00:27:48,082
I failed again!

457
00:27:48,163 --> 00:27:49,642
My name is on it too!

458
00:27:49,723 --> 00:27:50,973
Wan Li.

459
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,933
- Yang Wan Li! - Where?

460
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,160
You're in fifth place!

461
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,590
You're one of the top candidates!

462
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,880
The roll of honor

463
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,856
shows no difference in ranks. All of us are the same.

464
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,842
You can scream if you feel like it.

465
00:28:03,522 --> 00:28:04,896
Look at those three words.

466
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,559
Don't you think they look different?

467
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,840
Yeah.

468
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,400
They look majestic!

469
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,960
- I'm sure His Majesty wrote them! - His Majesty wrote them!

470
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:13,881
Seems like the result is fair this time around.

471
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,959
I'm done for!

472
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:21,391
I can never pass the exam!

473
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:24,162
Why am I so unlucky?

474
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,279
My name is on it too!

475
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:27,759
The heavens didn't let me down!

476
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,210
Sir!

477
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:31,879
Sir! Don't die after passing the exam!

478
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,320
Ji Chang, your name is at the front too!

479
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,569
- Where? - Hou Ji Chang!

480
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:44,122
I can't believe it!

481
00:28:45,005 --> 00:28:46,502
We'll find your name later. And Jia Lin's name.

482
00:28:46,526 --> 00:28:47,776
That's right.

483
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,490
My name is on it too!

484
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,896
- I passed the exam! - You passed it too!

485
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,800
Your name is on it!

486
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,120
My name is on it!

487
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,279
Chan Li...

488
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,959
- Shi Chan Li... - Cheng Jia Lin!

489
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,202
- Cheng Jia Lin! - My name is on it!

490
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,585
I almost missed out on it.

491
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:07,242
I'm glad that my name is on it.

492
00:29:07,389 --> 00:29:08,722
- Chan Li. - Shi Chan Li...

493
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,962
Shi Chan Li...

494
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,587
Shi Chan Li.

495
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,080
Calm down. Maybe we just missed it.

496
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,775
- Let's check it again. - That's right.

497
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,049
Let's check it again.

498
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,569
Shi Chan Li...

499
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,799
Shi Chan Li...

500
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,042
My name is on it too!

501
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:39,162
My name is on it too!

502
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:41,042
My name is on it too!

503
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,730
Brothers.

504
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,369
Congratulations.

505
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:00,799
Congratulations on your success.

506
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,682
Devote yourself to studying,

507
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,199
and you'll surely pass it next time.

508
00:30:06,302 --> 00:30:07,552
May that be true.

509
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,642
Wan Li.

510
00:30:17,877 --> 00:30:19,495
Now that the roll of honor has been released,

511
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:21,042
everything has settled down.

512
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,759
It's time for us to visit Lord Fan.

513
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:25,119
Naturally.

514
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,671
Now that the roll of honor has been released,

515
00:30:26,695 --> 00:30:28,202
there are no other concerns

516
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,840
if we were to visit him now.

517
00:30:30,192 --> 00:30:31,915
I'll look for Jia Lin right now.

518
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,490
Jia Lin!

519
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,130
Your name is on it.

520
00:30:37,256 --> 00:30:38,506
Cheng Jia Lin!

521
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,439
I should join you guys.

522
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:41,922
Although I didn't pass the exam,

523
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,159
I should visit him and thank him personally as well.

524
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,450
Of course.

525
00:30:55,178 --> 00:30:57,581
Let's rehearse that again.

526
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:59,598
No need for that. We've done it so many times.

527
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,650
He's here.

528
00:31:10,158 --> 00:31:13,399
Three, two, one.

529
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,760
- Greetings, - Greetings,

530
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,239
- Lord - Lord

531
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,882
- Fan. - Fan.

532
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,840
You guys were unorganized as well. Why is it my fault?

533
00:31:22,321 --> 00:31:23,865
We had a good laugh the last time we met.

534
00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:25,169
Why are you guys so nervous now?

535
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,320
Last time, we had no idea that you were Lord Fan.

536
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,479
Yeah.

537
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,759
Even so, I'm still human.

538
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,282
Lord Fan, you're not human.

539
00:31:34,898 --> 00:31:36,522
You're a poetic genius.

540
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,039
Shi Chan Li!

541
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:40,166
What's wrong?

542
00:31:40,247 --> 00:31:41,647
You should've said that right away.

543
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,920
Do you guys need anything?

544
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:47,734
Lord Fan, you were the examiner of the Spring Imperial Examination.

545
00:31:47,842 --> 00:31:50,600
We should show you respect as your proteges.

546
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,836
You guys intend to offer your services to me?

547
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,507
Lord Fan, you swept away the malpractices of the exam

548
00:31:56,531 --> 00:31:57,691
with a thunderous might.

549
00:31:57,772 --> 00:31:59,719
Your courage deserves such respect.

550
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:01,495
The four of us are truly impressed by your courage.

551
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,959
My Lord, we're willing to serve you.

552
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,849
The four of you?

553
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,240
Cheng Jia Lin got injured when everyone was checking the result.

554
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,450
He told us to relay his respect to you, My Lord.

555
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,959
Out of the four of you, three of you passed the exam.

556
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:19,506
Although the final palace examination will determine the top three spots,

557
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,082
you guys are already considered officials now.

558
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,015
I cannot accept your bow while offering nothing in return.

559
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,682
I've prepared the principles

560
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:29,410
that you guys need to abide by as officials. Here you go.

561
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:32,962
Everything I intend to say

562
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:34,448
is inside the note.

563
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,122
Go now.

564
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,202
My Lord.

565
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:40,999
Teacher,

566
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,080
we shall take our leave.

567
00:32:42,183 --> 00:32:44,082
Teacher, we shall take our leave.

568
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,930
Shi Chan Li,

569
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,970
stay here.

570
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:04,002
(Fan Residence)

571
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,970
Be a good person?

572
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,682
Be a good official?

573
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,339
Lord Fan does live up to his name indeed.

574
00:33:28,363 --> 00:33:29,545
One can actually formulate such phrases?

575
00:33:29,569 --> 00:33:31,642
They're concise, yet filled with profound meaning.

576
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:32,922
Ji Chang, look.

577
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,642
The phrase "Be a good person"

578
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,376
is in front of the phrase "Be a good official."

579
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,160
Wan Li, from today onward,

580
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,922
we're Lord Fan's proteges.

581
00:33:40,382 --> 00:33:43,183
Let's encourage each other so that we won't let Lord Fan down.

582
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,529
My Lord,

583
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,922
I didn't pass the exam.

584
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,849
I know.

585
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,032
I've let you down.

586
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,241
You didn't let me down as long as you've tried your best.

587
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,690
My Lord, you're right.

588
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:34,398
So, My Lord, why did you

589
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,530
tell me to stay?

590
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,882
What do you plan to do next?

591
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:42,809
Next,

592
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,552
I plan to leave the capital in a few more days

593
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,090
and return to my hometown.

594
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:50,934
You cannot return to your hometown anymore.

595
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,960
Shijia Town was burned down.

596
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,682
This is the disaster record

597
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,120
written by the local magistrate.

598
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,409
Take a look.

599
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,162
This fire

600
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,362
might not be a natural disaster.

601
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:37,962
(Shijia Town)

602
00:35:48,207 --> 00:35:49,457
My Lord.

603
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,360
He Zong Wei seeks an audience with you.

604
00:36:08,628 --> 00:36:09,789
Take him away for now.

605
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,109
I'll see him later.

606
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,440
Yes, My Lord.

607
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,396
Lord Fan.

608
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:43,289
He Zong Wei.

609
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:44,809
We meet again.

610
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,530
Educated individuals

611
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,170
mustn't act like dogs

612
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,082
and shouldn't act like dogs.

613
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,562
Lord Fan, I learned a lot

614
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,482
from the previous lessons you taught me.

615
00:36:54,598 --> 00:36:55,848
Here,

616
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,362
I would like to thank you.

617
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,079
Why didn't you participate in the Spring Imperial Examination?

618
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:06,599
Initially, I was supposed to participate in it.

619
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,402
However, there are certain things in life

620
00:37:09,973 --> 00:37:12,133
that are more important than the imperial examination.

621
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:15,015
Scholars devote years to their studies just to get a promotion.

622
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:17,719
Is there something more important than that to you?

623
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,690
Of course.

624
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,642
This concerns one's life.

625
00:37:22,781 --> 00:37:24,421
An injustice that's hard to redress!

626
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:34,856
You guys should approach the magistrate to redress an injustice.

627
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,482
We were supposed to head there.

628
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:40,519
But we heard that you took over the investigation of the exam fraud cases.

629
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:41,849
This injustice

630
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,762
can only be redressed by you, Lord Fan.

631
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:46,811
Is it related to the Spring Imperial Examination?

632
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,562
Her husband

633
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:50,798
was a candidate who failed the previous Spring Imperial Examination.

634
00:37:50,822 --> 00:37:53,802
He was exceptionally talented, and he was supposed to pass the exam.

635
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,159
But in the end,

636
00:37:55,255 --> 00:37:57,362
someone else took his place and position.

637
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:59,522
And, he found out about it.

638
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,962
He couldn't take it lying down.

639
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,329
He thought of

640
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,953
redressing his injustice.

641
00:38:05,173 --> 00:38:06,173
Continue.

642
00:38:06,254 --> 00:38:07,854
The person who replaced him

643
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,122
was the protege of a high-ranking official.

644
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,040
No one expected the high-ranking official

645
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:14,638
to silence the candidate.

646
00:38:14,765 --> 00:38:17,285
Now, only his wife is alive.

647
00:38:17,487 --> 00:38:18,737
But she's still bent on

648
00:38:19,086 --> 00:38:20,762
seeking justice for her husband.

649
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:23,849
He Zong Wei,

650
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,559
is this incident related to you?

651
00:38:26,678 --> 00:38:28,682
I, He Zong Wei, still have a conscience.

652
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:30,962
I left the capital

653
00:38:31,174 --> 00:38:32,495
upon hearing about the incident.

654
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,809
It took me a lot of effort to find this widow and bring her here.

655
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:40,438
My Lord, you're the only person in the imperial court who's willing

656
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,642
to uphold justice for all scholars in the world.

657
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,722
I had no choice but to bring her here to see you.

658
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:48,095
So, you actually gave up on the Spring Imperial Examination

659
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,240
because of this incident?

660
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,842
This incident concerns one's life.

661
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,880
I shall spare no effort in solving it!

662
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,610
Do you know

663
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,362
the high-ranking official who harmed your husband?

664
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:04,162
I know him.

665
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,610
Tell me, then.

666
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,159
Committing fraud in the Spring Imperial Examination,

667
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,562
the person who harmed my husband

668
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:13,242
is the current chancellor,

669
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,160
Lin Ruo Fu.

670
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:21,925
My Lord, you serve the people wholeheartedly.

671
00:39:21,949 --> 00:39:23,256
Everyone in the world admires you.

672
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,936
When it comes to sacrificing one's family for the greater good,

673
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,042
Lord Fan Xian, you're the only person who can do it.

674
00:39:38,598 --> 00:39:40,562
I'm a lone subject indeed.

675
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,962
- Lord Yan. - Lord Yan.

676
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,650
Were you looking for me?

677
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,360
A scholar and a case victim

678
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,813
is accusing Chancellor Lin of silencing a scholar.

679
00:40:01,837 --> 00:40:03,959
I know that. Why did you call me here?

680
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:05,542
The victim isn't living in the capital.

681
00:40:05,566 --> 00:40:07,095
We require the assistance of the Fourth Bureau.

682
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,369
That's not enough.

683
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,231
You require the assistance of the Ministry of Justice,

684
00:40:10,255 --> 00:40:11,856
the Court of Judicial Review, and the Judicial Bureau.

685
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,095
I can't afford to let them take the witnesses.

686
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,320
Of course.

687
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
The Overwatch Council will lead the investigation.

688
00:40:16,553 --> 00:40:18,610
I don't even know where all these bureaus are located.

689
00:40:18,634 --> 00:40:20,760
What about this? You can help me greet

690
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:22,152
the other bureaus for now.

691
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,530
Have you ever considered this?

692
00:40:24,687 --> 00:40:26,208
What if this case was true?

693
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:27,849
What would you do by then?

694
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:32,679
Princess Yun Rui was kicked out of the capital because of you.

695
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,362
Now, it's Chancellor Lin's turn.

696
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:36,242
How will you face Princess Wan Er?

697
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,200
What do you want me to do, then?

698
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,200
Transfer this case to me.

699
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:44,615
I'll enforce the law impartially.

700
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,959
Are you afraid that I might be in a tough spot?

701
00:40:45,983 --> 00:40:47,743
I'm worried that you might abuse your power.

702
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:50,950
Thanks.

703
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,561
However, I have to be the one investigating the case.

704
00:40:53,847 --> 00:40:57,722
- Why? - His Majesty ordered me to investigate the fraud cases.

705
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,642
I have no escape.

706
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:02,042
Do you think His Majesty knew about this case

707
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,759
beforehand?

708
00:41:08,337 --> 00:41:09,587
Don't think of it like that.

709
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,449
That's too dangerous.

710
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:16,219
- Where are you going? - The chancellor's residence.

711
00:41:17,062 --> 00:41:18,502
You're heading there at this moment?

712
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,170
Please come inside.

713
00:41:27,212 --> 00:41:28,959
Here you go. Take care.

714
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:30,566
All right. I'll pack them up for you.

715
00:41:30,846 --> 00:41:33,522
(Tingyu Restaurant)

716
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:36,376
Mr. Yuan, you're here. Please come inside. We have a seat for you.

717
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,014
Let's have some tea. This tea is excellent.

718
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:39,397
Yes. It's fresh.

719
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,640
Accessories for sale!

720
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,520
Accessories for sale!

721
00:41:46,702 --> 00:41:48,743
Mr. Yuan, we reserved a great seat for you.

722
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:50,088
No need for that.

723
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:58,040
Waiter, get us two plates of beef.

724
00:41:58,159 --> 00:41:59,962
All right, sir. Coming up!

725
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:02,442
Delicious yogurt for sale!

726
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,027
- I'll sit here. - All right.

727
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,199
Get me a pot of tea and two plates of nuts.

728
00:42:07,582 --> 00:42:09,782
All right. Looks like it's going to rain.

729
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:16,439
Why are the windows over there closed?

730
00:42:17,376 --> 00:42:18,575
The river is right below.

731
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,231
We closed them due to the bugs.

732
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:23,849
Open them.

733
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:28,916
Fresh flowers for sale!

734
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:31,402
Fresh flowers for sale!

735
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,631
Do you plan to stand there all day long?

736
00:42:37,862 --> 00:42:39,555
Don't pull a long face.

737
00:42:40,254 --> 00:42:41,504
Young man,

738
00:42:41,911 --> 00:42:43,161
you can't afford to be down.

739
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:47,840
Someone reported you to me.

740
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:49,805
Was it about me silencing someone?

741
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,202
I've heard about it.

742
00:42:57,662 --> 00:42:58,912
Did you do it?
