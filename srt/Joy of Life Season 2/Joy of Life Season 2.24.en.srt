00:01:25,162 --> 00:01:30,913
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:30,994 --> 00:01:34,002
(Episode 24)

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,482
You make it sound like

4
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:38,905
I'm going to go against His Majesty.

5
00:01:40,783 --> 00:01:43,722
This is out of your control.

6
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,232
- Uncle... - Enough chit-chat.

7
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:53,935
You've said your goodbye outside the city,

8
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:56,159
doing it again is too much.

9
00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:07,642
Take good care of Wan Er.

10
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,519
I'll take responsibility for the palace guards' outing this time.

11
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:24,815
What does my palace guard drill have to do with you?

12
00:02:24,902 --> 00:02:26,152
Drill?

13
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:28,122
I recently realized

14
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:30,839
that the palace guards haven't had enough drills over the years.

15
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,855
How can they handle real battles if this goes on?

16
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,200
Today's trip out of the capital is a practice

17
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,210
of marching over long distances and breaking through obstacles.

18
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,442
- Thank you. - For what?

19
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,818
I'm just training my soldiers.

20
00:02:41,842 --> 00:02:43,161
It has nothing to do with you.

21
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,549
Cheng Ru, why are you with him?

22
00:03:07,573 --> 00:03:08,842
We just ran into each other.

23
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,522
Is something wrong?

24
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,889
Is it about my father...

25
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,199
We just had a small problem.

26
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,326
I wouldn't call the Black Cavalry charging a small problem.

27
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,842
Fortunately, his status as the chief inspector helped.

28
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:21,378
Everything is well now?

29
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:23,216
This is all thanks to His Highness's help.

30
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:25,739
No need to thank me. The Black Cavalry doesn't respect the palace guards.

31
00:03:25,763 --> 00:03:28,002
Only you could have resolved today's danger.

32
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,440
Thank you, Cheng Ru.

33
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,161
We're family. No need for that.

34
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,122
Even though there's no need for thanks between us,

35
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,282
this concerns my father's life.

36
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:42,722
Fan Xian,

37
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:44,602
I owe you a life.

38
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,519
Husband and wife are as one.

39
00:03:48,615 --> 00:03:50,855
Your life is my life.

40
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,160
We aren't married yet.

41
00:03:54,272 --> 00:03:56,498
Where do you think you're going to run off to?

42
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,120
His Majesty has summoned Prince Cheng Ru and Fan Xian to the palace.

43
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,319
So soon?

44
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,359
If Father is furious, just blame it on me

45
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,521
and say it was my idea to see Chancellor Lin off.

46
00:04:20,545 --> 00:04:23,001
- No way. - That's defying an imperial decree. You can't handle that.

47
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:24,905
His Majesty's decree was for Chancellor Lin to retire to the countryside.

48
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:26,610
I haven't heard of any other decree.

49
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,959
Take Da Bao home when he wakes up.

50
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,719
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

51
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,482
I'll come to the palace with you.

52
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,482
Then we're done for.

53
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:10,042
Allow me to guide you there, gentlemen.

54
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:11,709
Where is Father waiting for us?

55
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,170
In the Imperial Study.

56
00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:14,836
This way, please.

57
00:05:17,272 --> 00:05:18,297
If it's grave offence,

58
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:19,935
the Ministry of Justice will be waiting to apprehend you.

59
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,199
Since he's not meeting us in the hall, it's a good sign.

60
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:27,562
Eunuch Hong.

61
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,170
Can I have some of the food?

62
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,602
Halt.

63
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:37,232
You're quite relaxed.

64
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:38,795
If His Majesty wants to behead me,

65
00:05:38,884 --> 00:05:40,204
I can't die hungry.

66
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,922
Want some?

67
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,889
One of us full is enough.

68
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,880
Think about what to say later.

69
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,439
I'm not afraid.

70
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,200
I've already died once.

71
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:03,719
What's wrong?

72
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,935
He might have twisted his ankle. It's all right, you go ahead.

73
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,082
I'll help him fix it.

74
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,089
After His Majesty learned the news, he showed no emotion.

75
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,200
He ate two or three pieces of the pastries

76
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,080
sent by the imperial kitchen earlier.

77
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,920
His Majesty never touches pastries

78
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,800
when he's angry.

79
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,842
That's brave of you to tell me.

80
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,222
Aren't you afraid of being executed?

81
00:06:27,246 --> 00:06:29,367
I haven't forgotten your kindness to me.

82
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,920
Your Majesty, they're waiting for you.

83
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,040
Summon Prince Cheng Ru.

84
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,370
Yes, Your Majesty.

85
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,680
Your Highness, His Majesty has summoned you.

86
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:16,279
- Father. - I heard you've been close with Fan Xian recently.

87
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,250
Yes, it's true.

88
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,760
I want to know,

89
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,519
are you here to plead for him

90
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,159
or to excuse yourself?

91
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,479
I want to plead for both of us.

92
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,120
Why do you want to plead for him?

93
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,599
I find him agreeable.

94
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,153
Agreeable?

95
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,359
Come.

96
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,689
Sit.

97
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,089
Sit.

98
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,959
Why do you find him agreeable?

99
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,480
He values loyalty and righteousness.

100
00:08:04,575 --> 00:08:06,985
He values loyalty and righteousness, but what about others?

101
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:10,282
Many officials in the capital prioritize fame and profit,

102
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:11,785
few value loyalty.

103
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,133
Your Majesty,

104
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,159
Minister of Revenue Fan Jian requests an audience.

105
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,272
- Let him wait. - Yes, Your Majesty.

106
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,961
You said few officials value loyalty.

107
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,801
Do you know why?

108
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,810
No, I don't.

109
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,936
Li Cheng Ru,

110
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,599
you're an honest man.

111
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,680
It's better you don't understand.

112
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,720
I've spent years stationed at the border,

113
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,640
so my vision and knowledge are limited.

114
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,970
Limited is good,

115
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,000
it keeps you at peace.

116
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,570
You may go.

117
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,529
Yes, Father.

118
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,282
Bring in Fan Jian and his son.

119
00:09:10,373 --> 00:09:11,402
Yes, Your Majesty.

120
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,129
President, can I stop wiping now?

121
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,730
Keep wiping.

122
00:09:58,855 --> 00:10:01,682
We've been waiting for too long, President.

123
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,280
Your Majesty, I've come to apologize.

124
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,570
What wrong have you done?

125
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,280
Leaving the capital without permission and mobilizing the Black Cavalry.

126
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:19,655
Your Majesty,

127
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:21,486
this is the roster of Chancellor Lin's former retainers and acquaintances,

128
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:25,086
handed over to me before he left for his hometown.

129
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,959
I present it to Your Majesty.

130
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:38,098
Fan Jian,

131
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,490
why have you come here?

132
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,402
Well, I...

133
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,079
What do you have up your sleeve?

134
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,694
What do you need a ruler for?

135
00:10:56,775 --> 00:10:58,575
Fan Xian defied the imperial decree.

136
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,334
He left the capital and mobilized the Black Cavalry without permission.

137
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:02,918
I was so furious when I heard about it.

138
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,120
The Fan family has always served loyally.

139
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,160
How did we produce such a rebellious son?

140
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,959
How do you intend to punish him?

141
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,409
I intend to discipline him

142
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,240
with family punishment.

143
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,442
Granted.

144
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,920
Beat him.

145
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,610
You rebellious son!

146
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,162
You rebellious son, you're driving me mad!

147
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,162
I'm going to beat you to death today!

148
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,282
I'm going to beat you to death today!

149
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:32,679
You rebellious son!

150
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,010
Fan Jian.

151
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:35,855
If I don't beat you to death today,

152
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:38,105
how can I face His Majesty? You...

153
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,719
That's enough. You can drop the act.

154
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,250
President Chen.

155
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,762
(Fan Xian is safe and sound. The conversation is peaceful.)

156
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,650
All right, that's enough.

157
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:05,757
Fan Xian is fine.

158
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,322
Fan Xian is fine.

159
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,250
Really?

160
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:19,687
Why have you been looking so grim then?

161
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:21,882
You scared me.

162
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,682
A word of advice,

163
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,400
don't be presumptuous.

164
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,850
I'll keep it in mind.

165
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:40,178
I'll go back and wait for Lord Fan then.

166
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,169
Since you're here,

167
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,160
run an errand for me before you go.

168
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:45,497
What is it?

169
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,601
(The body of a Sixth Bureau's spy was found this morning)

170
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,640
Someone from the Sixth Bureau was killed?

171
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,129
Yes, I'll have to trouble you to go check it out for me.

172
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:56,553
It's no trouble,

173
00:12:56,848 --> 00:12:59,682
but given the distance from here to the capital,

174
00:13:00,015 --> 00:13:02,295
shouldn't our local colleagues handle this?

175
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,642
That's true,

176
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,202
but we're short-handed now, and you're experienced.

177
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:08,535
Just take a look for me.

178
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,999
Is there something special about this case?

179
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,440
I'm waiting for you to come back and tell me.

180
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:16,744
I'll go right away.

181
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,090
Leave from the south gate.

182
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:20,670
Someone will be waiting for you at Liujiapo.

183
00:13:20,694 --> 00:13:21,944
I'll be quick.

184
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,988
I don't care

185
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:37,509
about Chancellor Lin.

186
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,799
I summoned you

187
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:43,222
to tell you something.

188
00:13:44,212 --> 00:13:45,362
Fan Xian,

189
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,162
it's time for you to get married.

190
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,320
- Pardon me? - It's time for you, Fan Xian, to get married.

191
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,962
You mean my marriage with Wan Er?

192
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,366
Do you want to marry someone else?

193
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:58,847
No, Wan Er is fine.

194
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:00,871
Good.

195
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,520
You will marry in three days.

196
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:05,146
Three days?

197
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,839
Is that enough time?

198
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:09,959
Get the money from the Ministry of Rites.

199
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:13,957
We'll make up for it afterwards.

200
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:16,562
Your Majesty, this isn't in accordance with the rules.

201
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,890
Fan Jian, Fan Xian,

202
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,882
listen carefully.

203
00:14:19,963 --> 00:14:23,042
This marriage isn't just your family matter,

204
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,450
it's a kingdom affair.

205
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:28,482
It's a kingdom affair. Your Majesty is wise.

206
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,009
As you command, Your Majesty.

207
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,570
Rise.

208
00:14:42,118 --> 00:14:44,176
- How did it go? Are you all right? - I'm getting married!

209
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,517
- Lord Fan! - Do come to my wedding banquet.

210
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,752
- Getting married? - Lord Fan!

211
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,191
Lord Fan!

212
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,962
He's getting married!

213
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,400
I'll go announce the decree!

214
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,360
Is the decree announced?

215
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,690
Yes.

216
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,199
Would you like to stay for tea?

217
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,622
I need to get back to the palace.

218
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,082
A grand wedding in three days,

219
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,082
how can we prepare in time?

220
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,090
We can manage.

221
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,561
The Ministry of Rites will organize it,

222
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:16,105
and the palace will provide the funds.

223
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:18,799
I've said it before, with my brother's talents,

224
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,321
His Majesty will surely favor him.

225
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,762
And you just accepted the decree like that?

226
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,169
It'll be fine.

227
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,762
You should act with more decorum.

228
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,479
Why did you shout?

229
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:41,209
Father, Mother, Xian, Ruo Ruo,

230
00:15:41,814 --> 00:15:43,122
we're going to make a fortune!

231
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:44,735
This is a no-cost business.

232
00:15:44,832 --> 00:15:47,122
What no-cost business? Sounds like robbery to me.

233
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,610
Don't put it like that. Robbery?

234
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,920
This wedding is way more profitable than robbery.

235
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,855
What nonsense are you talking about?

236
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,880
Think about it.

237
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,320
With the palace covering the costs

238
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:58,866
and the Ministry of Rites handling the arrangements,

239
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,952
we won't spend a penny.

240
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:03,680
His Majesty's grace is a huge honor.

241
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,319
You do make a point.

242
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,425
Right?

243
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,799
When the time comes,

244
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:11,559
all the distinguished figures in the capital

245
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,520
will be scrambling to attend it.

246
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,690
You're saying the more people come, the more gifts we'll get?

247
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,320
He's probably thinking the opposite.

248
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,970
He wants fewer people.

249
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,800
That's why you're my brother.

250
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,442
But if fewer people come, won't we get fewer gifts?

251
00:16:26,523 --> 00:16:28,042
At this point,

252
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:30,048
who cares about the gifts? That's not important.

253
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,482
Gifts aren't important?

254
00:16:31,563 --> 00:16:33,655
- It's the exclusivity that matters. - What exclusivity?

255
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,040
The exclusivity of attending.

256
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,959
Who wouldn't want to attend the wedding?

257
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,135
When the time comes, we need to make it a grand event,

258
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,199
as grand as possible.

259
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,879
Even the Northern Qi will hear about it.

260
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:44,790
But the opportunity to enter the Fan Residence,

261
00:16:44,918 --> 00:16:46,239
to get a seat at the table,

262
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,362
should be as limited and selective as possible.

263
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:50,259
We will make the high officials in the capital

264
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:53,202
to feel embarrassed if they can't get in.

265
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,242
That's scarcity marketing.

266
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,400
And once they're here, we can't let them go hungry, right?

267
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,079
Everything must be top-notch.

268
00:17:02,873 --> 00:17:05,410
But deciding who to invite and who not to will offend people.

269
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,289
No one will be offended.

270
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,690
We'll sell the tickets openly.

271
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,011
Fair and just, highest bidder wins.

272
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,120
Just like the term Xian invented, "auction".

273
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,039
My sister-in-law is a princess, right?

274
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,642
When she gets married, her brothers will have to come, right?

275
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,519
The crown prince, the princes,

276
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,015
all the officials and nobles will have to come.

277
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,519
Imagine how high the price will go?

278
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,056
People will fight over it.

279
00:17:25,137 --> 00:17:27,120
I must lead this auction.

280
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,232
I'll control the pace.

281
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,730
You're supposed to be low-key since you snuck back.

282
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,775
Never mind then. At this point, it doesn't matter who leads the auction.

283
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,402
Ruo Ruo, you can do it.

284
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,722
When all these people come,

285
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,162
we're going to...

286
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,958
Xian, we'll have to count on you

287
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,759
to marry a few more times.

288
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,802
Once this business is established,

289
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:50,803
we'll become the richest family in Qing Kingdom.

290
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,600
I'll only marry Wan Er in this life.

291
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:53,983
No more wives.

292
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,730
Fine.

293
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,120
One is enough. I can still make this business work

294
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,579
with just one wife.

295
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,600
Are you saying you would repeat this when you get married?

296
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,277
No. Who would come to my wedding?

297
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:12,757
It has to be Fan Xian's wedding.

298
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:15,529
How about this?

299
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,279
We'll have to wrong my sister-in-law.

300
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,199
A couple of years later,

301
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:21,769
you can find an excuse to divorce her.

302
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,998
After the divorce, you can remarry her.

303
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,199
We can throw another wedding.

304
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:28,855
And we can get more money again.

305
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,840
Divorce, remarry, divorce, remarry...

306
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,210
We'll be rich!

307
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,690
Rich...

308
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:43,282
Sit down.

309
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,089
Hold this.

310
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,541
Look at this.

311
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,148
Have some water.

312
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:19,506
Have some water.

313
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:23,611
Please have some tea.

314
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,289
Have some water.

315
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,120
Send these over there.

316
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,482
All right.

317
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,362
I have some here.

318
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,930
Give it to me.

319
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:55,562
- Where is he going? - The restroom.

320
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,177
Why would he bring paper and brush to the restroom?

321
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:00,376
For the well-being of the palace, using the restroom is fine,

322
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,650
but one mustn't be idle.

323
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,370
We need the ginseng soup here!

324
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,569
Where can I find Her Highness?

325
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,089
I'm done here.

326
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,759
Help the fainted one down.

327
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,049
Give him a bun,

328
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,410
add some chili,

329
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,809
let him recover.

330
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:49,640
Bring a bun over here.

331
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:51,009
Quickly.

332
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,882
Eat up.

333
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,482
Your Highness.

334
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,170
You're here.

335
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:04,120
Mr. Yuan, have you been adjusting well in Xinyang?

336
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,041
Everything's fine.

337
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,240
It's just that the food is a little spicy.

338
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,082
Doesn't the Chancellor's Residence serve spicy food?

339
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,360
The food in the Chancellor's Residence caters to Chancellor Lin's taste.

340
00:21:15,806 --> 00:21:18,127
It has been tough for you to undercover

341
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,849
in the Chancellor's Residence.

342
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:23,682
At last, I've completed the mission you entrusted to me

343
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,882
and removed Lin Ruo Fu from his position.

344
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,160
Whether he's in that position or not doesn't concern me.

345
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,239
We're just following the lead

346
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,080
of the one who sets the stage.

347
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:46,239
We're merely playing along.

348
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:49,039
You should know that.

349
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,049
I know,

350
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,160
but I have to pretend I don't.

351
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:58,162
It's better to deceive oneself than others.

352
00:21:59,823 --> 00:22:02,369
- Clever. - You flatter me.

353
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:07,505
By the way, you can't eat spicy food, right?

354
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,202
Come.

355
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,569
Kill all the cooks in Mr. Yuan's residence and bring in a new batch.

356
00:22:21,231 --> 00:22:24,002
Your Highness, that's not necessary.

357
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,202
I've started to get used to it.

358
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:29,440
Maybe in a few more days, I'll enjoy spicy food as well.

359
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,640
Your only flaw is your kindness.

360
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,122
Really, I've gotten used to it.

361
00:22:36,203 --> 00:22:37,882
Kind people are often taken advantage of.

362
00:22:38,913 --> 00:22:40,472
I'm the best example.

363
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:45,479
How else would I have been driven from the capital to this place?

364
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,802
Do you think the flowers in my garden are still blooming brightly?

365
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,930
What are these people doing?

366
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,082
Wan Er is getting married,

367
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,609
and I need to prepare a gift.

368
00:22:59,904 --> 00:23:01,344
Gold and jewels

369
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,882
are too common and tacky.

370
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,160
Something beautiful is better.

371
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,760
It's just that cutting these flowers too much makes them look unsightly.

372
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,322
Next year, they'll be in full bloom again.

373
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,160
They've been damaged at the roots.

374
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,840
We'll need some fertilizer.

375
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,840
Your Highness, your kindness

376
00:23:23,888 --> 00:23:25,408
truly lives up to its reputation.

377
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:31,890
That's the way one should be in life.

378
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,130
Who are these people?

379
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:39,951
I've summoned the best accountants

380
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:41,402
from all the shops in Xinyang.

381
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:42,809
For auditing?

382
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,562
After the wedding,

383
00:23:45,448 --> 00:23:47,608
the Imperial Treasury will be handed over to Fan Xian.

384
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:50,519
I'm tidying up all the accounts for him.

385
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:53,232
Consider it a gift for him.

386
00:23:59,381 --> 00:24:01,701
If you have something to say, don't hold back.

387
00:24:01,782 --> 00:24:04,262
The Imperial Treasury's accounts are confidential.

388
00:24:04,873 --> 00:24:07,472
These accountants must be strictly cautioned

389
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,719
not to leak any information.

390
00:24:10,298 --> 00:24:12,457
Didn't we just talk about preparing fertilizer?

391
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,650
By next year,

392
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,130
this garden will be in full bloom again.

393
00:24:57,918 --> 00:24:59,002
Everyone...

394
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:01,882
Everyone...

395
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,082
What took you so long? I've been waiting for a while.

396
00:25:10,895 --> 00:25:13,722
Guys... What are they doing?

397
00:25:13,885 --> 00:25:15,135
We're setting up defenses.

398
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,280
The one who died inside was a skilled agent from the Sixth Bureau.

399
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,842
I'll lead the guard,

400
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,722
you go in and examine the body.

401
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:26,440
Shouldn't we get a coroner for this?

402
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:28,236
It's a top secret of our unit.

403
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,921
The less people know, the better.

404
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,839
But I don't have tools.

405
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:55,642
Come in with me.

406
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:11,373
If there's any sign of enemy presence, charge with full force.

407
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,562
If casualties exceed half,

408
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,242
divide the troops

409
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,639
and escort Wang Qi Nian back to the capital!

410
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,479
These are already the finest items.

411
00:26:40,695 --> 00:26:42,682
I still feel like they're not good enough.

412
00:26:43,086 --> 00:26:44,566
Your Highness, perhaps you're placing

413
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,479
too much importance on Fan Xian's wedding.

414
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:49,375
Your Highness, Miss Ye requests an audience.

415
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,529
Come in.

416
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,769
What brings you here

417
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,719
at this late hour?

418
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,400
Wan Er and Fan Xian are getting married.

419
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:08,959
So I heard.

420
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,479
Wan Er is like a sister to me.

421
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,479
It's not been easy for her and Fan Xian to be together.

422
00:27:13,721 --> 00:27:14,971
Don't mess things up for them.

423
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:19,959
Why would you think that?

424
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,199
You tell me.

425
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,199
I did set up Fan Xian before,

426
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,439
but it's different this time.

427
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,800
My own sister is getting married.

428
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,130
I don't want any trouble.

429
00:27:29,424 --> 00:27:30,650
Look,

430
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,962
I'm even picking out gifts for the wedding.

431
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,369
Come help me choose.

432
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,369
Will you swear on it?

433
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,360
- How about we make a deal? - What kind of deal?

434
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,720
You ask me a question,

435
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,565
and I swear to the heavens

436
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,080
that I would answer truthfully,

437
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,440
or I'll die a miserable death

438
00:27:57,746 --> 00:27:59,522
and without a proper burial.

439
00:28:00,358 --> 00:28:02,682
- But I have a condition. - What condition?

440
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,160
I get to ask you a question,

441
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,920
and you have to answer truthfully too.

442
00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:07,229
It's only fair.

443
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,682
- Fine, I don't lie anyway. - Swear it.

444
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:14,402
All right. I, too, swear to the heavens,

445
00:28:14,565 --> 00:28:18,809
I'll answer any question you ask me truthfully. If I don't...

446
00:28:22,456 --> 00:28:24,335
My family will be ruined.

447
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,842
Ask away.

448
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,160
Will you cause any trouble at Wan Er's wedding?

449
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,880
- No. - You've never thought about it?

450
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,082
Never.

451
00:28:34,942 --> 00:28:37,015
No matter what happens between me and Fan Xian,

452
00:28:37,144 --> 00:28:39,824
I've always considered Wan Er my sister.

453
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,880
Good.

454
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,270
Now it's your turn.

455
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,680
You just said

456
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:53,282
you're like sisters

457
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,239
with Wan Er.

458
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,922
Closer than real sisters.

459
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,840
Then you shouldn't hide anything from her.

460
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,295
How could I hide anything from her?

461
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:01,600
Here's my question.

462
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,936
On the day Lin Gong was killed, Fan Xian came to see you.

463
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,479
What did he say to you?

464
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,490
You've sworn on it.

465
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,599
Now you have to answer honestly.

466
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,600
How do you know that?

467
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,342
Fan Xian is quite famous in the capital.

468
00:29:16,366 --> 00:29:19,647
It's not hard to find out where he's been and who he's met.

469
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,120
What's the matter? Are you hiding some secret

470
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:31,895
from Wan Er about you and Fan Xian?

471
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:34,008
- No, it's not like that. - Then what is it?

472
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,880
Fan Xian came

473
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,560
to ask me something.

474
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,890
What did he ask?

475
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,247
You saw Lin Gong meeting with the two female assassins

476
00:29:45,271 --> 00:29:47,277
from the Niulan Street assassination.

477
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:53,479
So, you're the one who told Fan Xian about this.

478
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,529
You promised me

479
00:30:00,016 --> 00:30:01,416
you wouldn't ruin their wedding.

480
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,722
Of course. I'll keep my word.

481
00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:08,239
Don't worry, this wedding is going to be very fun.

482
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:14,489
President.

483
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,369
You're back.

484
00:30:32,091 --> 00:30:34,171
- You've worked hard. - It's the least I could do.

485
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:35,382
I can still handle it.

486
00:30:35,488 --> 00:30:36,968
Did you see the body?

487
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:38,369
Yes.

488
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,239
- How did he die? - He died from a stab wound with a sharp object.

489
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,560
Judging from the wounds,

490
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,279
the assailant was extremely fast,

491
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:49,800
with martial arts skills beyond an ordinary person.

492
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,479
But other than that, there's nothing particularly unusual.

493
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:56,840
From Jiangnan to the capital,

494
00:30:58,365 --> 00:31:00,206
they have traveled a long journey.

495
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,400
What does this have to do with Jiangnan?

496
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:04,745
A while back,

497
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,320
there was a serial killer in Jiangnan.

498
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,229
This person had extremely high martial arts skills

499
00:31:10,253 --> 00:31:11,853
and was difficult to trace.

500
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,840
Fei Jie personally went to Jiangnan for this case.

501
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:19,840
If Mr. Fei got involved, then he would surely be caught.

502
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,440
Fei Jie sent a message a few days ago saying he lost track of him.

503
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,999
Even Mr. Fei lost track of him?

504
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,369
Since that day,

505
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,250
from Jiangnan to the capital,

506
00:31:32,072 --> 00:31:34,416
our colleagues of the Overwatch Council along the official routes

507
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,200
have been dying tragically every few days.

508
00:31:37,282 --> 00:31:42,183
So this killer is heading from Jiangnan to the capital?

509
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,559
The deceased you saw

510
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:47,200
should be the last one.

511
00:31:47,568 --> 00:31:48,882
Judging by the distance...

512
00:31:48,963 --> 00:31:50,963
This person should have arrived in the capital.

513
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,618
But who could it be?

514
00:31:54,132 --> 00:31:55,973
He even made Mr. Fei return without success.

515
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,100
(The Overwatch Council Autopsy Report No. 125)

516
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,640
From the injuries,

517
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,959
it looks exactly the same as the body I saw today.

518
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,439
He was killed by the same person.

519
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,049
Turn to the page in front.

520
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,730
Turn it.

521
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,800
Take a look at the deceased's name.

522
00:32:30,372 --> 00:32:32,792
(Lin Gong, Male, 30-year-old)

523
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,130
President,

524
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,319
can I tell Lord Fan about this?

525
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,039
Why do you think I sent you there?

526
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,930
Understood.

527
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:59,049
I'll take my leave.

528
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,160
When Lin Gong was killed, we did consider Fan Xian as a suspect.

529
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,159
However, at the time, his defense was

530
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,696
that he didn't know Lin Gong's involvement in the assassination plot,

531
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,519
so he had no reason to kill him.

532
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,930
But the fact proves that he did know.

533
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,970
So he had a motive.

534
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,707
He's very likely involved in Lin Gong's death.

535
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,305
Your Highness,

536
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:28,039
did you accept the engagement and associate with Miss Ye

537
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,279
just to obtain this answer?

538
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,400
Don't think so badly of me.

539
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,319
Fan Xian's marriage to Princess Wan Er

540
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,559
is the condition for taking over the Imperial Treasury.

541
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,359
If this marriage doesn't work out,

542
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,519
the Imperial Treasury might return to its previous owner.

543
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,681
Your Highness, three days is enough time.

544
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:54,599
Just tell the princess about this information,

545
00:33:54,652 --> 00:33:57,173
and this marriage will never happen.

546
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,650
Xie Bi An,

547
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,479
I never thought you would have such evil thoughts.

548
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,137
You're saying there's a serial killer who's been murdering people

549
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:12,801
all the way from Jiangnan to the capital?

550
00:34:12,903 --> 00:34:14,162
Yes.

551
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,095
And judging from the injuries of the deceased,

552
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:18,279
it's similar to a previous autopsy result?

553
00:34:18,393 --> 00:34:19,432
That's correct.

554
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:23,289
So, who was the deceased in this said previous autopsy result?

555
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,130
Lin Gong.

556
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,970
- You're not mistaken? - I'm sure, My Lord.

557
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,640
The injuries on both bodies are very similar.

558
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,610
The killer struck swiftly in both murders,

559
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,849
beyond the capabilities of an ordinary person.

560
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,650
And of course,

561
00:34:53,823 --> 00:34:55,022
there's another possibility,

562
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,279
the weapon used by this serial killer is similar

563
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,360
to the one used by the killer who murdered Lin Gong years ago.

564
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,600
Their martial arts skills are also similar,

565
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:06,279
leading to the same outcome as we see now.

566
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,489
You just said

567
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,999
this killer has been making his way from Jiangnan to the capital?

568
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,631
Judging by the time,

569
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,799
he should already be in the capital now.

570
00:35:57,231 --> 00:35:58,592
(Since I can remember, )

571
00:35:58,983 --> 00:36:00,382
(you've always been by my side.)

572
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:03,809
(As long as you're around, I'm not afraid of anything.)

573
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:06,839
(To me, you're not just a guardian angel, )

574
00:36:07,676 --> 00:36:10,366
(but also the most important family I have in this world.)

575
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:12,368
(That's why I hope)

576
00:36:13,292 --> 00:36:15,012
(you can find something you want to do.)

577
00:36:15,093 --> 00:36:16,933
(Find something I want to do...)

578
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,250
(For myself?)

579
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:40,241
Who's there?

580
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,090
Mr. Wu Zhu,

581
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,080
where are you?

582
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,242
Xian, you're awake.

583
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:05,111
Aunt, Xian's awake.

584
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:08,400
Fan Xian, you're awake.

585
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,730
Did you sleep well?

586
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,409
You're here, Aunt.

587
00:38:14,665 --> 00:38:16,362
Ruo Ruo, please step out for a moment.

588
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,056
- Let me put on some clothes first, Aunt. - No need.

589
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,835
It's a perfect time to try on clothes.

590
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,015
- Do I have to try everything in these two boxes? - Not just them.

591
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,839
There are boxes of clothes all over the yard.

592
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:49,040
I'll try this color.

593
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,560
That one, and that one.

594
00:38:56,651 --> 00:38:58,202
Let me try that one again.

595
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:05,479
It seems you've found your ideal husband.

596
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:07,242
You can't stop smiling, Young Lady.

597
00:39:07,509 --> 00:39:08,759
It's not that.

598
00:39:08,871 --> 00:39:13,162
I was just thinking, Fan Xian must be trying on clothes too.

599
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,690
Of course.

600
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,482
Do you think he'll run away?

601
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:18,889
Run away from what?

602
00:39:19,062 --> 00:39:20,312
Run away from the wedding.

603
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,842
I think this one is good.

604
00:39:25,005 --> 00:39:26,460
What's the point if you don't try them on?

605
00:39:26,484 --> 00:39:27,883
You have to try each one on.

606
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:31,449
You all can try them on. I'll go out for a bit.

607
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:36,442
Don't even think about leaving.

608
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:38,842
It's too much trouble, I can't handle it.

609
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:41,200
Trouble? These are just the outer layer.

610
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,736
The three sets inside haven't even arrived yet.

611
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,959
I'd rather die.

612
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:45,522
You can die after the fitting.

613
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,462
Ruo Ruo, you've always been the most obedient

614
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:48,548
since you were little. Please let me go.

615
00:39:48,572 --> 00:39:50,122
I feel bad for you too, Xian.

616
00:39:50,212 --> 00:39:51,462
You're clearly smiling!

617
00:39:52,129 --> 00:39:53,250
Am I?

618
00:39:53,347 --> 00:39:55,467
I haven't eaten anything this morning. I feel uneasy.

619
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:57,402
You can have them while you're changing.

620
00:40:00,249 --> 00:40:01,499
I need to use the restroom.

621
00:40:14,242 --> 00:40:16,642
The wedding is in two days. Where do you think you're going?

622
00:40:16,697 --> 00:40:18,166
If you don't want to get married anymore,

623
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,710
go ahead and run around as you please.

624
00:40:23,816 --> 00:40:26,815
He'd rather die than try on clothes like this.

625
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:28,444
How do you know?

626
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,090
I know him.

627
00:40:34,513 --> 00:40:36,482
If he doesn't run away at a time like this,

628
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,962
it means he truly can't bear to part with me.

629
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,450
Not running anymore?

630
00:40:54,712 --> 00:40:55,962
Let's do this.

631
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:45,160
Young Lady, you still have many clothes to try on.

632
00:41:45,288 --> 00:41:47,128
However tired you may be, please endure.

633
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,002
If he doesn't run away, I won't either.

634
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,482
Wan Er.

635
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:54,802
- Wan Er. - Ling Er.

636
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,999
You're just in time.

637
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,231
I've tried on so many clothes, I can't decide.

638
00:41:59,312 --> 00:42:00,562
Help me choose.

639
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,320
I have something important to tell you.

640
00:42:05,216 --> 00:42:07,346
Everyone, take a break and leave us.

641
00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:09,479
You may leave.

642
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,690
You want to talk to me?

643
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,090
Li Cheng...

644
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,119
What's wrong? Have you caught a cold?

645
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:25,469
No.

646
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,160
Tao, go get the medicine for colds.

647
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:31,719
Where did you put it, Young Lady?

648
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:32,922
It's at...

649
00:42:33,278 --> 00:42:34,638
Never mind, I'll go get it myself.

650
00:42:34,698 --> 00:42:35,882
Just wait for me.

651
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:50,842
Who's there?
