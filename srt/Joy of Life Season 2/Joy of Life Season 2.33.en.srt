00:01:25,023 --> 00:01:30,986
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:34,001
(Episode 33)

3
00:01:34,756 --> 00:01:37,556
I remember she once told me,

4
00:01:37,637 --> 00:01:40,227
being an emperor is not an easy job.

5
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:44,510
It requires a strong heart and unwavering will.

6
00:01:44,622 --> 00:01:45,902
Therefore,

7
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:49,669
some things must be abandoned,

8
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,599
including

9
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,860
the most precious things.

10
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,639
I've kept you in Danzhou for many years.

11
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,710
You suffered plenty of hardships

12
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,470
and grievances.

13
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,949
Please don't blame me for that.

14
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,599
Your Majesty,

15
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,360
I...

16
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,039
I...

17
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,429
I don't really know who's my father now.

18
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:40,711
Isn't it obvious?

19
00:02:56,998 --> 00:02:59,268
Even a goddess like her

20
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,401
would fall for mortal beings.

21
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:04,322
She married into the Nanqing imperial family.

22
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,879
Who was she married to?

23
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,869
The prince back then.

24
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,319
He's also

25
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,249
the current Emperor of Nanqing.

26
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,762
She was married to the Emperor of Qing.

27
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,429
Your Majesty, do I have to kneel?

28
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,230
Do you wish to kneel?

29
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,960
You don't have to

30
00:03:30,464 --> 00:03:31,744
if you don't feel like it.

31
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,300
Ye Qing Mei had a child with him too.

32
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:38,602
Is he the son of the Emperor of Qing?

33
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,470
He's about the same age as you.

34
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,879
I...

35
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,599
Your son, I...

36
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,030
I still don't know my birth date.

37
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,000
On the 18th day of the first lunar month.

38
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,159
On the 18th day of the first lunar month, huh?

39
00:04:17,294 --> 00:04:18,603
As the saying goes...

40
00:04:18,982 --> 00:04:20,505
Take things as they are.

41
00:04:24,287 --> 00:04:25,689
Thank you, Your Majesty.

42
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,749
I finally have a birthday now.

43
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,270
Rest and recuperate well.

44
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,150
Head to Jiangnan once you've recovered.

45
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,520
Go and take a look

46
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,510
at the assets left behind by your mother for you.

47
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,202
It's a pleasure to know you.

48
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:24,935
I was also regretful

49
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,200
that I came too late.

50
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,559
We missed out on each other,

51
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,440
Mother.

52
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:50,154
Xian, I've checked our surroundings.

53
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:51,515
There's no one outside.

54
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:57,479
Xian,

55
00:05:58,564 --> 00:05:59,844
what's the matter with you?

56
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,749
Today, His Majesty

57
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,042
confessed for the first time

58
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:08,767
that I'm his son.

59
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,734
Blood is thicker than water after all.

60
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,030
All of the answers I gave him

61
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,629
sounded appropriate.

62
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,150
They were filled with adoration

63
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,710
and a touch of moving emotions.

64
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,359
Xian?

65
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,150
However, those weren't my heartfelt words.

66
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,679
Ruo Ruo,

67
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,309
I've been acting all this while.

68
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,520
Why?

69
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,669
It's because I'm afraid.

70
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,119
You're afraid?

71
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Are you afraid that His Majesty might deceive you?

72
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,280
Not entirely.

73
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,270
I could feel that his emotions were sincere.

74
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,350
But for some reason, behind those emotions, I think there's another him

75
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,350
behind that mask.

76
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,510
Why would you think of it like that?

77
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:17,187
If he truly cared about his son, which was I,

78
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:20,241
he could've told me that on our first encounter.

79
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,623
But he only stood there and observed me.

80
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,470
The dangers I met in the capital,

81
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,160
my trip to Northern Qi,

82
00:07:26,254 --> 00:07:27,414
the Spring Imperial Examination,

83
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:28,718
my wedding,

84
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,320
he observed me until today.

85
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,520
Maybe...

86
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,442
Maybe His Majesty was touched

87
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:39,313
when you saved him in Xuankong Temple.

88
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,722
So, his concern for me

89
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,549
has to depend on my performance?

90
00:07:45,102 --> 00:07:46,782
He'll determine if I'm a worthy son or not

91
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,480
by observing my performance first, huh?

92
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,239
Ruo Ruo,

93
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,734
although you haven't met His Majesty as many times as me,

94
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:56,038
let me ask you this.

95
00:07:56,215 --> 00:07:58,974
Would our father do this?

96
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,562
No.

97
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,544
Xian,

98
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,520
when you put it that way,

99
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:10,191
it sounded like His Majesty was weighing the pros and cons.

100
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:13,860
The terrifying thing is

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,749
that I didn't know

102
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,950
when he started observing me

103
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:21,107
and how long it would last.

104
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,559
I don't know if his concern for me is more important

105
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:26,204
than the value I provide to him.

106
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:28,084
And, I don't know

107
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,189
whether I'm his son

108
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,710
or his pawn.

109
00:08:41,182 --> 00:08:42,462
But of course,

110
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,149
I might be imagining things too.

111
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,839
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

112
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,470
A woman's instinct is always right.

113
00:08:51,223 --> 00:08:52,462
But I'm a man.

114
00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:53,959
My instinct is telling me

115
00:08:54,046 --> 00:08:55,435
that your instinct is right.

116
00:08:57,628 --> 00:09:00,499
Xian, if His Majesty is this terrifying,

117
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:03,375
we should return to Danzhou once you've fully recovered.

118
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,959
The capital

119
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:07,802
is too exhausting to reside in.

120
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:09,229
Ruo Ruo,

121
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,002
in the future, I'm afraid I cannot

122
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,029
return to Danzhou whenever I feel like it.

123
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:20,757
I've given it some serious thought.

124
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,360
I'll head to Jiangnan.

125
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,685
But it's not because of His Majesty's order or anything else.

126
00:09:27,646 --> 00:09:29,596
It's because I realize

127
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,869
that there are certain things only I can accomplish

128
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,029
besides idling my life away

129
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,070
and enjoy a peaceful life.

130
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:52,042
(Fan Residence)

131
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,839
Wan Er.

132
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,559
Wan Er.

133
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,842
Wan Er.

134
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,722
Are you Mr. Wu Zhu?

135
00:10:23,716 --> 00:10:26,516
Tell Fan Xian to head to Jiangnan and visit the Three Great Workshops.

136
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:28,762
Tell Fan Xian to head to Jiangnan.

137
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:30,166
Visit the Three Great Workshops.

138
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:32,231
Tell Fan Xian to head to Jiangnan.

139
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,679
Visit the Three Great Workshops.

140
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,960
Tell Fan Xian to head to Jiangnan.

141
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,480
Visit the Three Great Workshops.

142
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,101
Tell Fan Xian to head to Jiangnan.

143
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:40,656
Visit the Three Great Workshops.

144
00:10:56,887 --> 00:10:58,676
Yes. I am Wu Zhu.

145
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,843
- You're wounded. - That's right.

146
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,599
Based on the current conditions,

147
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,341
I cannot survive if I enter the palace.

148
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,639
Therefore, you have to relay the message to Fan Xian.

149
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:17,358
Who's targeting you?

150
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,199
Plenty of people.

151
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,120
The entire capital is unsafe.

152
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,350
Did you kill my elder brother?

153
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,599
Yes, I did.

154
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:26,861
I'm going to kill you.

155
00:11:26,942 --> 00:11:28,222
That is

156
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:30,230
understandable.

157
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:32,511
I'm seriously wounded. Based on the current conditions,

158
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,880
this is your best opportunity to kill me.

159
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,678
- I'll definitely kill you! - That is understandable.

160
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,976
Tell Fan Xian to head to Jiangnan.

161
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,216
Tell Fan Xian to head to Jiangnan.

162
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,797
Visit the Three Great Workshops.

163
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,255
Tell Fan Xian to head to Jiangnan and visit the Three Great Workshops.

164
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,202
I'm going to kill you, but not right now!

165
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:48,762
Visit the Three Great Workshops.

166
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,642
- Why? - Fan Xian will head to Jiangnan soon.

167
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:07,939
However, he has lost all of his powers.

168
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,242
My mother and Cheng Ze,

169
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:13,842
they'll never let this opportunity slip.

170
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,389
I shall spare you for now.

171
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:20,116
It's because he needs you.

172
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:24,722
You're trustworthy indeed.

173
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:27,482
Once the crisis is over,

174
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,280
you and I

175
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,749
will be sworn enemies.

176
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,600
Deal.

177
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,162
When Fan Xian no longer needs me,

178
00:12:36,414 --> 00:12:38,762
you may take my life.

179
00:12:57,842 --> 00:12:59,120
This is unexpected indeed.

180
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,880
In the blink of an eye,

181
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:02,526
we're already at the South.

182
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:04,160
Cheng Ru, you have no idea.

183
00:13:04,302 --> 00:13:06,216
It's been so many years since I left the palace.

184
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,950
We should've come out sooner.

185
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,480
You're right.

186
00:13:09,813 --> 00:13:11,364
Although I've returned to the capital,

187
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,782
my heart always yearns for the scenery outside the capital.

188
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:15,086
Based on what you guys said,

189
00:13:15,223 --> 00:13:17,828
leaving the capital sounds enticing.

190
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:20,395
You're still young. You'll know when you get older.

191
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:25,280
Why don't we have a toast under this magnificent scenery?

192
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,233
Come.

193
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:35,202
Come.

194
00:13:43,902 --> 00:13:45,562
Isn't this farewell party

195
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:47,356
too grand?

196
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:53,362
This is what we're supposed to do

197
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,162
when we're this close.

198
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,400
Your Highness, I'm truly touched

199
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,908
by your concern for him.

200
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,159
Fan Xian,

201
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,087
His Highness honors and respects the talented.

202
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:04,391
However, you mustn't forget

203
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:06,512
that there's still a difference between your ranks.

204
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,615
I'm overwhelmed by your concern, Your Highness.

205
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:12,269
Thank you, Crown Prince. Princes, thank you all for coming today.

206
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:15,605
What are you doing?

207
00:14:15,686 --> 00:14:17,880
Sir, I can't afford to accept your bow.

208
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,240
Don't cause trouble.

209
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,640
Since all of the princes are here,

210
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:28,132
I'll take this opportunity

211
00:14:29,558 --> 00:14:30,869
to confide in you guys.

212
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,383
Confide in us?

213
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,760
To be honest,

214
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,869
I'm

215
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,149
a terrible son.

216
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:49,101
I'm sure you all knew

217
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,799
that I grew up in Danzhou.

218
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,389
I only returned to the capital not long ago.

219
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,061
Although I've been living in the Fan Residence,

220
00:14:57,085 --> 00:14:58,996
there's something I always hid from the world.

221
00:14:59,223 --> 00:15:00,503
I couldn't get over it.

222
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,039
I feel troubled because of that.

223
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:05,311
What is it?

224
00:15:05,597 --> 00:15:06,877
Tell us about it.

225
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,160
I'll be your judge. What were you troubled by?

226
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:15,024
Although I've returned for some time, I've never entered

227
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,962
the Fan Ancestral Hall. Isn't that absurd?

228
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,080
How could I not be troubled by it?

229
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:24,054
Since we're bidding farewell, I've also grown bolder.

230
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,360
Father.

231
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,002
All the princes can be my testimonies since they're here.

232
00:15:28,422 --> 00:15:29,822
When I return from Jiangnan,

233
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:33,563
I have to pay respect to our ancestors in the ancestral hall.

234
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:36,199
Think carefully.

235
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,112
Once you enter the ancestral hall and their pedigree,

236
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:40,362
your surname will be Fan.

237
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,120
Look at what you're saying.

238
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:43,892
My surname was Fan from the start.

239
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,882
Complete your task first.

240
00:15:48,975 --> 00:15:51,615
We can talk about the rest when you're back.

241
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,023
Don't worry. I'll be your testimony.

242
00:16:01,847 --> 00:16:03,127
Thank you, Crown Prince.

243
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,658
You're something else. Turning your setback into an opportunity,

244
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:08,202
you're stopping your competitor while opening up new prospects.

245
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,482
Cheng Ze, what are you saying?

246
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,470
Those were my heartfelt words. He impresses me.

247
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,842
To you.

248
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:23,696
You've lost your internal energy.

249
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:25,735
You must be careful when you head southward.

250
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,015
Losing my internal energy is better

251
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,470
than losing my influence.

252
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:30,327
Stay safe.

253
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,442
I'll wait for your return.

254
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:44,493
Take down Jiangnan.

255
00:16:44,574 --> 00:16:45,882
You mean, take it back.

256
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,800
You do have great awareness, huh?

257
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,679
Look after Cheng Ping.

258
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:01,967
Isn't Prince Cheng Ping returning with you guys?

259
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:03,271
Father told him to follow you.

260
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:06,842
As a student, one should serve their teacher.

261
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:09,042
Father permitted me to travel with you.

262
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:10,687
Go now.

263
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,061
Send me a letter if you encounter any trouble.

264
00:17:14,085 --> 00:17:15,645
I'll head to Jiangnan if you need help.

265
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:18,014
You have to manage the Palace Guards.

266
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,547
At most, I'll just go all out.

267
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:21,322
I won't be executed for it anyway.

268
00:17:22,117 --> 00:17:23,374
Don't keep thinking of leaving the capital.

269
00:17:23,398 --> 00:17:25,348
They need people like you.

270
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,079
Take good care of His Majesty.

271
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,670
Yes, Lord Fan.

272
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:40,322
It's my duty after all.

273
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:55,501
It's windy here.

274
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:57,262
Father, you guys should head back as well.

275
00:17:57,446 --> 00:18:00,246
The Ming family of Jiangnan is in charge of the Three Great Workshops.

276
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:03,060
They have extensive connections. They're the local bigwig.

277
00:18:03,902 --> 00:18:06,221
It's best if you can complete your task in Jiangnan.

278
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:08,562
If you fail, return home immediately.

279
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,439
At most, you can leave everything behind.

280
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,589
The Fan family can sustain your living.

281
00:18:12,702 --> 00:18:15,122
Yes, Father. I'll see you off.

282
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:23,642
What's wrong, Father? Is there something else?

283
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,829
This isn't my first long trip, you know?

284
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,522
- You see... - Fine.

285
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,120
I'll speak on his behalf.

286
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,282
Regarding the ancestral hall, were you being serious or...

287
00:18:38,013 --> 00:18:40,522
Fan Jian, just look at you.

288
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,127
What? Why don't I kowtow to you right now?

289
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,602
Don't!

290
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,482
Lord Fan, I don't deserve that.

291
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,391
I'm used to your usual demeanor.

292
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:51,663
I can't get used to it when you're bowing to me.

293
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,549
Just do whatever you like.

294
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,722
Do whatever I like?

295
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,682
My surname was Fan since young.

296
00:19:13,223 --> 00:19:14,503
It'll be the same in the future.

297
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:19,842
I'll wait for your return.

298
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,559
Take good care of yourself.

299
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:43,162
One, two!

300
00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:45,242
One, two!

301
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,029
One, two!

302
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,362
One, two!

303
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,039
One!

304
00:20:04,472 --> 00:20:06,722
Lord Fan, we'll set sail soon.

305
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:09,234
- Got it. - Yes, Lord Fan.

306
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,079
I remember

307
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:20,842
everything you said.

308
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:24,362
The starry sky you gave me,

309
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,962
it's always been here.

310
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:06,920
Lord Fan!

311
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,292
My Lord, you've just recovered. Don't move around.

312
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:10,653
I'll go and take a look.

313
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:15,390
Lord Fan!

314
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,910
Lord Fan!

315
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,950
Lord Xu, prefect of the naval forces in Sha Prefecture, has a gift for you!

316
00:23:27,175 --> 00:23:29,925
Lord Fan, please accept it!

317
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,240
What are they doing here?

318
00:23:32,436 --> 00:23:33,812
It sounds like they're delivering gifts to us.

319
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:35,742
Lord Xu, prefect of the naval forces in Sha Prefecture...

320
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:37,046
Stay here.

321
00:23:37,286 --> 00:23:38,566
I'll ask Lord Fan about it.

322
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:41,670
Lord Fan, please accept it!

323
00:23:43,495 --> 00:23:47,962
Lord Xu, prefect of the naval forces in Sha Prefecture, has a gift for you!

324
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:50,579
Lord Fan, please accept it!

325
00:23:53,294 --> 00:23:54,574
Where did you come from?

326
00:23:54,821 --> 00:23:57,063
We serve Lord Xu, prefect of the naval forces in Sha Prefecture.

327
00:23:57,087 --> 00:23:59,157
This is a token of his appreciation.

328
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:01,642
My Lord, please accept them.

329
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,320
All right. Someone.

330
00:24:04,423 --> 00:24:06,682
Pull the box up.

331
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,522
Thank you, My Lord.

332
00:24:13,437 --> 00:24:14,922
Be careful.

333
00:24:17,381 --> 00:24:19,762
Prefect of the naval forces. Jot that down.

334
00:24:22,774 --> 00:24:24,054
Be careful.

335
00:24:24,193 --> 00:24:25,642
Slowly.

336
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,802
All right. Thank you.

337
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,362
Thank you, My Lord.

338
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,880
We wish Lord Fan a smooth trip.

339
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,400
I shall take my leave now.

340
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,760
Take care.

341
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:44,400
- Let's go. - Lord Yao, Prefect of Sha Prefecture,

342
00:24:44,518 --> 00:24:46,362
has a gift for you!

343
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,239
- Another one? - We wish Lord Fan a smooth trip

344
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,661
and a bright future!

345
00:24:50,742 --> 00:24:52,682
Okay. Pull it up.

346
00:24:52,841 --> 00:24:54,198
There's no end to them, huh?

347
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,360
Get a book

348
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,950
and jot everything down.

349
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,522
Okay.

350
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,670
Be careful.

351
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:06,602
Lord Yao, Prefect of Sha Prefecture.

352
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,559
Be careful.

353
00:25:13,885 --> 00:25:15,355
All right. Thank you.

354
00:25:15,651 --> 00:25:17,560
Take care.

355
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,727
I shall take my leave.

356
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,279
Take care.

357
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,020
Lord Li of the Ship Bureau has a gift for you!

358
00:25:24,176 --> 00:25:26,482
Lord Fan, this is a token of his appreciation!

359
00:25:26,713 --> 00:25:31,322
Lord Li, official of personnel of Sha Prefecture, has a gift for Lord Fan!

360
00:25:31,464 --> 00:25:33,263
There's truly no end to them.

361
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,482
Buddy, bring me a chair.

362
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,762
Where are you from?

363
00:25:51,255 --> 00:25:53,642
Your box is quite small, huh?

364
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,010
We've received this many gifts even though we're only at Sha Prefecture?

365
00:25:59,207 --> 00:26:00,487
Your Highness,

366
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,070
that means

367
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:06,421
the Qing Kingdom is a treasure trove.

368
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,350
Talented individuals reside within our kingdom.

369
00:26:08,374 --> 00:26:09,654
I see.

370
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,320
Qi Nian.

371
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,753
What's wrong? Are there any characters you don't know how to write?

372
00:26:14,777 --> 00:26:16,057
That's not it.

373
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,482
I don't think it's appropriate for us to accept all these gifts.

374
00:26:19,998 --> 00:26:22,216
Lord Fan is investigating and eradicating corruption in the capital.

375
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,989
But now, we're doing this?

376
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:26,482
- I'm afraid people might badmouth us. - It's fine.

377
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:28,100
There are no outsiders on the ship.

378
00:26:28,181 --> 00:26:29,461
Let's just keep mum about it.

379
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,160
Don't let the palace know about this.

380
00:26:31,975 --> 00:26:34,725
Your Highness, I don't think you're supposed to say that.

381
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:36,920
Chan Li,

382
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:39,141
you only served Lord Fan for a short time.

383
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,322
But you should remember this.

384
00:26:41,582 --> 00:26:44,612
Just follow Lord Fan's instructions.

385
00:26:45,302 --> 00:26:48,172
Lord Fan has never disappointed anyone before.

386
00:26:49,446 --> 00:26:50,532
Jot everything down.

387
00:26:50,613 --> 00:26:51,893
I will.

388
00:26:52,062 --> 00:26:53,342
Look over there!

389
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,870
Sir, come and take a look.

390
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,960
Are they here to deliver gifts as well?

391
00:27:10,215 --> 00:27:12,402
Judging from their attire, I don't think so.

392
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,042
They look like they're here

393
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,069
to seek our help for some injustices.

394
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,479
That's possible.

395
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:18,806
Lord Fan is considered an imperial envoy.

396
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,941
Even drama scripts contain such scenes.

397
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,390
My Lord, should we entertain them?

398
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,007
I've been thinking about this ever since our trip.

399
00:27:27,031 --> 00:27:29,762
What should I do if the Ming family doesn't want to let me

400
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,341
take over the Three Great Workshops?

401
00:27:31,365 --> 00:27:34,716
Are you saying that this is one of the Ming family's plots?

402
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,760
Let's take a look.

403
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,282
Don't be scared.

404
00:27:46,814 --> 00:27:48,882
All right, now. We'll arrive soon.

405
00:27:56,678 --> 00:27:58,718
(Ming Qing Da, Head of the Ming family in Jiangnan)

406
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,269
Don't move.

407
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,602
I heard that you two are here to relay Princess Yun Rui's order.

408
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,762
What does Her Highness require?

409
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,162
Are you the head of the Ming family,

410
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:34,039
Ming Qing Da?

411
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,002
That's me.

412
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,589
May I know your name?

413
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:40,972
What were you doing just now?

414
00:28:47,463 --> 00:28:48,962
It was pouring last night...

415
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:54,002
It was pouring last night.

416
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,559
The swallow

417
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:58,242
fell off the beam.

418
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:00,802
It's incapable of flight yet.

419
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:02,271
If I don't

420
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:04,242
send it back to its nest,

421
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,442
it'll die.

422
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,399
A swallow's nest, huh?

423
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,839
Please have a seat.

424
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,319
Please have a seat.

425
00:29:33,101 --> 00:29:34,461
My trip was rushed.

426
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:36,133
My butt is killing me.

427
00:29:36,302 --> 00:29:37,812
It hurts when I sit on hard surfaces.

428
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,799
Please have some tea.

429
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,680
You're overdoing it.

430
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:48,401
What do you mean?

431
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:54,670
The Ming family is rich, but you're keeping swallows with a torn sleeve.

432
00:29:54,935 --> 00:29:56,215
You're over-pretending here.

433
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,639
It's too much.

434
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,559
You see,

435
00:30:04,812 --> 00:30:06,710
firstly, I'm soft-hearted.

436
00:30:07,953 --> 00:30:09,240
Secondly,

437
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,082
I don't care about wealth.

438
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:13,471
As the saying goes,

439
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,959
a house full of wealth

440
00:30:15,086 --> 00:30:16,762
is inferior to the peace one will have

441
00:30:16,937 --> 00:30:18,217
by sipping on cheap tea.

442
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,710
Look at how pretentious you are.

443
00:30:21,177 --> 00:30:22,574
You don't look concerned about worldly desires.

444
00:30:22,598 --> 00:30:24,238
That's better than anyone in the capital.

445
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,920
I haven't asked you this yet.

446
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,710
Sir.

447
00:30:33,162 --> 00:30:35,202
- How should I address you? - Li Cheng Ze.

448
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,760
Second Prince?

449
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,749
Stop kneeling. Get up.

450
00:30:50,408 --> 00:30:51,628
I came to Jiangnan by saying that I was sick.

451
00:30:51,652 --> 00:30:53,012
The capital doesn't know about it.

452
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,150
Let's not waste any time. I'll cut to the chase.

453
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,119
Your Highness, please go ahead.

454
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,642
Fan Xian is heading southward.

455
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,639
How does the Ming family plan to deal with him?

456
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,922
- I know not. - Come again?

457
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:15,614
"I know not?"

458
00:31:15,735 --> 00:31:17,015
That was interesting.

459
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,430
Aren't you the head of the Ming family?

460
00:31:19,663 --> 00:31:20,943
This is a huge deal.

461
00:31:24,812 --> 00:31:26,339
I have to wait for my mother's decision.

462
00:31:26,363 --> 00:31:27,643
Let's chat together, then.

463
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,255
You've been eavesdropping on us for some time.

464
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:31,559
Show yourself.

465
00:31:55,148 --> 00:31:56,242
Mother.

466
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,642
I'm just a woman.

467
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,161
Your Highness, I wasn't supposed to show myself in public

468
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:19,470
if you didn't summon me.

469
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,670
You're the head of the Ming family.

470
00:32:26,837 --> 00:32:30,387
You should make the call here.

471
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,562
Mother, without your guidance,

472
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,501
I feel anxious.

473
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,360
Silly child,

474
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,922
do you know how old you are?

475
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,957
How long do you need me to take care of you?

476
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,520
Mother, you'll live until 100 years old.

477
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,160
You'll live longer than me.

478
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,480
Just look at you.

479
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:55,559
I'll patch it up for you.

480
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,390
So, he inherited his non-indulgence from you.

481
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:12,910
Your Highness, you asked us how we would deal with Fan Xian.

482
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,029
Actually, it's simple.

483
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:19,029
The Ming family has served Princess Yun Rui

484
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,269
and you for many years.

485
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,110
Your Highness, we'll follow

486
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,950
your instructions.

487
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,040
I hope that you guys will retain control over the Three Great Workshops.

488
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,000
All right.

489
00:33:35,231 --> 00:33:37,021
Do we have a deal already?

490
00:33:37,214 --> 00:33:38,524
Your Highness, we shall follow

491
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:40,381
your instructions.

492
00:33:47,878 --> 00:33:49,189
However,

493
00:33:50,326 --> 00:33:51,877
we're facing a difficulty.

494
00:33:53,805 --> 00:33:55,085
Tell me about it.

495
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,789
Lord Fan

496
00:33:57,271 --> 00:33:58,842
took over the Imperial Treasury

497
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:00,859
under His Majesty's order.

498
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,172
The Ming family is just an ordinary family.

499
00:34:04,304 --> 00:34:05,962
How can we go against imperial order?

500
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,829
Your Highness, this is truly difficult.

501
00:34:11,254 --> 00:34:12,802
Even I think that's difficult.

502
00:34:13,528 --> 00:34:15,614
No matter how valuable the Three Great Workshops are,

503
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:18,348
there's no need to risk one's life for them.

504
00:34:18,495 --> 00:34:22,484
Moreover, if worse comes to worst, you can join Fan Xian.

505
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:25,141
You'll still be a lackey no matter where you go, am I right?

506
00:34:34,582 --> 00:34:35,842
Was...

507
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:38,482
Was I too rude?

508
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,519
Your Highness,

509
00:34:42,742 --> 00:34:45,653
the Ming family never intends to change sides.

510
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:48,871
Your Highness, we just hope that you can point us in the right direction.

511
00:34:48,895 --> 00:34:50,951
There's no right direction when you're going against imperial order.

512
00:34:50,975 --> 00:34:53,134
I would've gone there first if there was any right direction.

513
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:54,718
- Your Highness. - I'll explain the situation.

514
00:34:54,742 --> 00:34:57,320
Guys, there's no right direction for you.

515
00:34:57,439 --> 00:35:00,838
But luckily, I cut off your escape route for you.

516
00:35:02,965 --> 00:35:05,124
Deng Ming Er, he has three sons.

517
00:35:05,213 --> 00:35:06,493
Take your reward.

518
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,082
The Ming family has issued a bounty.

519
00:35:09,163 --> 00:35:11,202
We're gathering people from all walks of life.

520
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,079
Those who register their names will receive a reward.

521
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:15,722
He has two sons.

522
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:18,362
The Ming family has issued a bounty.

523
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:20,762
We're gathering people from all walks of life.

524
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:24,122
Those who register their names will receive a reward.

525
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,710
Take your reward.

526
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,670
Mr. Zhang, he has one daughter and one grandson.

527
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,040
Take your reward.

528
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:40,359
- Zhang Zi Zhi. - Father!

529
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:43,429
I'll take good care of the family. Don't worry.

530
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:48,839
Wang Fu Ren.

531
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:50,990
He has one daughter and one son.

532
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:52,722
They're still young.

533
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,482
Take your reward.

534
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,642
Lord Fan, please accept our gifts.

535
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,322
I shall take my leave.

536
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,202
Misters,

537
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,042
what are you guys doing?

538
00:36:22,689 --> 00:36:24,488
Sorry. Excuse me.

539
00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:25,730
What are you guys doing?

540
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:27,162
Can't you tell?

541
00:36:27,545 --> 00:36:28,962
We're raiding your ship.

542
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:30,242
Oh, you're raiding our ship.

543
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:31,671
Wait, what?

544
00:36:32,808 --> 00:36:34,768
You have to come up here to raid our ship.

545
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,160
We can't.

546
00:36:36,854 --> 00:36:38,134
Your ship is too tall.

547
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,991
Guys, give them a ladder.

548
00:36:44,108 --> 00:36:45,988
That's right. Give us a ladder.

549
00:36:46,085 --> 00:36:47,556
Give us a ladder.

550
00:36:55,173 --> 00:36:56,294
Hold tight.

551
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:57,655
Hold the ladder.

552
00:36:57,817 --> 00:36:59,242
Be careful.

553
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:01,884
The Ming family issued a bounty?

554
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,079
We're demanding Fan Xian's head?

555
00:37:04,198 --> 00:37:05,361
I heard

556
00:37:05,565 --> 00:37:07,955
that the Ming family dominates Jiangnan.

557
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,922
When the bounty was issued,

558
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,990
people were flocking to register their names.

559
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,390
If only I could witness

560
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,202
the scene myself.

561
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:18,319
The Ming family has never issued any bounties.

562
00:37:18,343 --> 00:37:19,802
I issued it on your behalf.

563
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,240
From now on,

564
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:25,764
the Ming family will only be enemies with Fan Xian.

565
00:37:25,935 --> 00:37:28,255
That's what you mean by cutting off our escape route, huh?

566
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:35,630
What time is it?

567
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,320
It has already passed the hour of Wu.

568
00:37:43,503 --> 00:37:46,573
I was wondering why I felt giddy.

569
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:49,282
Your Highness, please forgive me.

570
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:51,522
I'm old and lacking in energy.

571
00:37:51,991 --> 00:37:53,661
I have to take a nap

572
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,230
at this hour.

573
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,082
Go and rest, then.

574
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,522
Actually, there's one more solution.

575
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,840
Hire experts and kill me right here.

576
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,669
After that, deliver my head to Fan Xian.

577
00:38:26,757 --> 00:38:28,787
That will resolve your issue.

578
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:40,724
That was a joke.

579
00:38:41,102 --> 00:38:42,382
Don't take it seriously.

580
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:44,959
Go and rest now.

581
00:38:55,983 --> 00:38:58,653
A kind mother and her filial son.

582
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:00,868
This scene

583
00:39:02,205 --> 00:39:04,202
is so touching that I'm going to cry.

584
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,315
Take a break.

585
00:39:07,396 --> 00:39:10,385
The Ming family issued a bounty?

586
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,762
That's right.

587
00:39:11,843 --> 00:39:16,482
They'll reward us if we damage or raid your ship.

588
00:39:16,633 --> 00:39:19,584
But doesn't that make you guys pirates?

589
00:39:19,801 --> 00:39:21,522
We aren't pirates.

590
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:23,682
Pirates won't do this.

591
00:39:24,464 --> 00:39:26,423
It's a government ship after all.

592
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:29,962
They value their lives more than money.

593
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,400
Wait, you guys...

594
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,991
You guys know that this is a government ship as well.

595
00:39:33,015 --> 00:39:34,605
Don't you guys value your lives, then?

596
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,190
We have no choice.

597
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,760
But why?

598
00:39:39,285 --> 00:39:41,196
Natural disasters occurred in Jiangbei.

599
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,389
We're refugees who escaped to Jiangnan

600
00:39:43,503 --> 00:39:47,173
with our family.

601
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,682
We would've starved to death

602
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:52,070
if it weren't for the Ming family.

603
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:55,749
So, you guys are refugees from Jiangbei?

604
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,200
That's right.

605
00:39:57,281 --> 00:39:59,838
We've already transferred money to aid in relieving the disaster.

606
00:39:59,862 --> 00:40:02,381
- You guys can go home now. - My Lord,

607
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:04,522
we wish to go home as well.

608
00:40:04,906 --> 00:40:06,882
We're just afraid that we might starve to death

609
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:08,676
on our way back.

610
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:12,309
So, the Ming family aided you guys?

611
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,359
That's right.

612
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,070
I guess the Ming family was doing good deeds.

613
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:21,550
They were.

614
00:40:21,631 --> 00:40:25,202
Anyway, all of the refugees are working for the Ming family.

615
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,439
We clear the land and build roads.

616
00:40:27,562 --> 00:40:29,095
We do the jobs that no one wants to do.

617
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,429
We work all day and all night.

618
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,080
There's no wage.

619
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,349
They only provide us with food.

620
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:39,280
What did the government do?

621
00:40:39,391 --> 00:40:42,661
They gifted the Ming family a huge plaque.

622
00:40:42,848 --> 00:40:44,128
What was on it again?

623
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,122
"Virtues Through Good Deeds."

624
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,479
Leader Xia,

625
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:04,774
all of the refugees are already on the ship.

626
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:06,708
Shouldn't we try to go for it as well?

627
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,760
If we go now,

628
00:41:09,863 --> 00:41:12,372
the refugees will die.

629
00:41:16,584 --> 00:41:17,736
They're already damaging the ship.

630
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,349
I'm sure they'll be dead.

631
00:41:20,462 --> 00:41:21,507
Let's wait and see.

632
00:41:21,588 --> 00:41:23,308
We'll see how Fan Xian will deal with this.

633
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:24,840
Guys, don't be impatient.

634
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,159
Once he arrives in Jiangnan,

635
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:27,949
we'll have all the time we need.

636
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,479
Li Cheng Ze

637
00:41:34,598 --> 00:41:36,642
is forcing us into a dead end.

638
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,044
Is that all you have to say?

639
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,200
I'm sure someone in our family

640
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,602
is siding with Li Cheng Ze in secret.

641
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,120
If not,

642
00:41:47,295 --> 00:41:49,082
the bounty could never be issued.

643
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,640
Who's the head of the family here?

644
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,560
Me.

645
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,677
Since there are disruptions within the clan,

646
00:41:56,701 --> 00:41:58,701
the head of the family has to be held accountable.

647
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,879
I deserve to be punished.
