00:01:25,105 --> 00:01:30,946
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,027 --> 00:01:34,002
(Episode 31)

3
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,910
What did Chen Ping Ping tell you?

4
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,522
Your Majesty,

5
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,439
he told me

6
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,362
the identity of the three assassins.

7
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,879
What else?

8
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,882
He also told me

9
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,322
that you might be the one who set the fire.

10
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,790
That old fart.

11
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,920
What else did he say?

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,280
Your Majesty, he even said

13
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,510
that you did so in order to chase away the Ye family.

14
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,280
It has nothing to do with the Ye family.

15
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:09,639
- But it's related to one of their family members. - Ye Liu Yun?

16
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,079
Ye Liu Yun is in Jiangnan.

17
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,656
I heard that he traveled around the world.

18
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,760
I issued 12 secret edicts for him to return to the capital.

19
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,200
But he actually ignored all of it.

20
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,079
- He resisted your order? - That's right.

21
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,439
Do you know why?

22
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,630
It's because he's a grandmaster.

23
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,639
Ordinary folks can't go against them.

24
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,051
Si Gu Jian alone

25
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:34,107
has defended Dongyi City for decades.

26
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,357
No one could approach him even with a million soldiers at their disposal.

27
00:02:36,381 --> 00:02:37,661
Do you know why?

28
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,310
It's because they are grandmasters.

29
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:48,470
These people disregard the law

30
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,030
and take rules lightly.

31
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,269
Do you think they're still humans?

32
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,230
Are they tactical weapons, then?

33
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,280
Wrong.

34
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,590
Weapons don't have any emotions.

35
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,582
Maybe their humanity is the only thing holding them back.

36
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,669
These so-called "grandmasters"

37
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,470
are actually scourges of the world.

38
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,519
If so, why did you chase the Ye family away?

39
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:32,389
I want to see if Ye Liu Yun still cares about his kinship.

40
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,959
What if he goes berserk? How will you clean up the mess?

41
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,310
Some of his family members are still in the capital.

42
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,202
You mean Ye Ling Er?

43
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:06,222
I'll head to Dingzhou together with you.

44
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,004
Ling Er,

45
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,350
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,962
I'm not making you stay

47
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,590
to protect you.

48
00:04:16,302 --> 00:04:18,053
Do you know why I'm heading to Dingzhou?

49
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,319
You failed to protect His Majesty.

50
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,400
I'm punished for that.

51
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,162
Therefore, one of our family members

52
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:31,076
has to remain in the capital.

53
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,669
You're the hostage I've chosen.

54
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,000
As long as you're around,

55
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,516
His Majesty can be at ease.

56
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,243
Ling Er,

57
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,960
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,039
I could only

59
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,119
choose one of us.

60
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,000
From now on,

61
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,470
do not try to be chivalrous again.

62
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,960
Remember,

63
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,719
in the capital,

64
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,079
it's best for fatherless children

65
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,790
to do nothing.

66
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,440
I understand.

67
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:31,350
How do you feel about Prince Cheng Ze lately?

68
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,640
Why are you asking me that?

69
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,082
You may get married to him,

70
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,749
but do not fall for him.

71
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,799
Why?

72
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,960
If you fall for him,

73
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,150
there'll be no way out.

74
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,400
I understand now.

75
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,910
I'm the out for the Ye family.

76
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,390
I would rather you had no idea.

77
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,559
But there's no choice.

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,280
We don't always

79
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,629
get what we wish for.

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,280
Don't hate anyone for this.

81
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,479
Live well,

82
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,520
my daughter.

83
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,669
As long as one of them is around,

84
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,830
there'll be room for maneuver, don't you think?

85
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,030
Ye Ling Er is remaining in the capital

86
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,560
because of her engagement with Prince Cheng Ze.

87
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,319
So, you expected this day to arrive after you granted them the marriage?

88
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,839
Why are you telling me all of this?

89
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,230
We were surrounded by assassins in Xuankong Temple.

90
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,150
Why did you leave me and save Cheng Ping instead?

91
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,880
Why?

92
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,800
Back then, if I didn't block the blow for Prince Cheng Ping,

93
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,715
he would've been dead.

94
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:51,830
So, to you, his life is more important than mine?

95
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:00,119
They were attacking from both sides. I could only block one of them.

96
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,799
Back then, that attack looked more dangerous to me.

97
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,320
I saved Prince Cheng Ping

98
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,442
as I was going with the flow.

99
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,830
You could've used Cheng Ping as your shield.

100
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,230
You wouldn't have been hurt by then.

101
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,960
It was sudden. I didn't think too far ahead.

102
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,120
I was only bent on blocking the blow and saving him.

103
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,270
Rest well.

104
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,830
Once you get better,

105
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,400
I'll take you

106
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,509
to the place

107
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,950
you wish to go.

108
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,789
When I was in Xinyang, I was wondering

109
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,239
why His Majesty granted you a marriage all of a sudden.

110
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,070
It turns out that he was using you as a bridge

111
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,840
between the imperial family and the Ye family.

112
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,869
Judging from its function,

113
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,840
this should be considered a political marriage.

114
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,230
Why don't I give you some additional dowries?

115
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,400
Aunt Yun Rui,

116
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,350
we're on the same side here.

117
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,310
You were utterly defeated.

118
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,830
Why should I side with a useless fool like you?

119
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,640
But you're still living in my residence, you know?

120
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,959
You can kill me and vent your frustration, then.

121
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,509
We can't afford to act crazily for real.

122
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,799
Think about yourself.

123
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,029
The engagement is a pact.

124
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,230
If the Ye family gets demoted, you'll be implicated as well.

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,830
As long as they don't return to the capital,

126
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,749
you'll stand no chance

127
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,710
to fight for the throne.

128
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,479
But there's one more solution.

129
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,839
Is there even a solution?

130
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,760
Yeah.

131
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,710
Just kill Ye Ling Er.

132
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,509
Sever your ties with the Ye family.

133
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,839
Bi An.

134
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,959
Head to the Ye family

135
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,519
and relay this message to Ye Ling Er.

136
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,296
Since the engagement is set, we shall share both wealth and woe.

137
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,509
One day, I'll make sure the Ye family returns to the capital.

138
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,559
Aunt Yun Rui,

139
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:27,935
I believe that offering help

140
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:30,535
in times of need is better than adding to someone’s prosperity.

141
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,039
Moreover, the Ye family

142
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,159
needs someone to depend on right now.

143
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,760
Isn't it better for you to kill Ye Ling Er?

144
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,989
If not, you'll be done for as well when the Ye family falls.

145
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,520
Ye Liu Yun is still around.

146
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,029
The Ye family won't fall.

147
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,439
Fine, then.

148
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,640
This is boring.

149
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,310
Aunt Yun Rui, I have a question.

150
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:54,670
Were you truly intending to help me out just now?

151
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,389
I just want to see blood being spilled.

152
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,216
Aunt Yun Rui, I'm afraid I have to let you down.

153
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,070
I'll depart for Xinyang right now.

154
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,479
This sudden?

155
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,839
There's no show to enjoy here.

156
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,240
Why should I stay here?

157
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,360
Master.

158
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,989
- Master. - Master.

159
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,880
- Master. - Master.

160
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,679
- Master. - Master.

161
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,120
Master.

162
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,319
A father's love is like a mountain.

163
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,670
You love your children the most.

164
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,282
Dear, you're awake.

165
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,682
Yes.

166
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,640
I have to head to the Ministry of Revenue.

167
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,070
I need to use the money Fan Xian gathered to relieve the disaster victims.

168
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,199
All of you may leave.

169
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,719
Dear, you didn't visit Fan Xian in the palace

170
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,079
or allow me to visit him.

171
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,600
Seems like you made the right choice.

172
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,789
Of course.

173
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,550
We have to think carefully when he's in the palace.

174
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,789
It was inappropriate indeed.

175
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,749
I'm glad that you figured it out.

176
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,240
What's wrong?

177
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,989
Is my hair messy?

178
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,389
You should change the color of your hair ornament.

179
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,920
What are you talking about?

180
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,509
Why are you all of you acting strange after I took a nap?

181
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,160
What's going on?

182
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,640
We've already heard about it.

183
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,000
About what?

184
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:36,959
Enough already.

185
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,839
Dear,

186
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:43,042
Fan Xian's biological mother,

187
00:12:43,582 --> 00:12:45,213
was she Ye Qing Mei?

188
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,042
How did you find out?

189
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:50,359
- That means it's true, then. - This is a huge deal.

190
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,789
Do not spread the news.

191
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,710
But everyone on the streets is talking about it.

192
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,830
How could that happen?

193
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,760
There's more than that.

194
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,640
What else is there?

195
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,350
Is Fan Xian

196
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,869
His Majesty's son?

197
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,629
Did they talk about that too?

198
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,190
Dear, this isn't your fault.

199
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,269
His Majesty was ridiculous.

200
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,440
Relay my message to the residence.

201
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,149
If they hear rumors as such again,

202
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,670
treat them as mere rumors.

203
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,439
Of course.

204
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,682
If it doesn't work out,

205
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,599
I'll be a witness.

206
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,495
At most, I can say that I gave birth to Fan Xian.

207
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,482
You...

208
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:43,832
What nonsense are you talking about?

209
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,442
Dear, your hair ornament,

210
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,002
you should change it to another color.

211
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,950
Aunt Yun Rui, are you truly intending to return to Xinyang?

212
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,269
Where else can I go?

213
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,959
Seems like

214
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,590
you're moving everything.

215
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,280
What? You can't bear to part with them?

216
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,720
That's not it.

217
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,679
Aunt Yun Rui,

218
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,310
the name list and ledgers were co-owned by us.

219
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,269
If any of their content is leaked,

220
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,839
being convicted of colluding with an enemy nation is a minor offense.

221
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,039
Do you think I'll land myself in trouble?

222
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,679
Of course not.

223
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,416
However, safety should be our priority.

224
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,255
It's because the capital is a dangerous place.

225
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,520
That's why I'm going to look after them for you.

226
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,880
It has already come to this.

227
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,560
Aunt Yun Rui, do you still not trust me?

228
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,160
I would've moved them away in secret

229
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,710
if I didn't trust you.

230
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,173
Wait.

231
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,909
Let me keep these two books.

232
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,216
Your Highness, I have something to report.

233
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,576
Take care, Aunt Yun Rui. Please come again.

234
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,029
I'm busy. I won't see you off.

235
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,400
Wait.

236
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,480
Give me the books.

237
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,279
At least I have something to read on my way there.

238
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,959
- Speak. - Your Highness, something's off.

239
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:28,096
- Rumors have been spreading in the capital. - What rumors?

240
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,216
Everyone on the streets is saying

241
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,200
that Fan Xian's biological mother is Ye Qing Mei.

242
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,520
Ye Qing Mei?

243
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,190
Fan Jian and Ye Qing Mei?

244
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,255
It's no wonder Fan Xian will inherit the Imperial Treasury.

245
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,520
His father isn't Fan Jian.

246
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,240
They said Fan Xian was His Majesty's son.

247
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,816
How dare you believe in such baseless rumors?

248
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,176
The rumors are spreading across the streets.

249
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,957
The Overwatch Council didn't explain the situation or stop them.

250
00:15:44,981 --> 00:15:46,797
They would've arrested them if the rumors were false.

251
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,661
Your Highness, since they didn't react, that means the rumors are true.

252
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:52,693
No wonder.

253
00:15:52,774 --> 00:15:54,364
I knew we were alike.

254
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,439
Stop!

255
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,400
Say that again?

256
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,760
Whose son was he?

257
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:07,439
- His Majesty. - Tell me who his mother is!

258
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,480
It's Ye Qing Mei.

259
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,240
You.

260
00:16:20,351 --> 00:16:21,631
Come with me.

261
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,550
Perfumed sachet and accessories for sale.

262
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,799
This is trespassing! Stop!

263
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:48,879
- Stop right there! - Stop right there!

264
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:52,442
- Stop right there! - Stop right there!

265
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,360
Stop right there!

266
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,959
This is the Overwatch Council.

267
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:05,589
What is the Minister of Revenue doing here?

268
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,119
Keep your weapons away.

269
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,029
Everyone on the streets knows about Fan Xian's background now.

270
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,560
- I know. - So what?

271
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,519
How will you clean up this mess? And,

272
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,519
the news spread within the capital overnight.

273
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,829
It spread too quickly.

274
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,359
You have to investigate the phenomenon.

275
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:47,670
Who else can achieve this besides the Overwatch Council?

276
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,480
So, it was you guys.

277
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,549
To put it more accurately, the news should've only been spread

278
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,199
within the capital after the hour of Wu.

279
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,559
Was it His Majesty's intention?

280
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,640
We can only do it with His Majesty's permission.

281
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,000
But why?

282
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,113
Fan Xian risked his life to save him.

283
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:16,542
His Majesty was touched by his effort.

284
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:18,556
Why is he pushing him off a cliff, then?

285
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,950
From a subject to a prince,

286
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,920
that's a promotion in one's identity.

287
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,239
Fan Xian's background was kept hidden all these years

288
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:29,309
in order to ensure his safety.

289
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,829
Do you know what the name "Ye Qing Mei" implies?

290
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,309
There are as many people who love her as there are people who hate her.

291
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,829
Hatred,

292
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,870
it never fades once it's rooted in our hearts.

293
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,280
I know that.

294
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,440
I know that.

295
00:18:58,759 --> 00:18:59,880
I want him dead!

296
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,759
Aunt Yun Rui, calm down.

297
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,119
I'm calm right now!

298
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,479
Ye Qing Mei's son has to die.

299
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,799
No wonder he wants to hand the Imperial Treasury to him.

300
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,735
He's just returning it to its rightful owner.

301
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,160
With Fan Xian's current identity,

302
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,936
His Majesty won't allow anyone to kill him.

303
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,950
But His Majesty owes me for this!

304
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,639
All these years,

305
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,640
I provided His Majesty with whatever he desired.

306
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,150
I was the one who did the dirty deeds for him.

307
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,799
I investigated the people he didn't want to investigate.

308
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,710
It was me! It wasn't anyone else!

309
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,959
I devoted my entire being to His Majesty alone.

310
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,880
Even if he wanted to chase me out of the capital,

311
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,549
I also obliged his will!

312
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,920
Aunt Yun Rui.

313
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,799
This isn't the end yet.

314
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:47,110
Even if I'm not in the capital,

315
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,829
I'm still His Majesty's dagger.

316
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,600
He wanted to abolish the chancellor.

317
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:54,055
Therefore, I told Yuan Hong Dao to collaborate with him.

318
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,719
Aunt Yun Rui, wasn't that your intention?

319
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,190
Why should I do so?

320
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:03,399
It was even between me and that Lin fellow long ago.

321
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,080
He was the one who wanted to abolish him.

322
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,840
If not, I wouldn't have instructed Yuan Hong Dao

323
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,789
to serve that Lin fellow for so many years.

324
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:12,839
It was me.

325
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,599
All these years,

326
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,190
I did everything he asked me to do.

327
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,029
But now, he still wants

328
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,069
to let the son of that woman

329
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:25,029
to steal the Imperial Treasury from me.

330
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,480
This time,

331
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,069
I don't care what His Majesty wants.

332
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:34,929
I want Fan Xian dead.

333
00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:37,929
Fan Xian is in the palace.

334
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,559
How do you plan to kill him?

335
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,600
Is he in my Guangxin Palace?

336
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,960
That's right.

337
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,309
Fan Xian is living

338
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,440
in my Guangxin Palace?

339
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,910
He chased me away

340
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,029
and robbed me of my residence, huh?

341
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,599
Wait.

342
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,000
Wait.

343
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:20,839
Actually, if we look at it from another perspective,

344
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:25,470
Crown Prince should be the one panicking about Fan Xian's identity.

345
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,710
I want him dead.

346
00:21:57,313 --> 00:21:59,426
Your Highness, Her Majesty has arrived.

347
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:01,743
You fools. Why didn't you guys notify me in advance?

348
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:03,757
I told them not to notify you.

349
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,239
What's wrong?

350
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:07,059
Do you not welcome me?

351
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,000
Mother.

352
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,680
Greetings,

353
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:15,176
Mother.

354
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,520
All of you may leave.

355
00:22:26,871 --> 00:22:28,242
Don't close the door.

356
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,720
Mother is afraid of the dark.

357
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,879
Mother, it's been some time since you left your residence.

358
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,722
Were you panicking?

359
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,680
Have you heard of the incident with Fan Xian?

360
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:43,242
I was just about to look for you.

361
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,320
Fan Xian is in charge of the Imperial Treasury.

362
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,790
And, he's taking over the Overwatch Council too.

363
00:22:47,814 --> 00:22:50,644
Right now, he has more power than Li Cheng Ze.

364
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,762
How could you rest at ease

365
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:53,959
if the rumors were true?

366
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:56,176
Let's not talk about the validity of the rumors for now.

367
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,162
It's fine even if they were true.

368
00:22:58,599 --> 00:22:59,879
I'm competing with Cheng Ze

369
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,910
because he's trying to steal the things that don't belong to him.

370
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,002
What if Fan Xian is a prince as well?

371
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,399
His surname is Fan.

372
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,670
Even if the entire world knows

373
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,482
that he's my brother,

374
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,349
he has no right to compete with me as long as his surname is Fan.

375
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:19,829
An illegitimate bloodline cannot enter the imperial family.

376
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,719
Mother, with his bloodline,

377
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:24,840
at most, he can only take over the Imperial Treasury and Overwatch Council.

378
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,390
That's all he can do.

379
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,470
If so, I should side with him instead.

380
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,999
He hates Cheng Ze. I hate Cheng Ze too.

381
00:23:31,102 --> 00:23:32,612
We're born to be allies.

382
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,789
What if I want Fan Xian dead?

383
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,561
Is it because he's Father's son?

384
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:44,789
It's because he's the son of Ye Qing Mei.

385
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,199
Didn't Ye Qing Mei die a long time ago?

386
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,079
There are plenty of concubines in the palace.

387
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,000
I don't think she's that big of a deal,

388
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,680
Mother.

389
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,799
Ye Qing Mei

390
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,079
died because of me.

391
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,599
Although no one mentioned

392
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,052
Ye Qing Mei's death again,

393
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:07,724
I do know some facts about it.

394
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,110
Back then, she died at the hands of the empress and her tribe, right?

395
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,870
Due to that, the empress's tribe was massacred.

396
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,520
If so, wouldn't it be better for us to observe

397
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,269
and wait for the empress to strike?

398
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:25,989
The empress's devious plots are impressive indeed.

399
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:29,519
However, this is the only thing I cannot put any hope on her.

400
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,239
But why?

401
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:33,101
It's because she has someone she cares about.

402
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,922
- Do you not have one? - I do.

403
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,240
I care about Ye Qing Mei.

404
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,762
I want her son to vanish

405
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,789
from this world.

406
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,920
That means

407
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:02,749
your tribesfolk were the ones who killed Ye Qing Mei.

408
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,829
You didn't kill her personally.

409
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:06,839
That's right.

410
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,749
If so, was your tribe

411
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,950
massacred?

412
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,559
My entire tribe

413
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,002
was wiped out overnight.

414
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,882
If so, I guess it's all in the past now.

415
00:25:21,723 --> 00:25:23,003
All in the past?

416
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,200
That night,

417
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,000
the Black Cavalry was searching the entire capital.

418
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:32,349
They even stormed into the palace

419
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,069
and trespassed upon my residence.

420
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,160
I wanted to stop them,

421
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,960
but to no avail.

422
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,829
They knocked over the lamps in front of me.

423
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:46,230
They made the servants cover my eyes.

424
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,349
I could only hear the terrifying wails of my kin as they were slaughtered.

425
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:55,589
There was no light,

426
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,720
and the moon was covered by the clouds.

427
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,762
Although the sky was dark,

428
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:04,029
although my eyes were covered,

429
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:06,470
I could still see.

430
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,829
Blood was the only thing I saw.

431
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,682
Blood was everywhere.

432
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,160
Do you think

433
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,269
all of that is in the past now?

434
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,095
If so, I suppose you weren't the one

435
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,919
who ordered your men to take her life, right?

436
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:26,839
Does that even matter?

437
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,509
If so, that means you're not related to the incident.

438
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,199
By the way,

439
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,239
I suppose not many people know about this, right?

440
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:37,639
That's right.

441
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,160
If so, it'll be safer.

442
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:43,039
Now that the culprit is dead,

443
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,349
bygones are bygones.

444
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,589
If so, Fan Xian and I can focus on the common enemy.

445
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:51,239
We can deal with Cheng Ze together.

446
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,150
The culprit is dead?

447
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,789
Bygones are bygones?

448
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,589
But they're my family.

449
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,150
They're your family too.

450
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,349
But what should I do if Fan Xian finds out about this

451
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,190
and fall out with me?

452
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:19,079
What should I do, then?

453
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,559
Mother,

454
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:29,119
what about this?

455
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:31,039
You should

456
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,600
apologize to Fan Xian.

457
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,960
You see,

458
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,190
this incident happened a long time ago.

459
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,230
And, the perpetrators

460
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,910
had paid the price with their lives.

461
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:42,150
Since you didn't kill her

462
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,719
or order your men to take her life,

463
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,110
why don't we

464
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,879
lay it all out

465
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,910
and apologize to Fan Xian?

466
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,630
This incident will be over by then.

467
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,319
What did you say?

468
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:03,789
You want me to apologize to him?

469
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,360
Mother,

470
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,720
I know my fault.

471
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,069
Plenty of our family members had died.

472
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,710
I'm also disheartened by it.

473
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,349
But Cheng Ze has his eyes on my position.

474
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:22,214
He's keeping a close eye on me.

475
00:28:22,728 --> 00:28:24,896
I may lose my position as the crown prince at any time.

476
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,269
I'm requesting Fan Xian's help

477
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:29,722
because I had no other choices, Mother.

478
00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:39,359
Mother,

479
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,160
please trust me.

480
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:42,839
If, one day,

481
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:45,322
when push comes to shove,

482
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,549
I'll definitely kill Fan Xian myself

483
00:28:47,655 --> 00:28:48,935
and avenge our family.

484
00:28:52,641 --> 00:28:54,310
Weren't you the one who taught me

485
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,402
that

486
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,440
those who want to achieve great feats

487
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,230
have to first endure?

488
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:39,728
You're right about everything.

489
00:29:41,903 --> 00:29:43,225
I'm relieved.

490
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:48,390
So, you're the one who resembles him the most.

491
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,359
Mother,

492
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,200
I can only say these words

493
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,190
in front of you.

494
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,589
It's because

495
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,190
I'm your only kin

496
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,789
in the world now.

497
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,000
All right.

498
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,359
You'll get

499
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,680
what you wish for.

500
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,029
You should stop kowtowing. This is inappropriate.

501
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,630
It's more than appropriate.

502
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,390
You saved his life after all.

503
00:30:55,607 --> 00:30:58,002
Even so, he didn't need to kowtow to me.

504
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,442
It's fine. He's doing it of his own accord.

505
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,613
Cheng Ping has been talking about you every day

506
00:31:02,637 --> 00:31:04,387
ever since you saved him.

507
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,589
By the way, does your wound still hurt?

508
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,720
I'm fine now.

509
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,480
He fainted.

510
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,440
It's fine. He can continue after some rest.

511
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,039
Where are Wan Er and Ruo Ruo?

512
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,335
Ruo Ruo? The imperial physician wanted to learn medical skills from her.

513
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,519
You're something else.

514
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:30,095
Why are you imparting your surgical skill

515
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,160
to other people?

516
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,829
We practice medicine to save lives.

517
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,240
What about Wan Er?

518
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,495
She went home to take some clothing.

519
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,190
I was thinking that I have to stay here for some time.

520
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,896
I should bring the wheelchair here as well.

521
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,136
You have a wheelchair in your house?

522
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,360
President Chen gave me one when I was feigning illness.

523
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,190
Are the rumors true?

524
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,680
I don't know.

525
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,599
If they're true,

526
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:10,749
that means you and Cheng Ping will have a closer relationship.

527
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,680
I truly have no idea.

528
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,509
I want Cheng Ping to be your student.

529
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,136
Why don't you ask him about it when he regains consciousness?

530
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,760
It's... It's time to take your medicine.

531
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,549
It's fine. I can make the call for him.

532
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,589
Why... Why don't you take it now?

533
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,430
Why did you have to poison me?

534
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,710
Let go of me!

535
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,199
Lord Fan, let me go!

536
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:56,159
How could they try to poison you in the palace?

537
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,839
Lord Fan!

538
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:05,522
Lord Fan!

539
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,319
Leave!

540
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,160
What are you doing here?

541
00:33:21,494 --> 00:33:23,738
Gong Dian was demoted. I'm taking over for the time being.

542
00:33:23,762 --> 00:33:26,121
Rest at ease. I'll deter the assassins.

543
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:28,252
These two aren't the only assassins today.

544
00:33:28,276 --> 00:33:31,057
Those assassins have worked in Guangxin Palace for many years.

545
00:33:31,162 --> 00:33:32,345
The mastermind must be someone I know, then.

546
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:34,216
I'll swap out all the personnel in Guangxin Palace.

547
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,999
I'll also report this to Father.

548
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,303
I'll surely give you an account.

549
00:33:37,327 --> 00:33:38,482
Thank you.

550
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,439
Do you need an imperial physician?

551
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,602
It's fine.

552
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,470
He's not done kowtowing yet.

553
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,430
You saw for yourself the situation I'm in.

554
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,390
Prince Cheng Ping will be in danger if he stays close to me.

555
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:05,117
You see,

556
00:34:05,198 --> 00:34:07,188
you're the only person in the imperial court

557
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:09,670
who can protect him now.

558
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:23,973
You should stop now.

559
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,720
One has to be sincere when being a student.

560
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,319
We made a promise.

561
00:34:28,807 --> 00:34:30,910
- It'll only count when he faints. - He fainted just now.

562
00:34:30,934 --> 00:34:33,082
He's awake now. That means it doesn't count.

563
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,710
Don't you feel sorry for your son at all?

564
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,879
Mothers have to be strong.

565
00:34:42,233 --> 00:34:43,313
Put your back into it.

566
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,720
It's not loud enough.

567
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,802
According to His Majesty's oral edict,

568
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,269
the capital is too crowded.

569
00:34:52,431 --> 00:34:53,940
It's complex and unsafe.

570
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:55,949
It's time to pull the weeds.

571
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:59,046
Excuse me, but how do I pull the weeds?

572
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,508
Prince Cheng Ze, please inspect your residence

573
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:03,910
and see if there's anyone

574
00:35:04,017 --> 00:35:06,349
who shouldn't be in the capital.

575
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:10,078
If so, please send them out of the capital immediately.

576
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,519
There's no need to pull the weeds.

577
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,922
You can just designate me.

578
00:35:14,627 --> 00:35:17,802
Sir, don't worry. I'll surely inspect the residence thoroughly.

579
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:20,042
I've already relayed the message.

580
00:35:20,123 --> 00:35:21,913
I shall take my leave now.

581
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:25,879
Sir, take care.

582
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:29,150
Make her leave as soon as possible.

583
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:41,282
Aunt Yun Rui,

584
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,002
assassinating Fan Xian is a huge deal.

585
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,560
I didn't do it.

586
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:49,030
Those assassins in Guangxin Palace served you for many years.

587
00:35:49,127 --> 00:35:52,047
Although they said they did it of their own accord, who would trust them?

588
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:54,799
Do you think I'm dumb enough to resort to using maids and eunuchs?

589
00:35:55,645 --> 00:35:58,036
Moreover, I know that Fan Xian is a poison practitioner.

590
00:35:58,519 --> 00:35:59,799
Why would I try to poison him?

591
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,120
Who else could it be, then?

592
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:04,959
I may be crazy,

593
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,439
but I'm not foolish.

594
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,479
Are you saying that the empress is behind this?

595
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,560
That doesn't make sense.

596
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,160
Why would the empress take the assassination this lightly?

597
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,680
It's hard to say.

598
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:17,382
I'm too lazy to take a guess either.

599
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,479
Aunt Yun Rui,

600
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:21,173
His Majesty is forcing you to return to Xinyang now.

601
00:36:21,197 --> 00:36:22,477
What do you plan to do?

602
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:25,359
If Fan Xian wants to take over the Imperial Treasury,

603
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,599
he has to take over the Three Great Workshops first.

604
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:29,150
He'll surely head to Jiangnan.

605
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,519
It might be inconvenient for me to kill him in the capital,

606
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:34,349
but Jiangnan is a convenient location.

607
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:36,479
That's hard to say.

608
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:39,320
Although he lost his martial arts, he still has plenty of bodyguards.

609
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:42,190
Ye Liu Yun is in Jiangnan.

610
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,200
What?

611
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,480
Aunt Yun Rui, are you saying that the grandmaster will help you out?

612
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,560
Why don't you take a guess?

613
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:00,519
Aunt Yun Rui, we've been allies for a long time.

614
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,469
But how many secrets are you keeping from me?

615
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:07,789
Aunt Yun Rui, do you plan to wait for Fan Xian in Jiangnan?

616
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,349
Today, I'll return to Xinyang.

617
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:14,749
If anything happens to Fan Xian while he's in Jiangnan,

618
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:16,710
it has nothing to do with me.

619
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:23,990
You're on your own now.

620
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,479
I'll leave the capital today.

621
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,280
I won't see you off, then.

622
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:29,117
I'll also give it a try.

623
00:37:29,198 --> 00:37:32,428
Aunt Yun Rui, you can rest if I'm able to kill Fan Xian in the capital.

624
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,240
How do you plan to do it?

625
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:36,959
Will you enter the palace?

626
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,680
I'm not foolish either.

627
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,720
Aunt Liu, please stop.

628
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,936
We have more than enough here.

629
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,046
We'll only be away for a few days. We'll return soon.

630
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,350
Who can say for sure?

631
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,760
Wan Er,

632
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,640
I suppose you've heard of the rumors related to Fan Xian's background.

633
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,040
I have.

634
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:02,869
Say, do you think he'll remain in the palace after this?

635
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,482
He'll definitely come back.

636
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,362
Are you saying

637
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,150
that the rumors were false?

638
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,522
I don't know if they're false or not.

639
00:38:13,645 --> 00:38:16,036
But, it doesn't matter anyway.

640
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,080
Silly girl,

641
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,110
how could it not matter?

642
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,720
We bowed to you and his father

643
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,159
in the Fan Residence during our wedding.

644
00:38:24,278 --> 00:38:26,629
His surname is Fan, and that cannot be changed.

645
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:29,760
How did you know?

646
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,999
Did he tell you about it?

647
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,159
He didn't need to tell me.

648
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:33,628
I understand Fan Xian.

649
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,070
I'm sure he'll make that choice.

650
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,670
That boy is truly lucky

651
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,200
to get you as his wife.

652
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,070
I'm the lucky one here.

653
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,599
I'm lucky enough to encounter him.

654
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,120
Why did you stop the carriage...

655
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,399
Cheng Ze?

656
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,829
Fan Xian and his men killed your brother, Lin Gong.

657
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,118
Fan Xian already knew the truth behind the assassination

658
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:20,452
on Niulan Street before your brother died.

659
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:22,110
He deceived everyone.

660
00:39:28,465 --> 00:39:29,550
Please get off the carriage.

661
00:39:29,574 --> 00:39:30,894
Ling Er knows about that as well.

662
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,762
If you don't believe me,

663
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,749
you can confront Ling Er.

664
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,359
You'll know the truth by then.

665
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,920
Since when did you hear about the news?

666
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:44,510
It has been some time.

667
00:39:45,212 --> 00:39:46,601
Why didn't you tell me about it before the wedding?

668
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:47,695
Someone requested me to keep quiet.

669
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,157
Moreover, it's pointless for me to tell you about it back then.

670
00:39:50,181 --> 00:39:52,535
You're just trying to use someone else to do your dirty work for you.

671
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:55,642
Don't you wish to avenge your closest kin?

672
00:40:01,534 --> 00:40:03,775
Wan Er, have you forgotten?

673
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:05,642
Your surname is Lin.

674
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,160
Stop the carriage.

675
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,829
Sir, your handwriting is excellent.

676
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,640
There's no need to butter me up forcefully.

677
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,389
Yes, sir.

678
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,560
You can skip the formalities.

679
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,920
Once a teacher,

680
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,039
always a teacher.

681
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,119
I have to respect you.

682
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,559
Our seniority is all mixed up now.

683
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:58,800
Speaking of which,

684
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,829
I don't know what I can teach you either.

685
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,309
You have your own habits

686
00:41:03,477 --> 00:41:05,437
when it comes to dealing with matters and people.

687
00:41:05,982 --> 00:41:07,262
Mother told me

688
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:10,478
to do whatever you tell me to do

689
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,870
without questioning anything.

690
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,280
If so, please deliver this letter to the Overwatch Council.

691
00:41:18,204 --> 00:41:20,122
Me? You want me to go?

692
00:41:21,094 --> 00:41:22,374
Why don't I go, then?

693
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,734
I heard that the Overwatch Council is filled with blood and horror.

694
00:41:25,898 --> 00:41:28,159
- Is that true? - Give it back if you're scared.

695
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,320
No.

696
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,680
Sir, I'll listen to you.

697
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:34,162
Once you're there,

698
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,680
tell them to deliver this letter

699
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,710
to Northern Qi.

700
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,039
To whom in Northern Qi?

701
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,430
Haitang Duo Duo.

702
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:46,240
Sir,

703
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,600
I understand now.

704
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,640
What do you understand?

705
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:52,589
I'll definitely protect this letter.

706
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,789
Are you misunderstanding something here?

707
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,119
I'll head there right now.

708
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:58,909
No need for that. It's late now.

709
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,270
You can do it tomorrow.

710
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,240
Sir, I'll take my leave first.

711
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,903
Don't worry. I'll surely fulfill your request.

712
00:42:07,927 --> 00:42:09,082
Go now.

713
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:11,760
Good night, Madam.

714
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,120
I shall take my leave.

715
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,030
What request was he talking about?

716
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:31,230
Telling the Overwatch Council to deliver the letter to Haitang Duo Duo.

717
00:42:31,254 --> 00:42:32,614
What did you write in your letter?

718
00:42:33,335 --> 00:42:36,444
Master Ku He has a technique called Heaven's Path.

719
00:42:36,613 --> 00:42:39,093
Rumor has it that it can reconstruct one's body and meridians.

720
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:40,670
I'm trying to see if there's a way

721
00:42:40,694 --> 00:42:43,054
for me to learn it from him in exchange for something else.

722
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,990
I can't just keep being useless forever.

723
00:42:46,054 --> 00:42:47,602
I heard that Ku He never imparted

724
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:49,150
that technique to any outsiders.

725
00:42:50,087 --> 00:42:51,730
I have to give it a try somehow.
