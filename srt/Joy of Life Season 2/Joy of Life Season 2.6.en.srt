00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:30,962
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,082
(Episode 6)

3
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,649
Lord Xin, we'll follow your will.

4
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:38,881
Don't do that. Don't just follow my will.

5
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:40,615
- Lord Xin, please. - Don't!

6
00:01:40,696 --> 00:01:43,842
- Lord Xin, please. - I can't make the call here.

7
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,962
This is too much of a coincidence.

8
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,002
He said they changed their schedule.

9
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,522
They changed their schedule?

10
00:01:49,713 --> 00:01:51,362
Because of that, they bumped into me?

11
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:53,743
Your Highness, although your carriage

12
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,322
represents the honor of your kingdom,

13
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,780
in my opinion,

14
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,519
we'll be a family anyway.

15
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,086
You don't need to care about this.

16
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,550
We can discuss this.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,282
Your Highness should decide

18
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,282
whether we make way or not.

19
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,642
As a member of Qi's royalty,

20
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:21,082
my words and behavior represent Qi's reputation.

21
00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:23,562
I can be aggrieved

22
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:27,162
but the might of Qi cannot be humiliated.

23
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,762
I won't make way!

24
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:33,495
You won't?

25
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:35,722
I did my best.

26
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,722
Then... What about Prince Cheng Ru?

27
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:42,122
Why don't you ask him to wait?

28
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:44,282
He is the prince.

29
00:02:44,363 --> 00:02:45,922
She is his consort.

30
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,629
Lord Xin.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,620
Why don't you ask the Department of Rites to be prepared?

32
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:06,076
Let's depart!

33
00:06:52,085 --> 00:06:54,522
I, Fan Xian, greet Your Highness.

34
00:07:56,485 --> 00:07:57,826
I've heard your name.

35
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,842
I'm humbled.

36
00:08:02,094 --> 00:08:03,642
How daring of you

37
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,322
to take a prince's path.

38
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:07,336
However, you are also quite foolish.

39
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,510
Your Highness,

40
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,362
I didn't want to do that

41
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,442
but I was forced to.

42
00:08:15,672 --> 00:08:16,792
How so?

43
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,482
I am weak.

44
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:19,917
I've come to the South

45
00:08:20,015 --> 00:08:21,482
and don't feel acclimatized.

46
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:23,842
Prince Cheng Ru, are you

47
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,482
making me wait outside the city gates

48
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,762
and not allow me to enter?

49
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,082
Your Highness,

50
00:08:37,781 --> 00:08:39,202
that was why I'm forced to do this.

51
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,682
You are quite courageous.

52
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,202
Why should I panic

53
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,034
about your family matters?

54
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,943
What if I'm forcing you to make way?

55
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:09,767
Then, I'll have to apologize to Your Highness

56
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,110
by dying.

57
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,402
I want to enter the city soon.

58
00:09:13,503 --> 00:09:14,802
It's not Lord Fan's fault.

59
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,013
She's quite bold as well.

60
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,174
(First Prince, Li Cheng Ru)

61
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,140
Fan Xian,

62
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:32,449
do you think I dare not kill you?

63
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:34,752
I'm sure there's nothing that you're afraid of doing.

64
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,120
The horses are startled!

65
00:10:32,238 --> 00:10:34,562
Make way! Everyone, make way!

66
00:10:40,336 --> 00:10:42,482
The horses are startled, make way!

67
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,002
Gao Da, protect Lord Fan!

68
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,682
You're capable.

69
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,239
Your Highness, you are too polite.

70
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,562
The horses were startled. We should help manage the situation.

71
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,442
The horse is dead!

72
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,150
Hurry!

73
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,909
Hurry!

74
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,682
That's... Gao Da, you...

75
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,679
I don't think so. I didn't use my blade.

76
00:11:51,797 --> 00:11:53,442
How did the horse die then?

77
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:55,409
There was a stampede.

78
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,142
How could I stop it if I didn't use some strength?

79
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,316
You...

80
00:12:00,957 --> 00:12:03,054
I just came back from the battle, and you killed my horse.

81
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:04,682
Lord Fan, you are amazing indeed.

82
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:06,922
I led an army to battle for years.

83
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,959
I didn't expect the imperial court to welcome us in this way.

84
00:12:09,983 --> 00:12:12,583
- This is an accident. - Since you are Wan Er's future husband,

85
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,119
I will leave this matter alone.

86
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,870
Give this man to me.

87
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:19,438
We can compensate you with a horse.

88
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:21,241
Gao Da.

89
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,110
Fan Xian!

90
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:25,669
Think twice.

91
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:27,962
- Lord Fan, it's not worth it. - Shut up!

92
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,909
I will take responsibility of his mistake.

93
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,401
I gave the order.

94
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:39,997
There's no need to trouble Lord Fan.

95
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,842
His Highness, the crown prince, is here!

96
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,673
(Capital)

97
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,962
Greetings, Your Highness!

98
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,397
I, Fan Xian, greet Your Highness.

99
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:44,278
You are one of my own. Spare the formalities.

100
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,789
Cheng Ru.

101
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,839
Greetings, Your Highness.

102
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,282
You are my elder brother.

103
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,602
How can you bow to me?

104
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:06,522
You've been battling out there for years.

105
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,270
- You've lost weight. - It's fine.

106
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:11,202
Being out there makes me happy.

107
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:12,781
I didn't feel like coming back

108
00:14:12,873 --> 00:14:13,990
if it wasn't for the imperial edict.

109
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:15,362
You must come back.

110
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:17,562
Do you know how much I miss you?

111
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,150
Cheng Ru.

112
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,270
Give me a hug.

113
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,799
You're already home. Why wouldn't you enter the city?

114
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,680
It's not that I didn't want to enter.

115
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,522
Someone was blocking my way.

116
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,322
Who dares to block you?

117
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,189
Well...

118
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,909
You again?

119
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,696
Do you know that blocking my brother is a serious crime?

120
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,280
I'm not that daring.

121
00:14:51,362 --> 00:14:54,619
Her Highness from Northern Qi is also with us.

122
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,939
It was a long journey and she is not acclimatized to the land.

123
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,522
She wants to rest in the city soon. Right, Your Highness?

124
00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:04,202
It's my order indeed!

125
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:10,482
Your Highness, calm down.

126
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,282
Just sit calmly in the cart.

127
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:15,202
I will pay for the dying warhorse.

128
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,402
- It's not cheap! - I...

129
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,402
As a member of Qi's royalty,

130
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,722
I should be able to pay for it.

131
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,762
You are richer than me then.

132
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:25,959
I can't afford it.

133
00:15:26,062 --> 00:15:27,522
The money was given to my mother.

134
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,624
How much does it cost?

135
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,949
You just need to tell me.

136
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:36,640
All right.

137
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,058
I'll look for you alone later.

138
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,510
Cheng Ru.

139
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,429
The princess

140
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,897
is your future consort.

141
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,092
My future sister-in-law.

142
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,975
Fan Xian is troubled

143
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,922
because he was in between you two.

144
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,859
Of course. If you want to vent your anger,

145
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,750
I will teach him a lesson for you as your younger brother.

146
00:16:10,406 --> 00:16:11,637
Since Your Highness said that,

147
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,202
I should let this matter go.

148
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:15,482
Yes. Don't lower yourself to their level.

149
00:16:17,902 --> 00:16:19,207
You've not returned for a long time.

150
00:16:19,231 --> 00:16:20,495
This should be your first meeting.

151
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,802
Let me formally introduce both of you.

152
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,300
This is the young talent of the Qi Kingdom,

153
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:27,611
Fan Xian.

154
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,242
Greetings, Your Highness.

155
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,069
I know him. Wan Er's husband.

156
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:35,593
Yes.

157
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,122
He is also helping the President Chen now.

158
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,240
The chief inspector of the Overwatch Council.

159
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,081
How mighty.

160
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,280
Cheng Ru,

161
00:16:45,391 --> 00:16:48,170
Wan Er is like our younger sister.

162
00:16:48,504 --> 00:16:50,522
Why don't we

163
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,162
spare your future brother-in-law for Wan Er's sake?

164
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:55,437
Do you really think

165
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:57,242
I got angry because my way was blocked?

166
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,379
Why did you get angry then?

167
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,082
A marriage should be serious.

168
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,642
However,

169
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:04,633
Father said the one who marries Wan Er

170
00:17:04,714 --> 00:17:06,456
will take over the fortunes of the treasury.

171
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,740
After that, he appeared.

172
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,995
Is he marrying Wan Er

173
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,122
or the limitless fortune?

174
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,416
- Naturally, it's for Wan Er. - Anyone would say that.

175
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,360
His Majesty insisted on including the treasury.

176
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,910
I didn't want it but I couldn't go against an imperial edict.

177
00:17:21,846 --> 00:17:23,002
Father's edict

178
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,682
was muddled indeed.

179
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,362
Although both of you have never met,

180
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,139
I'm sure both of you can become good friends

181
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,802
with my understanding of both of your personalities.

182
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,162
It's getting late.

183
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,042
Cheng Ze and Cheng Ping

184
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,242
are still waiting for you inside.

185
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:47,162
Why don't we speak inside?

186
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,070
Your Highness,

187
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:51,539
who should enter the city first?

188
00:17:58,405 --> 00:17:59,665
You came at the right time.

189
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:00,759
I know.

190
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,642
You should make a decision, Your Highness.

191
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,310
Cheng Ze,

192
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,602
is Cheng Ru going to confront the convoy?

193
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,319
Are we not going to stop them?

194
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,042
We are here to welcome them

195
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,562
and not to stop a fight.

196
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:28,851
Why did His Highness go there?

197
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,522
He is different.

198
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,682
Who will he help?

199
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:35,932
Him?

200
00:18:36,302 --> 00:18:37,625
He will help anyone

201
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,562
and not help anyone.

202
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,522
It's tough for him.

203
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:50,642
Living alone is tough.

204
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,509
They are coming.

205
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,762
Why are they entering together?

206
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,162
He resolved it well.

207
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,150
Cheng Ru.

208
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,699
You've grown taller.

209
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:03,677
I want to grow as tall as you and lead an army in the future as well.

210
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,709
You just need to keep this ambition.

211
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:11,962
It has been so long. You've lost weight.

212
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:15,722
I said the same thing

213
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,522
when I saw him just now.

214
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:36,562
Let me take a good look.

215
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,799
You've become much fitter.

216
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:41,858
If I knew you were coming back with Cheng Ru,

217
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,980
I would prepare some gifts for you.

218
00:20:44,086 --> 00:20:45,446
Your Highness, you are too polite.

219
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,962
I've received the lavish gift you prepared

220
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,719
on our way here.

221
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:50,996
Really?

222
00:20:51,256 --> 00:20:52,562
I've forgotten.

223
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,519
Smile!

224
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,749
Don't worry.

225
00:21:06,854 --> 00:21:09,042
There's a much better gift waiting for you.

226
00:21:09,447 --> 00:21:11,642
I'll be looking forward to it then.

227
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:17,658
Cheng Ze, you are comprehensive.

228
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:21,968
Crown Prince, your contributions are unparalleled

229
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,842
in turning the tide.

230
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,002
Cheng Ze, are you mocking me?

231
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:32,202
I'm praising you.

232
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,602
That's too much praise, Cheng Ze.

233
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,922
You are...

234
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,669
It's you?

235
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,482
Who are you?

236
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:02,602
He is Prince Cheng Ping.

237
00:22:06,263 --> 00:22:07,413
It wasn't a dream.

238
00:22:07,518 --> 00:22:08,599
He's real!

239
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:09,853
Why are you hiding?

240
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,762
He knocked me out.

241
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:15,322
- Are you sure? - Yes. I thought I was dreaming.

242
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:16,842
Turns out it's real.

243
00:22:20,488 --> 00:22:22,042
You attacked a prince.

244
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,540
Your Highness, where did I knock you out?

245
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,260
It was in Moon...

246
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,830
What?

247
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:35,089
Keep talking. No one can stop you here.

248
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,110
Just say it.

249
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,350
I'm here.

250
00:22:43,207 --> 00:22:44,357
I...

251
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:45,989
I'm sorry.

252
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,120
I made a mistake.

253
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,350
You made a mistake?

254
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,482
It was a nightmare indeed.

255
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,199
Does it mean we've never met before?

256
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:57,550
No. It's our first time meeting each other.

257
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,682
You scared me.

258
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:01,762
Did you really make a mistake?

259
00:23:02,165 --> 00:23:04,759
It's true. I've always been living within the palace walls.

260
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,682
I have no chance to meet you.

261
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,909
Are you both not going to ask any questions?

262
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:18,519
He said

263
00:23:19,183 --> 00:23:20,461
he saw Fan Xian in his dreams.

264
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,229
All right.

265
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:25,442
I'll be leaving then.

266
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,600
What's the rush? We've never met for so long. Why not stay and chat?

267
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,800
I'm eager to return home.

268
00:23:29,981 --> 00:23:31,981
After leaving for so long, I miss home and Wan Er.

269
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:34,282
That must be troublesome for you.

270
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,282
Message from His Majesty!

271
00:23:39,636 --> 00:23:44,577
Fan Xian and all the princes are summoned into the palace.

272
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,562
Fan Xian?

273
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:49,562
Why is he in a rush to see you?

274
00:23:50,332 --> 00:23:52,812
Perhaps it was because I lied to His Majesty not too long ago.

275
00:23:54,628 --> 00:23:56,068
Cheng Ru, you should get used to it.

276
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,782
This is how

277
00:23:58,224 --> 00:23:59,722
our Lord Fan acts.

278
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,469
Cheng Ru.

279
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,402
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

280
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:17,910
We are all from the same family. Spare the formalities.

281
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,220
Cheng Ze.

282
00:24:20,935 --> 00:24:23,802
What was that man's name? Fan Xian?

283
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,470
Wasn't he with you?

284
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:26,765
His Majesty wanted to see him.

285
00:24:26,796 --> 00:24:28,322
The banquet will begin soon

286
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,910
yet Father wants to meet him alone?

287
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,362
Perhaps he is getting punished.

288
00:24:32,415 --> 00:24:35,722
- Why? - Fan Xian went out as an envoy and faked his death.

289
00:24:35,852 --> 00:24:37,247
After causing such a huge incident,

290
00:24:37,271 --> 00:24:38,815
it must be concluded one way or another.

291
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,962
I heard he had no choice but to fake his death

292
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,353
because of Si Gu Jian's threat.

293
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:45,402
Facing danger and lying to His Majesty

294
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,640
are two separate things.

295
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,162
Cheng Ze, this is serious.

296
00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:50,338
That person is the grandmaster after all.

297
00:24:50,397 --> 00:24:51,682
That's reasonable.

298
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:57,319
Crown Prince, are you saying that as long as it's reasonable,

299
00:24:57,406 --> 00:24:59,185
everyone can lie to His Majesty?

300
00:25:00,118 --> 00:25:01,738
I'm not saying that.

301
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,030
I'm just simply saying.

302
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,310
Don't be afraid.

303
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,402
Don't discuss government affairs in private.

304
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,362
His Majesty is here!

305
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:17,371
- Greetings, Father. - Greetings, Your Majesty.

306
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:19,669
Sit.

307
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:27,882
Li Cheng Ru, you look like you're in high spirits.

308
00:25:28,214 --> 00:25:30,176
I haven't seen you for years. How are you doing, Father?

309
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,350
I'm still alive.

310
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:32,629
Sit.

311
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,002
Your Majesty, thanks for granting me the punishment of flogging.

312
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,429
Sit down.

313
00:25:54,495 --> 00:25:55,882
I, Fan Xian,

314
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,042
thank Your Majesty for granting me a seat.

315
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,442
Take it slow.

316
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:05,442
I want to eat with all of you

317
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:09,260
and listen to some interesting stories

318
00:26:09,577 --> 00:26:11,802
about Fan Xian's journey to Northern Qi.

319
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,509
- Fan Xian. - Your Majesty,

320
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:19,762
we successfully escorted Yan Bing Yun back to the capital.

321
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,528
In Northern Qi,

322
00:26:22,692 --> 00:26:24,423
Shen Zhong died from Shang Shan Hu's spear.

323
00:26:24,504 --> 00:26:26,024
The political scene is a little messy.

324
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:28,882
I only care

325
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,859
about the Divine Temple.

326
00:26:38,102 --> 00:26:39,802
Before Xiao En's death, he revealed

327
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,282
that the Divine Temple does exist.

328
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,642
It's in the snowfield of the far north.

329
00:26:46,364 --> 00:26:47,718
Is there really a Divine Temple?

330
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:48,949
Xiao En said so.

331
00:26:51,173 --> 00:26:52,794
I'll need to see it for myself

332
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,500
to decide whether it exists or not.

333
00:26:57,078 --> 00:26:59,379
Northern Qi is between us and the far north.

334
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,562
It's not that convenient.

335
00:27:01,918 --> 00:27:03,722
It'll be convenient

336
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,722
if Northern Qi no longer exists.

337
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,962
Your Majesty is ambitious.

338
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,002
I'm sure you'll capture Northern Qi soon.

339
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,749
Fan Xian,

340
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:16,358
what else?

341
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:17,589
Your Majesty.

342
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,122
I do have something else.

343
00:27:20,951 --> 00:27:22,101
Tell me.

344
00:27:26,882 --> 00:27:28,882
Before Shen Zhong's death, he told me

345
00:27:29,004 --> 00:27:30,348
that Northern Qi's imperial guards

346
00:27:30,372 --> 00:27:32,519
have had acts of smuggling with the Qing Kingdom

347
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:34,094
and the one responsible from our side

348
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,642
is Princess Yun Rui

349
00:27:36,318 --> 00:27:37,642
and Prince Cheng Ze.

350
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,751
The family banquet has begun

351
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,379
at His Majesty's study.

352
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:51,042
Did Fan Xian leave?

353
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:53,379
Your Majesty, Lord Fan stayed there.

354
00:28:05,711 --> 00:28:07,077
The fire stick is extinguished.

355
00:28:07,231 --> 00:28:08,682
Your Majesty, please forgive us.

356
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,780
An outsider joins the banquet

357
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,438
(Queen of the Qi Kingdom)

358
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:21,882
yet I have no right to be there as the queen.

359
00:28:24,575 --> 00:28:26,034
A family banquet?

360
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,442
What did they talk about?

361
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:37,602
Your Majesty, Fan Xian accused Prince Cheng Ze and Princess Yun Rui.

362
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,722
The crime is smuggling with Northern Qi.

363
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,162
Did he say that in public?

364
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,362
Yes. The other princes were present as well.

365
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,522
How did His Majesty respond?

366
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:15,002
Your Majesty, calm down.

367
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,402
With my understanding of Cheng Ze,

368
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,260
he would never do that.

369
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:21,042
There must be

370
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,562
a misunderstanding.

371
00:29:23,643 --> 00:29:24,793
Your Majesty.

372
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:26,797
I confess.

373
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,682
Aunt Yun Rui and I never did anything

374
00:29:28,782 --> 00:29:30,282
that betrayed the Qing Kingdom.

375
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,362
However, someone as great as Lord Fan

376
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,882
would never say that

377
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,402
without proof.

378
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,642
Perhaps I did something wrong

379
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,962
and caused Lord Fan to misunderstand.

380
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:43,479
Lord Fan.

381
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:44,716
Fan Xian.

382
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,060
You openly accuse Princess Yun Rui and Prince Cheng Ze.

383
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,500
Do you have witnesses and evidence?

384
00:29:51,591 --> 00:29:53,877
- Shen Zhong is the witness. - Where is he?

385
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,970
He might be dead, but we can investigate something that was done before.

386
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:00,882
He's dead and you have no evidence.

387
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:03,820
How dare you accuse Prince Cheng Ze?

388
00:30:05,822 --> 00:30:07,362
Who do you think you are?

389
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,770
I am the chief inspector of the Overwatch Council.

390
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:19,242
I must enforce the law and eliminate the traitors.

391
00:30:21,262 --> 00:30:22,412
Say it again.

392
00:30:22,493 --> 00:30:23,936
I am the chief inspector of the Overwatch Council.

393
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,522
I must enforce the law and eliminate the traitors.

394
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,082
(Chief Inspector)

395
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:55,800
Father,

396
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,191
you should be angry at Fan Xian.

397
00:30:57,274 --> 00:30:59,162
He even stopped me outside the city gate.

398
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:01,121
I see he also behaves the same in front of you.

399
00:31:01,655 --> 00:31:03,602
I think he was born with this temper.

400
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:07,530
- Calm down. - Yes. Please calm down, Your Majesty.

401
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,440
Your Majesty, please calm down.

402
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,522
Father, please calm down.

403
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:17,242
Is there anything else?

404
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,039
Your Majesty,

405
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:25,242
I actually have an auspicious event

406
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:26,897
to discuss with you.

407
00:31:27,582 --> 00:31:29,932
- An auspicious event? What is it? - Yes.

408
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,802
Although Fan Xian made a mistake,

409
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,859
he has still contributed in Northern Qi.

410
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,820
Besides, he is also talented.

411
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:39,818
It's obvious that the Fan family is knowledgeable.

412
00:31:39,935 --> 00:31:41,695
The daughter of the Fan family, Fan Ruo Ruo,

413
00:31:41,795 --> 00:31:43,438
is famous for being talented in the capital.

414
00:31:43,462 --> 00:31:45,602
She is virtuous and elegant.

415
00:31:45,976 --> 00:31:49,485
Lord Jing's son, Li Hong Cheng, is gentle and yet to be married.

416
00:31:49,566 --> 00:31:51,999
He has also admired Ruo Ruo for a long time.

417
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,020
Since Fan Xian and Wan Er are engaged,

418
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:55,961
why not add to this auspicious event

419
00:31:56,263 --> 00:31:57,442
and grant another marriage

420
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,042
to bless this relationship?

421
00:32:00,942 --> 00:32:02,824
There's no rush for Ruo Ruo's marriage.

422
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,842
You are good at giving strange ideas.

423
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,780
I approve of this marriage.

424
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,709
- Your Majesty! - Besides,

425
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,122
Fan Xian has contributed in Northern Qi as an envoy.

426
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,282
He will be granted the title of Duke.

427
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,840
Since you like auspicious events,

428
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:29,562
I'll grant you a marriage.

429
00:32:31,102 --> 00:32:35,202
Ye Zhong's daughter, Ye Ling Er, is a good match for you.

430
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,400
I'll grant her to you.

431
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,139
I'm not close with Ye Ling Er.

432
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,642
All right. Eat without me.

433
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,669
I...

434
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,189
I obey.

435
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,469
We obey!

436
00:32:55,046 --> 00:32:56,196
I request Your Majesty,

437
00:32:56,334 --> 00:32:58,602
for the sake of the people and the Qing Kingdom's law,

438
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,999
to investigate Elder Princess, Li Yun Rui,

439
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:02,802
and Second Prince, Li Cheng Ze!

440
00:33:03,897 --> 00:33:05,377
You have no evidence

441
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:06,697
and tell lies!

442
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,759
How can I find evidence without an investigation?

443
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,202
You deserve to be flogged more.

444
00:33:18,013 --> 00:33:19,335
Many innocent lives are lost in this case.

445
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:22,540
The culprits mustn't be forgiven! Your Majesty, please investigate it!

446
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,790
Eat.

447
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:49,909
Congratulations.

448
00:34:24,622 --> 00:34:25,882
Didn't he receive a flogging?

449
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,439
How did he recover so quickly?

450
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:28,962
It was all an act.

451
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,562
An act for us.

452
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:31,809
Why?

453
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,070
He lied to His Majesty.

454
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,562
It was his way out.

455
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,362
However, His Majesty

456
00:34:38,847 --> 00:34:40,387
favors Fan Xian too much.

457
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:14,709
Don't give up.

458
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,082
Cheng Ze and Aunt Yun Rui are relatives.

459
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:19,162
I'm already used to it.

460
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,362
After so many years,

461
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,482
His Majesty still favors him more.

462
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,362
He let Yuan Meng manage Moon Embracing Pavilion

463
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,962
for this exact moment.

464
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,762
Granting a marriage

465
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:38,562
was despicable.

466
00:35:39,414 --> 00:35:41,762
Your brother is the owner of Moon Embracing Pavilion

467
00:35:42,233 --> 00:35:44,242
and the manager, Yuan Meng,

468
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,962
became your brother-in-law's lover.

469
00:35:46,415 --> 00:35:49,642
He has completely sullied the Fan family's reputation.

470
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:56,722
He is forcefully trying to get me involved.

471
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,522
Don't succumb to fate.

472
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,642
His Majesty was right about one thing.

473
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:10,602
I need evidence.

474
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,920
Your Highness,

475
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,722
how's the investigation at Shijia Town?

476
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,082
Did you find anything?

477
00:36:21,362 --> 00:36:23,602
The contraband must be kept there to be transported.

478
00:36:23,744 --> 00:36:26,177
If we can find the relationship between Prince Cheng Ze and Shijia Town,

479
00:36:26,201 --> 00:36:28,562
it means the case is 80% true.

480
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:34,869
What's wrong?

481
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,389
Shijia Town

482
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,430
is gone.

483
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,682
What do you mean it's gone?

484
00:36:47,242 --> 00:36:50,082
(Shijia Town)

485
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,802
There must be someone alive.

486
00:37:01,811 --> 00:37:03,522
When my men went there,

487
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,242
the whole town was burnt.

488
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,162
No one was left alive.

489
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:14,442
Cheng Ze was too cruel.

490
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,722
Now that the village is burnt,

491
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,802
the clues of the smuggling stop there.

492
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,002
But the most important thing is all the lives lost!

493
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:27,482
There needs to be an explanation

494
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,482
for the burnt village.

495
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:31,922
An accidental fire.

496
00:37:33,861 --> 00:37:35,036
That's all?

497
00:37:50,244 --> 00:37:52,264
He has everything under his control.

498
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,122
Don't be reckless.

499
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:01,162
Without evidence

500
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,162
and His Majesty siding with Cheng Ze,

501
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,242
what you can do is calm down

502
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:08,122
and try to get on His Majesty's good side.

503
00:38:08,481 --> 00:38:09,802
As for the rest,

504
00:38:10,031 --> 00:38:11,482
let's wait for an opportunity.

505
00:38:12,198 --> 00:38:13,348
Moreover,

506
00:38:14,568 --> 00:38:16,268
you need to find a way to get back your position

507
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:18,014
as the chief inspector of the Overwatch Council.

508
00:38:18,038 --> 00:38:20,098
This position is crucial.

509
00:38:24,788 --> 00:38:26,588
Her Majesty wants to meet you, Your Highness.

510
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:42,642
Don't give up. We will work together and slowly plan this.

511
00:39:01,343 --> 00:39:03,322
Mother, I'm here to see you.

512
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:06,349
Come in.

513
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,590
Greetings,

514
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:49,762
Mother.

515
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,962
Spare the formalities.

516
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,749
There are no outsiders here.

517
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,842
I've been maintaining my manner the whole day.

518
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,362
My whole body is firm.

519
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,269
Mother,

520
00:40:22,622 --> 00:40:25,082
Cheng Ze always walks barefoot.

521
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,882
Do you think it's very comfortable?

522
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,602
It does feel great.

523
00:40:54,645 --> 00:40:56,522
Mother, are you still afraid of the dark?

524
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,682
It has always been the same.

525
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:06,162
Why don't we find another imperial physician?

526
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,802
There's no use.

527
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,070
In this world,

528
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,442
a psychological illness is hard to treat.

529
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,980
You still shouldn't drink all the time.

530
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,550
What?

531
00:41:25,142 --> 00:41:26,905
Are you here to reprimand me?

532
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,282
I dare not.

533
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,202
What I'm saying is

534
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:37,562
this place is too bright.

535
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:39,082
It's dazzling.

536
00:41:39,376 --> 00:41:40,722
You are the crown prince.

537
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,202
You should behave properly.

538
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:45,860
After all, many people are watching.

539
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,002
I only dare do this in front of you.

540
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:57,042
Even if I'm in the Eastern Palace,

541
00:41:57,929 --> 00:41:59,962
I dare not slack.

542
00:42:03,368 --> 00:42:04,518
Is that true?

543
00:42:07,894 --> 00:42:09,162
It's the same every day.

544
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:11,842
I am extremely cautious.

545
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,882
Did you draw all these?

546
00:42:31,629 --> 00:42:32,779
Why do you have them?

547
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:35,242
- Did you draw them? - I was free.

548
00:42:36,207 --> 00:42:38,087
I was drawing as a form of entertainment.

549
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:40,082
Is it entertaining to not draw the face?

550
00:42:40,612 --> 00:42:43,482
Do you need me to ask you who you drew?

551
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,362
You are the crown prince!

552
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:49,882
I'm wrong.

553
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,842
I will remember Mother's teachings.

554
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,362
I will never draw again.
