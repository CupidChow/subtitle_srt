00:01:25,322 --> 00:01:31,002
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,966
(Episode 8)

3
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,268
Does President Chen intend to retire?

4
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,922
It's not just Chen Ping Ping.

5
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,939
I wish to retire too.

6
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,602
It's time to hand the Overwatch Council

7
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,570
to youngsters like you all.

8
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,362
Your retirement doesn't matter.

9
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,442
However, President Chen cannot retire.

10
00:01:58,606 --> 00:01:59,806
What are you saying?

11
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,640
No one in the Overwatch Council is as important as President Chen.

12
00:02:08,835 --> 00:02:10,282
Do you know that

13
00:02:10,578 --> 00:02:12,162
your trip to Northern Qi

14
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,569
was actually part of Chen Ping Ping's plan?

15
00:02:24,673 --> 00:02:26,882
It's my honor to serve the country.

16
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:31,762
He anticipated you'd say that.

17
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:33,962
Did he ask you to ask me about this?

18
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,340
He has one more question:

19
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:40,838
Would you accept any order he gives?

20
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:42,177
Certainly.

21
00:02:43,407 --> 00:02:47,122
What if his order is for you to stop following orders

22
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:50,473
and live by your own choices?

23
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,159
What does that mean?

24
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,882
Here, help me up.

25
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:05,904
You should spend more time with Fan Xian.

26
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,519
Is there a task?

27
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:08,819
Make friends with him.

28
00:03:13,103 --> 00:03:14,512
Making friends is a task?

29
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,252
You need to learn from him.

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,122
Sometimes, there needs to be a balance between emotion and law.

31
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,162
He's better at doing that than you.

32
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,962
How should I balance them?

33
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,842
Those are two different matters.

34
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,562
It's like when you brought Shen Zhong's sister back to the capital.

35
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,122
I disobeyed orders.

36
00:03:43,782 --> 00:03:45,002
I'm willing to be punished.

37
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:48,402
Forget about whether it's an order or not.

38
00:03:48,649 --> 00:03:50,722
Forget about whether it's right or wrong.

39
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:54,559
Your action showed that you followed your heart.

40
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,962
How can we disregard right and wrong?

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,402
There's no rush.

42
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:04,787
Let's go home first.

43
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:10,802
I'll gradually hand over the tasks in the Fourth Bureau to you.

44
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:13,962
I've been working hard for so many years.

45
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,562
It's time for me to enjoy life.

46
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,162
Sure.

47
00:04:18,635 --> 00:04:19,859
For your sake,

48
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,042
in the future,

49
00:04:21,124 --> 00:04:22,344
I'll try not to deceive His Majesty.

50
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,002
Should I kick you out of the Yan family

51
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:27,882
before I enjoy life?

52
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,722
Is that a task too?

53
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,122
Take it slow.

54
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,299
Lord Yan.

55
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:46,352
Come on.

56
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,962
- You really came.   - Slow down.

57
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:50,762
President Chen wants me

58
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,744
to show you around to help you get familiar with the place.

59
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,045
Give me that.

60
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,539
- Hurry up!   - This place, then.

61
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,940
Thank you very much.

62
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,099
Thank you.

63
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,240
This way, please.

64
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:03,761
Give me a hand.

65
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,082
It's quite lively here.

66
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,962
The First Bureau interacts with all the officials in the capital.

67
00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:15,042
After Zhu Ge's death, this place has become more chaotic.

68
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,842
Come here, right.

69
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,642
Put this here.

70
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,900
Careful.

71
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,960
Come, put it over there.

72
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,402
Put it over there.

73
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:26,223
Come on, let's take a look inside.

74
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:27,442
You go yourself.

75
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:28,722
I'm too lazy to look at them.

76
00:05:30,735 --> 00:05:31,955
There's a good show inside.

77
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,042
I guarantee it'll be lively.

78
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,220
We just walk in, and no one questions us.

79
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,587
Yunmeng Fish?

80
00:06:09,874 --> 00:06:11,171
- You know this?   - It's a fish species

81
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:12,316
exclusive to Great Lake in the south.

82
00:06:12,453 --> 00:06:13,659
It's known for its exquisite taste.

83
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,882
- The south is quite far, right?   - Yes.

84
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:18,597
What about these ice cubes?

85
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:20,873
They were cut from the northern border last year

86
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,929
and preserved until now.

87
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,602
It must be for these fish.

88
00:06:25,138 --> 00:06:27,042
They were transported urgently over 800 miles to the capital.

89
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,439
From the extreme south to the extreme north, spanning 800 miles,

90
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,882
just for a taste of the fresh fish?

91
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,482
What are you three doing?

92
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,082
Qi Nian?

93
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,780
Zhu.

94
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:39,362
Young Master Yan. Chief Inspector.

95
00:06:39,842 --> 00:06:42,962
- You know me?   - Everyone in the Council knows you.

96
00:06:43,108 --> 00:06:44,280
You're usually so busy.

97
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,760
What brings you to the First Bureau today?

98
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:46,922
Zhu.

99
00:06:47,446 --> 00:06:49,482
President Chen made an announcement.

100
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,960
As Chief Inspector, Lord Fan

101
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,682
will temporarily handle the affairs of the First Bureau.

102
00:06:55,698 --> 00:06:57,178
That's great news.

103
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:58,479
I'll go inform everyone.

104
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,722
Tell me.

105
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,780
Zhu, right?

106
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:03,618
Who

107
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:06,202
sent these Yunmeng Fish?

108
00:07:06,763 --> 00:07:07,763
Well...

109
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,562
I just came back from a business trip, so I'm not sure.

110
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,935
Fine. Then I'll ask someone else.

111
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:16,522
Lord Fan, I'll inform everyone to come out to greet you.

112
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:17,896
No need.

113
00:07:18,782 --> 00:07:20,402
I'll greet them myself.

114
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,140
One Bamboo.

115
00:07:38,146 --> 00:07:40,282
- Six Character.   - Green Dragon.

116
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,859
Six Bamboo.

117
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,802
- Two Bamboo.   - One Bamboo.

118
00:07:48,883 --> 00:07:50,274
Come on.

119
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:52,576
- South Wind.   - Eight Bamboo.

120
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:54,610
- So close.   - Four Character.

121
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,499
- Quick!   - Green Dragon.

122
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,759
It's your turn.

123
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:04,109
He's about to Pong.

124
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:05,362
Pong!

125
00:08:13,022 --> 00:08:15,122
Do you all know me?

126
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:18,002
Put them away!

127
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,562
Impressive. It's quite spectacular.

128
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:28,402
The mahjong tiles are made of amber.

129
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:31,282
My Lord, it's fake.

130
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:33,733
I'm fake?

131
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,034
No, My Lord.

132
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,610
The amber is fake. It just looks like it.

133
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:39,838
- Who sent it?   - The Imperial Treasury.

134
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:42,158
They sent a set to each of the Eight Bureau.

135
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,438
My Lord, when we have official duties,

136
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,838
we definitely won't play Mahjong.

137
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,202
It's just been quiet lately.

138
00:08:48,855 --> 00:08:50,075
My Lord,

139
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:52,002
please forgive us.

140
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,922
What about those fish outside?

141
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,682
Who sent them?

142
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,610
What fish?

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,442
Yunmeng Fish, the urgent delivery from 800 miles away.

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,729
I don't know much about it.

145
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,379
Who's in charge here?

146
00:09:18,273 --> 00:09:19,642
You don't know this either?

147
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,940
My Lord,

148
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,162
all the supervisors are on leave.

149
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,739
None of them show up?

150
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:32,610
We haven't had much to do lately.

151
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,300
How come you don't have much to do?

152
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,824
There are quite a few daily files and cases to be reviewed and archived.

153
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,139
Who's handling it?

154
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,842
The registrar in our bureau.

155
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:45,561
He handles all these chores.

156
00:09:46,273 --> 00:09:48,240
- Where is he now?   - He's in the side courtyard.

157
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:49,681
I'll go get him.

158
00:09:49,886 --> 00:09:51,682
No need. I'll go to him myself.

159
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,779
You guys

160
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:56,298
continue playing.

161
00:09:56,526 --> 00:09:57,746
Enjoy yourselves.

162
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,402
By the way, when you're done having fun,

163
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,442
distribute those fish outside among yourselves.

164
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,010
If they are left outside for too long, they will spoil.

165
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:15,929
Stay put.

166
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,449
Are you really going to keep playing?

167
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,329
- What should we do?   - I don't know.

168
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,220
Anyone here?

169
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,920
Qi Nian.

170
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:53,055
Zi Yue.

171
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:00,962
Registrar of the Overwatch Council, Deng Zi Yue,

172
00:11:01,134 --> 00:11:02,602
at your service, My Lord.

173
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,252
You know him?

174
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,779
An old acquaintance.

175
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,820
Deng Zi Yue.

176
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:13,238
Yes, I am.

177
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:14,402
Do you know me?

178
00:11:15,337 --> 00:11:16,557
We've never met.

179
00:11:16,638 --> 00:11:17,718
Then why are you kneeling?

180
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,959
My Lord,

181
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,920
everyone in the Overwatch Council knows that

182
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:23,642
Lord Wang Qi Nian is always by your side.

183
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,722
Besides, judging from your exceptional demeanor,

184
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,837
your stunning appearance, and your commanding presence,

185
00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:32,768
if I couldn't tell your identity, I'd be blind.

186
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,040
Young Master Yan.

187
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,362
All right, Zi Yue.

188
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,959
Lord Fan will take charge of the First Bureau for the time being.

189
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:43,002
- Really?   - Yes.

190
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,540
My goodness!

191
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,000
That's fantastic news. Right?

192
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,360
If Lord Fan can come to the First Bureau...

193
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,170
If you oversee the First Bureau,

194
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,499
then...

195
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:56,842
The First Bureau will finally have a mainstay.

196
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:58,242
I feel as though

197
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,520
I've found an oasis in the desert,

198
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,160
or met an old friend in a faraway place.

199
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:04,378
All right, enough with the pleasantries.

200
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:05,762
He's just like you.

201
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,460
My old acquaintance.

202
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:10,416
Deng Zi Yue, stand up.

203
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:11,682
Zi Yue, get up.

204
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,640
Thank you, Lord Fan.

205
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,242
Lord Fan is different from others.

206
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,770
Tell me, who sent those Yunmeng Fish outside?

207
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,762
(Registrar of the First Bureau, Deng Zi Yue)

208
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,242
Don't tell me you don't know.

209
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,019
Just tell him.

210
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,820
My Lord,

211
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,561
they were sent jointly by the Vegetable Inspection Office

212
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:41,242
and Ministry of War.

213
00:12:41,797 --> 00:12:44,448
Even the Ministry of War is involved in this basket of fish?

214
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
Only the Ministry of War could rush fresh Yunmeng Fish

215
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:50,920
to the capital from 800 miles away.

216
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:53,165
What about the Vegetable Inspection Office?

217
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:55,617
These fish are usually first sent to the Vegetable Inspection Office,

218
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:57,618
sorted by quality,

219
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:59,551
and then distributed to the inner courtyard of the imperial palace

220
00:12:59,632 --> 00:13:02,678
and the six ministries residences.

221
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,202
The Vegetable Inspection Office and Ministry of War will keep a portion

222
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,082
and send some here.

223
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,595
- You all ate the fish?   - These fish are precious.

224
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,040
Thus, some ate them, some sold them.

225
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,386
Where were they sold?

226
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,442
To the Vegetable Inspection Office.

227
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:28,018
Great.

228
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:30,640
The fish were delivered by the Vegetable Inspection Office

229
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,170
and then sold back to them.

230
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,890
What an easy deal.

231
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:37,602
It must be a profitable trade.

232
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,209
Perhaps

233
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:44,235
they didn't want to waste them.

234
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,770
Why do the Vegetable Inspection Office and Ministry of War send us gifts?

235
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,442
Just tell the truth.

236
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:03,482
Is there anyone else in the room?

237
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:06,607
No.

238
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:08,106
Then say just it.

239
00:14:14,301 --> 00:14:15,521
My Lord,

240
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,770
it's not just the Vegetable Inspection Office.

241
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,969
The other six ministries also send gifts.

242
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:22,802
Are we so popular?

243
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,770
You see, we're the First Bureau.

244
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:29,879
Our job is to monitor all the officials in the capital.

245
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:32,391
Naturally, no one wants to offend us.

246
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:35,336
So, they send the First Bureau gifts to stay on our good side.

247
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,520
And you dare accept these gifts.

248
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:38,880
No, he...

249
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:41,153
The one monitoring

250
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,250
are accepting gifts from those being monitored.

251
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,019
How absurd.

252
00:14:46,111 --> 00:14:48,521
Young Master Yan, please calm down.

253
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,202
If you want to talk about them,

254
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,410
it's not like they have a choice but to accept the gifts.

255
00:14:55,535 --> 00:14:58,386
So this absurdity actually makes some sense.

256
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,273
How can they not have a choice?

257
00:15:01,716 --> 00:15:02,802
You see,

258
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,640
we're all officials.

259
00:15:04,743 --> 00:15:09,072
Everyone is living here in the capital.

260
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,319
I think you understand

261
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,280
how complex the connections between the officials in the capital are.

262
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,918
It's like a dense cobwebs.

263
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:17,259
We're not just talking about major matters.

264
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,520
Even in trivial matters about basic necessities, food, and clothing,

265
00:15:20,623 --> 00:15:22,712
you can't avoid these connections.

266
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,922
If you don't accept the gifts,

267
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,931
it shows you're unwilling to be in cahoots with them.

268
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,322
In the future, I'm afraid it will be difficult to get anything done.

269
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,250
You seem to have a clear understanding of the realities

270
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,402
of being an official, Registrar Deng.

271
00:15:39,496 --> 00:15:40,800
There are numerous cases in the First Bureau.

272
00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:42,722
Have you been handling them recently?

273
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,802
I've always been handling them.

274
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:48,162
Okay.

275
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:50,842
Please take care of the First Bureau.

276
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,762
Lord Fan, I am just the registrar.

277
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,360
There are many supervisors above me.

278
00:15:57,471 --> 00:15:58,691
There are no more supervisors.

279
00:16:04,106 --> 00:16:05,326
From today onward,

280
00:16:05,968 --> 00:16:07,441
Wang Qi Nian and Deng Zi Yue

281
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:11,049
shall assist me in handling all matters in the First Bureau.

282
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:14,519
My Lord, what about the remaining supervisors?

283
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:16,965
Those who aren't here today won't be needed in the future.

284
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,439
I'll inform the Overwatch Council to assign them elsewhere.

285
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:20,769
Hurry up.

286
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:22,246
Hurry up.

287
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,329
Listen to this,

288
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,969
I, Fan Xian,

289
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,442
the chief inspector of the Overwatch Council, takes over the First Bureau.

290
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:31,979
I'm not the main point.

291
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,770
The main point is this person.

292
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,979
Yan Bing Yun.

293
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,336
He returned from Northern Qi.

294
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,220
You can imagine how cruel and ruthless he is, right?

295
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:45,755
In other words,

296
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,078
does he look like someone who will show respect?

297
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:53,691
Look at his eyes,

298
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,099
he's bloodthirsty.

299
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,851
What does his presence here mean?

300
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:00,898
It means he is willing to live and die with me.

301
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,842
He's such a ruthless person,

302
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:07,737
there's nothing he can't do.

303
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:12,769
- Do you understand?   - We understand.

304
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,442
- We understand.   - We understand.

305
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,600
We understand.

306
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:18,214
I repeat, starting from today,

307
00:17:18,295 --> 00:17:20,320
all previous supervisors of the First Bureau are dismissed.

308
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,825
Wang Qi Nian and Deng Zi Yue are my right-hand men.

309
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,999
Everyone, I'm done.

310
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,682
Who agrees and who opposes?

311
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,801
Supervisor Wang, Supervisor Deng.

312
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,810
Thank you.

313
00:17:34,031 --> 00:17:36,841
In the future, let's support each other.

314
00:17:41,222 --> 00:17:43,142
Be more gracious. They're calling you supervisors now.

315
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:45,560
Yes. Let's help each other out.

316
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:47,759
I will certainly do my best.

317
00:17:47,862 --> 00:17:49,082
I will do my best at work.

318
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,810
Let me ask one more question,

319
00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:54,166
do you all still remember

320
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:56,336
the oath you took when joining the Overwatch Council?

321
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,920
What is the first sentence?

322
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,962
"Everything for the sake of the Qing Kingdom."

323
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,310
You said it, but it has turned into everything for the sake of living.

324
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,410
Have you all forgotten the oath?

325
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:16,320
We didn't forget.

326
00:18:16,455 --> 00:18:17,922
What is the purpose of the First Bureau?

327
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,482
What is the purpose of the Overwatch Council?

328
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,330
To ensure clean governance and protect the peace of the people.

329
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:27,362
Have you fed your original intentions to the dogs?

330
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,209
I don't care how you lived before.

331
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:35,512
From today on,

332
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,238
you are not allowed to live like that.

333
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:39,442
No more accepting gifts.

334
00:18:39,813 --> 00:18:41,162
I know what you're going to say.

335
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,050
Not accepting gifts will make life difficult in the capital, right?

336
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:48,890
Life is always difficult.

337
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,359
Look at the people on the streets.

338
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:52,882
Look at those people.

339
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,722
They don't complain about difficulty! Do you have the face to complain?

340
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,940
But don't worry, everyone.

341
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,660
I am actually

342
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:06,146
easy to get along with.

343
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,900
Just be careful

344
00:19:09,663 --> 00:19:12,722
not to make any mistakes and get caught by Young Master Yan.

345
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:14,557
That would be truly miserable.

346
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:17,768
The First Bureau is not within my jurisdiction.

347
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:19,008
We're from the Overwatch Council.

348
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:20,529
Everything is for the sake of the Qing Kingdom.

349
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,122
All right, I've said enough.

350
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,439
It's time to do some work.

351
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:26,682
Deng Zi Yue.

352
00:19:27,657 --> 00:19:30,482
My Lord, what task should I handle?

353
00:19:31,894 --> 00:19:33,665
I saw the fish at the door.

354
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:36,002
I don't think they're fresh.

355
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,482
The fish aren't fresh?

356
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,386
What does it mean if the fish delivered aren't fresh?

357
00:19:43,342 --> 00:19:46,792
It means the Vegetable Inspection Office looks down on the First Bureau.

358
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,242
Who can tolerate that?

359
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:50,002
- Deng Zi Yue.   - Yes, My Lord.

360
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,362
Close down the Vegetable Inspection Office immediately!

361
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,202
My Lord.

362
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,170
My Lord, please understand that

363
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,577
Eunuch Dai from the Vegetable Inspection Office

364
00:19:57,658 --> 00:19:58,982
is favored by Noble Consort Shu.

365
00:19:59,063 --> 00:20:00,402
I know, Li Cheng Ze's mother.

366
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:01,759
She likes reading. I've met her.

367
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,880
My Lord, should we reconsider?

368
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,960
What are you afraid of?

369
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,522
Do as I say and seal up the place.

370
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,042
Even if we were to close it down, what's the charge?

371
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,840
There are so many files here,

372
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,042
has the Vegetable Inspection Office never made any mistakes?

373
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,562
If you put it that way, of course they did.

374
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:17,785
What are you waiting for? Take your men and seal the place.

375
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:20,475
My Lord, I'm new here. I can't convince them.

376
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:23,202
And my position isn't enough to suppress the Vegetable Inspection Office.

377
00:20:24,094 --> 00:20:26,682
Then shall we trouble Young Master Yan to lead the team?

378
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:28,511
The First Bureau's task is none of my business.

379
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
We're all part of the Overwatch Council serving the kingdom.

380
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,602
Thank you, Young Master Yan.

381
00:20:33,476 --> 00:20:35,646
If I lead the team to seal the Vegetable Inspection Office,

382
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,122
what will you do?

383
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,600
Invite people.

384
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:42,385
The stage is set. We need an audience for the show, right?

385
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:45,258
Who are you inviting?

386
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,762
The Great Immortal!

387
00:20:50,277 --> 00:20:53,042
- Fan Xian, you're here.   - Slow down, don't fall.

388
00:20:54,405 --> 00:20:55,802
Quick Sword has also returned.

389
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:04,402
I told you, this person is too cold and rude.

390
00:21:04,795 --> 00:21:06,278
Naturally, he can't compare to Your Highness.

391
00:21:06,381 --> 00:21:07,682
I have to scold you too.

392
00:21:07,774 --> 00:21:10,642
You've been in the capital for some time, and this is your first visit.

393
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:12,682
Yes, it is indeed my fault.

394
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,762
I've come to visit you personally

395
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:19,522
and apologize.

396
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,400
What is this?

397
00:21:21,522 --> 00:21:22,969
Have you heard of Yunmeng Fish?

398
00:21:24,223 --> 00:21:25,443
Yunmeng Fish?

399
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,959
They are known for being fresh.

400
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:28,362
Let's have a few drinks first.

401
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,087
I'll have someone steam the Yunmeng...

402
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:32,642
Where's the fish?

403
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,202
I've searched the whole city, and there's no fish.

404
00:21:44,322 --> 00:21:46,640
I appreciate the thought. You came all the way to send a bucket of water.

405
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,279
The sentiment is what matters most.

406
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,482
Is that so?

407
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:52,906
I'll give it to you then.

408
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,700
Bi An.

409
00:22:00,414 --> 00:22:01,562
Clean it up.

410
00:22:03,078 --> 00:22:04,559
But I know where you can find the fish.

411
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,719
So?

412
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,279
So, let's go fishing.

413
00:22:07,405 --> 00:22:09,320
You're asking me to go fishing with you?

414
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:10,635
Your Highness, are you busy?

415
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,100
I told you,

416
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,522
the most interesting person in the capital

417
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:17,689
is you.

418
00:22:17,821 --> 00:22:19,041
I agree.

419
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,410
I've always said,

420
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:49,834
you can neglect the other offices in the capital,

421
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,362
but you must serve the Overwatch Council well.

422
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:58,962
Have I ever said that?

423
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,679
Have I?

424
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:02,042
You've said that.

425
00:23:02,198 --> 00:23:04,317
Eunuch Dai, we dare not slack off.

426
00:23:04,398 --> 00:23:06,328
We've been sending gifts regularly,

427
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,370
and today we even sent Yunmeng Fish.

428
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,282
Then why are they sealing us up?

429
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,850
We don't know.

430
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,442
Which supervisor came?

431
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:20,682
None of them came. The leader said his surname is Deng.

432
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,059
He's a registrar.

433
00:23:28,801 --> 00:23:30,362
Get up.

434
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:44,082
What are the charges?

435
00:23:44,444 --> 00:23:46,802
Just some petty embezzlement.

436
00:23:46,985 --> 00:23:48,642
That's not even a crime.

437
00:23:50,326 --> 00:23:52,122
They're just here to extort us.

438
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,402
Should you go see for yourself?

439
00:23:58,056 --> 00:24:00,802
A mere registrar? He's not worthy of my presence.

440
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,489
The Overwatch Council is influential in the capital,

441
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:09,242
but who gives them the power?

442
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,449
It comes from the palace.

443
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:14,922
If you don't go, it will stay sealed.

444
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:16,442
How should we handle this?

445
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,722
Let them seal it as long as they want.

446
00:24:27,581 --> 00:24:30,530
Tell the Imperial Kitchen later that

447
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:34,362
the palace's vegetable supply is reduced,

448
00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:38,802
especially the greens favored by some concubines

449
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:40,842
are gone.

450
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,642
How can we do that?

451
00:24:45,804 --> 00:24:48,534
If the higher ups ask,

452
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:52,282
just say the First Bureau exercised their authority

453
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,922
and cut off the palace's food supply.

454
00:24:55,366 --> 00:25:00,242
We at the Vegetable Inspection Office are powerless to resist.

455
00:25:00,439 --> 00:25:03,682
Should we reduce the supply to His Majesty too?

456
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:07,682
How many years have you been in the palace?

457
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,162
How can you ask that question!

458
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,900
I apologize for my mistake.

459
00:25:19,838 --> 00:25:21,288
Eunuch Dai.

460
00:25:21,456 --> 00:25:22,962
What now?

461
00:25:23,983 --> 00:25:27,482
Lord Fan Xian is on the way to the Vegetable Inspection Office.

462
00:25:28,856 --> 00:25:30,602
Come forward to speak.

463
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,762
Lord Fan Xian is already at the Vegetable Inspection Office.

464
00:25:40,397 --> 00:25:42,488
How did you provoke Fan Xian?

465
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:45,489
Eunuch Dai knows what to do.

466
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,860
You may excuse yourself.

467
00:25:47,374 --> 00:25:48,784
Eunuch Dai should go.

468
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:53,196
How dare you! Who are you to tell Eunuch Dai what to do?

469
00:25:53,277 --> 00:25:54,497
Wait.

470
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,050
Why should I go?

471
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,423
Eunuch Dai,

472
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:00,265
Fan Xian isn't alone in the Vegetable Inspection Office.

473
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:01,802
Prince Cheng Ze is with him.

474
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,080
Who are you talking about?

475
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,380
Prince Cheng Ze.

476
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,479
Eunuch Dai, please calm down.

477
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,921
I asked a few more questions.

478
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,120
Although His Highness is there,

479
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,779
he's only watching and isn't angry.

480
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,449
It's likely not a big issue.

481
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,499
That's good.

482
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,320
The Vegetable Inspection Office relies on Noble Consort Shu.

483
00:26:28,437 --> 00:26:29,880
Since Prince Cheng Ze is there,

484
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,585
you should also show up

485
00:26:31,684 --> 00:26:33,923
to avoid appearing neglectful toward His Highness.

486
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,729
That makes sense.

487
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,900
I have to go.

488
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,882
What is your name?

489
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,040
Eunuch Dai, I'm Hong Zhu.

490
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,360
New here?

491
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,082
I've been in the palace for a few years.

492
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,710
Okay.

493
00:27:00,903 --> 00:27:02,393
You're sharp.

494
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,842
You should all learn from him.

495
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,460
Yes, Eunuch Dai.

496
00:27:24,062 --> 00:27:25,282
Come with me.

497
00:27:25,406 --> 00:27:27,617
Eunuch Dai, I won't be going.

498
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,132
How dare you!

499
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,962
How dare you disobey Eunuch Dai's orders!

500
00:27:31,168 --> 00:27:32,388
Step aside.

501
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,802
Why are you defying my order?

502
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:43,649
Someone has to guard the palace.

503
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,042
If something goes wrong at the Vegetable Inspection Office,

504
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:48,245
- someone has to respond to it.   - How to respond to it?

505
00:27:48,326 --> 00:27:50,615
By seeking help from Noble Consort Shu.

506
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,339
You stay.

507
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,860
Eunuch Dai, don't worry.

508
00:27:59,727 --> 00:28:01,242
The rest of you, don't follow me.

509
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,019
Yes, Eunuch Dai.

510
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,739
Eunuch Hong.

511
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:16,359
I have a matter I need your advice on.

512
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,320
With all the seniors here, I dare not give any advice.

513
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,560
Please, go ahead.

514
00:28:20,663 --> 00:28:23,032
Should we still reduce the vegetable supply to the Imperial Kitchen?

515
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,242
Since Eunuch Dai is going over,

516
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,842
there might be a chance to resolve this.

517
00:28:31,016 --> 00:28:33,827
At this time, as his subordinates,

518
00:28:34,023 --> 00:28:35,442
we should seek less trouble

519
00:28:35,742 --> 00:28:37,192
to find more opportunities for survival.

520
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,442
Eunuch Hong, you're right.

521
00:28:40,147 --> 00:28:42,880
Don't do anything. We only have one word to remember: wait.

522
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,180
Yes, that's right.

523
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,282
Zi Yue.

524
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,802
Go check if he's arrived.

525
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,042
Yes, My Lord.

526
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,299
Mr. Wang, wait a moment.

527
00:29:46,021 --> 00:29:48,198
We mustn't delay. Everyone is waiting inside.

528
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,479
- Indeed.   - What are you doing?

529
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,780
Just a moment.

530
00:29:52,312 --> 00:29:55,762
I've long heard that you are a wise and brave man,

531
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:58,602
but I've never had the chance to meet you.

532
00:30:01,405 --> 00:30:02,625
What are you doing?

533
00:30:06,335 --> 00:30:11,242
I heard that you are favored by Lord Fan.

534
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:14,322
So what outcome does Lord Fan want

535
00:30:15,661 --> 00:30:18,152
from this situation today?

536
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,249
Eunuch Dai, you have long been sending fish to the First Bureau.

537
00:30:25,462 --> 00:30:26,713
I appreciate

538
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,900
the affection.

539
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,642
It's just a small gesture.

540
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:35,215
But our Lord Fan didn't get to eat your fish yet.

541
00:30:35,303 --> 00:30:37,743
Lord Fan has just arrived at the First Bureau.

542
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,442
Don't worry, I've prepared everything.

543
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,282
All right, let's go inside.

544
00:30:43,437 --> 00:30:44,802
Wait a minute.

545
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,922
There's another matter.

546
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,682
There's another matter.

547
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,449
Why is Prince Cheng Ze also here?

548
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,322
There's another matter?

549
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,703
With Prince Cheng Ze here, it'll be easier to handle this matter, right?

550
00:31:05,825 --> 00:31:08,522
After all, we all serve in the capital.

551
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,170
We must always abide by the rules.

552
00:31:12,897 --> 00:31:14,602
I understand.

553
00:31:15,781 --> 00:31:17,001
- Let's go.   - Please lead the way.

554
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:21,202
Lord Fan asked me to check if you've arrived.

555
00:31:21,283 --> 00:31:22,503
I'm here.

556
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,282
Everyone here gets a share.

557
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,562
Let's make money

558
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:37,259
and spend it together.

559
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:55,090
Greetings, Your Highness.

560
00:31:56,872 --> 00:31:58,092
Rise.

561
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,630
Thank you, Your Highness.

562
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,209
I heard you have Yunmeng Fish here.

563
00:32:03,926 --> 00:32:04,966
Yes.

564
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:06,267
I'd like to buy two.

565
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,162
Your Highness must be joking.

566
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,810
I'll have them sent to Your Highness' residence later.

567
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,160
You're on official duty.

568
00:32:12,286 --> 00:32:13,602
You must charge for it.

569
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,410
As a prince, I cannot misuse my position for personal gain.

570
00:32:16,526 --> 00:32:18,736
Do you understand this principle?

571
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,729
Yes, Your Highness.

572
00:32:21,247 --> 00:32:22,776
I was confused.

573
00:32:23,265 --> 00:32:24,306
Bi An.

574
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,600
Pay him the money.

575
00:32:25,734 --> 00:32:26,954
That's not necessary.

576
00:32:30,654 --> 00:32:32,217
I will treat Your Highness to the fish.

577
00:32:33,503 --> 00:32:35,243
- No.   - I'll pay for it.

578
00:32:36,806 --> 00:32:38,682
- No, this...   - Record this in the accounts.

579
00:32:40,242 --> 00:32:42,204
- I'll record it into the accounts later.   - No, do it now.

580
00:32:42,285 --> 00:32:43,445
We have a brush and paper here.

581
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:44,808
Record it immediately.

582
00:32:44,977 --> 00:32:46,197
Okay.

583
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:50,269
Okay.

584
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,002
Don't record it in that book.

585
00:32:53,207 --> 00:32:54,427
Write it down in this book.

586
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,800
Eunuch Dai, do you know Old Man Jin?

587
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,273
- Who?   - Old Man Jin.

588
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,633
He's a vegetable seller who owes a lot of debt.

589
00:33:12,806 --> 00:33:14,336
I think...

590
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:17,922
- Can't quite recall?   - I can't quite recall.

591
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,722
If Old Man Jin is related to you, I can write off all his debt.

592
00:33:27,781 --> 00:33:29,344
No need. It's settled.

593
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:30,762
That's good.

594
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,279
Eunuch Dai, your calligraphy is quite decent.

595
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,722
You're flattering me.

596
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:43,473
It matches the previous records perfectly.

597
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:46,489
So you personally record these accounts?

598
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,842
I'm bearing His Majesty's grace,

599
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:50,602
I dare not slack off.

600
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,560
If I found any discrepancies in the accounts,

601
00:33:53,647 --> 00:33:54,867
I'll have to ask you then.

602
00:33:56,726 --> 00:33:58,879
The Vegetable Inspection Office

603
00:33:59,461 --> 00:34:01,320
handles miscellaneous tasks for the palace.

604
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:03,320
The records can be quite intricate.

605
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,420
If you find them confusing, I can clarify them for you.

606
00:34:06,585 --> 00:34:07,805
Intricate?

607
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,642
It's not about the minutiae,

608
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,610
it's about the big picture.

609
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,200
The Vegetable Inspection Office merely buys some vegetables.

610
00:34:24,303 --> 00:34:25,792
What big picture could there be?

611
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,482
Eunuch Dai, do eunuchs bear some responsibility in the fate of the nation?

612
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,600
I think we do.

613
00:34:35,694 --> 00:34:37,882
The Qing Kingdom just emerged victorious from a battle against Northern Qi,

614
00:34:38,002 --> 00:34:39,962
thanks to the valor of our border troops.

615
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:42,402
Shouldn't the Vegetable Inspection Office show some appreciation?

616
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,970
The border troops' provisions are not under our purview.

617
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,980
Big picture.

618
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,339
Think bigger.

619
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,042
What do you mean?

620
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,615
- Is the Vegetable Inspection Office a part of the Qing Kingdom?   - Yes.

621
00:34:55,696 --> 00:34:59,002
- Isn't the victory in battle an honor for all?   - Yes.

622
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:01,999
- The war against the Northern Qi cost us a hefty sum, didn't it?   - Yes.

623
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:04,602
With this war settled, our court is facing a shortage of funds.

624
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,282
- Is that the case?   - Yes.

625
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,039
- Should we stand together in this challenging time?   - Yes.

626
00:35:10,134 --> 00:35:12,322
- Should the Vegetable Inspection Office take some responsibility?   - Yes.

627
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,802
What should I be responsible for?

628
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,882
Our national treasury is depleted,

629
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,402
and there's a shortage of money everywhere.

630
00:35:25,649 --> 00:35:27,091
Instead of helping the kingdom alleviate its worries,

631
00:35:27,172 --> 00:35:30,572
the Vegetable Inspection Office is finding ways to embezzle funds.

632
00:35:30,653 --> 00:35:33,922
- Is this acceptable?   - No, that's absolutely not true!

633
00:35:34,003 --> 00:35:36,158
I've always been an honest person.

634
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,880
The sight of money makes me uncomfortable.

635
00:35:37,991 --> 00:35:39,920
You must be mistaken, My Lord.

636
00:35:40,158 --> 00:35:41,378
Honest?

637
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:44,784
You must've heard about

638
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:47,478
- the Overwatch Council, right?   - Your reputation precedes you.

639
00:35:47,582 --> 00:35:50,482
I bet you've also heard about how we handle cases.

640
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,642
You know if you've embezzled or not.

641
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:54,642
If these accounts are investigated,

642
00:35:55,432 --> 00:35:56,802
what will be the outcome?

643
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:04,602
We are all short of money, Eunuch Dai.

644
00:36:06,151 --> 00:36:09,201
Can't the Vegetable Inspection Office take responsibility

645
00:36:09,614 --> 00:36:11,122
and share the burden?

646
00:36:21,342 --> 00:36:24,951
Lord Fan, can we go to the back and talk?

647
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,042
It's okay, we all work together here.

648
00:36:29,448 --> 00:36:30,962
We all work together.

649
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:42,482
Regarding the accounts,

650
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,242
there are some additional details here.

651
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,479
If you don't understand,

652
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,162
you can review them at your leisure.

653
00:36:55,685 --> 00:36:58,536
One thousand, two thousand,

654
00:37:00,101 --> 00:37:01,442
three thousand taels.

655
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:07,602
Three thousand taels.

656
00:37:07,857 --> 00:37:09,077
Fair enough.

657
00:37:10,802 --> 00:37:12,414
As I was saying, it's not easy for the Vegetable Inspection Office

658
00:37:12,518 --> 00:37:14,362
to manage the daily vegetable purchases.

659
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,209
It's my duty to do so.

660
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:19,922
We all serve the same imperial court.

661
00:37:20,181 --> 00:37:21,842
I can't be too overbearing.

662
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,282
- We must be kind to one another.   - Indeed.

663
00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:28,602
Lord Fan, you truly understand the ways of an official.

664
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,650
It seems that Vegetable Inspection Office has no major issues.

665
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,322
- I was too hasty.   - No.

666
00:37:35,465 --> 00:37:37,642
It's right to investigate.

667
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:40,873
- I'm glad we've clarified the misunderstandings.   - Zi Yue.

668
00:37:41,794 --> 00:37:43,014
Dismiss the troops.

669
00:37:44,537 --> 00:37:45,757
Dismiss.

670
00:37:54,046 --> 00:37:56,305
Nothing fun to see here. You should go home.

671
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,522
Don't forget about His Highness' fish.

672
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:05,055
I will have it delivered to Your Highness' residence.

673
00:38:05,172 --> 00:38:07,160
Your Highness, should I have someone escort you back to your residence?

674
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,559
No need. See you around.

675
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:09,882
Sure.

676
00:38:11,157 --> 00:38:13,457
We should get together again. I'll wait for your message.

677
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,357
Here's the fruit money I owed you for the past six months.

678
00:38:38,438 --> 00:38:41,295
- Thank you. You remembered?   - I should remember it and pay you back.

679
00:38:42,265 --> 00:38:44,345
- The fruit is fresh today. Get some more.   - Okay.

680
00:38:44,426 --> 00:38:45,646
You pick.

681
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,379
This one is redder.

682
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:50,322
- You see.   - This one is redder.

683
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,682
These will do.

684
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:53,522
Do you know what you are doing?

685
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:57,329
Taking bribes.

686
00:38:58,198 --> 00:39:00,938
I will definitely report you for this.

687
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,320
One person isn't enough.

688
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:03,937
Get a few more to report me together.

689
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:05,930
What nonsense is this?

690
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,220
My Lord, have a pear.

691
00:39:12,807 --> 00:39:14,178
- Have a pear.   - No.

692
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,369
Which department

693
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:22,362
handles impeachment?

694
00:39:25,151 --> 00:39:26,882
Besides the Overwatch Council,

695
00:39:27,758 --> 00:39:29,082
it's the Censorate.

696
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,362
The Censorate.

697
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,402
The Censors.

698
00:39:36,008 --> 00:39:37,682
Are you close with him?

699
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:39,962
What are you planning?

700
00:39:40,148 --> 00:39:42,872
I told you, find more people to report me.

701
00:39:42,953 --> 00:39:45,642
Thank you for your hard work. Please spread this news.

702
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:50,522
Others set traps for their political enemies.

703
00:39:50,878 --> 00:39:53,337
But you dig your own grave.

704
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,039
Thanks.

705
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,642
If you fall, no one can save you.

706
00:40:08,601 --> 00:40:10,442
Give this, along with the ledger,

707
00:40:10,523 --> 00:40:13,682
archive, and all records to President Chen.

708
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:15,615
Yes, My Lord.

709
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,680
And this.

710
00:40:17,776 --> 00:40:19,955
As you expected, it's from Eunuch Dai.

711
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:23,800
Record everything.

712
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,100
Yes, My Lord.

713
00:40:28,645 --> 00:40:31,362
(Moon Embracing Pavilion)

714
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,634
Eunuch Dai doesn't remember Old Man Jin.

715
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,970
No one remembers him.

716
00:41:58,942 --> 00:42:00,831
Actually, I haven't seen him much either,

717
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:02,859
but for some reason,

718
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:04,739
I can't forget him.

719
00:42:09,303 --> 00:42:10,362
Qi Nian.

720
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,889
If no one stands up,

721
00:42:13,117 --> 00:42:14,688
people like them

722
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,249
will have to endure and suffer their entire lives.

723
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,329
But who can stand up?

724
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,329
Who can show them what true justice is?

725
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,362
If no one ever sees justice in action,

726
00:42:32,201 --> 00:42:33,722
who will still believe in it?

727
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:37,442
Do you think

728
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,242
I'm being overdramatic?

729
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,540
