(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:34,122
(Episode 25)

3
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,002
Ling Er?

4
00:01:38,896 --> 00:01:40,058
Ling Er?

5
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,482
Ling Er, where are you?

6
00:01:58,775 --> 00:02:00,260
Has she left already?

7
00:02:11,127 --> 00:02:12,743
I sent my men to inquire about it from your residence.

8
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:14,117
They said you loved perilla soup.

9
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,776
That's why I told them to learn the recipe.

10
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,080
How's the taste?

11
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,630
The Ye family is in charge of the capital's defense.

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,519
They'll find you eventually if I vanish for no reason.

13
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,910
You didn't vanish.

14
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,223
You left the capital due to an emergency.

15
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:27,716
You even left behind a letter.

16
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,439
What letter?

17
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,800
You imitated my handwriting?

18
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,960
Take it away.

19
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,389
Why did you capture me?

20
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,615
I'm worried that you might see Wan Er by yourself

21
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:58,590
and tell her that Lin Gong's death was related to Fan Xian.

22
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,389
You mustn't be impulsive.

23
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,046
You shouldn't do that if you consider yourself as her friend.

24
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,351
How can they get married if you tell her that beforehand?

25
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,109
You do make it sound nice.

26
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,880
You just want to expose him during their wedding.

27
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,240
Do you not trust me at all?

28
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:13,656
What do you think?

29
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:20,642
Don't you think this silk ribbon is too long?

30
00:03:20,723 --> 00:03:22,721
- Yeah. - I think it looks good.

31
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,332
I think it's a first-class top-grade ribbon.

32
00:03:24,356 --> 00:03:25,385
First-class top-grade?

33
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:27,840
- What do you think? - I think it looks fine.

34
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,019
- Who asked you that? - What are you doing here?

35
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,159
He's looking for me.

36
00:03:32,317 --> 00:03:33,357
He's looking for me.

37
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:34,734
- Don't leave yet. - I'm in no rush.

38
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:36,038
You can continue.

39
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,322
Finish it quickly and come back.

40
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,816
Tell me. What's the matter?

41
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,936
- Father told me to call for you. - I'll find him now.

42
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,056
It's fine. There's no rush. Your affair is more important.

43
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,360
But I'm in a rush.

44
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,359
Father.

45
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:52,639
Father.

46
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,221
Were you looking for me?

47
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,039
It does fit you perfectly.

48
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,000
Really? I'll take this, then.

49
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:14,963
No. I didn't say that.

50
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,390
My words don't count here.

51
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,790
I can't take it anymore.

52
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,482
When will the preparation end?

53
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:24,602
It's a major event. We have to be well prepared.

54
00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:28,600
But all of them look almost the same.

55
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,122
What's the difference?

56
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,069
I do agree with that.

57
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,759
Did you do the same back then?

58
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:38,493
I tried out more clothing than you.

59
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,270
How did you pull through, then?

60
00:04:42,446 --> 00:04:44,116
I endured it.

61
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:55,100
Why are you sighing too?

62
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,960
I was thinking

63
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:01,605
that ordinary folks have no chance to try out as much clothing as you.

64
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:04,756
The thing that frustrates you actually makes other people happy.

65
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,359
Was I wrong?

66
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,600
That's not it.

67
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:14,429
Are you sure you're Fan Si Zhe?

68
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,520
Could Fan Si Zhe even utter such brilliant words?

69
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,280
I've witnessed too much from my trip to Northern Qi.

70
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,351
Although the Qing Kingdom is considered a strong state,

71
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,174
many of the people are still starving.

72
00:05:27,302 --> 00:05:28,582
So?

73
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,960
So,

74
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:33,193
I have to make more money.

75
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,442
The more money I earn, the more shops I can open.

76
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,415
It's best if I can open shops all over the world.

77
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,799
Qing, Northern Qi,

78
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:43,720
even Dongyi City, I'll open shops everywhere.

79
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:46,415
With all the shops I open, there'll be plenty of job opportunities.

80
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,920
I'm not thinking too far ahead.

81
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:50,157
I just hope that everyone can make a living.

82
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,719
That's right.

83
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,669
Earning money shouldn't be our only goal in life.

84
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:58,101
You're actually thinking of that.

85
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,002
I guess you've grown up as well.

86
00:06:04,838 --> 00:06:06,079
Fan Xian,

87
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:09,157
I called you here because there's something you need to decide.

88
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:12,880
Your wedding has alerted the entire capital.

89
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:14,716
Firstly, you're known as the poetic genius.

90
00:06:14,797 --> 00:06:17,280
Secondly, you'll take over the Imperial Treasury.

91
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,260
Thirdly, His Majesty granted the marriage to you personally.

92
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,869
Right now, all officials are waiting for their turn to congratulate you.

93
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,960
Our residence isn't that spacious.

94
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,061
We can't invite all of them here.

95
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,830
What do you think about

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,280
the wedding guest name list?

97
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,799
I'll give you a reminder.

98
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,549
Inviting them is easy,

99
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,989
but it's hard to choose who not to invite.

100
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:43,316
Those who weren't invited might take it to heart.

101
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,509
Who knows when they'll turn against you?

102
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,440
Xian.

103
00:06:53,662 --> 00:06:55,733
Why don't we turn it into an auction?

104
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:06,841
So, it's inappropriate no matter who I invite, huh?

105
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,444
That's the case.

106
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,629
If so, I won't invite anyone.

107
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:15,293
It's a wedding. We have to hold a banquet.

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,360
We'll hold a family banquet, then.

109
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,239
A family banquet?

110
00:07:19,342 --> 00:07:20,622
A family banquet?

111
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,439
Look at it.

112
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,109
The carriage is here.

113
00:07:27,638 --> 00:07:28,918
It's gorgeous.

114
00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:31,745
What a beautiful carriage.

115
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,482
The flower carriage is here.

116
00:07:33,563 --> 00:07:35,834
The flower carriage is so beautiful.

117
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,242
The flower carriage is here!

118
00:07:38,328 --> 00:07:39,802
The flower carriage!

119
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,122
The flower carriage is gorgeous!

120
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:48,402
What a great scent.

121
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,928
Xian!

122
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,842
- Over there! It's coming! - Be careful.

123
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,083
A huge carriage is coming! It's so beautiful!

124
00:07:57,164 --> 00:07:58,375
They said it was heading to you.

125
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,679
Did you know about that?

126
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,360
If so, I'll go and check on it for you again!

127
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,030
They scattered petals from Xinyang all the way to the capital?

128
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,402
They were scattering the petals 24/7.

129
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,919
Don't they need to rest?

130
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,509
They're doing it by shift.

131
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,855
That's a lot of petals. Can they even fit inside the carriage?

132
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,159
They scatter petals

133
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,762
and pick flowers on their way here.

134
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,030
I don't know how many flowers have been picked.

135
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,280
I was the one who chased her out of the capital.

136
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,350
Now, she's making all this commotion just to give me a wedding gift?

137
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:36,788
She's Princess Wan Er's mother after all.

138
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,710
She wouldn't be Li Yun Rui if she was a loving person.

139
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,799
- Here it comes. - Here it comes.

140
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,159
Here it comes!

141
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,520
Here it comes! Hurry!

142
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,720
Look at the fresh flowers.

143
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,719
It looks gorgeous.

144
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,079
It's so beautiful.

145
00:08:56,874 --> 00:08:58,154
Look at that.

146
00:08:59,661 --> 00:09:00,776
I've never seen this before.

147
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,230
The flowers smell great.

148
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,830
The flowers smell great.

149
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:06,575
Who's sitting inside?

150
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,350
I can't even imagine it.

151
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,962
This is my first time seeing this.

152
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,559
What does she mean by that?

153
00:09:30,349 --> 00:09:33,042
(Fan Residence)

154
00:09:41,835 --> 00:09:43,282
Long time no see.

155
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,002
His Majesty ordered you to remain in Xinyang.

156
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,863
You cannot return to the capital without an edict.

157
00:09:58,887 --> 00:10:00,282
I'm going against his order.

158
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,269
I came back in secret.

159
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,400
Now, you can press charges against me if you like.

160
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:07,162
Why have you returned to the capital?

161
00:10:07,286 --> 00:10:08,566
These are for you.

162
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,760
Don't be afraid.

163
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:14,646
It's just my congratulatory gift.

164
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,362
You should be taking over the Imperial Treasury

165
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,230
after marrying Wan Er.

166
00:10:26,344 --> 00:10:28,224
These are the ledgers of the Imperial Treasury.

167
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,071
Don't you think it's a sincere gift?

168
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,079
So, you went against the order and came back just to deliver these?

169
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,362
I want to see Wan Er

170
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,882
on the day of your wedding.

171
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:45,252
She's my daughter.

172
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:51,470
Her wedding day is the most important day of her life.

173
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,830
I never led such a life before.

174
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,119
However, I hope that she can lead such a life.

175
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,400
I also want to leave her with the most beautiful memories.

176
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,202
Therefore, a ceasefire will take place

177
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,122
between us during the wedding.

178
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,480
What happens after the wedding, then?

179
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,640
Isn't it obvious?

180
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,439
We'll be enemies again.

181
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,200
Have you never considered the fact

182
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,722
that I might not agree to it?

183
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,082
I said it already.

184
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,599
You may press charges against me.

185
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,710
I just want to do the things I desire to do.

186
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,762
I'll handle it

187
00:11:35,853 --> 00:11:37,173
no matter what decision you make.

188
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,199
How long will you stay in the capital?

189
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,839
Depends on my mood.

190
00:11:43,965 --> 00:11:46,165
- Where will you be staying? - Not the Fan Residence.

191
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,959
You better hide yourself well.

192
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,140
Don't you think it's time for you to address me as Mother?

193
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:19,330
Read it slowly.

194
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Don't read it under strong light. There's no rush.

195
00:12:22,182 --> 00:12:23,462
It's fine.

196
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,839
I'm done reading it.

197
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,039
What do you think?

198
00:12:33,271 --> 00:12:36,820
The founding of the Imperial Treasury cannot be replicated.

199
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,716
It was the greatest shop in the world after all.

200
00:12:40,902 --> 00:12:44,571
It was the greatest shop in history.

201
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,670
It's filled with ingenious ideas.

202
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:49,350
It has branches all over the world.

203
00:12:51,947 --> 00:12:53,867
And, it's backed by the imperial family as well.

204
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,799
Judging from this,

205
00:12:55,926 --> 00:12:59,397
the ledgers indicate that there was a loss of 20 million taels.

206
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,789
The way Li Yun Rui had handled the business,

207
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,082
she should've been executed for this.

208
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,310
It's not that easy to execute a member of the imperial family.

209
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:10,812
Aren't you shocked by the sum?

210
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,922
I expected that long ago.

211
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,368
Even if there's no loss now,

212
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:17,239
it'll incur losses once I take over it.

213
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:19,279
To you,

214
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,842
these are more than just ledgers.

215
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,640
This is also a trap.

216
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:26,242
Even if it's a trap, I'll deal with it after the wedding.

217
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,640
You're right.

218
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,482
Your wedding is the biggest event in the world now.

219
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,959
Your mother was looking forward to this day too.

220
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,922
Should I hide these ledgers first, then?

221
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,520
How?

222
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,480
She delivered them to you in a carriage full of flowers.

223
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:42,999
Why don't we be generous as well?

224
00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:44,709
Generous?

225
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,030
Notify the Eighth Bureau to copy and record the ledgers.

226
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,520
Great timing.

227
00:13:48,623 --> 00:13:50,693
You can use the item left behind by your mother.

228
00:13:59,883 --> 00:14:01,322
(Seventh Bureau, Eight Bureau)

229
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:04,359
Who will we show them to after we're done copying them?

230
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,802
Those who are supposed to see them will receive a copy.

231
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,390
The Imperial Treasury's reserves are still intact.

232
00:14:13,414 --> 00:14:14,845
Fan Xian is a genius too.

233
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,762
I assume he can cover the deficit

234
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:18,442
within four to five years.

235
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,380
The ledgers were delivered here under huge commotion.

236
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:24,802
Those who should know about it

237
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,362
will know about it.

238
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,749
All merchants in the world

239
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:31,482
pursue profit.

240
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,296
Since they know that the Imperial Treasury has a huge debt,

241
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,749
no one will dare to do business with Fan Xian.

242
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,199
The loss

243
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,802
will only grow.

244
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,550
If there's no turnaround within six months,

245
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,980
he has to give up on the Imperial Treasury.

246
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:54,919
Six months?

247
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,079
And, a loss of 20 million taels.

248
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,710
Even a deity cannot achieve that.

249
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,880
Unless

250
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:08,562
someone is willing to help him out.

251
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:13,268
Has Fan Xian ever expressed explicitly

252
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,242
that he would join your faction

253
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,292
ever since he came to the capital?

254
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,559
Not yet.

255
00:15:25,351 --> 00:15:28,482
It's a huge debt of 20 million taels.

256
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,442
I think it's reasonable for him

257
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,560
to owe us a favor in exchange for our help.

258
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:38,802
You're saving him here.

259
00:15:57,702 --> 00:15:59,573
Not many people wish to save you.

260
00:15:59,814 --> 00:16:02,054
Many of them want to kick you while you're down instead.

261
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,882
After all, the sum is huge.

262
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,710
Are both of your eyes blurry?

263
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:12,202
No. Only this eye.

264
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:16,139
It should be presbyopia.

265
00:16:16,223 --> 00:16:17,652
It's 20 million taels after all.

266
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,710
Aren't you concerned about it at all?

267
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,398
I'll put it aside first. It can wait until the wedding is over.

268
00:16:23,422 --> 00:16:24,702
There's no need to panic.

269
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,120
Regarding the debt,

270
00:16:26,238 --> 00:16:27,718
both His Majesty and I knew about it.

271
00:16:27,845 --> 00:16:28,968
I'm not panicking.

272
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,999
Actually, this isn't the only reason I'm here today.

273
00:16:32,111 --> 00:16:34,461
Wang Qi Nian already told me about the serial killings.

274
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:35,941
Did you see the culprit's face?

275
00:16:35,965 --> 00:16:38,239
I thought you would seek me out on the same day it happened.

276
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,383
You wouldn't need to tell Wang Qi Nian to make a trip

277
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:43,059
if we could discuss this case out in the open.

278
00:16:43,456 --> 00:16:45,966
You're good enough to be an official now.

279
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:47,775
Was it Mr. Wu Zhu?

280
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,151
I don't know.

281
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,160
From Jiangnan all the way to the capital.

282
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,360
All those who saw him were killed.

283
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,391
- What about the past few days? - The capital has been peaceful lately.

284
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,430
It seemed like the culprit had vanished.

285
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,760
If so, I'm sure it's not him.

286
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,479
Wu Zhu has forgotten many things.

287
00:17:03,598 --> 00:17:05,388
What if it happens again?

288
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,549
What if he forgot about you as well?

289
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:09,682
What if he attacks you?

290
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,200
What will you do?

291
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,439
I'll do something about your presbyopia.

292
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:15,606
I'll definitely cure it for you.

293
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,300
What if he's the culprit?

294
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,000
What should we do?

295
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,599
Will you be attending my wedding?

296
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:26,882
It's a family banquet.

297
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,829
That's why I'm inviting you.

298
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,150
I lost my family long ago.

299
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:39,239
You still have me, don't you?

300
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:55,212
I'll see how it goes after the wedding.

301
00:17:56,894 --> 00:17:57,981
Is this my wedding gift?

302
00:17:58,062 --> 00:17:59,815
I can't just not attend your wedding and not give you a wedding gift.

303
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:01,119
That'll be inappropriate of me.

304
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,282
What's inside? You're acting mysterious here.

305
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,080
May you two have a harmonious relationship

306
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,670
and enjoy years of happiness together.

307
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,599
You look so beautiful.

308
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,642
- Mother? - Don't move.

309
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,693
Let me do your makeup for you today.

310
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,710
When did you return to the capital?

311
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,000
I came back in secret.

312
00:19:50,503 --> 00:19:51,805
Did His Majesty not issue an edict?

313
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:53,109
No, he didn't.

314
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,162
If so, you're going against his order.

315
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,600
Since when did that happen?

316
00:19:57,711 --> 00:19:59,181
This is a heinous crime.

317
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't care.

318
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,522
You're getting married.

319
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:09,202
I'll be committing a heinous crime

320
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,882
if I don't come back for it.

321
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,720
Mother.

322
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,319
In this life,

323
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,802
I only agree with one thing.

324
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,599
What is it?

325
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,442
In the entire world,

326
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,960
I, Li Yun Rui, am the most beautiful person.

327
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,762
Although some individuals are too blind to see my beauty,

328
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,589
that's not my fault.

329
00:20:40,054 --> 00:20:41,602
Who were you referring to?

330
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:47,919
That's not important.

331
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,559
I'm saying

332
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,466
that because I want to tell you this.

333
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,738
I have to come to the capital

334
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,870
because I have to do your makeup for you.

335
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,509
In this world,

336
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:03,749
if I allow someone else to be more beautiful than me,

337
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,362
that person has to be you.

338
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:13,430
And, it has to be today.

339
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:41,204
You were alone

340
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:44,190
since young.

341
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,240
You never had a happy life.

342
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:51,110
Even now, I can't make it up to you.

343
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,960
But today,

344
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,470
let me fulfill my duty as your mother.

345
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,962
Let me send you to the next phrase

346
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:08,309
of your life.

347
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:12,928
Mother.

348
00:22:13,648 --> 00:22:14,928
Don't cry.

349
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,069
The makeup is perfect.

350
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,200
Mother,

351
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:28,269
can you stop competing with Fan Xian in the future?

352
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,000
Look at you.

353
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,240
You're so gorgeous.

354
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,670
As your mother, I've lost to you.

355
00:23:14,023 --> 00:23:15,303
I've done

356
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,682
what should've been done.

357
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,920
Where are you going?

358
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:30,599
Since I came in secret,

359
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,589
I have to leave in secret.

360
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,599
Wan Er,

361
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,910
I've never led your life before.

362
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm envious of you.

363
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:08,413
Stop right there.

364
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,720
From today onward,

365
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,200
forget about

366
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,042
this mother of yours completely.

367
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,119
I'm very happy

368
00:24:38,696 --> 00:24:40,202
that you were able to come.

369
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,519
Where are we going?

370
00:25:05,622 --> 00:25:06,902
Where else can we go?

371
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,509
Just let them off!

372
00:25:08,598 --> 00:25:11,295
I was worried that you might be worried. That's why I want you to join me.

373
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,519
I don't know any martial arts.

374
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,800
If anything does happen,

375
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,402
you may kill me whenever you like.

376
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,212
Why are the horses still here?

377
00:25:51,293 --> 00:25:53,322
Go over there. Park the carriage over there.

378
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,482
Guys, sorry about this. Please park the carriage over there.

379
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,390
Park the carriage over there.

380
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,760
Park it over there.

381
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,762
Guys, bring all the horses there, okay?

382
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,082
Sorry about this.

383
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,400
This looks so grand.

384
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,760
Yeah.

385
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,759
It looks so grand.

386
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:22,519
I'm sure it's a major figure.

387
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,879
Yeah.

388
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,253
It does look grand.

389
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,719
Yeah.

390
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:29,230
What a grand carriage.

391
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,239
Greetings, Crown Prince.

392
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,560
Is this the crown prince?

393
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,162
- Are you... - I'm Wang Qi Nian.

394
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,962
Gift bearers, follow me.

395
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,400
I know what you guys are going to say.

396
00:26:49,086 --> 00:26:51,446
This is a family banquet. You guys don't need to follow me.

397
00:26:53,126 --> 00:26:54,288
- Who else has arrived? - Get out of the way!

398
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,322
The...

399
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,882
Get out of the way!

400
00:26:58,145 --> 00:26:59,241
Get out of the way!

401
00:26:59,322 --> 00:27:00,602
Get out of the way!

402
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
This is an urgent letter sent by Northern Qi.

403
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:10,663
- Is Northern Qi invading our borders? - No, this isn't about war.

404
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:12,882
Northern Qi wrote a letter to Lord Fan.

405
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:15,882
It's just a private letter.

406
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,790
How could the border army rush here just to deliver it?

407
00:27:17,814 --> 00:27:20,094
The person who wrote this was Northern Qi's emperor.

408
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,230
How could the groom pour us a drink?

409
00:27:31,782 --> 00:27:33,702
It's a family banquet. The customs don't matter.

410
00:27:37,608 --> 00:27:39,762
What's wrong? I'm getting married,

411
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,602
yet you look more nervous than me.

412
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,082
Fan.

413
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,962
Come.

414
00:27:54,448 --> 00:27:57,037
Is Miss Ruo Ruo here?

415
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,800
What's wrong?

416
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,829
Are you trying to act drunk before drinking?

417
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,560
According to the palace,

418
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,160
Ruo Ruo and I will get married after your wedding.

419
00:28:06,295 --> 00:28:07,735
Ruo Ruo doesn't want to get married.

420
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,160
Fan Xian,

421
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,400
that's an imperial edict.

422
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,247
Whether Ruo Ruo and I are willing to get married or not,

423
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:14,320
that doesn't matter.

424
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,269
But she doesn't want to get married.

425
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,959
What should we do, then?

426
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,320
Don't tell me she wants to go against the imperial edict?

427
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,759
Actually,

428
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:28,202
I've always had a good impression of Ruo Ruo.

429
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,362
Since that's the case, I should try to know her better.

430
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:33,842
I'm sure you can rest at ease since you know me well too.

431
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:37,349
What about Yuan Meng, then?

432
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,039
Yuan Meng?

433
00:28:40,175 --> 00:28:43,205
About Yuan Meng, that was just a ridiculous event in the past.

434
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,522
I never participated in the events

435
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,282
related to Moon Embracing Pavilion.

436
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,240
I trust you.

437
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,000
I've also forgiven you.

438
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:00,589
However, Ruo Ruo won't be married to you.

439
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:05,367
Our marriage was granted by His Majesty. Who dares to defy him?

440
00:29:05,454 --> 00:29:06,734
Congratulations.

441
00:29:06,815 --> 00:29:08,202
Your Highness.

442
00:29:08,661 --> 00:29:10,722
- Greetings, Your Highness. - Cheng Ru.

443
00:29:11,063 --> 00:29:13,642
Put the gifts in that room.

444
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,322
Don't touch any intriguing items you see, you hear me?

445
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,789
I came here only for one reason.

446
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,950
I came here to drink with my brothers.

447
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:26,722
That item,

448
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,480
have you fixed it?

449
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,322
I have.

450
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,671
The emperor of Northern Qi wrote a letter to you. Take a look.

451
00:29:33,695 --> 00:29:34,882
My Lord.

452
00:29:46,487 --> 00:29:47,962
He's urging me to update my chapter.

453
00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:49,484
What does that mean?

454
00:29:49,565 --> 00:29:51,965
The emperor of Northern Qi loves "Dream of the Red Chamber".

455
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:53,759
Is that all?

456
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,002
There's other news too.

457
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,480
Your Highness, you may read it yourself.

458
00:30:12,655 --> 00:30:15,562
One of the four grandmasters, Ku He,

459
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,440
wants to take

460
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,989
Ruo Ruo as his last disciple?

461
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,349
Isn't Haitang Duo Duo his last disciple?

462
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,800
According to the letter,

463
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,815
she didn't last. That's why he's taking another last disciple.

464
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:27,119
How is that a valid reason?

465
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,015
The four grandmasters are extraordinary at martial arts.

466
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,879
It's inevitable for their thoughts to be different from ordinary folks.

467
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,136
Send this to the palace and let His Majesty decide it.

468
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,440
I'll get to it right now.

469
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,999
All right now.

470
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,359
Take your seats.

471
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,482
Fan.

472
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,562
Fan,

473
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:52,402
how did you do that?

474
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:55,759
Do you still think the wedding between you two will be held?

475
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,082
Judging from the grandmaster's intervention,

476
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:01,479
I'm afraid the marriage granted to us by His Majesty will be voided.

477
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:04,682
The four grandmasters are above the imperial court.

478
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,660
Do you think that's a good thing?

479
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,522
It has always been like this.

480
00:31:12,126 --> 00:31:14,202
I was just saying. Don't take it to heart.

481
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,400
Take your seat now. The dishes are getting cold.

482
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,282
Why isn't there anyone on the streets?

483
00:31:32,602 --> 00:31:34,920
You're right. Why isn't there anyone here?

484
00:31:37,573 --> 00:31:39,202
You don't need to keep holding my hands.

485
00:31:39,337 --> 00:31:40,762
Xie Bi An isn't around.

486
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,280
I can only depend on you if an assassin were to attack us.

487
00:31:43,438 --> 00:31:46,042
I feel safer holding your hands.

488
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,230
I can protect you.

489
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,480
But remember that you made me a promise.

490
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,400
You said you wouldn't ruin Wan Er's wedding.

491
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,522
If you don't trust me,

492
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,842
why don't you kill me right now?

493
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:00,910
Look. I'm alone, and I don't know any martial arts.

494
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,295
It's easy for you to strike me down

495
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,599
and be free of all your worries.

496
00:32:05,366 --> 00:32:07,482
If you dare to speak nonsense during the banquet,

497
00:32:07,655 --> 00:32:08,935
I'll definitely strike you down.

498
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,680
It's a promise, then.

499
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,680
What promise?

500
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,362
It's either you protect me

501
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,679
or you strike me down.

502
00:32:16,766 --> 00:32:18,046
I'll leave my life

503
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,789
to you for now.

504
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,602
Once you marry Wan Er, we'll be considered relatives.

505
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,160
We're a family.

506
00:32:36,263 --> 00:32:37,383
Cheng Ru, I'm not lying.

507
00:32:37,508 --> 00:32:38,781
I have had sleepless nights

508
00:32:38,862 --> 00:32:40,973
because of our brother over here.

509
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,842
The Imperial Treasury has such a huge debt.

510
00:32:43,983 --> 00:32:45,522
What should we do about it?

511
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,522
Your Highness, you're benevolent indeed.

512
00:32:49,728 --> 00:32:51,008
There's one more thing.

513
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:54,261
I think Northern Qi has high regard for you as well.

514
00:32:54,358 --> 00:32:56,621
But no matter how huge of a debt the Imperial Treasury has incurred,

515
00:32:56,645 --> 00:32:58,196
it's our affair.

516
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,999
We mustn't use money from other kingdoms to fill up that hole.

517
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,342
That's a taboo.

518
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,015
Your Highness, you don't need to worry.

519
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:06,176
No matter how much the emperor of Northern Qi likes my novel,

520
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,999
he would never pay 20 million taels to me so that I could update it.

521
00:33:08,023 --> 00:33:09,933
No other world would do this.

522
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,879
You're right.

523
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:13,402
Speaking of which,

524
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:16,082
what should we do about the Imperial Treasury's debt?

525
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:19,550
Today's Fan Xian's wedding. Let's not talk about that.

526
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,922
Let's drop the topic. But I'll say one last thing.

527
00:33:22,023 --> 00:33:23,762
Luckily, that guy is under house arrest.

528
00:33:23,952 --> 00:33:26,397
I'm sure the wedding will be chaotic if he's here.

529
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,670
My Lord, Prince Cheng Ze is here to congratulate you.

530
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:44,927
Luckily, I came here alone.

531
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,959
If not, there would be no space for me.

532
00:33:47,046 --> 00:33:49,762
They're unlike you. At least they fear death.

533
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,430
I fear death too.

534
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,479
But that's not what I fear the most.

535
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,042
What do you fear the most, then?

536
00:33:59,214 --> 00:34:00,643
I fear

537
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,562
a calm and peaceful life.

538
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,480
It's so boring.

539
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,520
You're ridiculous.

540
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,002
Your Highness, Lord Fan

541
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:24,460
is inviting you inside.

542
00:34:24,692 --> 00:34:26,692
Since it's his wedding, all guests are welcome.

543
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,564
Great. I was worried that he might not let me in.

544
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:57,399
Your Highness, please.

545
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,439
All of you are here, huh?

546
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,353
Greetings, Crown Prince.

547
00:35:04,446 --> 00:35:05,726
Cheng Ze, spare the formalities.

548
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,319
Wait, you're not bowing to me?

549
00:35:11,336 --> 00:35:14,296
Cheng Ze, you made an appearance during Fan Xian's wedding.

550
00:35:14,377 --> 00:35:16,442
I can see that you're a loyal person.

551
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,215
However, you went against His Majesty's order.

552
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,504
If His Majesty does blame you for it,

553
00:35:20,528 --> 00:35:23,482
Cheng Ze, we brothers will share the blame with you.

554
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,030
Were you referring to my house arrest?

555
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,725
I already requested his permission.

556
00:35:27,749 --> 00:35:28,909
You requested his permission?

557
00:35:28,955 --> 00:35:31,439
It's Wan Er's wedding. I requested permission from His Majesty

558
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,800
to attend it.

559
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:34,429
That's great.

560
00:35:35,272 --> 00:35:36,982
Cheng Ze, I was worried for nothing.

561
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:40,039
Sorry about that. I'll punish myself by having a drink.

562
00:35:40,142 --> 00:35:41,422
I'll join you.

563
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,200
This is a rare sight to behold.

564
00:35:45,303 --> 00:35:47,463
I can't believe that such brothers exist in the world.

565
00:36:08,237 --> 00:36:09,517
Here's my wedding gift.

566
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,160
Thank you.

567
00:36:12,305 --> 00:36:13,842
Why don't you check it out?

568
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,925
Initially, I prepared some jewels and accessories.

569
00:36:24,006 --> 00:36:26,562
But when I thought about it, you didn't lack them at all.

570
00:36:26,734 --> 00:36:28,014
I chose a more direct approach.

571
00:36:28,182 --> 00:36:29,462
Here's 500,000 taels.

572
00:36:32,478 --> 00:36:33,600
That's too much.

573
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,896
This is just scratching the surface.

574
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,736
The Imperial Treasury incurred a loss of 20 million taels.

575
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,282
I'm worried for your sake.

576
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,261
You two are brothers indeed.

577
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,642
What was that?

578
00:36:42,895 --> 00:36:44,895
The crown prince was worried about the same thing.

579
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:51,482
I can never be as benevolent as the crown prince.

580
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:54,469
Let's consider the common folks' approach.

581
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,917
You taking over the Imperial Treasury is also a major task.

582
00:36:57,998 --> 00:37:00,148
You still need to do business.

583
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,119
But with that debt, it's hard for you to do business.

584
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,061
That's fine. I know many merchants.

585
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:07,550
They'll have to help you out

586
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,760
for my sake.

587
00:37:10,357 --> 00:37:12,882
- Yes. - Cheng Ze's intention is kind.

588
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:14,842
But...

589
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,070
Merchants never act if there's no benefit.

590
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,322
If you accept their help today,

591
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,720
what'll happen tomorrow?

592
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,230
All of them will interfere with the Imperial Treasury.

593
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:28,879
That'll be terrible.

594
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,882
But you see, Cheng Ze isn't like all those merchants.

595
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:36,319
He's not a materialistic person.

596
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,959
He's definitely a kind person.

597
00:37:38,109 --> 00:37:40,029
Crown Prince, you have excellent insight indeed.

598
00:37:40,245 --> 00:37:42,322
However, we can't just let the Imperial Treasury

599
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,190
crumble under Lord Fan's leadership, right?

600
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,360
That's right.

601
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,783
He's our brother. How can we leave him in the lurch?

602
00:37:47,871 --> 00:37:49,151
But even real brothers

603
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:51,402
are turning against each other, you know?

604
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:53,213
What's wrong, Crown Prince?

605
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:54,679
Do you plan to fork out the money?

606
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:57,280
It would be a huge deal if I were able

607
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,360
to fork out that sum.

608
00:37:58,441 --> 00:38:00,202
I guess you were wasting our time here.

609
00:38:01,062 --> 00:38:04,522
Fan, if you're free tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,

610
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,639
you can come to my residence.

611
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,522
We can always find a solution to our issues.

612
00:38:09,261 --> 00:38:12,159
Great. From now on, both the Overwatch Council and the Imperial Treasury

613
00:38:12,285 --> 00:38:13,842
will belong to you, Crown Prince.

614
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,519
Cheng Ze, you mustn't crack such jokes.

615
00:38:16,622 --> 00:38:18,492
I dare not act like you.

616
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,799
I don't dare to form factions in secret.

617
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,199
You should consider my proposal as well.

618
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:32,385
You don't need to join my faction.

619
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:34,045
It's just a deal. We're just getting what we need.

620
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:36,676
Yeah. A deal with endless implications.

621
00:38:36,757 --> 00:38:38,837
At least it's better than selling oneself for glory.

622
00:38:48,334 --> 00:38:49,614
I guess my hand slipped again.

623
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,600
Taking one is more than enough.

624
00:38:55,937 --> 00:38:57,078
500,000 taels is enough

625
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:59,279
for the Censorate to impeach me at least eight times.

626
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:01,347
I don't want to jinx this festive occasion.

627
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:06,519
Your Highness, have you ever heard of the term "honeymoon?"

628
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,642
Is it a kind of dessert?

629
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:12,880
No. That means Wan Er and I will take a break after our wedding.

630
00:39:12,991 --> 00:39:14,591
No official affairs will be entertained.

631
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,282
Your Highness, I appreciate your intention.

632
00:39:17,383 --> 00:39:18,663
But I won't be visiting you.

633
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,602
How can you repay the huge debt

634
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:27,039
without any help?

635
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:29,324
Today's a great day. I don't wish to talk about this.

636
00:39:31,378 --> 00:39:34,590
Everyone, this is my first time participating in the wedding ceremony.

637
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:36,026
The auspicious hour will arrive soon.

638
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,878
Why don't you guys observe the ceremony together

639
00:39:37,902 --> 00:39:39,182
and join in the fun?

640
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:48,070
The auspicious hour has arrived!

641
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,767
Shouldn't the matchmaker be the one holding the ribbon?

642
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:31,273
I stole her job from her.

643
00:40:31,447 --> 00:40:33,356
I want to witness this important moment myself.

644
00:40:35,823 --> 00:40:37,573
Two hearts as one,

645
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,829
never apart.

646
00:41:58,902 --> 00:42:01,331
Wan Er, I have something to tell you.

647
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:04,642
Young Master!

648
00:42:04,919 --> 00:42:07,278
We can talk after the wedding ceremony is over, okay?

649
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:08,469
No!

650
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,900
I have to tell her right now.

651
00:42:12,823 --> 00:42:13,985
Wan Er,

652
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,562
Father told me to tell you this during your wedding.

653
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,040
What is it?

654
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,560
He told you

655
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,600
to

656
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:33,682
Take good care of Da Bao.

657
00:42:38,854 --> 00:42:40,002
Okay.

658
00:42:40,344 --> 00:42:41,624
I promise you.

659
00:42:42,605 --> 00:42:44,319
- I'm done. - You're done? Good.

660
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,542
I'm done!

661
00:42:45,623 --> 00:42:46,663
Da Bao, you're done.

662
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,482
- I'm done. - All right.

663
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:52,122
Shall we begin?
