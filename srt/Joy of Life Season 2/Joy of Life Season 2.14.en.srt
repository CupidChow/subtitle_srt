00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:31,002
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,086 --> 00:01:34,042
(Episode 14)

3
00:01:35,622 --> 00:01:37,712
The testimonies they gave before this were fake.

4
00:01:38,162 --> 00:01:40,099
Now that they're going to be transported to the Ministry of Justice,

5
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:41,842
they might change their testimonies.

6
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:45,101
Therefore, Li Cheng Ze silenced them.

7
00:01:45,182 --> 00:01:46,632
Now,

8
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,489
everything makes sense.

9
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,760
That's right.

10
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:57,856
Thankfully, the truth has come to light.

11
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,370
Fan Wu Jiu is a good move to beat down Li Cheng Ze.

12
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,850
I just don't understand

13
00:02:08,823 --> 00:02:10,842
why he would appear at the scene.

14
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,659
I don't get it either.

15
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,099
I swear in the name of Heaven.

16
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:17,398
Fan Wu Jiu left the capital on another mission.

17
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,070
Besides, you knew

18
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:20,950
I asked the Ministry of Justice to take away the culprits.

19
00:02:21,038 --> 00:02:22,482
If I'm the mastermind,

20
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,602
my actions would be unnecessary.

21
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,340
I don't understand.

22
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,099
To be honest,

23
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,842
I don't understand as well.

24
00:02:37,093 --> 00:02:38,313
Wait.

25
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,002
Is Fan Wu Jiu dead?

26
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,340
He isn't.

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,082
He has been captured alive.

28
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,383
It's fine, then.

29
00:02:44,602 --> 00:02:45,781
If Fan Wu Jiu admits

30
00:02:45,862 --> 00:02:47,366
that he was sent outside the capital by you,

31
00:02:47,454 --> 00:02:49,162
that means you are unrelated to this.

32
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:02,936
He can't say.

33
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,920
How can he expose the fact

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,482
that Prince Cheng Ze sent him to attack Fan Si Zhe?

35
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,720
Moreover,

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,442
the members of the Overwatch Council

37
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:14,482
were with Fan Si Zhe as well.

38
00:03:15,548 --> 00:03:18,427
Attacking the Overwatch Council equals treason.

39
00:03:18,508 --> 00:03:19,749
If I was Fan Wu Jiu,

40
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,882
I would have no choice but to keep my mouth shut.

41
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,259
After all,

42
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,002
killing a murderer is better for him than treason.

43
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,442
Were you the one who sent Fan Si Zhe away?

44
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,290
Yes.

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,922
When you sent him away,

46
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,322
were you already preparing for this day?

47
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,042
No.

48
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,453
I can't foresee things.

49
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,362
I was thinking

50
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,202
that since Fan Si Zhe got himself involved with Moon Embracing Pavilion,

51
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,360
Prince Cheng Ze wouldn't let him leave easily.

52
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,202
I took an extra step

53
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,659
to protect him.

54
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,649
With Fan Wu Jiu's blade technique,

55
00:03:58,237 --> 00:03:59,802
even a normal ninth-ranked official

56
00:04:00,424 --> 00:04:02,482
can't capture him.

57
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,914
Indeed.

58
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,722
Who could capture him?

59
00:04:08,263 --> 00:04:10,512
Naturally, it wasn't a normal ninth-ranked official.

60
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:35,082
- Where is this?   - The Judicial Bureau.

61
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,520
You've killed someone.

62
00:04:37,623 --> 00:04:39,202
Why are you still pretending?

63
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,299
Killed someone?

64
00:04:45,476 --> 00:04:46,559
What?

65
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,082
There's irrefutable evidence. Are you still going to deny it?

66
00:05:24,218 --> 00:05:25,522
(Saintess of Northern Qi, Haitang Duo Duo)

67
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:29,640
How surprising.

68
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,442
The Saintess of Northern Qi

69
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,522
is going to protect someone from the Qing Kingdom.

70
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:36,722
The people of the Qing Kingdom want to kill each other.

71
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:38,562
The people of the Qi Kingdom are just joining in the fun.

72
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,449
You want to join in the fun, right?

73
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:44,233
Join in the fun.

74
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:48,687
My effort in practicing blade techniques my whole life has not been in vain

75
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,682
now that I get to fight

76
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:53,602
against the Saintess of Northern Qi!

77
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:47,482
Is that necessary? You can kill me but you shouldn't humiliate me!

78
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,242
It was not a bad loss.

79
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,249
That was a normal collaboration.

80
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,839
I have no other relationships

81
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,650
with Haitang Duo Duo.

82
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:14,221
I haven't said anything yet.

83
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:15,551
I know what you are thinking about.

84
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,611
I must responsibly say that what you are thinking is wrong.

85
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:20,242
- Keep explaining.   - What about swearing in the name of Heaven?

86
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:23,322
Who am I to Wan Er?

87
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,689
- Her father.   - Do you think I will believe you?

88
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,242
You should still trust my character.

89
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,482
Didn't you entrust the Lin family and Wan Er to me

90
00:07:34,563 --> 00:07:36,112
because of my pure character?

91
00:07:36,193 --> 00:07:37,280
This is the capital.

92
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,799
Do I dare entrust them to someone pure?

93
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:42,239
I'm innocent. Can't I clear my name?

94
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,520
Your shamelessness

95
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,562
is exactly the hope of the Lin family for decades to come.

96
00:07:46,896 --> 00:07:49,585
Are you praising me or insulting me?

97
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,940
I'm praising you.

98
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,170
Using Fan Wu Jiu here is an incredible move.

99
00:07:54,304 --> 00:07:56,910
The suicide squad, framing, and the true culprit.

100
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,129
Every scheme has been overturned now.

101
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:01,811
Li Cheng Ze

102
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,689
has lost this game.

103
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,660
You're here?

104
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,259
Time is running out.

105
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:07,482
Let's finish the chat soon. What's wrong?

106
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,842
I attacked Fan Si Zhe

107
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,122
within the Northern Qi borders.

108
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,442
Haitang Duo Duo saved him.

109
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,180
I lost.

110
00:09:22,158 --> 00:09:24,042
They captured me back to the capital

111
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,042
to confine me for a few days.

112
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,882
Today, they knocked me out.

113
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,482
When I woke up,

114
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,362
I was already in the Judicial Bureau.

115
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,959
Haitang Duo Duo took you to the capital?

116
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,259
That's not it.

117
00:09:36,057 --> 00:09:39,122
The people from the Overwatch Council took me here.

118
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,882
The Overwatch Council?

119
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,802
Do you know what's the situation now?

120
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,379
I don't.

121
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,220
Don't worry.

122
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,162
My lips are sealed.

123
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,202
I won't say anything.

124
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:03,682
The assassin prepared by His Highness

125
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,282
was supposed to be used to frame Fan Xian.

126
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,962
However, His Highness reached an impasse

127
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,562
because of your appearance.

128
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:19,922
- Are you going to kill me?   - You can't die yet.

129
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,199
What should I do next?

130
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,499
One.

131
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,722
You mustn't mention anything

132
00:10:24,935 --> 00:10:26,217
about attacking Fan Si Zhe.

133
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,120
- Understood.   - Two.

134
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,599
Find a suitable excuse

135
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,002
for the assassination in front of the Judicial Bureau.

136
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,816
You must never get His Highness involved.

137
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,522
With my current identity,

138
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:38,962
they won't believe a word I say.

139
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:40,902
Whether they believe you or not is unimportant.

140
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:42,919
At least it should be acceptable on the surface.

141
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,259
Sure.

142
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,940
Sure.

143
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,859
Sure.

144
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,162
There's not much time left.

145
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,762
Do you have anything else to say?

146
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:00,562
I'll help you tell His Highness.

147
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,940
Xie,

148
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:17,082
do I no longer have a chance

149
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,002
to participate in the Spring Imperial Examination?

150
00:11:32,476 --> 00:11:34,122
Help me thank His Highness.

151
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,562
At least he gave me hope.

152
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,522
Thank him for me.

153
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,859
I should leave.

154
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,540
Xie.

155
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,842
Can I ask you for a favor?

156
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:01,173
Say it.

157
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,642
Bring me a book.

158
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,180
Just one.

159
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,042
A book about Confucianism.

160
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:12,122
Any one will do.

161
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,820
Thank you.

162
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,019
Thank you.

163
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,402
His Highness knew what you wanted.

164
00:12:52,849 --> 00:12:54,522
He is still the one who knows me well.

165
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:26,522
Help me thank His Highness.

166
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,682
How are they treating you?

167
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,242
Did you get to eat meat?

168
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,880
Haitang Duo Duo

169
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,089
and the Overwatch Council are all on Fan Xian's side.

170
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,890
Does Haitang Duo Duo have an affair with Fan Xian?

171
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,619
I don't think so.

172
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:14,971
Why is she helping him then?

173
00:15:15,143 --> 00:15:16,505
Because Fan Xian

174
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:18,922
is the future owner of the Imperial Treasury.

175
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,882
I'm grateful for your help while I was in a dire situation, Saintess.

176
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:31,683
How is it?

177
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:33,959
Good.

178
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,259
Good.

179
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,042
What are you talking about?

180
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:40,562
Shangjing City.

181
00:15:41,912 --> 00:15:43,132
Great.

182
00:15:44,497 --> 00:15:46,242
How does it compare to the capital of Southern Qing?

183
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,682
They are good in their own ways.

184
00:15:51,144 --> 00:15:52,875
You are acting sneakily. What are you afraid of?

185
00:15:52,956 --> 00:15:54,176
Stop! No.

186
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:56,242
I'm afraid that they might recognize me.

187
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,863
The people of the Qi Kingdom and Qing Kingdom don't look too different.

188
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,772
Don't worry. They won't recognize your face.

189
00:16:02,853 --> 00:16:04,522
- Put it down.   - No.

190
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:07,410
Do you know how famous I am in the Qing Kingdom?

191
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,162
My father is Fan Jian.

192
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,985
He is the Minister of Revenue and Duke of Sinan.

193
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,532
The life of a noble like me is in danger

194
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:16,282
at this foreign place.

195
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,722
I'm starting to feel impressed with the people of the Fan family.

196
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,642
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

197
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:24,898
Hold on.

198
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,962
What did you just call me?

199
00:16:30,294 --> 00:16:31,514
You like me to call you that?

200
00:16:32,248 --> 00:16:34,122
I can only call you that here.

201
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:36,226
Sister-in-law.

202
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,562
How did your brother describe me?

203
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,722
Does he need to describe it?

204
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:47,802
Rumors are all over the Qing Kingdom.

205
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,402
I know everything.

206
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:51,522
You know nothing!

207
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,514
I'm telling you. This is the Qi Kingdom.

208
00:16:53,628 --> 00:16:56,318
- Don't spout nonsense and call me Sister-in-law.   - It's a secret here?

209
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,682
- It's not a secret!   - The secret's out?

210
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,122
There's nothing between your brother and me.

211
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:04,922
There's nothing. I'm sure there's nothing.

212
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,282
Enough, Sister-in-law. There's no need to hide it from me.

213
00:17:07,379 --> 00:17:09,289
I'm on the same side as you. I support you.

214
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,082
How are you on the same side as me?

215
00:17:11,225 --> 00:17:12,639
You didn't meet my sister-in-law in the capital.

216
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,640
She is sickly and weak. Just like Dai Yu in "Dream of the Red Chamber".

217
00:17:16,774 --> 00:17:18,042
She's different from you.

218
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:19,482
You are strong...

219
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,310
I'm telling you. The main reason I'm helping your brother

220
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:25,522
is because he took over the Imperial Treasury.

221
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,802
The Qi Kingdom and Qing Kingdom has a business deal.

222
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,090
Understand?

223
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,602
If there's a case

224
00:17:31,736 --> 00:17:33,482
of internal conflict in the Qing Kingdom,

225
00:17:33,557 --> 00:17:35,482
I'm also happy to see that. Understand?

226
00:17:38,638 --> 00:17:41,282
You just don't believe me completely?

227
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:51,368
- Follow me.   - Where to, Sister-in-law?

228
00:17:56,797 --> 00:17:57,838
Here it is.

229
00:17:57,939 --> 00:17:59,159
Go inside.

230
00:17:59,263 --> 00:18:01,223
A shop established by the Qing Kingdom in Shangjing City.

231
00:18:01,737 --> 00:18:03,249
What's it for?

232
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,177
Command. Spy. Dispatch.

233
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,810
Your brother asked us to send you here.

234
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,002
- Command and spy?   - Yes.

235
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:17,797
My brother even told you about a place like this.

236
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:19,322
I'm sure both of you are...

237
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,209
Good friends.

238
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,922
I've done all I can to help you.

239
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,499
Take care of yourself.

240
00:18:53,374 --> 00:18:54,594
Where's everyone?

241
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:56,107
I suffer from a cold

242
00:18:56,188 --> 00:18:57,479
and can't welcome my guests.

243
00:18:57,715 --> 00:18:59,275
If you want anything, just find them yourself.

244
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,973
Guo Bao Kun.

245
00:19:09,054 --> 00:19:10,274
Fan Si Zhe?

246
00:19:12,098 --> 00:19:13,318
You...

247
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:25,882
Wait. The medicine.

248
00:19:26,694 --> 00:19:27,914
Where's your brother?

249
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,082
At home perhaps. I don't know.

250
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,929
Why are you here when he's not here?

251
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,560
I'm helping you.

252
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:35,122
Stop talking nonsense.

253
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,402
Do you know what place this is?

254
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:40,754
I command

255
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,322
all the movement of the Qing Kingdom's spies.

256
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,370
You shouldn't be involved in something so important.

257
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,082
If you can be here, so can I.

258
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,860
How can you say that?

259
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,842
Do you know Yan Bing Yun?

260
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:59,482
I know. The guy from the Fourth Bureau of the Overwatch Council, right?

261
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:01,202
Even someone like him

262
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,929
failed his mission in Northern Qi.

263
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,700
Take another look at me.

264
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,640
Under my command,

265
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,810
this little store is still safe.

266
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:15,882
It's flawless as if it's hidden in the Ninth Abyss.

267
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,650
Do you dare look down on me

268
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,370
after learning how capable I am?

269
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,159
Duo Duo, you know a lot about food.

270
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,842
Pairing yogurt with fruit is great.

271
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:05,258
Lang Tao,

272
00:21:05,655 --> 00:21:07,242
what brings you here?

273
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:09,682
His Majesty asked me to come here.

274
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,400
He wanted to ask

275
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:14,442
if Fan Si Zhe had been escorted to Guo Bao Kun's oil shop.

276
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:17,682
Even His Majesty knows about the oil shop?

277
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:18,880
He's not the only one.

278
00:21:19,024 --> 00:21:21,360
Every official in the imperial court knows.

279
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,660
Besides them,

280
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,199
even Master who stays indoors to cultivate

281
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:27,113
knows about the oil shop.

282
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,130
His Majesty said

283
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,850
Guo Bao Kun was a genius.

284
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,259
We must keep him here.

285
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,729
Don't let a wise person take over.

286
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,929
That's easy.

287
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,614
Just pretend that we haven't discovered him.

288
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:41,929
That's difficult.

289
00:21:43,381 --> 00:21:45,007
He is too careless

290
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:47,209
and the flaws always appear suddenly.

291
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,090
I need to pretend not to find out with a reasonable excuse.

292
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,289
It's too difficult.

293
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,220
Never mind.

294
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,682
All of the Qi Kingdom can put in effort to help.

295
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:06,882
We must protect Guo Bao Kun.

296
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,880
The Imperial Guards of Northern Qi

297
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:16,733
have an empty reputation in my opinion.

298
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:20,239
The spy network in Shangjing City is perfect

299
00:22:20,358 --> 00:22:21,649
under my command.

300
00:22:22,754 --> 00:22:24,210
I'll put it this way.

301
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:27,122
The imperial army doesn't even patrol here.

302
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,539
That means

303
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:31,722
I'm hiding this place well.

304
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,929
Sounds impressive

305
00:22:35,936 --> 00:22:37,027
but something feels off.

306
00:22:37,108 --> 00:22:39,479
What feels off? Just tell me.

307
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,570
It's perfect.

308
00:22:44,694 --> 00:22:47,503
Since your brother asked you to follow me,

309
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,529
I'll show him respect.

310
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,162
You can learn from me by observing.

311
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:56,009
Well, you can follow us on our next outing.

312
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,040
What? An outing?

313
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,999
- With whom?   - The spies.

314
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,519
The spies get to go on an outing normally?

315
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,719
What's wrong?

316
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,160
All of us left home to a dangerous place.

317
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,800
It's inevitable to feel fear.

318
00:23:06,944 --> 00:23:09,322
I was thinking that we could gather when we were free.

319
00:23:09,592 --> 00:23:10,760
Go on a trip and have a meal together.

320
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:13,122
Even reading together is fine.

321
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,562
Well, I'm just making an assumption.

322
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,209
When you and the spies are gathering,

323
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:22,279
what will you do if Northern Qi captures all of you?

324
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,362
No one has found anything weird about it.

325
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:31,719
It's obvious that I, Guo Bao Kun, am a genius in commanding spies.

326
00:23:31,814 --> 00:23:33,762
Your brother found a treasure in me.

327
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,120
Great.

328
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,840
Unfortunately, you'll be returning soon.

329
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,140
Where to?

330
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,579
The capital.

331
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,489
My brother asked me to summon you back.

332
00:23:41,726 --> 00:23:42,946
Why?

333
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:46,998
I don't know. He said he had some kind of agreement with you.

334
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,679
He promised to save your father.

335
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:51,074
- It's true?   - He said the time has come.

336
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,439
Did he ask me to do anything?

337
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,121
I don't know. Go ask him yourself.

338
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,642
What about this place?

339
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:02,066
Is he leaving this place to you?

340
00:24:02,147 --> 00:24:03,160
What's wrong with leaving it to me?

341
00:24:03,254 --> 00:24:05,424
Isn't it just taking them out on a trip and gathering?

342
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,689
But...

343
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:09,745
I must send you back first.

344
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:11,515
Fine.

345
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,259
What are you doing?

346
00:24:17,218 --> 00:24:18,438
What are these?

347
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:19,882
There's no rush.

348
00:24:21,337 --> 00:24:22,696
I'm packing up. We'll leave immediately.

349
00:24:22,885 --> 00:24:24,176
Shouldn't we plan this further?

350
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,080
What's there to plan?

351
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,199
The journey is long. We can think about it along the way.

352
00:24:28,286 --> 00:24:30,337
That's how you catch the unprepared enemy by surprise.

353
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:32,962
If you are swift enough,

354
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:35,009
the enemy can't even react.

355
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:39,120
Guo Bao Kun and Fan Si Zhe left the oil shop

356
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,719
and are leaving the city. They even had brought their bags?

357
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,382
Yes. They were discovered as soon as they left.

358
00:24:43,478 --> 00:24:44,922
Everyone was guarding the place.

359
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:47,242
They are returning to the Qing Kingdom.

360
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:49,019
Seems like it.

361
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,019
What should we do?

362
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,460
Should we let them go?

363
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,059
How do I know?

364
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,860
Why don't you

365
00:25:02,921 --> 00:25:04,402
go and ask His Majesty?

366
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,209
Doesn't he want to keep Guo Bao Kun here?

367
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,519
His Majesty says

368
00:25:07,653 --> 00:25:10,503
you are in charge of Fan Si Zhe and Guo Bao Kun's matters.

369
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:18,002
Is someone replacing Guo Bao Kun?

370
00:25:18,094 --> 00:25:19,585
No. They left suddenly.

371
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,722
I think we should let them go.

372
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,562
There's no point keeping them here.

373
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,322
Let's leave a good impression.

374
00:25:31,471 --> 00:25:33,081
Perhaps he might come back again.

375
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:35,842
I don't care. I'm just a messenger.

376
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,220
You can make the decision.

377
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,529
Can you cherish the saintess?

378
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:44,159
Don't let me do everything

379
00:25:44,287 --> 00:25:45,360
while all of you are idling.

380
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,412
I am the saintess. The saintess!

381
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:50,120
Idling? Oh, right.

382
00:25:50,254 --> 00:25:52,612
His Majesty asked you to write Fan Xian a letter when you're free.

383
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,279
Why should I write him a letter?

384
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:56,600
Ask him why he stopped writing "Dream of the Red Chamber"

385
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,279
after going back to Southern Qing.

386
00:25:58,382 --> 00:25:59,922
That's too much.

387
00:26:02,703 --> 00:26:04,322
He only knows how to read books.

388
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,882
- Let them go.   - Yes.

389
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,499
I'll go with him and take a look.

390
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,478
Why didn't he write the letter? Why did he ask me to do it instead?

391
00:26:20,628 --> 00:26:21,848
It's Fan Xian.

392
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,362
What's wrong with Fan Xian?

393
00:26:24,703 --> 00:26:27,682
Don't you understand him well?

394
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,209
Understand him, my foot!

395
00:26:31,338 --> 00:26:33,134
You are the saintess now.

396
00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:34,784
Mind your words. Keep them elegant.

397
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:40,320
There's nothing between the two of us.

398
00:26:40,478 --> 00:26:42,042
Do you think we do?

399
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,320
All of you...

400
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,620
I...

401
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:46,162
You're so annoying!

402
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,610
Duo Duo, remember to write the letter!

403
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,130
Ask him to continue the story!

404
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,969
Vegetables!

405
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:58,868
- Vegetables!   - Make way!

406
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,860
Saintess.

407
00:27:18,342 --> 00:27:19,562
How is it?

408
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,719
They have been acting sneakily.

409
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,340
Many people think there's something wrong with them but we suppressed them.

410
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,262
Where did they get the cart?

411
00:27:25,396 --> 00:27:26,616
They rent it from a cart shop.

412
00:27:27,127 --> 00:27:29,162
- Where are they renting the cart to?   - To the border.

413
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,160
They just go straight to the border

414
00:27:33,263 --> 00:27:34,722
without thinking about switching carts?

415
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:38,237
I know, right? The shop owner reported them to the officials immediately

416
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:39,642
but we suppressed the reports.

417
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:42,562
Saintess, should we let them return to Southern Qing safely?

418
00:27:43,015 --> 00:27:44,235
That's right.

419
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,762
We have to follow them all the way then.

420
00:27:49,854 --> 00:27:51,122
Thanks for your hard work.

421
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,242
Everything is normal.

422
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,449
You were smart.

423
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:08,882
You said we were going to the border

424
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,842
instead of the Qing Kingdom.

425
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,449
Staying hidden at all times

426
00:28:15,023 --> 00:28:17,202
is our first mission as a spy.

427
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,180
I'm quite talented, right?

428
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,140
Si Zhe,

429
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,460
it seems like

430
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,810
you are also someone with great potential.

431
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,770
Bao Kun,

432
00:28:29,088 --> 00:28:31,738
I was rude before.

433
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,410
Today, I finally understand

434
00:28:34,534 --> 00:28:37,544
why Fan Xian left you alone in Northern Qi.

435
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,322
If the Qing Kingdom is full of talents like us,

436
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:46,002
the world will be at peace.

437
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,202
Well said, Bao Kun.

438
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,019
Lord Fan,

439
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,962
I have two pieces of news.

440
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,962
One. Fan Wu Jiu has confessed

441
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,802
at the Ministry of Justice.

442
00:29:06,526 --> 00:29:09,617
- What did he say?   - I worked at His Highness' residence.

443
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,762
Yuan Meng knows Prince Hong Cheng.

444
00:29:15,277 --> 00:29:18,917
Prince Hong Cheng is always with His Highness.

445
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,922
That was how I knew Yuan Meng.

446
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,322
Yuan Meng switched to Moon Embracing Pavilion.

447
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,842
I thought it was good business

448
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:31,882
so I helped Moon Embracing Pavilion

449
00:29:32,526 --> 00:29:35,722
make a few indentures behind His Highness' back.

450
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,642
Unfortunately, someone discovered what I did

451
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,522
so I hired someone to murder the person.

452
00:29:44,758 --> 00:29:46,290
After that,

453
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,642
someone was murdered.

454
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,202
I was too greedy.

455
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,322
I did everything.

456
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,539
He made it clear

457
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,162
that it was all his fault.

458
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:09,238
He said he purposely used your name to hire the assassin

459
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:10,728
to frame you.

460
00:30:11,486 --> 00:30:12,848
That's illogical.

461
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,360
Since he used my name,

462
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,202
why would he kill the assassin?

463
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,461
He was already being investigated

464
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:20,271
for being the murderer.

465
00:30:20,478 --> 00:30:22,487
He had no choice but to kill the assassin.

466
00:30:22,712 --> 00:30:25,634
When he said that, your name was cleared.

467
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:26,882
I was worried at first.

468
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,759
I was worried that he might accuse you

469
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,202
and say you are his accomplice.

470
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,259
Prince Cheng Ze's assassin becoming an accomplice of mine

471
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,846
with my current situation with Prince Cheng Ze?

472
00:30:33,927 --> 00:30:35,322
No one would believe that.

473
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:37,842
He no longer cares about me now.

474
00:30:38,392 --> 00:30:40,842
He is only trying his best to distance himself from Prince Cheng Ze.

475
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:43,055
Can he do that?

476
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,660
Impossible.

477
00:30:44,931 --> 00:30:46,842
Do you think the people in the capital can be easily fooled?

478
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,518
The Ministry of Justice said the testimony was fine.

479
00:30:49,621 --> 00:30:51,221
They were just turning a blind eye to it.

480
00:30:51,302 --> 00:30:52,712
Everyone knows deep down.

481
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:55,900
You said there were two pieces of news. What's the other one?

482
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:58,851
Someone is here to visit you again.

483
00:30:58,932 --> 00:31:00,292
I'm very sick. I'm accepting guests.

484
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:03,489
It's Lai Ming Cheng from the Censorate.

485
00:31:05,086 --> 00:31:07,522
- The one who complained about me?   - Yes. It's him.

486
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:12,958
He is here to visit me?

487
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,361
What is he trying to do?

488
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,849
Lord Fan is extremely ill.

489
00:31:18,102 --> 00:31:20,202
However, he insisted on meeting you

490
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:22,983
when he heard you came to visit, Lord Lai.

491
00:31:26,534 --> 00:31:28,202
How big is your residence?

492
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:31,499
My residence?

493
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:33,059
Fan Residence.

494
00:31:33,573 --> 00:31:35,602
Fan Residence, well...

495
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,120
- I don't know.   - The size of every official's residence

496
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:43,209
is limited to their position.

497
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,165
If the Fan Residence exceeds the permitted size,

498
00:31:46,246 --> 00:31:48,722
I must make a complaint.

499
00:31:50,845 --> 00:31:52,722
Why don't you measure the place?

500
00:31:54,023 --> 00:31:55,482
I didn't prepare for it today.

501
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:56,800
Do you have a ruler?

502
00:31:56,911 --> 00:31:59,202
Wait for me. I'll borrow one for you.

503
00:31:59,325 --> 00:32:00,545
There's no need!

504
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:27,249
Am I wasting time by measuring alone?

505
00:32:28,054 --> 00:32:29,815
I don't know. No one has ever done this anyway.

506
00:32:29,927 --> 00:32:31,976
Why don't I help you out and we can measure it together?

507
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,362
Forget about it today.

508
00:32:34,822 --> 00:32:36,042
I'll do it again next time.

509
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:43,642
Lord Fan, why are you getting up?

510
00:32:43,747 --> 00:32:45,449
Didn't I ask you not to get up?

511
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:48,074
- Lord Fan.   - Is Censor Lai here?

512
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,962
Censor Lai.

513
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,489
I won't get up

514
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:54,562
since I'm in this condition.

515
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,890
Lord Fan, I asked the imperial physician.

516
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,762
He said you were seriously injured.

517
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,242
I bought some red dates

518
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,922
to replenish your Qi and blood.

519
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:10,059
Thank you.

520
00:33:10,302 --> 00:33:12,302
Officials in the Censorate

521
00:33:12,383 --> 00:33:14,202
depends on our salary.

522
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,162
Unlike the other officials.

523
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,202
You might have heard this.

524
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,600
In the Judicial Bureau,

525
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:22,362
the poorest people are censors like us.

526
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,682
I wanted to buy some tonic for you

527
00:33:24,943 --> 00:33:26,802
but I'm unable to make ends meet.

528
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:29,322
I couldn't afford it. Please forgive me.

529
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,265
Red dates are quite good.

530
00:33:31,346 --> 00:33:32,842
I like red dates.

531
00:33:33,355 --> 00:33:34,842
Censor Lai, please sit down.

532
00:33:34,952 --> 00:33:36,631
Qi Nian, serve him tea.

533
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,420
- I'll leave after a while.   - Please sit down.

534
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,082
Let me pour tea for you.

535
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,033
Lord Fan.

536
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,562
Your father is poisoned

537
00:33:48,671 --> 00:33:49,962
and you are seriously injured.

538
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:52,455
Was it caused by Prince Cheng Ze?

539
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:57,743
I can only say

540
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,042
that there's no evidence so it's hard to say.

541
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,959
Have you heard about

542
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,279
- Fan Wu Jiu's testimony?   - I have.

543
00:34:04,432 --> 00:34:07,173
A retainer like him dared involve himself

544
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:09,741
in the murder of Moon Embracing Pavilion behind Prince Cheng Ze's back?

545
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,402
It's obviously nonsense!

546
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,682
- So?   - So I want to complain about Prince Cheng Ze.

547
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:20,419
You are going to complain about a prince?

548
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,650
As a censor,

549
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,122
I should be fair and just.

550
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,319
Dare I ask

551
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:31,402
why you tell me this?

552
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,202
So far,

553
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:34,882
the investigation of the corruption case

554
00:34:35,127 --> 00:34:37,079
shows that all the involved officials in the capital

555
00:34:37,187 --> 00:34:39,478
are closely related to Prince Cheng Ze

556
00:34:39,576 --> 00:34:42,280
when we check against the name list in descending order.

557
00:34:42,391 --> 00:34:44,122
If we keep investigating,

558
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,959
we will see how deep the problem goes.

559
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:49,162
It's too hard for the Censorate

560
00:34:49,351 --> 00:34:51,041
to keep investigating.

561
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:55,611
Are you saying that you can't investigate it anymore?

562
00:34:58,189 --> 00:35:00,399
Unless the Overwatch Council

563
00:35:00,511 --> 00:35:03,400
can provide us with the related dossier.

564
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:06,682
- Are you asking me for help?   - No.

565
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:10,282
I want to work with the Overwatch Council in this corruption investigation.

566
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,202
You should go to the Overwatch Council then.

567
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,540
Why did you come to my house?

568
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,962
I'm not close to anyone else in the Overwatch Council

569
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,280
except you.

570
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:27,962
I just complained about you

571
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:30,122
so we are acquainted.

572
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,970
How are we acquainted?

573
00:35:33,694 --> 00:35:36,224
Investigating corruption is a matter of the kingdom.

574
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:37,819
What's wrong with that?

575
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,465
If I help you,

576
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,962
will you still complain about me?

577
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:42,802
Of course.

578
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,682
You are going to complain about me

579
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,013
and still want me to help you.

580
00:35:47,133 --> 00:35:49,282
This is not a personal grudge.

581
00:35:49,415 --> 00:35:50,864
You can't mix them together.

582
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,610
The law is strict.

583
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:54,562
How can we make it into a private deal?

584
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:59,162
You want to ask for help

585
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:01,121
yet you won't give me any benefit.

586
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,882
Forget it if you don't want to.

587
00:36:11,077 --> 00:36:12,297
Fine.

588
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,140
What?

589
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,322
I can work with you.

590
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:21,450
Qi Nian, bring Censor Lai to the Overwatch Council.

591
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,240
He can see any related dossier

592
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,639
at the First Bureau.

593
00:36:24,742 --> 00:36:25,962
All right.

594
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,939
Lord Fan,

595
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,530
you are different from what I imagined.

596
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,459
Censor Lai.

597
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,479
Although you complained about me

598
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,362
and will still complain about me in the future,

599
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,610
I keep feeling that we might become friends

600
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,570
one day in the future.

601
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:47,899
Impossible.

602
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:49,854
Those who work with official matters

603
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,122
shouldn't have a personal relationship.

604
00:36:52,362 --> 00:36:54,442
- You are right.   - However,

605
00:36:54,727 --> 00:36:55,947
Lord Fan,

606
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:59,400
we might be able to work together

607
00:36:59,534 --> 00:37:01,242
to investigate the corruption.

608
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,880
For the kingdom.

609
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:05,922
I want to ask another question.

610
00:37:06,612 --> 00:37:09,816
- When will your illness be treated?   - What's wrong?

611
00:37:09,982 --> 00:37:11,174
When you've recovered,

612
00:37:11,255 --> 00:37:13,842
I want to complain about you in the Moon Embracing Pavilion case.

613
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,762
How long can you finish reading the dossier at the First Bureau?

614
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:21,482
One day is enough.

615
00:37:21,777 --> 00:37:23,922
Two days. I'll attend the audience in two days.

616
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,842
You can recover in two days?

617
00:37:25,968 --> 00:37:27,129
After eating your dates,

618
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,329
I mustn't delay you in complaining about me.

619
00:37:29,703 --> 00:37:30,923
Great.

620
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,362
See you in the hall two days later.

621
00:37:37,697 --> 00:37:39,362
He has quite the character.

622
00:37:39,463 --> 00:37:40,802
Let me send him off.

623
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:48,442
You are a rare case.

624
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,122
You just got complained by the Censorate

625
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,282
and you got another one coming.

626
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,242
You even brought me along.

627
00:37:56,222 --> 00:37:58,322
I haven't heard of an official like you.

628
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,620
Indeed.

629
00:37:59,701 --> 00:38:01,421
People do favors when they become an official

630
00:38:01,502 --> 00:38:03,632
but I offended other people when I became one.

631
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:05,522
So, you do know that.

632
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,562
- I was wrong.   - Who said you were wrong?

633
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,315
Harming others and being corrupt is wrong.

634
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,682
Doing things well will cause trouble.

635
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:18,763
I'm afraid of everything

636
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,289
except for trouble.

637
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,140
Are you all right?

638
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:31,242
I'm fine.

639
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:34,489
As long as both of you have recovered.

640
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,242
Why does he greet you?

641
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:42,899
What's wrong?

642
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,281
Since becoming a censor, Lai Ming Cheng has become a rabid dog.

643
00:38:46,362 --> 00:38:48,202
I've only seen him bite and not smile.

644
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:50,930
I've never seen him nod to other people.

645
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,369
I still appreciate an official like Censor Lai.

646
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,020
It's cloudy.

647
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,682
I think it's going to rain.

648
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,602
Let's go. His Majesty is waiting.

649
00:39:14,776 --> 00:39:16,146
This is not the way to the hall.

650
00:39:16,304 --> 00:39:17,952
The audience is held in the Imperial Study today.

651
00:39:18,246 --> 00:39:19,816
Why? Shouldn't it be held in the hall?

652
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,073
His Majesty said the Censorate is complaining about you.

653
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,540
What position do you hold?

654
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,482
You have no right to be in the hall

655
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:28,722
and waste other official's time.

656
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,162
Fine. I don't deserve it.

657
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:44,819
Where do I sit?

658
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,580
Sit?

659
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:49,202
- Stand at the back.   - Not only that.

660
00:39:50,503 --> 00:39:52,426
The Overwatch Council is so daring?

661
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,322
Excuse me. Sorry.

662
00:39:57,487 --> 00:39:59,322
Everyone is panicking.

663
00:39:59,669 --> 00:40:01,842
- Yes.   - Indeed.

664
00:40:06,094 --> 00:40:07,314
Lord Xin!

665
00:40:09,321 --> 00:40:11,242
- Lord Fan.   - Why are you hiding here?

666
00:40:12,049 --> 00:40:14,962
I'm trying to see what books are here.

667
00:40:15,632 --> 00:40:17,202
This is a good place.

668
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,842
No one can see you.

669
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,282
Let me ask you something.

670
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:24,162
Why are so many people here today?

671
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,762
His Majesty said

672
00:40:26,013 --> 00:40:28,296
he won't force anyone to come today.

673
00:40:28,407 --> 00:40:30,442
- It depends on their free will.   - Free will?

674
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,482
All of them are here.

675
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,882
Free will cannot be trusted nowadays.

676
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,720
Look.

677
00:40:37,846 --> 00:40:39,282
Even those people are here.

678
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,240
None of us dares to be absent.

679
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,540
Right?

680
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,402
His Majesty is here!

681
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:54,831
This is not a hall.

682
00:40:54,935 --> 00:40:56,562
Spare the formalities.

683
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:01,819
All of you, sit down.

684
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,980
Relax.

685
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,540
Fan Xian.

686
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,980
I'm here.

687
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,882
- Lai Ming Cheng.   - I'm here.

688
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,459
Are you still going to complain about him?

689
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:24,242
Yes. I'm not just complaining about him.

690
00:41:24,423 --> 00:41:27,402
I'm also complaining about Fan Jian, the Minister of Revenue.

691
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,100
Your Majesty,

692
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,282
before Censor Lai complains about me,

693
00:41:32,518 --> 00:41:34,282
can I first make a complaint myself?

694
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:37,738
Say it.

695
00:41:40,629 --> 00:41:41,750
Your Majesty, take a look.

696
00:41:41,927 --> 00:41:44,360
This is luxurious jewelry I got an appraisal.

697
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,762
It is worth a lot of money.

698
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,202
Where does it come from?

699
00:41:47,366 --> 00:41:50,576
A few days ago, I visited my elders with the princess.

700
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,282
They simply gave it to me.

701
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:57,559
They simply gave me something that's worth a lot of money.

702
00:41:57,643 --> 00:42:00,042
I'm sure the elder has more in his residence.

703
00:42:00,182 --> 00:42:01,680
His residence is built around the hill and forest.

704
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,999
He has collected precious stones from around the world.

705
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,320
He even owns many courtesans.

706
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:07,752
His extravagance shocks people.

707
00:42:08,551 --> 00:42:11,361
Who is the person you speak of?

708
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:16,082
He is the president of the Overwatch Council, Chen Ping Ping.

709
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:18,915
He's so daring.

710
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:27,920
I'm complaining about Chen Ping Ping for being involved in corruption.

711
00:42:28,023 --> 00:42:29,802
Your Majesty, please investigate him.

712
00:42:29,975 --> 00:42:31,195
President Chen.

713
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,060
Yes.

714
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,479
Do you have anything to say?

715
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:35,856
Lord Fan,

716
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:41,100
is it wrong to give my things to others?

717
00:42:41,181 --> 00:42:43,032
I'm not the one who decides that.

718
00:42:43,392 --> 00:42:47,241
The imperial court is investigating corruption

719
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,202
to rectify the officials' behavior and uphold the kingdom's law.

720
00:42:50,351 --> 00:42:51,760
At a time like this,

721
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,322
I dare not accept any gifts.

722
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,540
Your Majesty,

723
00:42:57,702 --> 00:42:59,242
can I explain this?
