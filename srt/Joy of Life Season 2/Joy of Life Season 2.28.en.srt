00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:30,994
(Joy of Life Season 2)

2
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:33,965
(Episode 28)

3
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,842
Does such a musket actually exist?

4
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:38,064
This musket is different.

5
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,519
It was brought here by Young Lady.

6
00:01:39,622 --> 00:01:41,682
- From where?   - The Divine Temple.

7
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,749
It's from the Divine Temple

8
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,442
but a part is still missing?

9
00:01:46,616 --> 00:01:48,722
- It was destroyed.   - By whom?

10
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,202
That's none of your business.

11
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,480
What you need to know

12
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:53,556
is to be prepared by using it

13
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,266
to protect Fan Xian.

14
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,040
What next?

15
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,320
Can you fix it?

16
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,680
Not me.

17
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,799
Protecting Fan Xian

18
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,199
is a secret.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,280
I won't tell anyone.

20
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,442
- Does it include my brother?   - Yes.

21
00:02:19,718 --> 00:02:20,958
Why did you choose me?

22
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,319
What is

23
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,239
the most important thing in this world to you?

24
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,599
My brother, of course.

25
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,120
That is the reason.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,442
He left just like that?

27
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,002
Did you understand what Lord Fan said?

28
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,400
I don't understand as well.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,359
- See you tonight.   - See you tonight.

30
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:52,042
- Farewell.   - Hurry.

31
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:12,694
See you later tonight.

32
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:14,069
See you.

33
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:45,958
- What is it?   - I saw the merchants releasing pigeons outside.

34
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,160
I didn't know what they were doing so I caught one of them.

35
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:51,902
Are they sending a message to the capital?

36
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,350
The capital needs to know what happened in the mountains.

37
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:59,385
Why? Aren't they the bosses?

38
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,639
Can't they decide whether to buy the treasury bonds or not?

39
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,869
A tree can't stand without its roots.

40
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:07,586
Are you saying that all of them have roots to support them?

41
00:04:07,976 --> 00:04:09,202
Of course.

42
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,162
I'll release it then.

43
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,602
You shouldn't capture it again. Seriously.

44
00:04:19,614 --> 00:04:21,813
Fan Si Zhe, you are capable.

45
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,174
You can even speak on stage.

46
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,760
Of course.

47
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,119
Ruo Ruo,

48
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,359
let me tell you.

49
00:04:28,462 --> 00:04:30,733
What Fan Xian said was amazing

50
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,159
but I've never heard of it before.

51
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,599
Think about it.

52
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,442
If I've never heard about it,

53
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,040
do you think the merchants will understand?

54
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,830
The words Fan Xian mentioned

55
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,119
such as national fortune and wealth.

56
00:04:43,237 --> 00:04:45,762
The officials... The merchants wouldn't understand a thing.

57
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,629
The only word that moves them

58
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,719
is royalty.

59
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,080
Why are you feeling proud?

60
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,359
Shouldn't I feel proud?

61
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,910
Speaking of feeling proud,

62
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,520
it's still lacking something.

63
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,869
I do feel a little worried instead.

64
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:03,359
Why do you feel worried?

65
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,119
I thought

66
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,790
they would give all their money

67
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,669
when I mentioned His Majesty.

68
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,069
But if news was sent to the capital...

69
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,679
What's wrong?

70
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:17,282
Treasury bonds are something unprecedented.

71
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,960
What if

72
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,119
it is against the kingdom's law?

73
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,479
It's fine.

74
00:05:22,784 --> 00:05:24,064
That's good to hear.

75
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,669
You spoke during the latter half.

76
00:05:26,956 --> 00:05:28,479
You also mentioned that His Majesty doesn't lie.

77
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,600
If something happens,

78
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,960
I'll just hand you over.

79
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,500
I'm sure he won't do that.

80
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,509
I was helping him.

81
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,842
I...

82
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:43,439
No. This must not happen.

83
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,309
We are quite close.

84
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,522
Yes. It won't happen.

85
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,320
Treasury bonds

86
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,882
are not against the law.

87
00:05:51,982 --> 00:05:53,733
Of course, it is!

88
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,960
What treasury bonds?

89
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,280
This has been unheard of

90
00:05:58,383 --> 00:06:00,373
since the establishment of the Qing Kingdom.

91
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,040
This man is audacious.

92
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:06,270
Sharing the royal family's debt?

93
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,980
It's ridiculous!

94
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:09,421
It goes against the law of the kingdom!

95
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:10,808
As the saying goes,

96
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,549
it's the father's fault for not educating the son.

97
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
In my opinion,

98
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,720
we should first capture Fan Xian.

99
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:19,756
Next, axe me from my position of minister.

100
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,130
I fail to educate my family,

101
00:06:22,212 --> 00:06:23,882
and I'm embarrassed to become an official.

102
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:27,556
I should go back to Danzhou and retire.

103
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,710
President Chen, wake up.

104
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,830
You are venting your frustration. Why are you calling me?

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,682
I'm sure you have an opinion

106
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,509
about the treasury bonds.

107
00:06:57,474 --> 00:06:59,955
- I see nothing.   - Are you blind?

108
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:01,557
The authority of the Imperial Treasury

109
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:03,383
 is not within the Overwatch Council's jurisdiction.

110
00:07:04,385 --> 00:07:06,722
- It's out of my control.   - I'm not talking about the Imperial Treasury.

111
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:08,040
I'm talking about the treasury bonds.

112
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,429
Interesting.

113
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,960
I've never heard about it.

114
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,479
It's interesting indeed.

115
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,520
Treasury bonds

116
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,189
are unheard of.

117
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,840
According to the Qing Kingdom's law,

118
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:20,524
there's nothing about treasury bonds.

119
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,910
If he is to be punished,

120
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,162
there's no law we can use.

121
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,119
What do you think

122
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,642
about this new thing, Cheng Ze?

123
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,642
Crown Prince,

124
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:35,318
I'm still grounded to reflect on my mistakes.

125
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,559
I dare not go out the door if His Majesty doesn't summon me

126
00:07:37,654 --> 00:07:39,564
let alone discuss politics.

127
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,522
It's all right to say it.

128
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,559
There's no law

129
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,242
and reason to follow.

130
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,030
Only Divine Judgment can punish him.

131
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,720
Everyone is here.

132
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,362
Please come with me.

133
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,159
Where is His Majesty?

134
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,520
I don't know.

135
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,790
If you don't know, where are you taking us to?

136
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,280
Harem Garden.

137
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,069
Harem Garden in the middle of the night?

138
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,239
What for?

139
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,630
Moving flowers.

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,280
Eunuch Hou,

141
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,109
are you sure this is His Majesty's edict?

142
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,389
Lord Fan, even with the world's courage,

143
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,522
I dare not fake His Majesty's edict.

144
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,629
What even is this?

145
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,482
It's just moving flowers.

146
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:04,122
Just a few of us?

147
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,400
Where are the servants?

148
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,482
His Majesty has already forbidden

149
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,919
any servants

150
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,642
to get near this patch of land.

151
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,869
Lord Fan, you've worked hard.

152
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,882
The Chrysanthemum Viewing Festival is held once every three years.

153
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:53,162
It has always been held in Xuankong Temple previously, right?

154
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,919
Indeed.

155
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,230
They are not some kind of rare flowers.

156
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,109
Why do we need to send it there ourselves?

157
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,799
His Majesty likes them.

158
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,839
His Majesty wants to tell us

159
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:09,319
that he prioritizes the Chrysanthemum Viewing Festival,

160
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,830
but why would he tell us at a time like this?

161
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,240
I remember the festival wasn't held around this time in previous years.

162
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:19,601
The date has been changed.

163
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,790
When has it been changed?

164
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:24,236
It has been changed to the near future.

165
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,319
The exact date is yet to be confirmed.

166
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,479
What are we waiting for?

167
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,839
For Lord Fan

168
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:31,757
to return to the capital from Mount Cang.

169
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,430
Why do we need to wait for Fan Xian to hold the festival?

170
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:39,164
That is His Majesty's intention.

171
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,670
That means His Majesty prioritizes the festival,

172
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:43,919
but it will only be held

173
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,710
when Fan Xian returns to the capital?

174
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,190
Your Highness, you are right.

175
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,950
His Majesty wants to remind us

176
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,719
that the festival is important,

177
00:10:51,838 --> 00:10:53,118
but Fan Xian

178
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,240
is more important.

179
00:11:09,388 --> 00:11:11,630
Did you leave it in the capital?

180
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,719
I took it from the cart

181
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,040
and put it in your room.

182
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,520
How could such a huge box

183
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:18,191
go missing suddenly?

184
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,470
What is inside the box?

185
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:22,438
Something from the Divine Temple?

186
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,509
You brought it out from the Divine Temple?

187
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,359
Is it a divine weapon?

188
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,590
It is the ultimate weapon if it is completely assembled.

189
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,142
- Is something missing?   - The main body is gone.

190
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,040
Everything else is here.

191
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,629
Only a box is missing.

192
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,629
That means the person who stole it knows what it is at least.

193
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,550
Not many people know what it is.

194
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,480
Who is it?

195
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,480
Lord Fan, there's someone over there!

196
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,290
Impressive. I didn't even notice him.

197
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,598
Qi Nian, protect Wan Er.

198
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:55,736
Yes.

199
00:12:32,341 --> 00:12:33,482
Teacher.

200
00:12:39,113 --> 00:12:40,393
My dear.

201
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,559
Commander Jing?

202
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,120
Didn't all of you return to camp?

203
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,350
Our order is to guard Mount Cang and protect you.

204
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,002
Shadow?

205
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,190
Wang Qi Nian is quite alert.

206
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,552
In the end, everyone is from the Overwatch Council.

207
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,080
Are you here for a team building activity?

208
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:05,842
What is a team building activity?

209
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,402
We have many new terms.

210
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,190
Just get used to it.

211
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:13,162
Teacher, why did you come to Mount Cang?

212
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,109
Because you are here.

213
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,880
Lord Fan.

214
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,736
Did you lose something?

215
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,120
Were you eavesdropping?

216
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,000
I think it's Official Wu.

217
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,360
What do you mean?

218
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,789
He has been following you in secret

219
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,909
because he wants to fight against Official Wu.

220
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,799
Lord Fan,

221
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,670
you were taught by Official Wu.

222
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,642
I don't mind if we fight.

223
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,240
Don't move.

224
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,909
If you move, I'll poison you to death.

225
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,070
Everything's fine, right?

226
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,600
I think it should be fine.

227
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:50,882
Leave!

228
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,799
Just pretend we don't exist.

229
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,430
You can pretend that I don't exist as well.

230
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:02,289
All of them

231
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,720
are acting mysteriously.

232
00:14:04,584 --> 00:14:05,984
Teacher, let's go. You're at Mount Cang.

233
00:14:06,065 --> 00:14:08,345
Come and have supper at my place. Wait. It's this way.

234
00:14:08,426 --> 00:14:09,626
Hold on.

235
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,122
Let me tell you something.

236
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,909
I went to Jiangnan to investigate a murder case.

237
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,749
After the murderer arrived at the capital,

238
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,655
he went missing.

239
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,749
There are two possibilities. One, it was Official Wu.

240
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,199
What is the other possibility?

241
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,590
Someone hid the murderer

242
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,430
in the capital.

243
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,187
Even the Overwatch Council can't find anything?

244
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,799
Of course.

245
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,341
How many people in the capital have such an ability?

246
00:14:39,418 --> 00:14:41,648
Wait, that's a clue as well.

247
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,789
I've come to stay with you in Mount Cang for a few days.

248
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:50,423
This case is very strange.

249
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,039
I've been investigating in this direction since returning to the capital.

250
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,190
I wanted to meet you after I got a result.

251
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:03,448
I am in the dark.

252
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,159
Teacher.

253
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,310
You've nearly treated

254
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,509
your wife's tuberculosis.

255
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,120
When you go back,

256
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,480
let her take one pill each day.

257
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,480
She will be treated

258
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,240
when she finishes the medicine.

259
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:25,557
Eternal union.

260
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:28,567
His Majesty wants to see it.

261
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,070
So do I.

262
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:34,909
Why don't you retire? I'll support you.

263
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,319
Nonsense.

264
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,362
- I'm serious.   - Enough.

265
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:41,190
The grandmaster is hiding in the capital.

266
00:15:42,514 --> 00:15:44,202
If I don't find him,

267
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:46,122
I can't sleep and eat at peace.

268
00:15:46,272 --> 00:15:47,312
Teacher.

269
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,749
Stop it.

270
00:15:49,472 --> 00:15:51,062
Give me a grandson soon.

271
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,120
When he grows up,

272
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:55,841
I'll teach him how to use poison.

273
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,400
I'm going back.

274
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:01,577
Promise me.

275
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,959
Don't risk your life.

276
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,326
Don't worry.

277
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:05,799
I'm more afraid of death than you.

278
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,240
Mr. Wu Zhu.

279
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,640
You took the box?

280
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,839
- Come with me.   - You've been sitting here and no one has discovered you?

281
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,400
It's reasonable.

282
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,710
After all, who are you?

283
00:16:56,944 --> 00:16:57,984
Mr. Wu Zhu,

284
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,789
Shadow seems interested in you.

285
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,319
He has been trying to fight you.

286
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:02,727
I'm not interested.

287
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:46,349
Mr. Wu Zhu, what are you looking for?

288
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,280
Is there something inside?

289
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:28,839
Young Lady used to live in Mount Cang.

290
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:44,856
My mother hid this?

291
00:18:44,975 --> 00:18:46,337
They were supposed to be destroyed.

292
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,359
Just like this box.

293
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:52,922
Did my mother destroy it herself?

294
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:55,319
- Why?   - She followed the law.

295
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,110
Items that are not from this era

296
00:18:57,352 --> 00:18:58,631
cannot be kept.

297
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:00,039
Who's law?

298
00:19:00,368 --> 00:19:02,328
- The Divine Temple's?   - I think so.

299
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,720
You think so?

300
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,160
I forgot.

301
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:11,983
In that case,

302
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,150
why didn't she destroy all of them?

303
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,320
Why did she leave these three items?

304
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,829
The items that are not from this era

305
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,162
cannot be kept for this reset world.

306
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,910
History should not be affected.

307
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,559
However, you are different.

308
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,359
You are a mistake.

309
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,280
A mistake?

310
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,162
You are from this world

311
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,190
and also originate from the past.

312
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,480
You are a mistake.

313
00:19:41,095 --> 00:19:42,375
An error.

314
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,079
An unknown variable.

315
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,319
You are also a logical flaw.

316
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,989
These are Young Lady's words.

317
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,910
Does my memory

318
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,240
come from the Divine Temple?

319
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,720
I don't know.

320
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,720
I'm just repeating what she said.

321
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,120
Young Lady left you

322
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,480
a glimmer of hope.

323
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,360
Fix it,

324
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,749
and you'll get three chances to change fate.

325
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,599
How do I fix it?

326
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:14,839
Go to Jiangnan.

327
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,280
Visit the Three Great Workshops.

328
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,349
The Three Great Workshops

329
00:20:28,598 --> 00:20:30,229
is the foundation of the Imperial Treasury.

330
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:34,362
Everyone knows that the foundation of the Imperial Treasury's predecessor

331
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,162
is the Three Great Workshops.

332
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:38,082
All the novelty items from previous years

333
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,789
came from Jiangnan.

334
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:40,919
Let me ask all of you.

335
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,999
Who is controlling the Three Great Workshops now?

336
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:45,080
It's the Ming family of Jiangnan.

337
00:20:45,168 --> 00:20:47,837
The Ming family has been following Princess Yun Rui's orders.

338
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,190
Will they really hand over the Three Great Workshops?

339
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:52,799
Even if the Ming family is the richest in Jiangnan,

340
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:54,480
they still can't go against the imperial edict.

341
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,390
I'm sure they won't.

342
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,680
What are they handing over

343
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,160
and how they do it

344
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,520
are crucial.

345
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:03,041
We are all businessmen.

346
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,549
Don't you know that?

347
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:07,222
In that case, the future is bleak for Fan Xian

348
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,989
after taking over the Imperial Treasury.

349
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,110
That's right. We mustn't let him fool us.

350
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,150
If we buy treasury bonds from him,

351
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,829
how will he pay us back in the future?

352
00:21:16,111 --> 00:21:18,054
You are right. I will never buy it.

353
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:19,415
Then, are we leaving

354
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,282
after sleeping one night?

355
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,349
The person who buys is an idiot.

356
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,670
Yes. The person who buys is an idiot.

357
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,840
- Idiot.   - Cheers.

358
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,200
Cheers.

359
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:35,400
These are items from another era.

360
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,002
What is inside the Three Great Workshops? They can even fix this?

361
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:40,470
You will find out when you see for yourself.

362
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,950
I must go to Jiangnan.

363
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:44,759
I must help my mother

364
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,119
take back her assets.

365
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,950
Why didn't she place them both together?

366
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,589
Can't she place them both in the box?

367
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,870
Young Lady left them for you

368
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,950
but she didn't want you to fix them.

369
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,762
Why?

370
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,390
When the Divine Temple changes destiny,

371
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,190
it leaves a mark in the future.

372
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,069
I don't understand this at all.

373
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,110
When an item from the Divine Temple is overused,

374
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:24,799
in the future

375
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,950
you will still head to the Divine Temple.

376
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,870
This is serious idealism.

377
00:22:29,229 --> 00:22:30,589
I'm waiting for you to come to Jiangnan.

378
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,500
That is the time when you can truly face the grandmaster.

379
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,190
Fighting the grandmaster with this?

380
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,562
- Isn't this bullying?   - Not necessary.

381
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,959
What do you mean?

382
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,110
Having this might not be enough to defeat the grandmaster?

383
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,599
That's right.

384
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,269
Grandmaster is a human too.

385
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,269
How can he dodge a weapon that's not from this era?

386
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:51,478
Do I look like a normal person?

387
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,119
A grandmaster

388
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:56,150
is no longer bound by the human's common sense.

389
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:57,799
Doesn't it make him a monster?

390
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,960
I guess.

391
00:23:52,091 --> 00:23:53,130
News from the palace.

392
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,920
His Majesty wants Fan Xian to return to the capital to attend the festival.

393
00:23:57,695 --> 00:23:58,974
What about the treasury bond issue?

394
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,359
His Majesty did not mention it.

395
00:24:26,555 --> 00:24:27,580
Have you heard?

396
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:29,038
About the Chrysanthemum Viewing Festival?

397
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:31,322
The festival is unimportant.

398
00:24:31,418 --> 00:24:32,679
His Majesty is probably waiting for Fan Xian

399
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,279
because of his literary talents.

400
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,639
Yes. That's right.

401
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:39,479
Poetry and songs are nothing much.

402
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:42,470
He still can't handle the responsibility of the Imperial Treasury.

403
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,728
- That's right.   - What are you...

404
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:46,199
Me?

405
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:47,519
I'm going to the outhouse.

406
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,029
As for me, I need to take a stroll in the morning.

407
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,522
Please be on your way.

408
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,879
See you later.

409
00:24:53,524 --> 00:24:55,202
Right. I'm going this way.

410
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,640
Didn't you go to take a stroll?

411
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,069
Is this your outhouse?

412
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,320
You impressed me as well.

413
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,309
How did your stroll end up here?

414
00:25:18,074 --> 00:25:19,354
It must be right.

415
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,720
You...

416
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,870
Lord Fan.

417
00:25:29,054 --> 00:25:32,162
You must keep the 50,000 taels you promised!

418
00:25:32,238 --> 00:25:33,842
I'll go back and retrieve the money immediately.

419
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:35,482
I'll return by today.

420
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,562
Why are you here as well?

421
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,390
What did you say yesterday?

422
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,160
This idiot...

423
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,160
The idiot you see here

424
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,910
has bought the treasury bond.

425
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,060
Farewell.

426
00:26:22,317 --> 00:26:24,560
- It's done.   - It's all right.

427
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,920
Wan Er, wipe your hands.

428
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,670
Fan Xian, something's not right.

429
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:37,119
Perhaps someone didn't bring enough money

430
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,480
and went home to retrieve it.

431
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,999
I made a rough calculation.

432
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,549
It's more than 20 million taels here.

433
00:26:43,195 --> 00:26:44,762
The number is limited and there's a premium price

434
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:45,969
but it is still sold out.

435
00:26:46,085 --> 00:26:47,365
This is all thanks to you.

436
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,110
The Imperial Treasury's bond has been distributed.

437
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,710
Why are you so happy?

438
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:54,560
After all, they chose to buy the bonds

439
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,549
because His Majesty invited me to the flower viewing.

440
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,390
With His Majesty's grace, your future will be bright.

441
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,199
By choosing to share the burden of the debt,

442
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,439
you will be

443
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:06,430
someone who supports them in the future.

444
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,039
Yes.

445
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:09,470
It is a kind of investment.

446
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,630
However, none of them truly understand

447
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,589
what the treasury bond means.

448
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:24,269
The national fortune is related to the currency.

449
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:27,199
That means the meaning of wealth

450
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,269
has far exceeded the limits of the past.

451
00:27:30,256 --> 00:27:31,257
Fan Xian,

452
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,390
I've been thinking about the things you said.

453
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:36,309
What's between the Qing Kingdom and wealth

454
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,509
is not something as simple as the national fortune.

455
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,509
There are still some other connections.

456
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:47,589
These merchants have chosen to believe in treasury bonds

457
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,549
and the future of the Imperial Treasury

458
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,710
because His Majesty trusts you.

459
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:55,390
So, they don't only value you

460
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,319
but also His Majesty,

461
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,749
the royal family's credit,

462
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,400
and the Qing Kingdom's credit.

463
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,679
That's right. The amount of gold and silver is limited.

464
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:06,519
The Qing Kingdom's credit is the foundation of the currency.

465
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:07,879
That's right.

466
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,759
Not just the Qing Kingdom.

467
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,119
Northern Qi's credit

468
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,989
also represents its wealth.

469
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,950
So, a kingdom's credit is its wealth.

470
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,599
A kingdom's credit

471
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,480
is wealth.

472
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,280
It is the foundation of the currency.

473
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,110
What is missing in between?

474
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:32,799
Currency.

475
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,399
Credit.

476
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,439
Let's go out.

477
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:38,309
Let him think alone.

478
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:40,119
Currency.

479
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,520
Wealth.

480
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,960
Credit.

481
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,399
Wealth.

482
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,520
Currency.

483
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,520
Credit.

484
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,539
What's going on with Si Zhe?

485
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,829
He has seen a new world.

486
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,199
This kid is a genius

487
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,559
when it comes to business.

488
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,559
Both of you are the same.

489
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,960
It's different.

490
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,239
I have another memory.

491
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:31,230
To a certain extent, it's cheating.

492
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,199
If our bodies are swapped,

493
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,950
at least in business,

494
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,520
I can't comprehend as good as him.

495
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,230
He is better than me in this.

496
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,520
That's good.

497
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:44,840
Wan Er,

498
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,200
sorry.

499
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,710
- What's wrong?   - I'm afraid we can't stay in Mount Cang for long.

500
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,280
Of course.

501
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,789
His Majesty is waiting for you to attend the festival.

502
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,430
I've prepared everything for so long,

503
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,119
but it still comes down

504
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,079
to his word in the end.

505
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,519
He is the ruler.

506
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,510
The ruler has been the center of the world since ancient times.

507
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:11,910
When the festival is over,

508
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,349
let's go to Jiangnan together.

509
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:16,119
Me too?

510
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,749
My mother established the Three Great Workshops in Jiangnan.

511
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,190
Right now, it is still the foundation of the Imperial Treasury.

512
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,390
These are the traces she left in this world.

513
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,720
I think

514
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,950
I should go and see it with you.

515
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,162
A kingdom's credit

516
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:49,282
is connected to the currency.

517
00:30:49,687 --> 00:30:51,516
To balance these two,

518
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,430
a shop is needed.

519
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,670
But I've never seen a shop like this.

520
00:30:59,145 --> 00:31:01,855
What should this shop be called?

521
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,120
(Find a musket)

522
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:14,487
(and practice your aim.)

523
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,589
(Your hand is steady. You are a budding talent.)

524
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,160
(Protecting Fan Xian)

525
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,559
(is a secret.)

526
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,640
(You want me to protect my brother)

527
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,442
(to resist the grandmaster?)

528
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:27,719
(Not to resist him)

529
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:29,039
(but to kill him.)

530
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,470
(Kill a grandmaster)

531
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,110
(or perhaps me.)

532
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,670
How long are they planning to stand there?

533
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,720
If you dare disturb them,

534
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,230
I'll poison you.

535
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,111
Tell me. Will Official Wu appear today?

536
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,349
Whether he appears or not,

537
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,710
you still shouldn't fight him.

538
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,639
You are no match for him.

539
00:32:25,103 --> 00:32:26,383
The result isn't important.

540
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,800
You learn martial arts as well.

541
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,160
You know the reason why.

542
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,910
I don't learn martial arts.

543
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,119
What are you then?

544
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,509
I'm his teacher.

545
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,589
Do you see him as your disciple

546
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,480
or your son?

547
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:49,910
I don't think Official Wu will be here today.

548
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,280
I'm going back to the capital.

549
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,000
Be careful.

550
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,430
If Wu Zhu is indeed the murderer,

551
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,630
no one will be able to survive in this world.

552
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,230
Disciple or son.

553
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
Aren't they the same?

554
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,400
What's wrong?

555
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,760
What did you see?

556
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:58,599
It's nothing.

557
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,879
All of you have worked hard.

558
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,519
What is this?

559
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,990
It's... It's nothing.

560
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,879
I saw it.

561
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,439
You bought a musket?

562
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,882
Yes.

563
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,990
Is someone bullying you?

564
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,760
No.

565
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,150
I'm just interested.

566
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,230
That's good to hear. Be careful when you use it.

567
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:44,402
Where's Si Zhe?

568
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,990
He has been in a trance recently.

569
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,760
He's here.

570
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,882
Fan Xian. Ruo Ruo.

571
00:34:55,858 --> 00:34:57,138
I'm coming.

572
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:59,119
- It's time to leave.   - Of course.

573
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,479
We've been waiting for you.

574
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,590
No, Ruo Ruo. I'm saying that I should go to Northern Qi.

575
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,120
Northern Qi?

576
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:07,079
I've discussed it with Fan Xian.

577
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,439
Mother agreed as well.

578
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,639
Have you thought about what you should do

579
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:12,999
as the director of trade?

580
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,280
I've been thinking,

581
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,747
and it's becoming clearer.

582
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,762
I've been thinking about what you said over the last few days.

583
00:35:17,874 --> 00:35:20,042
National credit and foundation of currency.

584
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:23,469
I think a shop is needed to maintain the balance.

585
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:25,271
If the shop is opened in the Qing Kingdom,

586
00:35:25,387 --> 00:35:27,429
it's probably doomed to fail.

587
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,860
The shop must be in Northern Qi.

588
00:35:28,941 --> 00:35:30,025
Northern Qi just lost a battle.

589
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,002
Businesses are waiting to flourish. It's a good opportunity.

590
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:33,363
I can grasp this opportunity.

591
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,991
This is a shop that's never seen before.

592
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,990
I'm a pioneer.

593
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,601
Pessimistically speaking, we'll make some money.

594
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,070
Optimistically speaking,

595
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,637
the national fortune of Northern Qi

596
00:35:42,718 --> 00:35:44,669
will be in the grasp of my hands.

597
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,399
Have you come up with a name?

598
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,880
Yes. Help me out.

599
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,887
Look. A shop that sells rice is called a rice shop.

600
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,440
A shop that sells textile is a textile shop.

601
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:56,882
This is related to the money.

602
00:35:56,963 --> 00:35:58,882
Calling it a money shop is too direct.

603
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,159
It's very vulgar.

604
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,829
Money is silver.

605
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,439
So, we'll call it Fan's shop!

606
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,400
Why did you mention silver?

607
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,361
No. Here's what I think.

608
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:14,400
We are the pioneers.

609
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,680
The Fan family needs to be written into the history books.

610
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,230
You can think about the name again.

611
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,479
Fan's shop is bad?

612
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:22,562
Let's call it Xian's shop.

613
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,359
Ruo's shop.

614
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,959
Zhe's shop?

615
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,320
Forget it. I'll think about it on the way later.

616
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:30,999
Fan Xian, do you know? I'm very excited right now.

617
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:32,880
It feels like I finally know

618
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,510
what I'm living for.

619
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,030
This is called a life goal.

620
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:40,070
Yes! I've found my life goal!

621
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:16,919
Lord Fan, it's the palace guards.

622
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:24,840
They are here to stop me.

623
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,200
The Black Cavalry awaits your order.

624
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,642
We can rush them at any time.

625
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:30,033
Stop. They are the palace guards.

626
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:31,438
His Majesty's army.

627
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:32,799
Don't worry.

628
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,949
The Black Cavalry is the world's strongest army.

629
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
We will never lose.

630
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,039
No. Do you think I'm worried about that?

631
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,760
Qi Nian is saying that rushing the palace guards is a serious crime.

632
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,120
President Chen has ordered us

633
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:47,429
to obey Chief Inspector Fan at Mount Cang.

634
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:50,110
The Black Cavalry only obeys military orders.

635
00:37:51,505 --> 00:37:53,202
Someone is coming.

636
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,150
Isn't he someone we know?

637
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,760
Lord Fan,

638
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,200
it has been a long time.

639
00:38:11,386 --> 00:38:12,760
Commander Gong, you should be guarding the palace.

640
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,280
Why have you left the palace today?

641
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,720
His Majesty ordered me to leave the palace for official matters.

642
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,482
Commander Gong, I wish you a smooth journey.

643
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:20,899
Well, should we make way for you?

644
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,280
His Majesty is ordering

645
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,749
you to come with us.

646
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:31,559
All of you came

647
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,840
as soon as I left Mount Cang.

648
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,925
All of you are well informed.

649
00:38:34,006 --> 00:38:35,556
I only obey orders.

650
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,762
I don't understand everything else.

651
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:41,240
Well, are you going to lead the way while we follow you?

652
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,630
There's no need for so many people.

653
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,590
Having you follow us is enough.

654
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:48,322
You said it's His Majesty's orders.

655
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,720
Do you have the imperial edict?

656
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,760
So small?

657
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,479
It's His Majesty's verbal orders.

658
00:38:56,848 --> 00:38:58,128
We should save money

659
00:38:58,639 --> 00:38:59,919
whenever we can.

660
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:02,840
His Majesty

661
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:04,589
is really frugal.

662
00:39:09,283 --> 00:39:11,242
(Go with Gong Dian)

663
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:26,319
Lord Fan,

664
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,519
please.

665
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:16,161
Lord Fan,

666
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,040
this has been the royal family's flower-viewing area since ancient times.

667
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:39,789
It's built on a cliff and suspended in the air.

668
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,070
This is the legendary

669
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:43,919
Xuankong Temple.

670
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,522
(Xuankong Temple)

671
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,030
This is the earliest temple in the Qing Kingdom.

672
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,682
It is said

673
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,519
that it was built brick by brick

674
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,830
by ascetics who worship the temple.

675
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,080
Although all temples in the world

676
00:41:27,183 --> 00:41:30,093
is to worship the legendary Divine Temple,

677
00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:31,909
only the real Divine Temple

678
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,720
is unique.

679
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,240
The power of the people

680
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:38,439
is incredible.

681
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,789
Lord Fan, you prioritize

682
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:42,839
people more.

683
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:44,680
Of course.

684
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,510
Otherwise, why call it the mortal world?

685
00:41:48,668 --> 00:41:50,588
The Chrysanthemum Viewing Festival begins in a few days.

686
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:52,519
Our work

687
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:54,359
is to move them

688
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:55,879
to the temple on top.

689
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,670
Why should I be here?

690
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,160
His Majesty said

691
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,639
you need to move these pots

692
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,269
to the temple on your own.

693
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,510
Is there anything special about these pots?

694
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,399
I don't know.

695
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:10,590
I'm just carrying out the order.

696
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:53,399
Once every three years?

697
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:55,319
It has become a tradition.

698
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:57,949
If someone is up to something bad,

699
00:42:58,119 --> 00:42:59,399
this is a chance.
