1
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:20,070
♫ There’s an empty world deep in my heart, save me ♫

2
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,600
♫ I wanna reset, I wanna reset, I wanna reset ♫

3
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,000
♫ Lonely eyes trapped in darkness ♫

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,360
♫ Isn’t there anyone to hold my hand? ♫

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,460
♫ I wanna reset, I wanna reset, I wanna reset ♫

6
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,350
♫ Your smile that’s not sneering at me ♫
♫ Takes me away from disappearing ♫

7
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,830
♫ In the darkness, your smile shines brightly into my heart ♫

8
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:53,460
♫ I wanna reset, I wanna reset, I wanna reset♫

9
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,000
♫ How about you ♫

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,300
♫ I’m all about you ♫

11
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:07,110
♫ I wanna go back to the beautiful days ♫

12
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:14,100
♫ I won’t let you go ♫

13
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,200
Letter of Advisement to Transfer

14
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,660
You did this, right?

15
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,590
Go Eun Byul did nothing wrong to get transferred.

16
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,580
Unauthorized leave during the school trip.

17
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,330
Threatening the karaoke owner.

18
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,620
And making the School Violence Committee hold a meeting over the jewelry theft case.

19
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,800
I don't think there's a shortage.

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,600
- Teacher...
- Getting the parents approval and quietly transferring her

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,040
is going to be the best for her.

22
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,670
Paper, scissors, rock!

23
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,800
Suddenly, it's a rock!

24
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,530
Lee Eun Bi

25
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,840
Go Eun Byul

26
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,470
Yi Ahn!

27
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,860
You don't even have your cast off yet. What are you doing lurking around here.

28
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,200
Did you get hurt a lot?

29
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,300
How's your injury.

30
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,420
I'm fine.

31
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,340
And..

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,900
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,610
What is there to be sorry for us?

34
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,220
Good luck on your rehabilitation.

35
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,450
But, anyways what kind of spectacular problem was there

36
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,160
that you left the match and ran out and got in an accident?

37
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,720
Stop it.

38
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,800
Hurry and go.

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,370
You treated the National match as some kind of

40
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,920
neighborhood track and field. It serves you right.

41
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,510
This bastard, look at his face expression.

42
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,020
What?

43
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,630
You think that since you're not here

44
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,280
and we can't win medals I'm acting like this?

45
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,430
- No it's not.
- Hey, you bastard, I don't wanna say I got into college because of someone like you either.

46
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,690
But, if you got special treatment, it's your duty to show your special talent.

47
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,410
Hey, Sunbae. Please stop.

48
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,750
You and me

49
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,470
becoming dirt like everybody is friendly and great.

50
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,060
Hang in there.

51
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,010
You becoming weak will be a great experience.

52
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,700
School 2015: Who Are You

53
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,280
Episode 11

54
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,240
Tae Kwang said he will keep taking the bus from now on.

55
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,170
For whatever reason, his face has become brighter everyday.

56
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,900
Thank you for the meal.

57
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,050
Today,

58
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,700
who was the girl you were with?

59
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,360
Wow.

60
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,400
You're interested in my relationships.

61
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,010
- Thank you.
- Did you coincidentally meet her because she is in the same class as you?

62
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,000
Why are you like this all of a sudden?

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,660
You don't have to worry at all.

64
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,850
I won't fight her or get sued for money.

65
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,870
If she's someone I don't have to worry about then that's fine.

66
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,600
I'm sorry we had to suddenly tell you this.

67
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,000
No, it's okay.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,200
But,

69
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,580
I want to know the reason why this happened.

70
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,400
- That's...
- Like I said before,

71
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,440
All of the reasons you explained,

72
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,990
not one of them are clear.

73
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,690
All of the incidents were not caused by my child alone.

74
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,100
I have nothing to say.

75
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,400
Of course, if she did something wrong then she has to get punished.

76
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,400
But,

77
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,330
I feel that the school's decision

78
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,220
is using this as an excuse

79
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,750
to get my child

80
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,290
kicked out of school.

81
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,070
Is that not right?

82
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,500
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, Teacher Kim.

83
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,950
What do you mean you're sorry?

84
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,600
School by school has their reasons on why they do things.

85
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,140
And if you go against it, it's only right you get punished for it.

86
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,040
So why is this something to be sorry for?

87
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,570
Is that it?

88
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,710
So you're saying, it's a definite answer that she needs to get punished.

89
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,810
Of course.

90
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,600
Then,

91
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,990
every student that went with Eun Byul on the trip,

92
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,310
I request that they be on the punishment list as well.

93
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,660
And, please call that student who lied

94
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,050
to get Eun Byul hold the School Violence Committee and then transferred out.

95
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,170
And during the school trip,

96
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,180
during the school trip,

97
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,220
the people that were in charge of taking care of the students.

98
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,370
I will ask them to take responsibility.

99
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,700
Ma'am...

100
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,210
I didn't mean that..

101
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,610
Isn't that..

102
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,710
this school's way of doing things?

103
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,720
Try

104
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,680
doing whatever you want.

105
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,910
B-But.. M-Ma'am!

106
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,300
Wow, Year 2 Class 3

107
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,530
Why is our class like this?

108
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,050
It can only be Go Eun Byul.

109
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,340
What is this?

110
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,060
Did Go Eun Byul cause trouble?

111
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,030
- Disciplinary Committee Meeting -
Subject: Year 2 Class 3 Go ___ ____
Time: June 1st, 2015 at 11:00am
Location: School Meeting Room

112
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,170
Year 2, Class 3, Go ___ ___

113
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,910
The girl you were with.

114
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,880
If I don't have to worry then that's good.

115
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,360
Hey move, hold on.

116
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,030
Hey, what is this?

117
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,910
What is the policy that Eun Byul broke?

118
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,790
Hey, Gong Tae...

119
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,030
What should we do?

120
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,000
You should've lived better.

121
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,850
Kang So Young.

122
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,930
What did you do now?

123
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,390
There's two different types of transfers.

124
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,470
The transfer you do when you want to move and..

125
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,480
the transfer that happens by force even if you don't want to.

126
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,220
Yeah, so

127
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,030
if you made your decision before

128
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,920
then this would've never happened and it would've been good.

129
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,620
Oh yeah,

130
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,860
Is Han Yi Han okay?

131
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,310
You...

132
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,380
how much more are you trying to live and ruin other people's lives?

133
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,000
Is it my fault Han Yi Han got injured?

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,980
It happened because he came to cover your lies.

135
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,420
So then why is that my fault?

136
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,900
You...

137
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,420
how long are you going to stay here?

138
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,970
Even after you leave and longer.

139
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,500
It's not going to go your way.

140
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,320
Because I'm going to keep it till the end.

141
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,910
The strength to protect someone

142
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,830
you love is a lot stronger

143
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,930
than the strength of hating someone, I believe that.

144
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,980
If the world went the way we believed it, it would be boring.

145
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,360
You...

146
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,760
were honestly happy

147
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,940
that I was completely done, right?

148
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,430
That's why plot twists are super fun.

149
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,900
Look forward to it.

150
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,590
Eun Byul.

151
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,350
Mom.

152
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,830
Kang So Young

153
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,920
You were very startled after receiving a call from the school right?

154
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,790
A little. Don't worry.

155
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,250
We'll talk at home later.

156
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,990
Okay.

157
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,670
You punk, why didn't you go to the hospital?

158
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,810
Do I have to come find your at school everyday and yell at you for you to listen to me?

159
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,330
I need some time to gather my thoughts.

160
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,070
What gather? Aigoo, this...

161
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:51,050
After you whole body is ruined...what are you going to gather?

162
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,980
Yi Ahn. You have to stretch every day to relieve tense muscles

163
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,000
and if you don't strengthen your shoulder, it's going to get harder, you punk!

164
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,760
Start today! Without missing a day. You got it?

165
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,480
Look at this guy.

166
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,360
Hey punk, you're not going to answer?

167
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,860
Han Yi Ahn! Get yourself together!

168
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,780
I'm going to watch you.

169
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,860
If you throw away your mind like that

170
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,920
I'll kick you out of swimming team forever no matter how good your talent is.

171
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,110
This is better than that stuffy counseling room, right?

172
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,870
Right. So what is it that you have to say?

173
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,580
About the laptop formatting...

174
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,640
I did it.

175
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,150
Right.

176
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,450
Thank you for gathering your courage.

177
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,040
Will you be okay?

178
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,170
I don't have the confidence to say otherwise.

179
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,840
Even so...like you said...

180
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:55,370
I don't want to go down a path that I know is wrong.

181
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:02,130
Later...if I forget that I even did wrong and live...what would I do?

182
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,060
Year 2 Class 3

183
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:22,030
It has been verified that a student from this class was responsible for the notebook incident.

184
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,230
Is it Kang So Young again?

185
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,480
So, those 3 groups who had 5 points taken off

186
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,850
are going to receive points as if nothing happened.

187
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,520
Ah, that's good.

188
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,890
Teacher. So who is the culprit?

189
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,700
If they confessed, you should reveal them.

190
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,530
Must you know?

191
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,110
- Yes!
- Of course!

192
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,410
You need to tell us.

193
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:57,570
Quiet! Anyone can make a mistake with one decision.

194
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:03,130
But, the friend who formatted the laptops knew their grade would become zero,

195
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:07,170
and courageously revealed the truth.

196
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,160
I hope you guys understand that they fixed their problem

197
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,710
as early as they could

198
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,340
so that you guys will not be affected.

199
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,160
- Kang So Young wouldn't do something like that.
- No, that can't be.

200
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,110
Well we all know who it is.

201
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,740
What's he doing?

202
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,420
Oh my gosh.

203
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,120
Is it him?

204
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,320
What's this?

205
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,960
I'm getting goose bumps.

206
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:53,210
I'm really sorry for doing something so cowardly.

207
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:59,310
Also, for not telling you earlier.

208
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:03,690
Right now, the feeling of embarrassment,

209
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,830
feeling of regret,

210
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:14,630
I will never forget that.

211
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:31,770
Of course, we know that we can't force you to forgive him.

212
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:36,970
But Min Joon, even after he lost his grades,

213
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:42,470
until the very end, didn't want to lose you guys.

214
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,230
Friends.

215
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,900
I hope you'll understand that.

216
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,500
Alright. Thank you.

217
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,520
Go back.

218
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,860
Alright. That's all.

219
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,630
Thank you!

220
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,920
This is punishment for absence without notice. I told them to gather all the overdue books they borrowed from the library.

221
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,160
Return them to the library and clean the place up as well.

222
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,880
When it's frustrating on the inside, it's best to move around.

223
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,300
Oh!

224
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,730
Thanks for helping.

225
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,750
What?

226
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,850
You helping me is really awkward.

227
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,250
We were in the same class since freshman year.

228
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,430
There wasn't a time like this.

229
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,710
You and I were in the same class freshman year?

230
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,410
Yeah.

231
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,870
How was I then?

232
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,930
We weren't close even then.

233
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,950
I think I know that.

234
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:48,850
But around this time last year, there was a time when I returned to school at night.

235
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,890
During the lunch time, it was loud in the classroom so I studied somewhere else.

236
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,070
But since I forgot my notebook, I went back to school.

237
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,850
Something like that happened?

238
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,870
Yeah. I remember clearly because it was that day.

239
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,510
What day?

240
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:27,870
There was a student named Jung Soo In who was in the same class as us.

241
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,410
It was the day before hearing the news of her death.

242
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,410
Jung Soo In?

243
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,670
But you don't remember Soo In either?

244
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:04,750
My friend got put on notice for disciplinary committee meeting.

245
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:09,150
If they did something wrong, it's an obvious consequence.

246
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:14,130
Right? But I felt sorry.

247
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,370
For me who causes trouble everyday

248
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,130
can get around here and there because of you or something.

249
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,050
But isn't it unfortunate for other students?

250
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,720
So? What is it you want to say?

251
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,080
You're not asking me to cancel the transfer, are you?

252
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,420
If I tell you to, will you do it?

253
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,180
You said yourself that she was a girl I need not be concerned with.

254
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,880
I did.

255
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:56,440
But how did you know at that time, it was with the girl who was up for transfer?

256
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,400
I don't think I ever mentioned that.

257
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:08,990
Wow, Father you're amazing. You're giving each and every student this much attention.

258
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,670
If not, never mind.

259
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,510
Han Yi Ahn.

260
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,110
What?

261
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:01,810
I heard everything when you and your coach were talking.

262
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,080
Why aren't you going to the hospital, huh?

263
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,870
Why are you worried about that?

264
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:14,800
You...are not related to me in any way.

265
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,720
Did you forget it?

266
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,330
♫ For you, I pray ♫

267
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:31,010
♫ That you’ll be protected, I pray ♫

268
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:38,760
♫ So that my hopes can reach you ♫

269
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:46,460
♫ The closed door is slowly opening ♫

270
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:54,140
♫ I hope you won't cry over wounded heart and get exhausted ♫

271
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:01,950
♫ Or get trapped in despair with pain ♫

272
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:12,590
♫ With all my heart, I hope to become your comfort ♫

273
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:21,000
♫ I’m praying today ♫

274
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,770
♫ again ♫

275
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,340
Mom.

276
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,610
Kang So Young

277
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,970
- Ah!
- Omo! Hey!

278
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,530
Let go!

279
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:59,420
Continue what you were saying. Who are you to interfere in someone else's conversation?

280
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,650
Mom!

281
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,120
Yeah, Eun Byul.

282
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:20,690
Kang So Young is the girl who bothered you in Tongyoung, right?

283
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,760
Mom.

284
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:30,380
It scares me to know that you're in the same school with that girl.

285
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:36,030
Don't get involved with her emotionally and let's hurry and transfer.

286
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,840
Okay.

287
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:46,340
But Mom, before that, there's something I have to do.

288
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,480
What is it? Do it after you transfer.

289
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,990
No, I have to do it here.

290
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,740
If it's not now, it won't work.

291
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,090
So, please wait a little longer.

292
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:09,950
Every time you see her, you'll be reminded of the past. Will you be okay?

293
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:15,840
Yeah. Now, I have you by my side.

294
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,080
Right.

295
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,260
Since I'm next to you, don't worry

296
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,430
and stay strong.

297
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:24,180
Oh.

298
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,700
Hello.

299
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,310
Didn't you tell me that there were no evidence?

300
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:34,770
- But Ma'am, Min Joon...
- How much did you say

301
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,800
about the CCTV to make a kid say something like that?

302
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,410
Yes? What do you mean?

303
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:48,440
Are you saying that our Min Joon really did something like that?

304
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,440
Teacher, do you really not know how much the effect a mark of zero on performance assessment can bring?

305
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:06,390
To top students like Min Joon, it's the deadliest thing. You should know this.

306
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,020
Ma'am.

307
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:16,700
Do you think grades are the most deadliest thing for Min Joon right now?

308
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:23,370
When you're trying to give a child wings, you can often break their legs.

309
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:28,990
Don't just see what grades he brings home but also how he feels on the inside.

310
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:35,160
Please see it.

311
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:29,600
Everyone knows about how Min Joon's mother got called to court by the Education Ministry, right?

312
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,170
This, this happened because of excessive private tutoring...

313
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:39,110
So shouldn't our school do something about this as well?

314
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:46,020
Of course. When students' demands are diversifying. If we don't satisfy them, where will they go to learn?

315
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:53,010
From the second semester, it is said that the rules changed so we can provide after school classes, so we'll see how it goes.

316
00:27:53,010 --> 00:28:00,010
Then, as a dean, you should write up an After-school Class Project Proposal and submit it by the end of the semester.

317
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,780
What?

318
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,740
I'm just...

319
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,080
Good. Everyone work hard.

320
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,030
Vice Principal.

321
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,380
- Student Go Eun Byul-
- Teacher Kim.

322
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:18,920
Whatever you do, the disciplinary committee meeting will be held. So don't waste your time.

323
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,530
What are you taking out?

324
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,940
W-What? I don't have anything.

325
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,000
Teacher, do you have something on your mind?

326
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,760
What about you?

327
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,840
Should we each say one?

328
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,180
Should we?

329
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,810
Me first?

330
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:16,470
I have a lot of dirt on my hands.

331
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:20,920
There is a person next to me who fell with clean hands.

332
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,820
But do I have the right to hold their hand and help them up?

333
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,780
What right is there to help someone up?

334
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,770
You could hold their hand and wash them together.

335
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,980
You're right.

336
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,950
What's on your mind?

337
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,440
The one trying to kick out Go Eun Byul is my father, right?

338
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,860
You can't respond even if I ask you for the reason, right?

339
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,580
I'll be going now.

340
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,470
The student's mother is also involved.

341
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:48,510
No, she should be involved.
Because her child is unfairly getting kick out of school.

342
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:54,230
If the student's mother wants to make an objection,
she can come to the disciplinary committee.

343
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,990
I don't want to talk about something that's already over.

344
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:02,190
Are you talking the disciplinary committee that's filled only with people who will agree to whatever the school wants to do?

345
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,410
Leave. I'm busy.

346
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,970
Is the reason really because of Soo In's incident?

347
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:15,230
Eun Byul forgot her memory, even if she didn't, she will not talk about that case again.

348
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,240
Just as I did.

349
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,920
I said it's not like that!

350
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:37,330
I also want to believe that.

351
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,130
Please reconsider,

352
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,130
Teacher.

353
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:03,370
I'm planning on recruiting the teacher that guys have been waiting for, Hong Jae Dong.

354
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,750
There's no one like him in literary studies-

355
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:09,410
This isn't something we can act like nothing happened.

356
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,820
I'll tell you straightforward.

357
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:17,040
Min Joon's mom, you know how important this incident is, right?

358
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,500
After releasing the scam that happened with your tutoring,

359
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,020
what are you trying to do right now?

360
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,480
Right, this case is obvious to everyone,
you know that more than anyone here.

361
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,230
Who's going to trust you with their kid's education?

362
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:36,620
On top of that, they say it's Min Joon.

363
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,380
How could the son do that to his mom?

364
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:45,360
Let's stop talking about that. We came out to tell her that we're not meeting her anymore.

365
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,960
Min Joon's mom, we're leaving.

366
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,820
Unnie.

367
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,440
About you consulting Shi Jin...

368
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,920
I'll think about it again.

369
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,240
Oh, Jung Hyun's mom, it's Min Joon's mom.

370
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,880
Are you free right now?

371
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,320
What do you mean why, I got a space for Jung Hyun.

372
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,800
Of course.

373
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,560
Woo hoo!

374
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,060
Oh, aren't you Eun Byul?

375
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,960
Hello.

376
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,660
If you came you should have come in. Why are you just standing here?

377
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,640
No.

378
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:49,800
What do you mean no? I never send a guest away with nothing.

379
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,900
Hurry and come up.

380
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,880
What are you doing? I said come up. Come up.

381
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:36,460
Here. Warm, warm soup.

382
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,600
Let's eat.

383
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,260
Why? You don't like it?

384
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,360
No, thank you for the food.

385
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,300
Alright.

386
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:01,510
If it's uncomfortable for you to use chopsticks should I feed you?

387
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,810
Father.

388
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:10,930
Oh, kiddo. It seems like you can live now since you're smiling.

389
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:25,590
But, why are you two so quiet?

390
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,870
Did you guys fight?

391
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:47,570
Ahjusshi, thank you for the food.

392
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:51,930
Alright, go home safely and come again.

393
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,730
Okay.

394
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:03,050
Eun Byul, even though he's acting like everything's okay he shouldn't be on the inside.

395
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:08,710
Since you guys grew up well together depending on each other,

396
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:13,970
I hope you can help him this time too.

397
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,510
Call him out so that he doesn't stuff himself in his room all day

398
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:20,170
and kick his butt, so that he can come back to his senses.

399
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,210
Alright?

400
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,450
Yes.

401
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:26,090
Okay, thank you.

402
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:36,450
Ah, kiddo. What are you doing being so slow?

403
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,430
I'll be going.

404
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,490
Alright.

405
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,250
I'm leaving.

406
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,850
Bye.

407
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:48,130
Wait, wait.

408
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,830
Hey, did I teach you like that?

409
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,670
You need to drop her off when it's this dark.

410
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,930
It's close anyways.

411
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:59,270
He's right. I'm fine.

412
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,910
I can go alone now.

413
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,990
You should go now.

414
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:41,790
Let's just go.

415
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:44,890
- You're not well yet.
- I said let's just go.

416
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,930
Mom

417
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:12,370
Where are you? You have a new tutor. Don't be late.

418
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:15,910
I can't forgive you behaving like this just because of this.

419
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,470
Get back to your senses.

420
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,290
Mom

421
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,690
11 missed calls

422
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,830
Is he not answering?

423
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:22,410
The person is unavailable right now.

424
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,870
Seriously.

425
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,000
You punk.

426
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,060
Why did you come here?

427
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,540
I took the elevator

428
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,720
and even though our house is on the third floor,

429
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,060
I couldn't press the 3rd floor button.

430
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:48,450
But, after coming up the door is locked tightly.

431
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:55,470
♫ Remember that you’re not alone ♫

432

♫ Even if the world causes you pain ♫

434
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:13,840

♫ I’ll hug you without a word, I’ll listen to your words ♫

435
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,080
♫ I’ll hug you without a word, I’ll listen to your words ♫

436
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:22,660
Because I hate mom.
♫ Turn around, I’ll be there ♫

437
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:30,240
I wanted to stop hating her.
♫ I’ll wipe away all your tears ♫

♫ Even your loneliness ♫

00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,880
I'm sorry.

440
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,760
I'm sorry, Min Joon.

441
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,930
Being a father,

442
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:47,450
I didn't even know how you felt.

443
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:53,110
I didn't even bother finding out.

444
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:03,850
So don't think bad thoughts, alright?

445
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,100
I'm asking you, Min Joon.

446
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:16,120

453
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,860
Why?

454
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,860
Why did you do it?

455
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,480
Why did you go there?

456
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,060
Why did you go up there?!

457
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:11,720
What about me? Why did you go up there?!

458
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:20,610
How can you do this to me?

459
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:25,370
How can you do this to me?!

460
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:30,060
How can you do this to me? I only live my life looking at you.

461
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,190
That's why.

462
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:43,210
You only live watching me

463
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:47,750
so you can't live without me.

464
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,870
Mom.

465
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:03,090
Isn't it better to lose your greed

466
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:08,710
than to lose me?

467
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:00,310
Year 1 Class 2

468
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:03,280
Hello.

469
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:15,630
Should I take the attendance book back to the office for you?

470
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:19,530
Yes. Thank you.

471
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,630
School 2015: Who Are You

472
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:50,790
"Teacher! Someone pooped on my toothbrush!"

473
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:53,200
- "What did you say?"
- Hey kids, look!

474
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,500
- What is this?
- Here, take it.

475
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,600
- What is this?
- This is Lee Shi Jin's and this is Go Eun Byul's.

476
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,610
This is mine.

477
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:04,960
This is what I received from modeling but I begged them for two more.

478
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,630
Oh, it's so pretty. Thanks.

479
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:09,150
Would you guys know my feelings?

480
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:13,550
Hey, everything's great, but let's not carry it on the same day. Please.

481
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:16,520
I'm going to wear it everyday. But the black color is prettier.

482
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,620
Hey, that's mine.

483
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:20,020
Let me just try it on.

484
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,960
Han Yi Ahn.

485
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,240
What are you doing here?

486
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,720
I asked you something useless, right?

487
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:53,830
It's obvious you being at the swimming pool.

488
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:03,820
But, why do you keep coming secretly when no ones here

489
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:06,770
and just leave after walking around the swimming pool?

490
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,400
Like someone who shouldn't be here.

491
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,880
I don't want to hear it. Stop it.

492
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,260
You told me this.

493
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:21,230
Sometimes people's expectations are too heavy so you want to throw it away.

494
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:26,910
So is it comfortable now? Are you happy?

495
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,330
That's not it.

496
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:35,490
I said to stop it.

497
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:38,210
Is it because you hate me so much?

498
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,210
It's something that has nothing to do with you.

499
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:46,950
Then are you also scared of the water?

500
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,340
I...

501
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,920
after getting my memories back

502
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,120
I'm really scared of the water.

503
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,910
At the moment I wanted to die,

504
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:10,060
to be honest, how much I wanted to get out of the water...

505
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:14,520
how much I wanted to live...

506
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,090
I thought of it all.

507
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:23,410
And,

508
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,940
I was thankful every time I saw you,

509
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:32,110
because I'm so relieved to be alive.

510
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:36,750
That's why I

511
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,360
can't watch you ruin yourself.

512
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:16,370
Eun Byul! Please come to Class 1-2! -Jung Soo In

513
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:34,160
The phone number you have dialed is not available.

514
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:45,110
Please get the meeting ready.

515
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:04,170
Gangnam Police

516
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:15,390
Gangnam Sekang High School Female Student Death Case.

517
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,640
Is the reason really because of Soo In's death case?

518
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,410
I said it's not because of that!

519
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,070
Go Eun Byul.

520
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:28,870
Hello.

521
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,810
Have strength! Han Yi Ahn!!

522
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:07,280
Who are you

523
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,850
that you would call me?

524
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,690
I just have something to ask you.

525
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:20,410
Go Eun Byul. You remember, right?

526
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:21,710
What?

527
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,490
Jung Soo In.

528
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:29,640
You said she was your friend long ago with your own mouth.

529
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:33,910
Soo In?

530
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:35,090
That's right.

531
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,530
You said you even got a letter.

532
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,800
What did it say on it?

533
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,910
That's...

534
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:51,730
What are you going to ignore from Soo In now?

535
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:55,100
Soo In,

536
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,360
do you know her?

537
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,470
I asked you first.

538
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:05,080
Did you forget... what you did to Soo In?

539
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:08,940
How could you do such a thing?

540
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,900
The day Jung Soo In died,

541
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,410
what were you doing?

542
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:43,850
Ever since you ignored her,

543
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:47,400
how was it, the day she died alone?

544
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:52,490
I... did that?

545
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:54,380
You...

546
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:59,100
If you had gone to her and

547
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,290
asked "are you okay?" just once,

548
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:04,450
she wouldn't have died.

549
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:16,100
Experience it once for yourself.

550
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:19,450
In this cold, dark classroom.

551
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:22,340
The feeling of being abandoned.

552
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:25,560
You experience it.

553
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:46,720
Please open it. Please open it!

554
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,990
Hello-?

555
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,240
Hello?

556
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:22,940
Hello?

557
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:25,950
Hello?

558
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,180
Hello?

559
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:16,100
The phone number you dialed is not available.

560
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:23,340
Help me!

561
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:26,570
Is no one there?!

562
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:29,570
Please, someone help me!

563
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:45,370
Help me.

564
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:49,350
Help me, please.

565
