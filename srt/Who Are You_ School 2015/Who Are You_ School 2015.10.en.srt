1
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,100
- She was bullied and committed suicide.
- She died?

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,980
- Murder is too much.
- But Kang So Young didn't kill her.

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,260
But if she died because of Kang So Young, then she is a murderer!

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,280
Episode 10

5
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:43,470
The High School Division Men's 400m freestyle will begin shortly.

6
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,740
Swimmers, please make way to the lanes, accordingly.

7
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,980
Han Yi Ahn, I'm going to reveal everything about Go Eun Byul's identity today.

8
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,080
It's a waste you're not going to witness such a great event.

9
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,500
Do well in your competition.

10
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,830
- Hello
- No, no.

11
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,020
- She's here, she's here.
- Did you not eat yet?

12
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,470
- What to do?
- Girl K, hello!

13
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,570
Hello, hello, hello.

14
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,340
Hello, Girl K!

15
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,470
K-show? I like it.

16
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:29,190
Guys, you're having fun chewing me out lately, right?

17
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,280
- She's good.
- How shameless.

18
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,500
We're having fun.

19
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,630
Yeah, we're having fun.

20
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,790
That's good.

21
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:50,670
Yes. The N Girls High School from the news article... It's true that it was the school I used to go to, Noori Girls High School.

22
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,210
And it's true that I'm the Girl K.

23
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,030
She said it's true.

24
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,930
- Awesome.
- How could she kill her?

25
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,290
- She's the worst.
- How could she.

26
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,070
Please be careful.

27
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,320
What do we do?

28
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,660
But, the outcasted victim who died...

29
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,510
Aren't you curious

30
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,340
about what she looks like?

31
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,590
Should I

32
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,200
show you?

33
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,130
Let's see.

34
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,520
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- He seems really hurt.

35
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,700
- Call 911! Call the ambulance!
- He's badly hurt!

36
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,810
Are you okay?

37
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,630
Are you okay?

38
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,920
I think he's really hurt.

39
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:37,030
That outcasted victim looks just like someone in our class.

40
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,800
- What is that?
- I can't see.

41
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,790
Hey, is that a text?

42
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,760
Hey, take it, take it.

43
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,100
Hey, isn't this Go Eun Byul?

44
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,980
- The name is different though.
- What the heck?

45
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,670
- What the heck?
- Daebak!

46
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:06,680
- Ah, Daebak.
- This is totally Go Eun Byul.

47
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,840
Daebak, it really is.

48
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,890
They look the same.

49
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,830
Hey, Kang So Young.

50
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:23,200
How long has it been since you've transferred here?

51
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,200
How much do you think you know about Go Eun Byul to make a fuss? Huh?

52
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,940
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang. What kind of remark is that?

53
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,640
Remark? Remark...

54
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:14,640
Go Eun Byul, since it's your family's story, you say it yourself.

55
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,850
Hey, doesn't he have a game today?

56
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,100
Did you text me to make this kind of a mess?

57
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,950
Go Eun Byul's memories haven't come back yet, so I'll tell you instead.

58
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,660
Who are you to tell them?

59
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,760
Is there a person here who knows Go Eun Byul better than me?

60
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,950
There isn't.

61
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,470
- I don't know.
- There isn't.

62
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,790
Well, there isn't.

63
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:40,650
There's something Go Eun Byul couldn't tell you guys yet.

64
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,670
When she was 5, she was adopted by her mom.

65
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:52,130
And she recently found out that she had a twin sister.

66
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,970
- So it's a twin.
- They look the same.

67
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,770
- Wow.
- What are you talking about?
- Is this a movie?

68
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,490
Are you believing that too?

69
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:04,330
In the article that you guys are reading, the victim is Go Eun Byul's younger sister.

70
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,440
Wow.

71
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,340
- No way.
- This is crazy.

72
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,210
- Goose bumps
- Then what is this?

73
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,580
You're saying Go Eun Byul's sister died because of Kang So Young?

74
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,430
Hey, I'm not done talking yet!

75
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,280
That's not it!

76
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,680
Kang So Young, stop twisting the story and tell them.

77
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:37,880
The Lee Eun Bi you killed in Tongyeong is Go Eun Byul's sister. True or false?

78
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,880
Lee Eun Bi is not dead.

79
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,870
All right.

80
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:03,090
Then, who died? Who died instead of her?

81
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,600
That...

82
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,500
What is she doing?

83
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,980
I don't know. This isn't the time to be bragging.

84
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,630
Why are you not talking all of a sudden? You're making me feel frustrated.

85
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,920
But Kang So Young, how are you so bold in front of Go Eun Byul?

86
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,380
Right. This seriously won't do.

87
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,240
Of course.

88
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,770
No.

89
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,910
Lee Eun Bi isn't dead.

90
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,110
She isn't dead!

91
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,920
- What the heck.
- She's the worst.

92
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,580
The worst.

93
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,350
Can she even stay here?

94
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,150
She is the worst.

95
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,810
How can something like this happen?

96
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,960
She really has no manners.

97
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,340
- But they're exactly the same.
- Hey, aren't you going to the swim meet?
-Wow.

98
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,500
What's with him?

99
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,160
They're the same person, basically.

100
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,420
Yi Ahn! Han Yi Ahn!

101
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,970
Yi Ahn! Yi Ahn! Han Yi Ahn!

102
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,360
♫  There’s an empty world deep  ♫

103
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,620
♫  In my heart, save me  ♫

104
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:04,330
School 2015: Who Are You
♫  I wanna reset  ♫

105
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,630
♫  Lonely eyes trapped in darkness  ♫

106
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,750
♫  Is there anyone to hold my hand?  ♫

107
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,130
♫  I wanna reset, I wanna reset  ♫

108
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,450
♫  I wanna reset  ♫

109
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,760
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang.

110
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,170
You...

111
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,490
I warned you.

112
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,120
If you both reveal, who would get affected more?

113
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,300
Saying she's Lee Eun Bi means

114
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,740
Go Eun Byul died.

115
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,010
If you say Go Eun Byul died because of you,

116
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,350
the matter would be a lot worse.

117
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,520
You must be concerned.

118
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,020
This is a joint injury due to thickness rotator cuff tear.

119
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,420
During the accident, when the shoulder hit against the car,

120
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,520
it ruptured the tensions in shoulder,

121
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,790
and it's a situation where the joint fell off, too.

122
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:26,320
But there are signs that he had problems with his shoulder even before the accident. Did you not see them?

123
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,220
If it was to this extent, the pain would have been great.

124
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,470
Doctor, then...

125
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,430
How long will it take for him to recover?

126
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,970
Well, if he goes through rehabilitation a week after the surgery,

127
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,410
then it'll take at least a year.

128
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,340
He said it'll take a year.

129
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,440
What's going to happen to him?

130
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,560
There's no guarantee that he will recover fully, either.

131
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,100
Sir,

132
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,910
Yi Ahn is a strong kid.

133
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,960
I will do all I can to help him go through rehab,

134
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,300
so please have hope and stand firm.

135
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,600
No, no, lay down.

136
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,630
Hey, punk.

137
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,420
Are you okay?

138
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,120
Father.

139
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,820
You're really disappointed, aren't you?

140
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,630
No.

141
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,160
But,

142
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,880
what exactly happened? Huh?

143
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,400
I'm not sure.

144
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,410
I heard from my friend that there was an emergency,

145
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,920
and I couldn't think of anything.

146
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,010
I'm sorry, Father.

147
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,830
Sorry...

148
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,250
Hey, hey! I don't know what happened,

149
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,930
but the world hasn't ended. Lighten up.

150
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,410
Right now, you're only eighteen years old, punk.

151
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,900
At that age, if kids falter, they have accidents,

152
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,670
and some live without thinking about the past or the future.

153
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,790
That's what they do. It could happen.

154
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,030
Hey, Father.

155
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,910
Hey, I'm coming to say this now,

156
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,120
but if you compare this to the problems I've caused at this age, this is nothing.

157
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,760
So, don't think of anything else,

158
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,280
and use this opportunity to just rest.

159
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,070
Understand?

160
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,420
Yes.

161
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,940
All right.

162
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,940
Rest up, I'll be back.

163
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,670
Han Yi Ahn / 18

164
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,040
Hey, Lee Shi Jin!

165
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,300
You're not going to talk to me?

166
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,810
But isn't Go Eun Byul a little too much?

167
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,200
What?

168
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,220
It's weird. I mean, does it make sense that Gong Tae Kwang knows something we don't know?

169
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,200
What about me? Did you guys talk trash about me?

170
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,240
Stay out of it!

171
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,120
Han Yi Ahn should be fine, right?

172
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,020
All he thinks about is Eun Byul.

173
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,020
He even gave up his match and ran here.

174
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,290
They're were friends for 10 years, that's why.

175
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,610
Yi Ahn was pretty cool, right?

176
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,620
Cool? Bullshit is cooler.

177
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,230
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang.

178
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,750
You want to try being like half of Han Yi Ahn?

179
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,420
- Hey!
- Omo.

180
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,460
Even when I say it gently...

181
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,890
You and I really don't get along well.

182
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,920
Let's go.

183
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,280
Of course, I know that the fee is burdensome.

184
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,050
But $1,000,000 and $10,000,000

185
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,500
can't be the same.

186
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,660
Based on consulting, a student's college and future differ.

187
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,430
Troubles arise if you go to a place that claims it's cheaper.

188
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,810
You've heard of our child's story, right?

189
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,980
Of course.

190
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,110
I have some know-hows on how I raised my child.

191
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,760
Don't worry. You can really trust me.

192
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,260
I'll just trust you, Teacher, and follow.

193
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,360
What times are available for you? We'll have to meet often.

194
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,670
Honey! Do you have 2 or 3 kids?

195
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,720
The entire school is talking about her newspaper article.

196
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,920
Are you going to treat her like someone else's child?

197
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,170
If So Young gets labelled with stuff,

198
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,020
Do you not think it won't affect you, too?

199
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,070
She says she won't do it again!

200
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,070
Either way, since it's become like this,

201
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,130
So Young and that girl

202
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,280
can't go to the same school.

203
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,880
All right.

204
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,610
Then, I'll deal with it myself.

205
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,220
What did Dad say?

206
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,450
Don't worry. I'll meet with the chairman.

207
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,710
Really? Thanks, Mom.

208
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:27,130
I won't cause problems to bother you or Dad anymore.

209
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,720
I'm sorry.

210
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:52,690
Han Yi Ahn

211
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,210
If you came, you should go in.

212
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,140
What are you doing?

213
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,350
Is it hurting a lot?

214
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,130
Not much.

215
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,850
Is there anything I can help with?

216
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,520
No.

217
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,460
For yesterday,

218
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,470
in the classroom, thank you.

219
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,230
I didn't do it because of you.

220
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,230
Whatever the reason may be.

221
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,300
If that's all you had to say, go ahead and leave.

222
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,120
- Please give it to me.
- Yes.

223
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,950
I'll leave after I see you eat.

224
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,920
It's fine, so just go.

225
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,980
Gong Tae Kwang, you go too.

226
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:43,630
I know since I ate a lot at the hospital. Honestly, the food sucks.

227
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,570
But just eat it. You'll heal faster.

228
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,410
- Get lost, you bastard.
- Aish.

229
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,400
Gong Tae Kwang.

230
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,410
Are you worried about Han Yi Ahn that much?

231
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:17,140
He got hurt because of me. Do I just pretend not to know?

232
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,440
That's why I'll stay here. You go.

233
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,200
It's because I want to stay here.

234
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:31,530
Should I wait? Until you come out?

235
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,280
No.

236
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:54,190
The one year resting period may seem long, but if you recover well, it's nothing.

237
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:02,120
There aren't many famous athletes who live comfortably without an injury.

238
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,650
Even if I rest one day, it gets harder to shorten the record time.

239
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,510
Does it make sense that a year will be nothing?

240
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,640
So what? You're saying that you'll give up?

241
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:23,500
You... if you're not going to give up swimming forever, throw those weak thoughts away.

242
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,470
You have to start thinking about recovering quickly, punk.

243
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,810
Then why did you leave the swim match and get hurt?

244
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:38,020
Even if it was an important thing!

245
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,870
Should I get you more water?

246
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,270
Are you an idiot?

247
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,780
Who's welcoming you to keep coming here?

248
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:10,670
- Han Yi Ahn.
- Don't call my name and don't appear in front of me anymore!

249
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,410
I don't even want to look at you anymore.

250
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:38,870
♫ When you are lost ♫

251
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:46,780
♫ I will shine a light ♫

252
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:53,060
♫ When your heart shakes because of the wind ♫

253
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:59,690
♫ I will hold your hand ♫

254
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:07,600
♫ For you, I pray ♫

255
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:15,280
♫ That you’ll be protected, I pray ♫

256
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:23,130
♫ So that my hopes can reach you ♫

257
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:30,830
♫ The closed door is slowly opening ♫

258
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:38,600
♫ I hope you won't cry over wounded heart and get exhausted♫

259
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:46,320
♫ Or get trapped in despair with pain ♫

260
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:56,640
♫ With all my heart, I hope to become your comfort ♫

261
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:10,800
♫ I’m praying today again ♫

262
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:48,030
Let's get through today

263
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:51,930
safely and please, quietly.

264
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,650
- Kwon Gi Tae.
- Yes?

265
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,440
Quietly.

266
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,570
Gong Tae Kwang! Quietly.

267
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,750
Understand?

268
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,430
That's all.

269
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:16,190
I'll be absent today. Please don't tell my mom.

270
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,590
Gong Tae Kwang, Kwon Gi Tae, and Han Yi Ahn.

271
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:28,640
Han Yi Ahn is admitted into the hospital, right? That's unfortunate, I was going to share good news.

272
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,380
Your group has the highest score for the performance assessment.

273
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:40,070
Teacher. You were surprised beyond your expectations, right?

274
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:43,620
Yeah. Until 10 minutes ago.

275
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:48,930
But. In the middle of the brochure, there is a logo.

276
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:53,060
Your group name is "Screwed Up Team"
but what is this "Green Ad Inc."?

277
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,700
If it wasn't for Teacher Jung Min Young's falcon eyes, we would have been fooled!

278
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,470
"Screwed Up Team". 0 points!

279
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,310
Wait a second, T-Teacher Jung Min Young?

280
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:20,800
Wow, Sekang High Go Eun Byul's sense of existence is unbelievable.

281
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,420
Right?

282
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,030
But don't be deluded.

283
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,380
That's not Lee Eun Bi's.

284
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:34,920
Kang So Young. I won't even ask about your sense of existence.

285
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,100
There aren't a lot of kids who don't know you anymore.

286
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:44,800
Hey. I don't know how you tricked Han Yi Ahn, but how long do you think he'll last?

287
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:53,480
He'll soon not care about what happens to you.

288
00:28:53,480 --> 00:29:00,440
Just wait. I'll make those next to you turn away from you one by one.

289
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,600
I don't think it's a time for you to be worried about someone else.

290
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,110
The contract is ready.

291
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:21,750
Bring your parents' consent form and contact me before you visit.

292
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:31,470
Teacher Kim, help me with this.

293
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,530
Ah, yes.

294
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,740
You did everything right, but I don't think you need this.

295
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,720
Since this is important, bring this to the top,

296
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,100
and match this.

297
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,930
Oh, this is harder than teaching a class.

298
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:51,900
If you keep going, you'll get good at it.

299
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,060
You think so?

300
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,570
Yes.

301
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,250
Dating within work is prohibited.

302
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:12,100
Dating within work? That sounds thrilling.

303
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,870
Mathematics I

304
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,750
Jung Soo In

305
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,240
Jung Soo In

306
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,820
What is it? Why are you coming to my office?

307
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,320
Do you know what this is?

308
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,490
- I'm not sure.
- One year ago,

309
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:13,430
on the day Student Jung Soo In died, this was on her desk.

310
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,310
Jung Soo In

311
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,490
What are you doing bringing this up now?

312
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,050
I'm not the one bringing it back up.

313
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,940
You know that I don't have that right.

314
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,730
If it's not you...

315
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:39,490
It must have been one of the people gathered in the classroom that day.

316
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,840
I told you before that it's better to go through the punishment

317
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:52,730
or else it would come back to punish you after one year, then two years, then the rest of your life.

318
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:20,750
Yes, Detective Park. Hello, this is Gong Jae Ho.

319
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,360
I have something I need you to confirm.

320
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,970
About the Jung Soo In case from one year ago.

321
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:31,630
Oh, Eun Byul, is Yi Ahn okay?

322
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:36,570
Not yet, but he'll be able to go through it.

323
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,630
Oh, he's a kid that only knows how to swim. What is he going to do?

324
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,050
Take care of him well.

325
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:45,000
Hey, Lee Shi Jin. If you're so worried about him, you take care of him.

326
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,420
Hey, does it look like I am an equal to her in Han Yi Ahn's eyes?

327
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,820
What is so different? Huh? Huh?

328
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:55,280
You are so tiring. Idiot, why are you bothering me?

329
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,420
Do you perhaps

330
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,950
like me?

331
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,220
Ah, I'll go first.

332
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,980
Where?

333
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,380
By any chance, the hospital?

334
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,180
Yeah.

335
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:16,710
Hey, you're going there again?

336
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:19,930
Why? For what?

337
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,310
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

338
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,640
Okay, go ahead.

339
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,390
Don't follow me.

340
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,480
Why?

341
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,830
Want to go on a walk?

342
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,570
The weather is really nice today.

343
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:06,980
You could feel better if you get some fresh air.

344
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,530
Do I look pitiful to you?

345
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,810
Hey, Han Yi Ahn.

346
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:19,220
Or are doing this because you're sorry for lying to me until now?

347
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,730
I don't know what I should call you,

348
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:24,360
and it's frightening to see your face.

349
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,860
I feel like I'll go crazy because I'm so pathetic.

350
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,020
So stop it.

351
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,410
All right.

352
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,230
I'll go.

353
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,010
Sorry.

354
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:57,860
But, no matter what you say,

355
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,050
I'll come back tomorrow.

356
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,990
So,

357
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,090
if you don't want to see me, get better quickly.

358
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,360
Han Yi Ahn,

359
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:42,730
you asked me this a while ago,

360
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,600
"When you got your memories back,

361
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,090
why didn't you tell me the truth?"

362
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,140
If I say everything,

363
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,020
I must have known that we would become like this.

364
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,230
So,

365
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,130
for just one more day...

366
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:12,230
For one more day, I wanted to pretend I didn't know.

367
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,450
That's right.

368
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:21,330
I feel sorry towards you.

369
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:25,040
And when I see you, I feel really bad for you.

370
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:32,040
But I'm not here because of that.

371
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,590
So...

372
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,990
So...

373
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,620
Han Yi Ahn.

374
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,720
Congratulations on getting discharged.

375
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,800
What's with you refusing visitors? It made me sad.

376
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,780
I'm sorry.

377
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:59,200
Your heart feels heavy because of your injury, right?

378
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,130
I am the teacher and you are being taught, but

379
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:07,260
when I see you doing your best for something you love,

380
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,400
I'm the one who ends up learning.

381
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,330
Teacher, this doesn't suit you. What's with you?

382
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:16,740
Right? When I think about it, even I don't think this is right.

383
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:26,810
Yi Ahn, after living for many years I realized, during your age,

384
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:32,370
Getting a little late, getting a little rest, and getting a little behind

385
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:38,370
That may seem hard at times, but after time passes,

386
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:42,070
if you look back, it's not such a bad thing either.

387
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,660
You got it?

388
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,640
Cheer up. Fighting!

389
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,460
Is this not it either?

390
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,190
All right.

391
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,610
Teacher! Let's go together!

392
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,910
Come and get your bag.

393
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:28,150
Park Min Joon, you skipped school.

394
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,630
Where did you go?

395
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,750
- The library.
- Huh?

396
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:45,450
I have so much time, but there's nowhere else to go.

397
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:54,170
Time goes really fast when I'm studying.

398
00:41:54,170 --> 00:42:00,320
Even when I didn't complete half of what I decided to do, but so much time passes by.

399
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:08,110
So that's why I studied in the library. To let time pass by.

400
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:20,870
Min Joon, if you're having a hard time, should I try meeting with your mother again?

401
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,760
Report Illegal Tutoring Now

402
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,920
Report

403
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:28,780
If anyone has something to say about this laptop, find me by 9pm tomorrow.

404
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,320
I will do as much as I can to help you find a way.

405
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:38,430
It's not you, right? Your homeroom teacher is wrong, right?

406
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:43,240
Nothing is confirmed, so just keep your mouth shut.

407
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,630
Song Joo.

408
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:02,700
What is it? Just get straight to the point.

409
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:26,120
Song Joo, I really thought we were friends. But how can you do this to me?

410
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,080
Friends?

411
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,390
Did you really think of me as a friend?

412
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:36,370
You didn't use me to bother Go Eun Byul?

413
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:41,200
Song Joo, do you think that I made a request

414
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,840
to my busy uncle to prepare a difficult audition time for you just to bother her?

415
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:53,320
My uncle talked about a contract.

416
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,530
What? Should I ask him about it for you?

417
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,440
Really?

418
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,550
Go ahead then.

419
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:21,470
Yes, Uncle. My friend Song Joo wants to talk about the contract.

420
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,960
Yes, one moment.

421
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,430
He'll grab a date.

422
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,780
Sir, I can't do the contract.

423
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,830
The reason?

424
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:38,870
Hear it from So Young herself.

425
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,250
It's true that I want to become a celebrity.

426
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:53,260
But I'm not the type to betray a friend to be one.

427
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:57,040
"Making those around Go Eun Byul turn away one by one?"

428
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:01,180
That won't be easy, Kang So Young.

429
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,960
Who are you?

430
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:41,240
We came from Gangnam Office of Education's
Private Tutor Regulation Squad.

431
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,850
We received a complaint.

432
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,290
How far did you stretch out your hands?

433
00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:00,230
I'm investigating and there's no place where your name doesn't pop up!

434
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:05,150
Even if you think I'm not much, I'm your husband.

435
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:09,270
Your husband is a police officer. How can you live like this?

436
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:13,120
Was it really Min Joon?

437
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,810
Yeah.

438
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:19,320
Your son reported you, woman!

439
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:53,850
Wash up. You should eat and then start studying.

440
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,240
Where is the vice principle?

441
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,470
Ah, yes. He's that way.

442
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:41,370
What brings you here?

443
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:45,860
I am Grade 11 Class 3 Kang So Young's mother.

444
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:49,370
Can I see the chairman?

445
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:54,600
The chairman?

446
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,380
You can't barge in like this!

447
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:59,810
How can you just walk in without prior appointments?

448
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:02,920
I just have to see him for a moment.

449
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,000
You can't do this! Why are you doing this?

450
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,270
I'm sorry, Chairman.

451
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:12,860
I strictly told her.

452
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:16,410
Because I was in a hurry, I forgot to call you ahead of time.

453
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:20,910
I am Lawyer Kang Il San's wife.

454
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:23,080
Oh, yes.

455
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:28,880
Hello, I'm Gong Jae Ho.

456
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:37,890
I heard briefly from Lawyer Kang

457
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:47,820
This is the child I told you about earlier.

458
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:53,780
In the past, she left school after bullying my daughter.

459
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:57,810
At this school, in the same classroom, I heard her older twin sister is here.

460
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:02,000
Like her sister, she's bothering my daughter.

461
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:08,430
It's a bit too much to leave the two students in the same room.

462
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:11,380
If what you're saying is true, then it is.

463
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:14,660
Withdraw or transfer, I don't care.

464
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:18,280
She just needs to leave this school.

465
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:24,190
For now, let me look into it. Then I will contact you.

466
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:27,890
Yes, I'll leave it to you, Chairman.

467
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:33,290
Does your shoulder hurt a lot?

468
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:35,240
I'm okay.

469
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,730
Han Yi Ahn, you're right-handed, eating must be hard.

470
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:06,120
Right?

471
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:10,090
Oh, right. Using the chopsticks must be hard.

472
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:37,140
Hey, Gong Tae. What's with you now?

473
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:40,470
Hey, did I do anything wrong? I was helping him.

474
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:44,550
That's true, but since you're doing it, it's a little scary.

475
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,010
Give it to me. I'll take it back.

476
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:53,990
Hey, I'll do it.

477
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:09,100
Gangnam Sekang Female Student Death Case

478
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:13,620
This is the list of people that were at the crime scene of the Jung Soo In case.

479
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,880
Ah, yes. Thank you.

480
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,540
Chairman, me, Teacher Kim, and Jung Soo In's mother,

481
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:26,770
and all the paramedics. In total, there are about 8 people involved.

482
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:31,390
Within the students, there was only Go Eun Byul.

483
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:38,050
But there may be a chance that there are more witnesses.

484
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:40,970
But why are you asking about a year old case?

485
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,830
Did you say Go Eun Byul?

486
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,700
Ah, yes.

487
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:48,960
Excuse me for a second.

488
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:55,260
Please let me see class attendance of Go Eun Byul's class.

489
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,800
Right. What happened to Class 3's laptop case?

490
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,320
Did you find out who it was?

491
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,210
Not yet.

492
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:07,660
Isn't this because all the kids are competitive with their grades?

493
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:11,120
That's why, in order to focus on the goals and not the competition,

494
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,720
we don't ever talk about Soo Noong results.
 (Soo Noong is the Korean standardized college entrance exam.)

495
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,660
Of course. If they all do well, we have to give them the best.

496
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,660
Do we really have to split them into ranks?

497
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:29,870
Teacher Kim, can I have the attendance record of Class 3?

498
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,340
But why our class attendance?

499
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:35,520
The chairman is asking me to bring it.

500
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:41,810
Vice Principal, should I take them instead?

501
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:45,560
- Would you?
- Yes. I'll be going.

502
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:22,100
Hello, I'm the new student teacher, Jung Min Young.

503
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,960
Ah, yes.

504
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:29,090
You were looking for Grade 11, Class 3's attendance records?

505
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:31,210
You've worked hard.

506
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,400
Gangnam Sekang Female Student Death Case
Case Report

507
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,870
Yes, Mom.

508
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:13,020
Wait just a little longer.

509
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,580
We're almost there now.

510
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:27,590
School 2015 : Who Are You

511
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:39,390
There was a time when she bullied my daughter and left the school.

512
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:43,420
Her twin sister is in the same class at this school

513
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:48,580
It's seemed she was using her younger sister to bother my daughter.

514
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:53,600
It's difficult to keep the two kids in the same class, right?

515
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:07,800
Recommendation of Transfer
Grade 11, Class 3
Name: Go Eun Byul

516
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:22,200
Chairman, you did this, right? What are you doing right now?

517
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,790
It's exactly what you see.

518
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:26,120
You know it doesn't make any sense.

519
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:31,130
Go Eun Byul has done nothing wrong to receive a transfer.

520
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:34,930
Unauthorized leave during the school trip. Threatening the karaoke owner.

521
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:40,270
And making the School Violence Committee hold a meeting over the jewelry theft case.

522
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:43,430
- I don't think it's lacking.
- Teacher.

523
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:49,040
I think it's best for her to get transferred with her parent's consent.

524
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,560
Hey, get on.

525
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:07,150
I said get on.

526
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:11,160
Hey, even at school...

527
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,370
Well, how's this?

528
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:17,500
Let's play rock, paper, scissors. Loser carries it to the bus stop.

529
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,070
Rock, paper, scissors.

530
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:26,490
Eh? Rock, paper, scissors.

531
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,290
All of a sudden– Rock!

532
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:33,470
Forget it.

533
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:39,480
Hey, I was kidding around!

534
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:17,870
