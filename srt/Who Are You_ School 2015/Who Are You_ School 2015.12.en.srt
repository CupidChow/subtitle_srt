1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,880
Experience it once for yourself too.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,560
In the dark and cold classroom,

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,040
the feeling of being left alone,

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,140
you experience it too.

5
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,200
Please open it. Please open it!

6
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,680
Teacher Choi.

7
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,600
Ah, Teacher Kim. I feel so sorry.

8
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,380
What nonsense are you talking about?

9
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,000
She was fine this morning when I was talking to her on the phone,

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,180
but who would have known that she would collapse after a few hours?

11
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,800
She will be okay. Don't worry about the school and please go.

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,040
Then I'll ask you for this favor.

13
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,980
Let's go.

14
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,290
Stay strong, Han Yi Ahn!

15
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,860
Please help me.

16
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,540
Anyone- isn't anyone there?

17
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,880
Please... Please save me!

18
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,410
Help me.

19
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,950
Help me, please.

20
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:13,940
Eun Byul!

21
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,030
Teacher...

22
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,040
Are you okay?

23
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,420
You're not hurt anywhere?

24
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,340
How'd you get in here at this time?

25
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,070
Let's get out for now.

26
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,110
Han Yi Ahn.

27
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,150
You came at a good time. Could you take Eun Byul home?

28
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,930
Yes.

29
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,930
What's wrong with you?

30
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,310
It seems that Eun Byul is in a lot of shock right now.

31
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,610
Go Eun Byul, go home for now. We'll talk tomorrow.

32
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,690
Yes, teacher.

33
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,550
Go.

34
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,770
Do you think you can walk?

35
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,850
Yeah, I'm fine.

36
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,730
Tell me if you're tired.

37
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,670
Yeah.

38
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,310
The phone is turned off-

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,580
Aish...

40
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,350
Hey, why is your phone turned off?

41
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,280
Gong Tae Kwang, lower your voice.

42
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,690
Are you okay?

43
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,890
Yeah.

44
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,530
Why is she like that? What's the problem?

45
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,270
Did you say something to her again?

46
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,550
It's not like that.

47
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,110
If it's not an emergency, talk to her later.

48
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,810
It's actually a really urgent matter.

49
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,710
Hey, by chance did Jung-

50
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,630
Aish...

51
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,210
Just go in. What's wrong with your face?

52
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,440
Hey, Han Yi Ahn.

53
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,770
Tell me what happened.

54
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,150
Why do I have to?

55
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,390
You don't like her.

56
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,230
Aren't I right? Why can't you answer me?

57
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:59,550
You... Don't like her.

58
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,310
So?

59
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,770
Mind your own business.

60
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,470
Or at least, don't make her cry.

61
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,550
School 2015: Who Are You

62
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,480
Episode 12

63
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,140
So, you couldn't see the face?

64
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,880
Yes.

65
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,660
It was dark and they were wearing a hooded hat.

66
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,920
So it's like that.

67
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,040
You didn't hear anything else?

68
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,860
They brought up Jung Soo In.

69
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,360
The truth is,

70
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:09,040
I've been receiving text messages from her for a while.

71
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,140
Yesterday, I went to the classroom after receiving her text message.

72
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,290
How could something like that ever-

73
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,800
I'm very flustered and I don't know why either.

74
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:30,280
Eun Byul, I'm sorry but I don't have anything immediate to say right now.

75
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,070
While I find things out carefully, could you wait?

76
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:41,890
If another text message comes, tell me about it as well. Got it?

77
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,790
- Teacher Kim.
-Yes?

78
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,510
You were here.

79
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,490
Yes. I had something to check.

80
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,430
You're not going to the homeroom meeting?

81
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,050
I should go.

82
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:51,770
Everyone, the weather is hot and it must be hard to stay inside a small classroom all day, but

83
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:56,070
don't forget that there are teachers who are continually thinking about you.

84
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,070
Yes.

85
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,620
Stay strong today too!
-Fighting!
-I love you!

86
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,200
Do you have anything else you would like to say?

87
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,740
You experience it once too.

88
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,900
In the cold and dark classroom, the feeling of being abandoned.

89
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,750
That's it for today.

90
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,480
Work hard.

91
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,680
Thank you.

92
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,440
Rooftop.

93
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,530
Han Yi Ahn!

94
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,760
-What are you thinking about?
-Huh?

95
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,490
Why did you fight with Go Eun Byul again?

96
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:16,310
She's already having hard time because of Disciplinary Committee. You should quickly reconcile.

97
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,380
Disciplinary Committee?

98
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,610
It seems like you guys had a serious fight. Didn't you know?

99
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,420
Ah it's refreshing.

100
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,100
I almost threw up my breakfast because of the student teacher.

101
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,930
-Awh.
-Why is she like that?

102
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,760
"Everyone~"

103
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,710
-I feel sick in the stomach.
-Go ahead, burp~

104
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,570
Wow, Jo Hae Na, your jealousy is unbelievable.

105
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,950
What? Jealousy?

106
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,170
It's obvious looking at Gi Tae.

107
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,170
What do you mean no? Last time you got the teacher's number on the bus-

108
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,720
Hey! Go home punk!

109
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,860
Ah right! My mom called me earlier!

110
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,050
Hey Kwang Gi Tae. Just what did you get on the bus?

111
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,890
You think a bus is some kind of orchard? What do you mean getting things? He's just crazy. (Getting numbers and picking apples use the same verb "ttada' in Korean)

112
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:16,600
Tell me the name before I call every single contact.

113
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,850
Wow. Venus. Sarah. Sophia. Scarlet.

114
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,930
Who is it?!

115
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,160
J-Jennifer?

116
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,170
"J-Jennifer?"

117
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,610
You. Must. Be. Joking.

118
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,840
Hey!!! How can you go in that room without any fear?

119
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,760
What if something happened?

120
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,010
I was curious about what happened with Jung Soo In.

121
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,750
Student Jung Soo In was found in Sekang High School's Room 1-2. Go Eun Byul first found the body.

122
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,910
I can't tell you the details right now

123
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,680
but when Jung Soo In died, Go Eun Byul found her first.

124
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,950
How did you know that?

125
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,000
I just... found out.

126
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,740
Either way, if there's a problem like yesterday, call me.

127
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,590
Whenever, wherever. Got it?

128
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,170
Eh? You're not answering?

129
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,820
I got it.

130
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,710
Aigoo.. aish!

131
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,560
Aren't you leaving?

132
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,680
I'll go a little later. You go down first.

133
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,170
No. Never.

134
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,550
I can't leave you alone for now.

135
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,610
It's Eun Byul.

136
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,110
Why are you so surprised?

137
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,160
Have a good time in class.

138
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,840
Hey, why are you so surprised?

00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,050
-Aren't you going to class?
-I should go.

146
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:26,070
The dates came out for the famous lecturers that people search for, to attend. The topics they plan to lecture seemed good.

147
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,160
Yeah, since colleges give full support for those programs.

148
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,270
I hope it helps the students.

149
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,920
Then...

150
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,170
Teacher.

151
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,990
Yes.

152
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,150
Do you have time tonight?

153
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,770
What's the matter?

154
00:14:54,770 --> 00:15:01,720
Just... since you're more experienced in teaching. I want to get some advice from you.

155
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,440
Let's do that.

156
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,530
Are you okay?

157
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,070
Yeah.

158
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,510
I was near school. You should have called me.

159
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,020
I should have.

160
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,450
Are you really going to transfer?

161
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,410
Why?

162
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,130
Do you wish I would leave?

163
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,580
What clothes should I get?

164
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,240
What are you doing not eating?

165
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,340
I have a meeting on Saturday. I want to buy some clothes.

166
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,740
Wow, this shirt is amazing. Buying immediately. Confirm.

167
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,360
Nowadays dogs and cows are going on meetings. Give me that.

168
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,340
Why?

169
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,150
I need to calm down my upset Hae Na because of you.

170
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:54,280
I said sorry earlier. But my face is a bit better than yours. (speaking in dialect)

171
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,020
I can't hear you~

172
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,630
The sausage is still raw.

173
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,730
Why is the sausage like this? We paid so much for the lunch fee, too.

174
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,410
This will lighten up her mood, right?

175
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,510
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang.

176
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,170
Do you not feel like eating these days?

177
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,100
I don't either.

178
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,550
Hey, what are you doing?

179
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,840
Hey Gong Tae! It feels like you're throwing out your leftovers.

180
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,500
You look the prettiest when you're eating. Eat a lot.

181
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,410
What do I do with him? Hey! I have no interest in accepting you.

182
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,630
Dude. Do you really like her?

183
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:02,420
Right? It's not true? It'll be a waste for Shi Jin.

184
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,390
Shucks~

185
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,540
Did you hear from the Chairman?

186
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,540
No, not yet.

187
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,170
Still not yet?

188
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:21,620
Then, do you want to try meeting him?

189
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,790
If one person went and came, it's fine.

190
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:28,800
You should go since I already went but nothing is happening.

191
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,720
No matter how much So Young says, no one believes that the twins have switched.

192
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,110
So? Is your face like that because of her?

193
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,670
Dad...

194
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,220
Can I not transfer somewhere else?

195
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,390
If I go somewhere I don't know anyone, I know I can do better.

196
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,490
You are acting weak again.

197
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:03,220
I finally got settled here but in the end I have to leave because of a kid?!

198
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,200
Honey, let's eat first and then talk.

199
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,140
Get your mind straight and persevere.

200
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,130
All I have to do is just transfer her, right?

201
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,770
Yes.

202
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,270
I remember when I was a student teacher.

203
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:43,760
At that time, I had the same energy as you, Teacher Jung.

204
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,640
What about now? Are you saying that you don't have it now?

205
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,270
Yes. I don't have it now.

206
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,520
Why?

207
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,250
What's the reason that changed your mind, Teacher Kim?

208
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,150
Last year,

209
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,920
I lost a student in my class.

210
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:18,540
I couldn't protect her even when she was alive or when she was dead.

211
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,400
because I'm cowardly.

212
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,840
What exactly happened?

213
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,990
It's all my fault, but I couldn't take responsibility.

214
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,160
That's what I did.

215
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,600
What are you doing?

216
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,340
You know it well, don't you?

217
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,590
Song Hee Yeong's wedding to be held at a hotel in Seoul in 2 days

218
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,650
What is it?

219
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:59,130
I have something I'm curious about.

220
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,930
What is it?

221
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:06,760
Jung Soo In, Go Eun Byul, and your relationship with them.

222
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:14,840
To be specific, what are you afraid about Jung Soo In who died a year ago

223
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,890
to force the witness, Go Eun Byul to transfer.

224
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,600
What are you digging around?

225
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:35,500
Seeing you act like this I guess I did dig something up.

226
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,780
The two cases have no involvement with each other. Don't go around doing useless things.

227
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,720
Don't be curious either.

228
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,670
If you have nothing to respond you don't need to.

229
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:51,360
I'll just go directly to the Disciplinary Committee and ask them.

230
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,460
If it matters or not.

231
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,940
Arrogant little kid.

232
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:05,630
So don't force her to leave like that.

233
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:13,080
I never asked you for anything else before.

234
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,030
Just leave it like that. I still have some more to say.

235
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,780
First of all, although I can't apologize with just one word

236
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,380
I'm really sorry.

237
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,650
You're Soo In's older sister, right?

238
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:01,450
Sorry? Now?

239
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,660
Yesterday, Go Eun Byul was called to the classroom at night.

240
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,490
Was it you?

241
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,510
Yes.

242
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:17,070
You know the reason, so I won't need to explain.

243
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,630
I don't care what you do to me,

244
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:30,040
but don't hurt young students.

245
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,980
I didn't know you were someone who cared about the students that much.

246
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:40,770
I understand your heart, but the method is wrong.

247
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,820
Wrong?

248
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,090
I went to the police and even the reporters.

249
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:49,340
I did everything and it was useless.

250
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,030
Then what should I do?

251
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:01,180
Even you, before I showed up

252
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:05,010
lived without any guilt.

253
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:14,740
What's wrong with wanting to see the person who did wrong pay?

254
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:22,900
Just give me one chance. I'll correct it.

255
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,100
How can I trust a person like you?

256
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,390
If I don't keep my promise, then,

257
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:35,170
I won't say anything about your method.

258
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,970
School 2015: Who Are You

259
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,090
Song Hee Yeong's wedding to be held at a hotel in Seoul in 2 days

260
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,820
Hello?

261
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,390
Hello?

262
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,390
I'm sorry I got the wrong number.

263
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,600
Is this Tae Kwang?

264
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:40,340
Tae Kwang, Tae Kwang.

265
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,150
-This is Tae Kwang, right?
-Mo-

266
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:46,540
Don't hang up and talk. Let's talk for a bit.

267
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,760
Tae Kwang, I have a lot I wanted to say too.

268
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,610
Please don't hang up.

269
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,970
Hey Gong Tae Kwang what's wrong with your expression?

270
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:31,650
You're depressed because there isn't that many days left to see Lee Eun Bi.

271
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,190
Hey, Kang So Young just leave.

272
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,770
I'm going to leave.

273
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:50,320
Just anticipate it until she leaves.

274
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,640
There's a lot that's going to be exposed.

275
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,560
-Teacher.
-Talk.

276
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:26,370
You know I really liked and respected you when I was in high school, right?

277
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,900
Joon Suk.

278
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:34,530
Do you remember when I lost the class fee that I gathered from other students

279
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:40,980
and got misunderstood by the students because I was poor?

280
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,930
Yeah, I remember.

281
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:50,690
If you had just gave me money back then

282
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:58,750
or just covered it up as if it never happened that wound would have probably been still be in my heart.

283
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:05,900
What's the reason you're bring up the past?

284
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:11,330
While getting hit in the rain together, you helped me

285
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,990
move the desks that were in the closet out to the field.

286
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,510
I will never forget that.

287
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:28,690
I also wanted to become a teacher like that.

288
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:36,570
So that I can stand proudly in front of my students, please help me, Teacher.

289
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:44,720
Joon Suk, back then it was a time when I could only think about your pain.

290
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,600
I did, but now it's different.

291
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,740
If you won't do it,

292
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:57,300
then I'll correct it this time.

293
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,680
Teacher.

294
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,360
Oh, Eun Byul. What's the matter?

295
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,950
Don't you have more to tell me?

296
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,310
Then, do you want to talk real quick?

297
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:18,210
All this time,

298
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:23,360
it was you who sent me those texts, right?

299
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,820
Yeah. That's right.

300
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,270
I want to hear why you did that.

301
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,270
Because... I'm Soo In's sister.

302
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,150
If I don't do that,

303
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:04,890
then no one will remember my poor younger sister.

304
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:14,220
You guys were best friends in elementary school.

305
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:21,060
You guys always stuck together and came over to our house often.

306
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,020
Do you not remember?

307
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,560
Last year, Sekang High School's first day of school

308
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,300
Soo In!

309
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,040
Go Eun Byul? Eun Byul!

310
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,330
Hey! What is this? We're going to the same school.

311
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:49,010
This is the first time seeing each other since elementary school, right?

312
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,490
It's so good to see you!

313
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:55,710
-Which class are you in?
-Class 2. You?

314
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,060
Me too. Class 2.

315
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,220
Really? You're in Class 2?

316
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,790
That's so good. Let's go.

317
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,650
Contact me more~

318
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:19,480
What is this? It smells.

319
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,370
Hey, let's go to the store.

320
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,100
The day of Soo In's death

321
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,600
The x...

322
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,740
meets up with the x-axis

323
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,500
at the x-axis.

324
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:15,460
Hey! Wake those next to you!

325
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,050
Teacher, just continue.

326
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,390
We'll lose pace trying to wake everyone up.

327
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,020
You guys are studying at private tutors but sleeping at school.

328
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,160
What has the world come to.

329
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:36,560
Now, it meets up with the x-axis on two different points.

330
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:40,350
Teacher Kim, see me real quick.

331
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,810
Everyone self-study.

332
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,470
Teacher said the end-of-the-day homeroom meeting is canceled. Everyone go home!

333
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:14,290
Yeah. Our Soo In died by herself like that.

334
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,680
Cause of Death: encephalomeningitis*
(*Inflammation of the brain, spinal chord, and their membranes.)

335
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,560
Time of Death:

336
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,760
During Teacher Kim Joon Suk's last class: 4:30pm.

337
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:48,070
Time of Discovery: 8:00pm.

338
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:56,260
If one person, if only one person asked my sister if she was okay,

339
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,240
if she was hurt somewhere!

340
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,860
Our Soo In wouldn't have died.

341
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:13,890
Instead of mourning for the dead, everyone in the classroom,

342
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:19,700
everyone who promised not to say anything about it,

343
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,770
I won't stay still.

344
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,990
- Jung Soo In -
-The Girl Who Became More Lonely After Her Death a Year Ago-

345
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:48,420
I hope to inform everyone about one girl’s lonely death that happened at this school. Jung Soo In was what everyone would call an outcast. Everyone ignored her coldly and she could not do anything else but lay flat on her desk all day.

346
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:57,320
... during fun times...at a joyful lunch time... she suffered by herself...

347
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,020
Find this uploader immediately.

348
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,970
Okay, I will.

349
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,960
Like we discussed in our previous meetings,

350
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,490
Make sure the kids can't access that post,

351
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:22,990
And start finding a way to catch the uploader.

352
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:26,090
Yes, I understand.

353
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,320
Vice Principal.

354
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,530
We deleted the post immediately but it already spread online. News reporters are already investigating.

355
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,690
What?!

356
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,110
Prosecutor Kang

357
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:49,470
First, we blocked the reinvestigation from my side.

358
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:52,860
But I cannot guarantee anything.

359
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:57,660
Lawyer Kang. As you understand, it wasn't done for my benefits.

360
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,350
I did it all for the school.

361
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:08,660
I heard my wife met you earlier.

362
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,170
Y-Yes, she did.

363
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,610
I am processing what she asked.

364
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:18,130
I know this is a ridiculous request, but I hope you'll understand since you have a kid of your own as well.

365
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:23,360
It was an ill-fated relationship, so our child is having a hard time.

366
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,950
Yes, of course

367
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,050
I understand. Goodbye.

368
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,510
Yes.

369
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,340
He's out!

370
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:44,470
Is it true that you instructed to cover up the case a year ago?

371
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,510
What do you think about the manipulated time of discovery?

372
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,800
-Please say something!
-Chairman!

373
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,320
Is it true?

374
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,870
What are you doing? Hurry and drive.

375
00:39:55,870 --> 00:40:00,710
-Sir!
-W-Wait!

376
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,850
Chairman!

377
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:20,830
Mom, what is it?

378
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:30,250
What do you mean what? I came to sleep with my daughter.

379
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:38,790
Before you transfer, you said you had something to do, right? Did you finish all of it?

380
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,420
Not yet.

381
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:46,520
If you finish it before the disciplinary committee meeting date,

382
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,860
let me know.

383
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,770
I want you to transfer quickly.

384
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,080
So you can start fresh at the new school,

385
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,770
I'll help you.

386
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,690
As Lee Eun Bi.

387
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,590
Mom...

388
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,180
Because of my selfishness,

389
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:24,000
you had a hard time, right?

390
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,070
I'm really sorry.

391
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,220
Truthfully,

392
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:40,570
if I said I wanted to live as Lee Eun Bi,

393
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,110
I was really scared

394
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,500
as to how you would think of me.

395
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,630
Why would you think that?

396
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,400
Mom.

397
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,600
Thank you.

398
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:14,060
Han Yi Ahn, I have a favor to ask of you.

399
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,930
How do you feel today?

400
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,920
Please look this way.

401
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,610
Bride: Song Hee Young

402
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,960
Oh, you came? Thank you.

403
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,770
Please look here.

404
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:09,770
♫ When you are lost ♫

405
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:15,530
♫ I will shine a light ♫

406
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:19,840
♫ When your heart shakes because of the wind ♫

407
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,190
Now, it's time for Tae Kwang to sleep.

408
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:25,570
Let's sleep.

409
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:27,070
Mom,

410
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:31,430
Do people die when they turn 100 years old?

411
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:35,790
Will you and dad die when you guys turn 100 years old?

412
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:44,190
When people get old, we do die.

413
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:50,090
I don't like it. You and dad dying. I don't like it.

414
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:57,210
Don't worry. Until our Tae Kwang is 100, even 200 years old,

415
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:00,630
we're going to be next to you.

416
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:01,750
Really?!

417
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:06,880
Of course I'm serious. We need to stick right by our Tae Kwang.

418
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:16,790
♫ Or get trapped in despair with pain ♫

419
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:27,850
♫ With all my heart, I hope to become your comfort ♫

420
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:41,040
♫ I'm praying today again ♫

421
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:09,400
What is it? What's the favor?

422
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,190
For just today,

423
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:16,330
can you stay with me like before?

424
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,110
Even if you don't like it,

425
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,330
do what I ask you to do just for today.

426
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,980
Hey, let's eat this.

427
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:39,400
Are you a kid? Please give us one.

428
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,570
Thank you.

429
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:44,810
♫ Everyone around me is leaving ♫

430
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:50,070
♫ Seats are emptying one by one ♫
♫ I blame myself for just watching ♫

431
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:55,330
♫ I have nothing else to do but rush time that is passing slowly ♫

432
00:46:55,330 --> 00:47:01,300
♫ If I hold it in, will they know it? ♫
♫ Will someone warmly tell me it’s alright? ♫

433
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:06,450
♫ When I look into your two eyes, tears are about to fall down ♫

434
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:12,590
♫ When the lonely night comes ♫
♫ Flying in the wind, should I go somewhere? ♫

435
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:16,880
Hey, hurry up.

436
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,870
♫ I will stay by your side ♫

437
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:26,970
♫ I know well, all your painful scars, I’m your fortress ♫

438
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:31,240
I've always wanted to come here once.

439
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:35,710
♫ It’s too sad to wither as a flower yet unblossomed ♫

440
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:40,850
Han Yi Ahn, give me your hand.

441
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,320
Do you like it?

442
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,190
What is this?

443
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,460
I too,

444
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:58,540
wanted to throw everything away.

445
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:04,080
But back then, I didn't have anyone by my side.

446
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:12,130
If there was a friend like you next to me,

447
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,600
what would you have said to me?

448
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,990
I can't even imagine,

449
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:24,320
how important swimming must be to you.

450
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:28,790
The only person that knows this,

451
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:31,480
would probably be only you.

452
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:36,100
The thing I want,

453
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:41,610
is for you to understand what you actually want.

454
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,130
That's it.

455
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:50,480
You,

456
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:55,260
I know it's hard for you every time you see my face.

457
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,190
But still, I'd like it if you recovered quickly,

458
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:07,200
and returned to the old Han Yi Ahn.

459
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:14,070
I'll try to help you no matter what.

460
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,240
Even if that requires...

461
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,520
Me to disappear.

462
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,350
Han Yi Ahn.

463
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,720
I'm going now.

464
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:57,560
Take care.

465
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:20,870
♫ For you, who is sad and crying ♫
♫ For you, who is struggling ♫

466
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:26,480
♫ I’ll sing this song for you with all my heart ♫

467
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:35,130
♫ When you think you’re alone, when you suddenly start to cry ♫

468
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:40,950
♫ When you feel like no one is by your side ♫

469
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:48,600
It was hard for me lately because I didn't know what to call you.

470
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,680
Go home safely, Lee Eun Bi.

471
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:02,380
♫ Turn around, I’ll be there ♫

472
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:08,500
♫ I’ll wipe away all your tears ♫

473
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:13,240
♫ Even your loneliness ♫

474
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,900
Save all attachments (1 item)

475
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:32,180
I thought you might feel bad so I, instead, gave some money as a wedding gift.

476
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:42,160
What did you do?

477
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,560
Problems with school and mom.

478
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,700
Are you alright?

479
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,760
Foolish child.

480
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,640
What does that mean?

481
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,340
Is this the only thing you thought of in order to get what you want?

482
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,700
You're not possibly thinking that I'm the one who caused all this, right?

483
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,660
Why? You're someone who's enough to do that.

484
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,480
Father!

485
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:09,320
Are you worrying about me after causing all the problems?

486
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:26,910
What do you mean, worry? I've collected what you spread. Things exploded like they were supposed to.

487
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:36,510
That kid that you talked about, I'm going to request for a forced transfer tomorrow so just know that.

488
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:38,850
I don't want to even see your face, so just get out of this house.

489
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:41,970
Alright, you're right.

490
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:44,470
It's my fault that your life got complicated and ruined, right?

491
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:46,910
Then just think that way, I'll let you do that.

492
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,190
But...

493
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:57,910
it's cheating if you touch someone next to me because you hate me.

494
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:12,740
You know well as to what happens if I can't control myself, right?

495
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,760
Gong Tae Kwang.

496
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:48,830
Why are you just trying to leave after coming all the way here?

497
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,930
What?

498
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:55,050
I was just passing by.

499
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:12,720
Hey, what are you thinking about?

500
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,180
I'm not thinking about anything.

501
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:21,480
I'm just looking, so what would I be thinking about?

502
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,840
I do it only when I'm not looking.

503
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,840
Gong Tae Kwang.

504
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:28,660
You know...

505
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,680
I know.

506
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,020
What you're going to say.

507
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:40,120
I also know that whatever I say is going to be useless.

508
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:44,780
But, even so,

509
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,620
I like you.

510
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,560
I'm sorry, Gong Tae Kwang.

511
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:10,470
♫ Whenever I got close to you ♫

512
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:15,380
♫ You tried to get further away ♫

513
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:19,320
♫ I miss you ♫

514
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:23,720
♫ I can't sleep tonight either ♫

515
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:28,260
♫ Out of the countless people ♫

516
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:32,660
♫ Among them, the fact that I met you ♫

517
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:39,120
♫ It's not a coincidence ♫

518
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:43,800
♫ When I go to you ♫

519
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:47,960
♫ Wherever it is ♫

520
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:52,360
♫ I get happy even when I just look at you ♫

521
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:57,060
♫ I shout out ♫

522
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:00,260
♫ Your name ♫

523
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,960
I said I know.

524
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:06,600
♫ So that you could hear it ♫

525
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,980
I know everything so...

526
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:13,810
♫ I'm calling out ♫

527
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,870
just for a moment.

528
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:21,510
♫ When I go to you ♫

529
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:25,750
♫ Wherever it is ♫

530
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:30,270
♫ I get happy even when I just look at you ♫

531
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:34,830
♫ I shout out ♫

532
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:39,670
♫ Your name ♫

533
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:43,570
♫ So that you could hear it ♫

534
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:52,670
♫ I'm calling out ♫

535
00:56:56,290 --> 00:57:00,200
Go Eun Byul took leave without notice during the trip.

536
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:06,500
The karaoke incident, etc. She went against our policy in three different incidents.

537
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,040
Do you acknowledge that these are true?

538
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:15,930
Go Eun Byul got into an unexpected accident during the school field trip.

539
00:57:53,870 --> 00:58:00,030
Now then, we will determine the result of Class 2-3 Go Eun Byul's case

540
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:02,650
with a vote.

541
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:07,550
You know the homeroom teacher doesn't have a say in this, right?

542
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:12,350
Alright, then. We'll start the vote.

543
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:16,210
I did this because I thought there would be a slight chance.

544
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:20,190
I'm simply astounded and baffled just listening to you all.

545
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:24,510
My child will volunteer to transfer.

546
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:30,690
Her grades were outstanding and she was a model student.

547
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:34,790
I don't know why you're trying to kick her out,

548
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:38,930
but I also don't have any thoughts of wanting

549
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:41,910
to send Eun Byul here at Sekang High School.

550
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:13,660
Going My Way

551
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:17,750
Mom.
