1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,780
Actually...

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,340
It's been a while since I regained my memory.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,150
Go Eun Byul, do you remember?

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:23,700
When your memory returns, you promised you'll fulfill my wish.

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:34,040
From now on, tell me "yes" to everything I say.

6
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,590
You're Go Eun Byul, right?

7
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,840
Hey, it's not that hard of a wish.

8
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,800
Sorry.

9
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,330
I'm really sorry.

10
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,980
Don't say you're sorry. Say that I'm right.

11
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,630
Why are you doing this to me? Why are you not Go Eun Byul?

12
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:33,920
Then was everything you did to me a lie? Why didn't you tell me earlier? Who are you?!

13
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,210
Let's go.

14
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,760
Gong Tae Kwang, let go of that hand.

15
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,810
Let go of her hand.

16
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,410
-Gong Tae Kwang
-I told you not to do anything.

17
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,630
No, I have to do this now.

18
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,640
Sorry.

19
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,910
Han Yi Ahn

20
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,350
I...

21
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,650
am not Go Eun Byul.

22
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,080
No.

23
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,190
I think

24
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,120
I've misunderstood.

25
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,150
Later,

26
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,620
let's talk about this later.

27
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,700
Now,

28
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,680
you know everything.

29
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,920
When I lost my memories,

30
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,650
the first love I received

31
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,900
ever since I was born

32
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,650
was so warm and nice,

33
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,500
I think I made the wrong decision.

34
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,210
Back then,

35
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,350
I didn't know that I'd hurt you this much.

36
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,520
I know it's too late,

37
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,930
but I'm sorry

38
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,840
- that I lied.
- I don't know

39
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,180
what you're trying to say.

40
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,030
So...

41
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,200
I think I need some time to think.

42
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,200
School 2015: Who Are You

43
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,780
I have something to say.

44
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,010
-You know we're switching over to our summer uniforms, right?
-Yes.

45
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,170
Anyone who needs a new uniform can go to the infirmary to get new measurements and order one.

46
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,000
- Do you have something to say?
- Yes.

47
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,340
Everyone, do you guys know that our school website has been renewed?

48
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,880
-Yes!
-Ah, goosebumps.

49
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,190
Husband, she's super creepy, right?

50
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,730
Our baby is so excited.

51
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:32,500
Since there's a section to write about teachers anonymously,

52
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,790
please leave a lot of love and thankful comments

53
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:42,010
- about your homeroom teacher!
- Yes!
- Noona...

54
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,430
- Teacher! Is it anonymous?
- Can you track who's writing it with the person's IP address?

55
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,490
Uh, never mind!

56
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,160
Gong Tae Kwang!

57
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,140
Come a little earlier! That's all.

58
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,510
Everyone, do well today! Ajja, ajja! (fighting!)

59
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,710
It became a Sekang Preschool with our new student teacher.

60
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,090
The duck goes "Quack, quack!" The dean goes "Bring my hammer!" The new teacher goes...

61
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,640
"Everyone, ajja, ajja!" School store, go, go, go!

62
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,630
How was it? Did the students listen well today?

63
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:35,650
Yes. As soon as I entered, the students sat down and they answered with loud voices.

64
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,530
I have a class to go to.

65
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,000
She doesn't even know the kids are making fun of her.

66
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,750
Teacher Kim, shouldn't you say something to her?

67
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,840
-I did.
-But?

68
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,340
She believes in the students' purity.

69
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,610
Han Yi Ahn is absent today.

70
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,240
I guess he couldn't take it.

71
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,350
Seeing that he's absent, I guess it was a big shock to him.

72
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,360
Why?

73
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,090
Did you possibly think that even though he knows you're not Go Eun Byul, he would defend you?

74
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,770
-Kang So Young...
-It must bother you.

75
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,450
Every time other kids call you "Go Eun Byul',

76
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,340
I wonder what Han Yi Ahn would think?

77
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,720
You're going to get rid of me?

78
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,680
The fact that you just being here

79
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,280
is hurting him.

80
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,210
You should know that.

81
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,990
-Are you Min Joon's mother?
-Hello, Vice Principal.

82
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:16,660
-Have you been well?
-Yes. I've been doing very well.

83
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,920
You're busy as usual, right?

84
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,980
Of course.

85
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,370
But another issue has risen to make me come to this school again.

86
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,520
Please, sit down for now.

87
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,930
I think I have to see Min Joon's English teachers.

88
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,310
Min Joon, your mom came to school.

89
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,200
-What?
-She went into the teachers' office.

90
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,490
I'll be straightforward.

91
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,890
After hearing about it,

92
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,470
the (laptop) case began when Kang So Young was in the classroom by herself.

93
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,490
That student even lied saying that she wasn't in the classroom.

94
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:19,600
Why are you being petty and cutting off points from innocent students?

95
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,250
Did Min Joon say that?

96
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,560
He's too nice to say something like this.

97
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,890
I heard it from the mothers of other students

98
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:37,350
The rumors have spread to more than half the students. You didn't know?

99
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,710
It's true that So Young was in the classroom alone

100
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,500
but there's no hard evidence that shows she's related to the laptop incident.

101
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,870
Then you should find hard evidence!

102
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:58,470
Or return Min Joon's points.

103
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,190
Oh my goodness, 5 points?

104
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,270
He didn't do anything wrong, so why should he be punished?

105
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,960
There's the issue of fairness for the students who submitted in time, as well.

106
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,890
It's not possible to give points without penalty. I'm sorry.

107
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,520
I see.

108
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,540
I didn't want to make a school-related incident like this...

109
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,330
But seeing how the teachers can't handle it

110
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,180
I have no choice but to seek help from the police.

111
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,930
What? The police?

112
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,370
Min Joon's mom, instead of that...

113
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,200
Please sit down.

114
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,460
I'll see you later.

115
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,900
Oh! Min Joon's mother! Min Joon's mother!

116
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:02,000
It's J Entertainment. Your audition date and time has been set. Please give us a call.

117
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:15,470
You got a call, right? My uncle was really busy, but I had to beg him like crazy to spare some time.

118
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,580
You have to do well, okay?

119
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,360
Hey! Let's go eat.

120
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,600
What? It's lunch time.

121
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,490
Oh...

122
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,570
I don't have an appetite.

123
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,800
Is that so?

124
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,950
Alright.

125
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,580
Hello.

126
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,450
Yi Ahn, it's been a while.

127
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,970
I didn't get a call from Eun Byul. What brings you here?

128
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,870
I...am here to see you.

129
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,040
Really?

130
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,360
Okay then. Hold on for a second.

131
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,480
Have you been well?

132
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,370
Yeah.

133
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,750
It's okay, tell me.

134
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:48,800
You... came because you're curious about Eun Byul, right?

135
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,170
Aigoo...

136
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,100
Gong Tae Kwang.

137
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,260
Why didn't you go to the cafeteria?

138
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,740
Your misunderstanding is a bit harsh.

139
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,760
I don't feel like eating either.

140
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,920
Ahjusshi! Here, here!

141
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,070
Of course, our country.

142
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,970
We have the best delivery system.

143
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,310
Are you sure you're the "good-looking man waiting at the Sekang High field stands?"

144
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,850
You found me.

145
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,890
-How much is it?
-It's $14.

146
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,350
Eat well!

147
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,740
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang.

148
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,220
Hey! When you don't have an appetite, black bean noodles are the best.

149
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:58,500
Hey! This place is really delicious. Do you know how to mix it like this?

150
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,200
You don't know, right? What do you know?

151
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,260
Hey. Eat this.

152
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,920
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang. Don't you hate me?

153
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,010
It's delicious. Hurry and eat.

154
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:40,460
So, did you have a good talk yesterday?

155
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,820
Yeah.

156
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,880
Doesn't it feel good to be caught with your lie?

157
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,890
No,

158
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:51,680
it seems like the feeling that I didn't want to get caught was bigger.

159
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,990
Hey, stop talking. Eat a dumpling. You look like one.

160
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,750
Hey, are you okay?

161
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:25,810
It hurts to see such a young girl living such a hard life.

162
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:31,470
At that moment, both her and I...

163
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:38,080
had only each other.

164
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,670
I wish you wouldn't misunderstand.

165
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,180
Yes.

166
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,600
You were really surprised, right?

167
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,510
I still can't believe it.

168
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:03,800
But, I was selfish to keep her by myself.

169
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:09,070
After I came to my senses, my heart was heavy.

170
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,620
No matter how much love you give them,

171
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,570
would living as someone else be comfortable?

172
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,920
So, we're going to move soon

173
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,600
and transfer schools.

174
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,930
Until then, pretend like you don't know anything.

175
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,420
Lastly, regarding the laptop Incident,

176
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,920
let's not suspect people without evidence.

177
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,200
For now, until the verdict comes out, I ask that you wait patiently.

178
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,160
That is all.

179
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,550
You did well.

180
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,520
I went to the laptop tech shop yesterday

181
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:33,100
and found out that one laptop was internally broken while the other two were manually formatted by someone.

182
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,360
Did you know

183
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,610
that it was your laptop that was internally broken?

184
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,720
Yes.

185
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,060
I did it.

186
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:54,830
I knew my laptop was broken,

187
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,300
so I formatted the other two laptops.

188
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,070
If I said that,

189
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,570
what would happen to me?

190
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:25,090
My laptop was fine until gym class

191
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,810
and I didn't touch anything.

192
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,930
Min Joon.

193
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,020
Telling a lie and then correcting yourself afterward

194
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,200
is really difficult.

195
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,160
You can lose a lot of things

196
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,760
and get fingers pointed at you.

197
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,340
But because of that, if you pretend to not notice,

198
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,220
the road to correcting your mistake gets farther and farther away,

199
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,270
and you choose the cowardly path.

200
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,590
Past events don't disappear as if nothing happened.

201
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,300
I hope you won't be like that.

202
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,060
Hello.

203
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,490
Miss Cha Song Joo?

204
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,950
Yes.

205
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,610
If you have prepared something, show us.

206
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,240
Okay.

207
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,350
♫ Bass player, this is N.Flying  ♫

208
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,230

I can't even talk to you  ♫

♫ Oh la la la la la  ♫

Of suffering  ♫

217
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,820
What about me? Why don't you think about me?

218
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,960
Day after tomorrow, I won't have a mom.

219
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,500
Do you not pity me? I'm by myself now!

220
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,170
I will never send them!

221
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,850
You're good.

222
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,230
Were you a trainee somewhere else?

223
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,770
No, this is my first entertainment audition.

224
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:04,450
Oh really? I think we have good luck.

225
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,790
It was good.

226
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:12,280
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

227
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,930
Gong Tae Kwang, why?

228
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:25,570
I'm just checking to see if you blocked me since you ignored all my calls.

229
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,390
Would there be something like that?

230
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,360
That something is here.

231
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,910
What the heck?

232
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:39,890
Hey. Kang So Young was so excited because you're leaving.

233
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:47,010
Yeah. I told her that I'll take care of her before I leave.

234
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:52,830
Then, we have to hurry and send Kang So Young away.

235
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,210
So I don't have to see this face anymore.

236
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,020
Aigoo.

237
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,510
Aigoo. Aigoo, Aigoo.

238
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:48,200
So we're going to move soon, and transfer her.

239
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,150
Until then, you can pretend not to know, right?

240
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,020
Tongyeong.

241
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,950
Thank you.

242
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,130
Tongyeong.

254
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,520
I miss Eun Bi noona.

255
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,460
We're going to see her right now.

256
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,920
No, I mean the real Eun Bi noona. She's not even there if we go.

257
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,400
Right, what's the point of bringing our grades?

258
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,120
She probably can't even see them.

259
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:47,190
Eun Bi unnie is up there.

260
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:53,470
We may not see her with our eyes, but if she sees that Seung Min got a prize,

261
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,090
Unnie would be so happy.

262
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,800
She was like that in the past.

263
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:04,830
Right, she congratulated us and made us ddeokbokki (spicy rice cakes), right?

264
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,600
Yeah, right.

265
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,490
Noona, are you crying?

266
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,370
No.

267
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:20,550
If I cry, Eun Bi unnie will be sad.

268
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,670
So I won't cry.

269
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,610
Let's go.

270
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,320
Ra Jin...

271
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,000
Seo Eun!

272
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,070
Oh no, are you okay? I'm sorry.

273
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,390
What do we do? Are you okay?

274
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,370
Yeah, I'm okay.

275
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,520
Oppa, here.

276
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,300
- I'll put it on for you.
- Okay.

277
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:17,180
♫  To you, who is sad and crying, to you who is having a hard time.  ♫

278
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:23,540
♫  I'm singing this song for you with my heart ♫

285
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:13,190

00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:23,730
♫  even you loneliness ♫

288
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:46,130
Of course, this isn't accurate evidence to say that Min Joon did it.

289
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:49,520
Same goes for So Young.

290
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,510
I understand what you are saying.

291
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,760
As you said, there isn't any confirmed evidence,

292
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,080
so please don't give trouble to my child.

293
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,710
You too,

294
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,290
do that please.

295
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,410
I'm home.

296
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,660
It's not, right?

297
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,680
Your homeroom teacher is mistaken, right?

298
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,770
Son,

299
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,070
aren't you answering me?

300
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,580
There's nothing confirmed,

301
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,030
so keep your mouth shut.

302
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,500
Go wash and start studying.

303
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:04,960
Oh, my son! You're here?

304
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,940
Did you drink a lot?

305
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,540
A lot? No.

306
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,160
Hey. When are you going to grow up

307
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,530
and drink with your father?

308
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,190
I'm taller than you.

309
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,210
You're fooling around now.

310
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:27,620
Hey you! Are you all grown up just because you're tall?

311
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,320
You don't even know the taste of alcohol.

312
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,090
What does it taste like?

313
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,740
Well.

314
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:45,900
When it seems like you're still hungry after eating so much food,

315
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,730
if you drink this...

316
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:57,310
Do you want to try?

317
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,080
After my competition the day after tomorrow, pour me some.

318
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,420
I'll see if it really would fill my empty stomach, like you said.

319
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:15,220
Aigoo. You praiseworthy guy.

320
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,370
Okay, after you get the medal,

321
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:21,830
drink the alcohol that I give you, okay?

322
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,370
Okay.

323
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,770
Mom.

324
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,230
Are you okay?

325
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,070
I'll call the school and say that you will rest for a day.

326
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:04,480
No. I'm all better.

327
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:08,170
Did you stay awake the whole night?

328
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,500
Hey, Go Eun Byul. Why is your face like that?

329
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,510
Are you sick?

330
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:47,170
Oh, it's nothing much.

331
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,190
I did my audition.

332
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,340
You did?

333
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,810
Nothing that you were predicting happened.

334
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,980
I think I will be able to sign the contract.

335
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,000
Song Joo...

336
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,140
Go Eun Byul.

337
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,910
While preparing for my audition,

338
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,630
do you know how much I wanted to get encouragement from you,

339
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,320
and brag to you?

340
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:21,610
Why did you make our relationship like this?

341
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:24,400
Song Joo, I–

342
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:36,660
I know a lot of you are worried because of the laptop incident.

343
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,790
After checking the CCTVs and investigating,

344
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:43,600
there wasn't any certain evidence.

345
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,550
- Kang So Young.
- Kang So Young.

346
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,330
It's her.

347
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,340
She's the worst...

348
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:56,270
I think I just told you that there isn't any certain evidence!

349
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:59,180
It's not right to mindlessly suspect one another and spread rumors,

350
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,250
And all the more, ganging up on one student.

351
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,780
Without a doubt, that is violence, too.

352
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:10,660
I hope our class doesn't have something like that.

353
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,050
Quiet! So what I'm saying,

354
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,560
the only way to solve this case

355
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,630
is to receive a self-confession.

356
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,400
I'll give you 2 days.

357
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,270
If anyone has anything to say about this case,

358
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,770
find me by 9 pm tomorrow.

359
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:43,440
A call is good, messages are good.

360
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,100
I will do my best to

361
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,450
help you find a way.

362
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,930
That's all.

363
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,870
Ah.

364
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,560
Will anyone say anything?

365
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,940
Eun Byul.

366
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,020
Go Eun Byul!

367
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,220
Yeah?

368
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,200
Are you okay?

369
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,000
Are you sick?

370
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,490
You have a high fever!

371
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,800
Get up. Let's go to the infirmary.

372
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:59,250
Let's go. Aigoo...

373
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:04,270
Aigoo, if you were this sick, you should have said something.

374
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,110
Hey!

375
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,110
Are you really sick? Aren't you faking it?

376
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:57,360
Gong Tae Kwang, stop talking to me and go to class.

377
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,720
Hey. I'm hurt too.

378
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:33,010
♫ For you, who's sad and crying ♫
♫ For you who is struggling  ♫

379
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:40,310
♫ I'll sing this song for you with all my heart  ♫

380
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:47,290
♫ When you think you're all alone ♫
♫ When you suddenly start to cry  ♫

381
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:53,190
♫ When you feel like no one is next to you  ♫

382
00:41:53,190 --> 00:42:00,320
♫ Remember that you're not alone  ♫

383
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:07,520
♫ Even if the world always hurts you  ♫

384
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:14,820
♫ Even if you're lonely or sad, don't cry  ♫

385
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,640
♫ I'll wordlessly hug you  ♫

386
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,960
♫ I'll listen to you  ♫

387
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:28,970
♫ Look back, I'll be here  ♫

388
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:35,110
♫ I'll wipe away all your tears  ♫

389
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:39,670
♫ Even all of your loneliness  ♫

390
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,740
Go Eun Byul!

391
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,810
Hello.

392
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,790
Do you have something on your mind?

393
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,270
No.

394
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:09,090
If you have a problem, don't hold it in and find me anytime!

395
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,850
Okay, I will.

396
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:14,170
Eun Byul, fighting!

397
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,320
Min Young!

398
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,680
What a surprise, Mom.

399
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:48,030
School 2015: Who Are You

400
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,370
Right?

401
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:53,530
They're making me solve a problem per minute.

402
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,820
Does that make sense?

403
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,880
Hey...!

404
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,970
You're all better. Ahjusshi, let's go.

405
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:00,950
Hey, Eun Byul!

406
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:04,520
Hey! Hey! Gong Tae Kwang! Gong Tae Kwang! Lunatic!

407
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,850
I'm going to report you to the police!

408
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,820
Eun Byul...

409
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,480
What are we doing?

410
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,600
Let's just go, huh?

411
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:20,950
Let's go.

412
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:22,850
Hurry up!

413
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,260
It's amazing, right?

414
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,120
Do you remember?

415
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,380
What?

416
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,260
"Hi, Go Eun Byul."

417
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:56,330
Hi, Go Eun Byul!

418
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:08,180
Should we do it again? Our greetings?

419
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:19,270
Hi... Lee Eun Bi.

420
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,400
Thanks,

421
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,700
Gong Tae Kwang.

422
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:01,580
Aigoo!

423
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:05,360
Hey! What's this?

424
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,950
What is this?

425
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,720
A cell phone.

426
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,780
A mobile phone.

427
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,020
What color shoes are these?

428
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:19,980
Black color.

429
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,120
Black color.
(Korean has multiple ways to say things.)

430
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,840
See? It doesn't matter what you call it.

431
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:36,020
It's the same for you too. It doesn't matter to me if you're Lee Eun Bi or Go Eun Byul.

432
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:40,360
So, in front of me, be whoever.

433
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,760
Whoever you want.

434
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,220
Hey, Han Yi Ahn!

435
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:41,560
At her old school, there was a horrible kid

436
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,080
who bothered her enough to make her think of suicide.

437
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:54,710
Aren't you even going to say thanks?

438
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:55,870
Why should I?

439
00:48:55,870 --> 00:49:00,690
I don't know about anyone else, but I thought you would understand me.

440
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:06,090
A weird person is pretending to be Go Eun Byul, doesn't that make you mad?

441
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:09,610
I heard that you're the one who made her do something like that.

442
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:13,280
Well, I guess I can see how you would think that.

443
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:20,150
But there's still a lot left to reveal, so wait for it.

444
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,080
Hey, transfer student!

445
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:29,510
You should stop.

446
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:32,950
You look pitiful.

447
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,600
Pitiful?

448
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:55,710
Of course.
 - This is embarrassing, but thank you. *^^*
- Teacher, you're the best~
- If you write something bad, I bet they'll track you with IP.. lol
- Is this really anonymous? Hahaha

00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:09,010
...transferred to Seoul Sekang School Class 2-3...

Tongyeong N. Girl's Highschool, Bullied Student Commits Suicide

454
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:36,030
-What wrong did the dead girl do? Bully b*tch lives on shameless.
-What is the ghost doing... Not taking away girl like So Young...

455
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:07,990
Here enters Tongyong N Girl's High's Girl K!

456
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:11,660
Hey, Cha Song Joo, you were talking about a novel last time...

457
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,690
What is this?

458
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:17,480
She probably won't say she has the same name as the girl in her neighboring school.

459
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,480
How come out of all the schools she could have ran to, it was ours?

460
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,640
I really don't like it.

461
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,900
You're so rude. What the heck.

462
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,080
Unbelievable.

463
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,410
She went too far.

464
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,830
Song Joo...

465
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,660
That is...

466
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,230
Go Eun Byul, have you eaten yet?

467
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:08,060
Let's go to the school convenience store. You buy since I bought last time.

468
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,670
-Let's go.
-Okay.

469
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:25,390
Hey! What's going on? Did you do this, by chance?

470
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,430
It's wasn't me.

471
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,310
Are you okay?

472
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:37,250
I think it's better this way.

473
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:42,040
What is? What's better?

474
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,470
After you get rid of Kang So Young, then what?

475
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:47,270
It's done if you leave this school?

476
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:53,570
Well, I guess you would feel a lot better, like you have any good memories of us anyways.

477
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:58,580
You...don't have any good memories of me?

478
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,320
What?

479
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:06,150
Since coming here, I was really happy...

480
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:09,740
And you were one of the reasons why.

481
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:18,820
You– are not leaving right at this moment,

482
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:22,540
so be prepared.

483
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:37,800
The High School Division Men's 400m freestyle (swim) will begin shortly.

484
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,910
Swimmers, please make way to the lanes, accordingly.

00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:02,380
Han Yi Ahn, I'm going to reveal Go Eun Byul's identity today.

486
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:05,720
It's a waste that you won't be able to witness such a great event.

487
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:08,390
Do well in your competition.

488
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:15,130
She's here, she's here.

489
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:18,140
Hello, Girl K.

490
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:23,210
Isn't she Girl K?

491
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:25,530
How can a person...

492
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:28,180
She's the worst.

493
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:30,870
She really is the worst.

494
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:32,760
Hello, Girl K.

495
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,970
Hello, hello, hello!

496
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:39,940
Girl K, hello.

497
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:23,770
Please be careful.

498
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:48,720
-Oh no!
-What do we do?
-He's hurt a lot!

499
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:11,490
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- It looks like you're hurt a lot.

500
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:16,600
Call 911! 911! Call the ambulance!

501
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,270
Are you okay?

502
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:21,720
Are you okay?

503
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,960
I think he's hurt a lot.

504
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:34,330
Hey guys! You're having a lot of fun,

505
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:35,730
chewing me out lately, right?

506
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,070
She's good.

507
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:40,870
She's shameless.

508
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:43,950
It's fun chewing you out.

509
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,640
That's good.

510
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:54,640
About the N Girl's Highschool.

511
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,210
it's true that it's the school I used to go to, Noori Girl's High.

512
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,810
and that Girl K is me.

513
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:03,030
She said it's right.

514
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:07,290
She said it herself.

515
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:11,220
She admits it.

516
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,830
But...

517
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,730
the dead, ostracized, victim...

518
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,840
What does she look like?

519
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,700
Aren't you curious?

520
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,400
Should I...

521
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,900
show you?

522
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:49,820
What is she talking about?

523
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:10,690
♫  There’s an empty world deep, in my heart, save me  ♫

524
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:17,290
♫  I wanna reset, I wanna reset, I wanna reset  ♫

525
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:24,000
♫  Lonely eyes trapped in darkness, is there anyone to hold my hand?  ♫

526
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:30,500
♫  I wanna reset, I wanna reset, I wanna reset  ♫
