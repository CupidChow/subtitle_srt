1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,510
I...
- Last Episode -

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,550
I have something to tell you guys.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,750
Truthfully...

4
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:34,690
What is this? It's scary! Didn't they say that Go Eun Byul's sister died?

5
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,950
It looks like we've finally all gathered to the same place.

6
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:07,660
I told you, didn't I? Lee Eun Bi from Tongyeong isn't dead.

7
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,340
Don't worry. Keep saying what you were going to say.

8
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,450
I'm sorry. I'll explain later.

9
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,110
Kang So Young, see me for a minute.

10
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,450
Do it here. Why? Do you still have more to hide?

11
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,090
I don't want to hear your thoughts. Follow me.

12
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,580
Why should I?

13
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,790
I said follow me!

14
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,260
Wow! Awesome!

15
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,850
- Hey.
- What is this?

16
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,030
Who is that?

17
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,790
Wow.

18
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,380
No. No.

19
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,730
Kang So Young, give it to me.

20
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,590
What?

21
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,890
If you called me to come here,

22
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,530
then you got all what you wanted. So hand it over!

23
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:57,170
Ah, the video? Why is the smart Go Eun Byul like this?

24
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,570
If that video is released, then it's game over.

25
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,800
Do you think I'm going to give it to you that easily without any copies of it?

26
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,400
What did you do to my sister, exactly?

27
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,710
Don't worry. Do you think she'll die from it?

28
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,690
When many people see your same faces,

29
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:36,430
and when the video pops up, there will be talk.

30
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,370
That...

31
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,180
Did you take it?

32
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,170
Maybe.

33
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,560
Answer properly.

34
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,390
Did you do it?

35
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,210
I'm sorry for lying all this time.

36
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,230
I'm Lee Eun Bi and...

37
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,510
- Hey, wow.
- She must be crazy.

38
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,890
Hey, wait a minute. What are you saying right now?

39
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,880
You're saying you're not Go Eun Byul?

40
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,280
Then you are Lee Eun Bi, but you acted like Go Eun Byul who lost her memory?

41
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,060
Then the Eun Byul who said her memories returned is the real Go Eun Byul?

42
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,520
What is this?

43
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,180
Hey, Go Eun Byul.

44
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:36,020
No... So, you two switched places

45
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,230
and pretended to be one person?

46
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,900
Hey, Han Yi Ahn, you knew?

47
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,360
Yeah.

48
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,480
How can you two do this?

49
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,560
I didn't intend to trick you from the start.

50
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,910
When I woke up in Tongyeong,

51
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,880
I lost my memories

52
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,930
and I didn't know what was what, so I believed I was Go Eun Byul and came to Seoul.

53
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,390
When my memories came back,

54
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:20,270
so many things happened already

55
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,570
that I couldn't tell the truth.

56
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,690
Hey. But still, until when were you planning to trick us?

57
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,530
Hey. Is this a hidden camera prank?

58
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,590
This is a hidden camera. 100% hidden camera.

59
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:38,980
Hey, be quiet. Let's listen to the end.

60
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:45,730
Whatever the reason, it's true that I tricked you guys.

61
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,510
So it's obvious to get mad at me.

62
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,680
I'm really sorry.

63
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,110
Hey, Go Eun Byul! Are you crazy?

64
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:10,280
Kang So Young, listen carefully.

65
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:21,410
The same faces, and when the video pops up, there will be talk.

66
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:26,650
That... Did you take it?

67
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,090
- Maybe.
- Answer me properly.

68
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,920
- Did you take it?
- Yeah. I did.

69
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,440
What are you doing?

70
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:45,020
That video. If you show it to someone or if it's online for even a second–

71
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,720
No, if you even mention that video,

72
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,780
it will be best if you leave.

73
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,720
Do you think it will be different without you?

74
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:10,700
I'm warning you. As long as my head remembers,

75
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:17,040
the way for you to live is to not get in my sight as much as possible,

76
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,820
and not doing anything as much as possible.

77
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,280
That's all.

78
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:34,020
♫ I believe, I believe, I won’t fall down again ♫

79
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:40,580
♫ I believe, I believe, there'll be no more tears ♫

80
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:48,280
♫ You know that tomorrow's sun will rise ♫

81
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,320
♫ You never cry ♫

82
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,380
♫ You never cry ♫

83
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,660
If there's something I did wrong, I should obviously apologize,

84
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,760
but I feel like that apology was irresponsible.

85
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,100
Isn't it more irresponsible to avoid the apology?

86
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,380
Saying sorry after hurting others,

87
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:29,560
I don't know whether that hurt got better or deepened.

88
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,390
It seems like I did it to make myself feel comfortable.

89
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:40,240
I think I'm like that to you too.

90
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:51,540
That's probably why I don't want to say sorry.

91
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,620
It's okay.

92
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:01,550
You don't have to say what you don't want, right?

93
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:06,270
If you don't have to hear what you don't want to hear, how good would that be?

94
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,490
School 2015: Who Are You

95
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,770
Hey.

96
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,430
Who are you?

97
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,710
I'm sorry.

98
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,990
Go Eun Byul, right? It's you now?

99
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:58,340
Hey, Eun Byul. I don't know about others, but isn't it wrong to do that to us?

100
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,100
It's true that I shouldn't have. I'm really sorry.

101
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,370
I'll ask little by little about why you did it or where you were.

102
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,020
What I want to ask you now is,

103
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,780
are you okay right now?

104
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,860
- Yeah.
- Then that's good.

105
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,740
- Thanks.
- So... What was it?

106
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,920
Nice and kind Go Eun Byul is your younger sister, Lee Eun Bi.

107
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,370
The rude Go Eun Byul is the real Go Eun Byul, but...

108
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,290
Hey, that's enough. Stop it. It hurts my head.

109
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:38,560
Hey. Your sister, Lee Eun Bi, must've been through a lot all this time because of Kang So Young.

110
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,170
She is really scary.

111
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,880
We need to punish her. That's the way it should be.

112
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,310
Hey, also, tell Lee Eun Bi to call me. I have to scold her.

113
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,430
Should the four of us meet and play? It would be so fun, right?

114
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,700
Hae Na.

115
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:05,690
Whatever the reason, Kang So Young isn't it.

116
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,800
Who said I won't admit it? You're right.

117
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,740
Even with the laptop incident and the fake Go Eun Byul incident, everything Kang So Young told us was right. But...

118
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,470
Keep talking.

119
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,270
You're saying that you admit

120
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,730
that everything I said was true, right?

121
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,020
It's a relief that the truth was revealed.

122
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,270
Right, Cha Song Joo?

123
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,020
Yeah.

124
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,400
But Kang So Young,

125
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:08,270
Even after I know that what you said is correct, why can't I understand you more?

126
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,800
What?

127
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,030
You really don't know?

128
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,880
The reason why the kids hate you more than the Lee Eun Bi who lied.

129
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:24,740
You, do you make friends just to confirm that

130
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,700
you are the best and strongest?

131
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,510
I'm honestly saying this to benefit you,

132
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,290
don't live like that.

133
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,710
She's so cool. On point.

134
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,060
She's alive.

135
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:02,130
How can an 18-year-old student do these horrific things to her own classmate?

136
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:07,720
- And even after these things in the past, instead of reflecting on the wrongdoings, you're now threatening!
- What do you mean threatening?

137
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,290
Look here. Like I said,

138
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,620
that video or whatever you're talking about, is not found anywhere on my child's phone or computer or anywhere!

139
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:21,060
- You can't be like this just because the kids were playing around!
- Mother.

140
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,210
Please don't use the phrase "playing around" in this situation.

141
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:32,630
Whether you have the video or not, making a friend feel burdened is a wrongdoing.

142
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:39,100
The student Kang So Young's personality and atmosphere never seemed like that of a child, but instead was very cold.

143
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,670
But I now know why after looking at you.

144
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,040
- What did you say?
- I'm saying that the student

145
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,980
is very pitiful.

146
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:54,550
There is no child who goes into the wrong path with no reason.

147
00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:01,340
Please settle down, and sit down.

148
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,520
Sit down, please.

149
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,190
After looking at all the cases,

150
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,120
for now,

151
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,920
it seems like disciplinary action for student Kang So Young will be inevitable.

152
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,180
Pardon?

153
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:28,620
Well, we have a voice record file which shows that she threatened a friend with a video that she doesn't even have.

154
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:37,330
Also, other than that, we have other students that confirm that she bothered other students several times.

155
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,280
We'll proceed in opening the disciplinary committee.

156
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,530
But,

157
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,030
why is it only my child that must face disciplinary actions?

158
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:55,640
A student used her twin sister and sent her to school instead.

159
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,420
The fact that they switched places and tricked the teachers and students,

160
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,410
doesn't go against the rules?

161
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,070
Please give a penalty to that student as well.

162
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,040
What is this? Is the disciplinary committee opening up again?

163
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,470
- Why?
- Who is it this time?

164
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,110
Class 3. Your new homeroom teacher is here.

165
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,280
In charge of your math class, this is your teacher Kim Seul Young.

166
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,700
- Listen to him well. You can do well, right?
- Yes.

167
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,240
Teacher, please introduce yourself.

168
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,870
Nice to meet you.

169
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:55,880
Since I'm your homeroom teacher, I'll take responsibility for every grade in this room.

170
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:07,350
I briefly heard about the incident going around. I don't need kind students, nor care about students that cause problems,

171
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,100
I do not condone and will not be lenient with whoever bothers those that are trying to study.

172
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:18,440
So you all pay attention and work hard on whatever you need to do individually. Understand?

173
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,850
- Hello!
- Hello.

174
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,630
Now, last time...

175
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,570
Gong Tae.

176
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,470
Why are you here without even contacting me? Did you miss my class?

177
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,400
I missed it a lot. I didn't know.

178
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:57,490
Teacher, your voice is better sleeping pills. I just took a wonderful nap.

179
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:05,360
Hey punk, the result is not important.

180
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,120
Yi Ahn.

181
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,400
No matter how fast you recover and the pain disappears, you are not in the condition to compete.

182
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,270
Coach.

183
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:22,190
I know. I'm not purposely chasing after the medal. I will just try to run like when I first started.

184
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,110
You might just lose confidence.

185
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:30,130
Still, I want to try.

186
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,300
I need to buy my dad's present. Will you pick one out?

187
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,720
Now that I'm done with training, I'm hungry.

188
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,990
Hey! Come out immediately.

189
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,090
Why are you so happy?

190
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,780
Aish. Ah!

191
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,470
- This isn't it!
- What isn't?

192
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,550
Ah...

193
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,990
I'm at my academy.

194
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:34,070
♫ Do you remember? The time when we first met ♫

195
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,660
Hey!

196
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:43,580
- Hey, Gong Tae Kwang. Why are you here?
- I'm here to study at the academy.

197
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,550
Do you think I came here to see you?

198
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,940
You always sleep at school, so what studying?

199
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,520
Are you okay?

200
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,210
Yeah.

201
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:03,490
Now, I don't need to lie to anyone. I'm fine.

202
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,590
Let's go.

203
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:22,970
♫ I love you, you’re my everything ♫

204
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:29,430
♫ Forever, you know ♫

205
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,340
Han Yi Ahn.

206
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,480
How are you two together?

207
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,060
I go to this academy.

208
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:45,080
Gong Tae Kwang. You go here?

209
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,990
Why? Is it weird that a Korean student is going to an academy?

210
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,740
It's weird if you don't go. Like you.

211
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:59,830
But, why are you here?

212
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,170
To walk her home.

213
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,290
Because we are going the same way.

214
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,470
Forget it.

215
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,290
I'll go alone.

216
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,370
I want to go alone.

217
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,050
Hey, Lee Eun Bi.

218
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,490
Ow!

219
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,230
Kwon Gi Tae, minus one point.

220
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,220
Excuse me?

221
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,400
Hey, Teacher. Why? Huh?

222
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,310
Don't question what I do. Minus 3 points.

223
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,640
Kang So Young

224
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,940
Kang So Young. You study well, but why do you make such trouble?

225
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:37,840
As soon as you transferred, two people, and from those above.

226
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,240
I feel like I'm going to be biased now.

227
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,380
Now, homeroom's begun.

228
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,940
You've both been having a hard time, haven't you?

229
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:03,460
What I'm thinking to do is to close the shop and move,

230
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,460
and for you two to transfer schools.

231
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,720
How would you like that new start?

232
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,020
Yeah. I like it.

233
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,060
Yeah. Me too.

234
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,500
Alright then. I'll look into doing that, alright?

235
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,380
But, I have something to tell you and Eun Bi.

236
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,880
What is it, Unnie?

237
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,860
It's something I have been thinking of for a long time.

238
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,900
But back then, there was no one besides you except for me.

239
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,940
It didn't make sense, so I closed those feelings.

240
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,780
But right now, you have Eun Bi, too.

241
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,820
Why are you going around in circles?

242
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,900
There is something I want to study.

243
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:11,330
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang.

244
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,510
Let's eat together.

245
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,210
- It's alright.
- Sit down.

246
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,630
Hey, I'm transferring.

247
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,830
In the end, it happened like that?

248
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:43,210
It's a good thing that happened. If I transfer, I get to go to school with Eun Bi.

249
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,390
And, I might study abroad.

250
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,950
- Study abroad?
- Where are you going?

251
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,290
That's why you should be good to me before I leave.

252
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:01,150
I want to say hi to Eun Bi.

253
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:06,150
That's right. Make time for us to say hi to Eun Bi before you go.

254
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,620
Do you want to watch a movie on the weekend?

255
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,780
Hey, are you like that because you're moving?

256
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,700
No matter how far, it's going to be a place where people live. Where cars pass and there's electricity.

257
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,720
How many times have I told you?

258
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,460
Gong Tae Kwang–

259
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,180
I don't care about that stuff.

260
00:24:52,200 --> 00:25:00,160
But what about you? You don't feel anything about how far away you'll be from me?

261
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,350
Tae Kwang...

262
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,820
Every time I see you,

263
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:16,200
I have always been thankful and sorry.

264
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,080
I wanted to be as good as you were to me.

265
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,580
Hey. I got it.

266
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,180
You don't have to answer my question.

267
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,160
In my opinion,

268
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,350
us, like this, is enough for me.

269
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:38,190
That's a lie.

270
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,550
That's why I'm saying this.

271
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:51,930
How you look at only me,

272
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,750
I can't look at you like that.

273
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,190
I'm sorry.

274
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,910
Isn't this stuff I already knew?

275
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,410
I understand, so get up.

276
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,130
Let's go.

277
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:34,810
Anorexia nervosa. In other words, it's an eating disorder.

278
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,590
Sekang High's most unwanted, Kang So Young.

279
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:55,170
I'm close with Kang So Young, but she's a bully.

280
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,320
Ah, that problematic transfer girl...

281
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,820
Out of all places, why is she at our school?

282
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,050
At Tongyeong High School,

283
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,630
she killed somebody...

284
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,780
Even if she almost killed a person...

285
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:09,020
Kang So Young's picture...
I don't think I can go to this school anymore...

286
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,110
So did you set up a departure date?

287
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:23,630
First, we are going to move. As soon as break starts, I'm going to leave.

288
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:31,070
Han Yi Ahn. Do good so I can brag about you being my friend while I'm overseas.

289
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:36,070
Hey, ever since I was 8 years old, I went around showing off that you were my friend.

290
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:40,540
Han Yi Ahn...

291
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:49,280
After experiencing what happened to Soo In, I realized a lot about myself and my friends.

292
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:57,480
The most important thing is not what others see of me, but my feelings.

293
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,820
Why didn't I know?

294
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:06,460
So, I'm giving a lot more time towards my dream.

295
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:10,260
Hey. You're cool.

296
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,580
And I'm saying this now.

297
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,400
I always made fun of you for always doing worse in school than me.

298
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,600
But when it comes to swimming, you are the best.

299
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,100
What?

300
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:35,010
Go Eun Byul. Be well.

301
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:40,630
Don't forget I will always be cheering you on, and don't get sick.

302
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,810
You too.

303
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,800
Did you meet with Eun Bi?

304
00:28:53,950 --> 00:29:00,210
Ah, so suffocating. You two are really not my style.

305
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,500
Sorry.

306
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,200
Stop it.

307
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,820
Hey!

308
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,870
I said to stop! Seriously.

309
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:26,440
I told you to stay quiet or step on those in order to not let it backfire. How many times did I tell you?

310
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:32,640
Because you couldn't handle something like this, you ultimately got me eliminated from nomination!

311
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,520
Stop it!

312
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,300
What should I stop?

313
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:45,100
How many times did this happen? I suffered so much to get a place here from when I transferred from Tongyeong.

314
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:51,270
Because of this careless child! Wh-what kind of state am I in?

315
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,270
Honey.

316
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:55,750
All kinds of rumors have spread all over the district, so my nomination was rejected.

317
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,870
I cannot even go about holding my head up!

318
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,740
Stop it. She's frightened!

319
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,960
You.

320
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,100
You better get your head on straight.

321
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:14,770
If you do something stupid like this again, I don't care if you're my child– There will be nothing for you!

322
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,440
You know Eun Byul made this event specifically so that we could also be friends with Lee Eun Bi?

323
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,060
Let's meet up and hang out like this sometimes even after we move.

324
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,300
I don't want to.

325
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,010
We're going to meet up often, right Song Joo?

326
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:16,150
Yeah, that's right. We're going to make you so irritated by visiting all the time.

327
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,750
Do that.

328
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,180
Ah, you're so cute! You grew so much! What grade are you in?

329
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:29,870
Noona, where's that Air Force Academy field trip article from last time?

330
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,390
At his school, they do an individual study on subjects they choose.

331
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:49,020
Ever since his field trip, he's been in love with airplanes and has been acting like that.

332
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,280
That little one has a dream, too...

333
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,700
I have something to say to you one last time. - Kang So Young

334
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,450
What's the matter?

335
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,560
Why do you think I called you?

336
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,720
I'm not sure.

337
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,000
I have nowhere to go,

338
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,260
and no one to meet up with.

339
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,680
You're an idiot.

340
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,030
The type that would go running to help a pitiful person.

341
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,900
You said I was pitiful.

342
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,290
You said that from when you first met me.

343
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,780
The videos

344
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,150
are gone.

345
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,160
If you don't believe it, I can't do anything about it. But it's true.

346
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:17,900
Since your awesome older sister destroyed my phone, it disappeared.

347
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:25,800
That's why I'm practically in tears because I'm so thankful to Go Eun Byul.

348
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,090
I,

349
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:36,860
at some point,

350
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,940
forgot how to stop.

351
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:49,810
I'm not going to ever apologize to you.

352
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,160
Even if you say you're going to forgive me...

353
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,090
There's nothing that would change.

354
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,790
Kang So Young.

355
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,150
I know that

356
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,440
you're regretting everything.

357
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,970
There is only one encouragement

358
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,840
that I can give you.

359
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,260
That I'm alive.

360
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:25,910
When you realized you did something bad,

361
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:29,370
when there's no one in this world to accept your apology...

362
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,620
That's such a terrifying thing.

363
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,180
If, sometime in the future, you

364
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:45,510
sincerely want to say something to me,

365
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,490
I hope me, living well,

366
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,300
encourages you, even just a little bit.

367
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,990
Lee Eun Bi.

368
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,550
Move the x to the back.

369
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,000
Up to here for today.

370
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,270
Thank you!

371
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,940
Gong Tae!

372
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,960
Are you sick?

373
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,150
What?

374
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,920
Why are you awake in my class when you should be slee–

375
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,870
This is not it...

376
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,650
What's the matter now?

377
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,410
Teacher.

378
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,020
What do you like the most in the world?

379
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,810
Why do you ask?

380
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,940
Not just liking it,

381
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,330
but liking something the best in the whole world.

382
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,450
I was just wondering if you could live without seeing it.

383
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,480
You can live through it.

384
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,640
But why?

385
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,960
Why would you not be able to see what you like the most?

386
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,810
Because she

387
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,530
likes someone other than me the most in the world.

388
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,280
And, I don't want to see her keep being sorry.

389
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,010
Tae Kwang.

390
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:20,890
You can live without seeing it by holding yourself back.

391
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,240
But,

392
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,550
you can't stop liking it just because you want to stop.

393
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,870
Why?

394
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,750
Do kids these days just let that happen?

395
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,630
Anyway, you're saying you can live through it by holding yourself back.

396
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,930
But,

397
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,680
you won't be happy.

398
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:55,550
Gong Tae Kwang, you grew a lot, having a girl you like.

399
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:02,370
Who is it? Tae Kwang, who is it?

400
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:11,680
Teacher, what do you like the most in the world?

401
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,530
Notice
Gumoon High School
Employment for a short-term math teacher

402
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,920
Are you moving tomorrow?

403
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,600
No.

404
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,220
After a few days.

405
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,550
Are you going to keep avoiding me, then leave?

406
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,410
No.

407
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:14,140
Hey. Lee Eun Bi.

408
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,490
I

409
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:23,080
will end my feelings for you the way you want,

410
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,850
so leave comfortably. You can do that.

411
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,750
What?

412
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,820
You're going to definitely regret it in the future, rejecting me.

413
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,840
Gong Tae Kwang.

414
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,320
Whatever.

415
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,980
Hurry up and go inside.

416
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,880
Since your house is right there, I'm not gonna walk you home.

417
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,230
Go.

418
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:55,690
Go on.

419
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,880
Hey, Lee Eun Bi.

420
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,420
Teacher Kim Joon Suk said...

421
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:42,050
Even if you really like someone, you can live on by holding back.

422
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,620
When I met you today,

423
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,790
I was going to lie that I'd end my feelings.

424
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,220
But, I don't want to do that.

425
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,740
So,

426
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,360
I'll just tell you honestly.

427
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,810
No matter how much I think about it,

428
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,510
there's no way for me not to like you.

429
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,300
So I'll just stay like this.

430
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:31,490
You don't need to feel sorry.

431
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,900
You don't need to do anything.

432
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,970
My feelings...

433
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,880
Just know them.

434
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,450
All right.

435
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,280
I'm done.

436
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,910
Now,

437
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,930
you can really go.

438
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:56,730
Hey, won't you get rid of that?

439
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,170
Yeah.

440
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,890
Hey.

441
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,940
You like Han Yi Ahn, don't you?

442
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:17,620
Hey, if it's like that, then it's right.

443
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,220
Why are you surprised?

444
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,960
You must really be an idiot.

445
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,920
Eun Bi.

446
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:35,710
After I knew about you, do you know what upset me the most?

447
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:42,830
The mom I love and the sister I longed for...

448
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:47,090
Why couldn't the three of us be a family?

449
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,900
That was it.

450
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,740
Unnie.

451
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:53,450
I'm fully happy right now,

452
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:57,300
and Han Yi Ahn and I are still good friends.

453
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,810
Whether you accept his feelings or not,

454
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,410
that's your choice.

455
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,710
I didn't know you'd be leaving so quickly.

456
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:18,190
After we decided to move,

457
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,530
it seems like time is going by so fast.

458
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,000
What about my tournaments?

459
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,670
Will you be able to see them?

460
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,570
I'm sorry.

461
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:31,700
That day is the day I transfer.

462
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:35,770
Hey.

463
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:38,460
What's wrong with you?

464
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,450
You're not going to see me now?

465
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,770
Han Yi Ahn.

466
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,570
I like you.

467
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:00,920
But, right now,

468
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,410
rather than the person I like,

469
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,700
I think I have to think about who I am first.

470
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,220
So that's why you... And that's why other people...

471
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:20,930
When I feel that you and others like me for who I am.

472
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,370
At that time, I'll accept your feelings.

473
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,950
I told you already.

474
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:42,640
That I could wait for a long time.

475
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,670
Han Yi Ahn.

476
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,550
Stay well.

477
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:14,680
When you find your real name, and you're sure of your feelings about me,

478
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,540
give that back again.

479
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,480
But,

480
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,450
you have to make sure to give it back to me.

481
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,670
This is what I cherish the most.

482
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,050
How are you feeling on the first day of your transfer?

483
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,920
- Eun Bi.
- Huh?

484
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,890
What is it, Mom?

485
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:09,530
The male freestyle 400 meter finals will start.

486
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:12,580
This day is especially important since this is Han Yi Ahn's comeback.

487
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:16,230
Han Yi Ahn got hurt, but he has come back.

488
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:20,450
What will he show for us? Let's wait. They've started.

489
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:24,660
Everyone has a great start.

490
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,080
They are all hard working swimmers.

491
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,320
Now the lead swimmers are starting to show.

492
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,930
For now, he is not showing any sign of after effect of injury.

493
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:39,470
♫ Lonely eyes trapped in darkness ♫
♫ Isn’t there anyone to hold my hand? ♫

494
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,420
They have changed directions.

495
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,700
Wait, what happened? He stopped.

496
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:12,780
Han Yi Ahn can't go any further. He can't seem to move.

497
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,110
Fighting!

498
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:19,280
That's right.

499
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,320
Is he having the same problem?

500
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,860
What happened? Han Yi Ahn's condition was great today.

501
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:28,660
Everyone doesn't know what to do.

502
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:34,890
Kim Yi Soon!
Park Jun Sung!

503
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:38,350
We can't believe what is happening in front of our eyes. Han Yi Ahn.

504
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,990
You can do it.

505
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:49,600
But Han Yi Ahn started to move again. Han Yi Ahn is moving again.

506
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,430
He can't use his right shoulder.

507
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:55,940
He's only swimming with his left.

508
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:10,800
♫ When you are lost ♫

509
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:16,710
♫ I will shine a light ♫

510
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:24,890
♫ When your heart shakes because of the wind ♫

511
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:31,560
♫ I will hold your hand ♫

512
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:39,380
♫ For you, I pray ♫

513
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:47,080
♫ That you’ll be protected, I pray ♫

514
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:54,940
♫ So that my hopes can reach you ♫

515
00:49:54,940 --> 00:50:02,900
♫ The closed door is slowly opening ♫

516
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:10,330
Han Yi Ahn! That's right!

517
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:18,020
♫ Or get trapped in despair with pain ♫

518
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:28,240
♫ With all my heart, I hope to become your comfort ♫

519
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:42,950
♫ I'm praying today again ♫

520
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:47,690
6 Months Later

521
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,650
Class 3.

522
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:31,620
We have a new transfer student today.

523
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,110
Come in.

524
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:47,030
Oh.

525
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,390
Hey, Go Eun Byul.

526
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:55,310
Isn't it Eun Bi?

527
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,710
Who is it?

528
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,060
Hi.

529
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,830
My name is

530
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:15,090
Go Eun Bi.

531
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,740
It's Eun Bi.

532
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:36,230
Go Eun Bi

533
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,570
Rooftop.

534
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:08,570
♫ My heart is thumping ♫

535
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:12,370
♫ I keep trembling ♫

536
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:18,420
♫ Every night, even when I can't sleep ♫

537
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,970
♫ It keeps growing even more ♫

538
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,640
Hey, Lee Eun Bi.

539
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,990
You make someone so surprised.

540
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,280
You transferred? For real?

541
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:42,080
Hey, Go Tae Kwang you want to die?

542
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:48,620
You're not?

543
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,070
No way.

544
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:55,000
I'm right. You're Lee Eun Bi.

545
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,810
Hey,

546
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:58,700
I'm Go Eun Bi.

547
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:04,640
Go Eun Bi

548
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,260
Aish. Hey.

549
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:10,860
Look.

550
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:15,910
As the Y equation has X under the root,

551
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:18,920
you can draw the graph in the Y direction.

552
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,010
Alright, everyone draw it together.

553
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:26,430
Hey, don't put your head down!

554
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,910
Geez!

555
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,500
So you put your fingers here.

556
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,200
Yes, that's good.

557
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,190
Hey, Shi Jin what are you doing?

558
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:49,130
Concentrate, concentrate.

559
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:50,980
18 years old.

560
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:53,860
It's too early to fulfill your dream,

561
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:57,160
but it's a great day for that dream to start.

562
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:08,760
It hurts to fall,

563
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:14,400
but it's a great day to learn how to get back up 100x.

564
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:20,860
The love that we thought would last forever. The moment before college admittance,

565
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:24,180
and no matter who said the love would immediately end badly.

566
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,240
You guys are going to break up when you go into college.

567
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,130
You'll also break up even if you don't go.

568
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,610
Because we're 18 years old,

569
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:38,920
we're loving towards each other like today is our last day

570
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,790
and also hating.

571
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:50,150
We're immature. It's easy to get hurt at that age.

572
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:52,740
At that time,

573
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:58,030
you'll get hurt and have a hard time.

574
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,390
Even so,

575
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:05,350
after that long time has passed,

576
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:10,210
at that time, you can say your happiest moment

577
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:15,910
was when someone lent a warm hand after you fell.

578
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:28,110
Mom, I got a letter from Unnie.

579
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:29,820
Really?

580
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:36,040
I miss her.

581
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:43,630
Eun Byul's going to come to Korea soon.

582
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,240
What are you doing?

583
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,780
Going to school. You?

584
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,180
Same.

585
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:24,900
Have you been well?

586
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,260
Yeah.

587
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:31,320
Did you not watch the game?

588
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:36,090
Yeah, sorry.

589
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:37,860
Did you do well?

590
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:40,960
So so.

591
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:46,670
Liar.

592
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:54,730
♫ I liked you a lot, still I do
Do you remember ♫

593
00:57:54,730 --> 00:58:00,100
♫ The day we first met ♫

594
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:06,200
♫ When you call, wherever it is ♫

595
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,890
Congratulations, Han Yi Ahn.

596
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:09,270
Hey.

597
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,720
What is up with your hair?

598
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,710
You, right after you come back...

599
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:14,400
Ah, hey, wait a minute.

600
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,710
No more, no less.

601
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:23,120
When a friend is crying, you step in to help.

602
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,950
I

603
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:30,960
and we... There's nothing that we can't beat that comes in our way.

604
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,240
It's okay.

605
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,460
You can be hurt.

606
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:57,000
Since you're 18 years old.
