1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,480
What?

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,340
School?

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,190
It's no fun.

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,260
So, I'm just going around and looking for fun stuff to do.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,620
Ah, I died!

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,300
But do you know this?

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,800
What's even more boring than school is this interview right now.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,850
You should leave now.

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,300
What do you have to say?

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,340
Actually...

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,600
I have a concern.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,420
I don't want to hear your concerns.

13
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,660
Look for someone else.

14
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,580
When I was at Tongyeong,

15
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,800
there was a famous outcast in our class.

16
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,370
At middle school, she was the class president and she was doing so well...

17
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:06,360
After showing off and butting in she fell with one blow.

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,890
Honestly, you could play around among friends

19
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,380
but because of her death

20
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:22,220
I, who had no fault, had to transfer.

21
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,850
So? What is it you want to say?

22
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:40,410
Can a dead person come back to life?

23
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,360
Living as someone else, deceiving everyone around her

24
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,770
So I'm going to try finding out a little.

25
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:59,880
That outcast, if she's dead or alive.

26
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,260
Your friend died,

27
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,980
but that's the only thing you can think of?

28
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,900
You're really pitiful.

29
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,730
In my eyes, from elementary school until now,

30
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,450
you seem very pitiful.

31
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,570
I knew you would say those words.

32
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,200
Our outcast, nothing has changed about you.

33
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:55,560
Lee Eun Bi, long time no see.

34
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,400
Hey, because of you, do you know what I went through at Tongyeong?

35
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,670
This punk!

36
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,580
Do you want to die?

37
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,510
I really hate being bothered when I'm sleeping!

38
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,540
Sorry.

39
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,370
I, also,

40
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,050
have something to say.

41
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:00,090
My twin sister that lived in Tongyeong.

42
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,330
The Lee Eun Bi you speak of,

43
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,170
none of my friends here know of her.

44
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,590
I also found out only recently.

45
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,530
I heard the news that she died after being bullied by her friends

46
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,880
so I went to Tongyeong.

47
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,080
It was you, huh?

48
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,320
What?

49
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,150
I...

50
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,360
am aware of everything you did.

51
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,760
You...

52
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,370
What should I do with you?

53
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,860
I'm going to have to think about it from now on.

54
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,110
School 2015: Who Are You

55
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,030
Now for the next question, "For example"(in English), for example what should we do (in Korean).

56
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,590
"In the movie Twilight", the movie Twilight that you all like,

57
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,750
"the scene when Bella realizes"

58
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,890
Oh, "realizes," she realized something! What might have Bella realized?

59
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,670
Should I also tell you a secret?

60
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:30,170
The words I say... don't believe any of them.

61
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,930
I'm a total liar.

62
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,730
"Edward has a super power."

63
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:40,290
You know...my name...

64
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,330
is Go Eun Byul.

65
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:47,800
"... superpower". Edward has superpowers.

66
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,050
The moment Bella found out that Edward had superpowers...

67
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,930
"Is much less." "Less" means less (in Korean).

68
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,110
"Much less." Yes, that means it was less by a lot.

69
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,290
Now, "in the book," that means in the book...

70
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,390
Husband, isn't Gong Tae Kwang going crazy?

71
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,020
Was he ever in his right mind?

72
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,750
Gong Tae Kwang is listening to the lesson!

73
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,100
You're right.

74
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,050
Gong Tae Kwang, "leaves out," what does that mean?

75
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,870
It seems so, huh?

76
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,300
Park Min Joon?

77
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,300
To leave something out.

78
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,730
That's correct! That means they left something out.

79
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,340
What did they leave out? Let's find out! Lea-ve O-ut.

80
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,030
"So an important part from the book."

81
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,540
So they left something out from the book, what could that be?

82
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,540
Hey,

83
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,930
eat with me.

84
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,360
Alright, let's eat.

85
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,060
Does the transfer student like Gong Tae Kwang?

86
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,170
He's so pitiful, that mental patient.

87
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,040
Right?

88
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,960
What are you thinking about?

89
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Nothing.

90
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,580
What...I said before.

91
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,780
It was a bit weird but it was pretty funny.

92
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,940
Did you perhaps...tell anyone about it?

93
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,250
Oh... Don't worry.

94
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,870
You don't seem to have realized it yet

95
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,920
but I'm known as a crazy guy so no matter what I say, no one will believe me.

96
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,600
Is that so?

97
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,490
I have a request.

98
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,680
Pretend you didn't hear it.

99
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,720
But you shouldn't be saying this to me.

100
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,390
Go Eun Byul, do you know how dirty her temper is?

101
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,370
No one can bother her at this school.

102
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,030
It'd be best to settle things quickly with her.

103
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:45,370
But you said, "let's eat together." Why haven't you eaten anything? What a waste.

104
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,360
Soo Mi, I have a favor to ask of you.

105
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,480
What is it?

106
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:06,580
Go to the Love House and find something with the outcast's handwriting.

107
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,720
That's not too hard. Okay!

108
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,560
In 5 minutes, I'll call people out to solve the problem on board.

109
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,450
Ah, yes.

110
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,230
- That scared me!
- What the heck?

111
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,910
What are you doing?

112
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,770
Teacher, I did it. I did it.

113
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,760
I'm shooting a commercial!

114
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,630
Oh! Fighting!

115
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,370
Sure. First of all, congratulations.

116
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,120
Since you stood up, Cha Song Joo, come and solve the problem.

117
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,890
What?

118
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:29,590
You...must have a lot to ask me. I know that but

119
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,990
can you hold it in?

120
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,520
I have nothing to ask you. What?

121
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,740
Then, why do you keep following me?

122
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,450
What kind of confidence is that?

123
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,370
School ended, so I'm going home. Home.

124
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,720
But, my house isn't this way.

125
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,750
What do you want to know?

126
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,330
I said there was nothing like that. I'm not curious about anything. I have no interest in your business.

127
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,560
Then, why do you keep following me around and bothering me?

128
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,810
Because I'm worried!

129
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,700
Is that what you thought?

130
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,840
Me?

131
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,380
Why should I worry about you?

132
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,390
Since when have you been saying one month, one month?

133
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,440
Madam, I'm really sorry about this.

134
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,610
If you didn't think you could pay, then you shouldn't have signed my contract!

135
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,400
Considering your situation, I only raised it $1,000

136
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,930
With that kind of warranty these days, you won't be able to get a house.

137
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,450
This time, I'll make sure to give it to you next month.

138
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,130
This is the last time!

139
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,220
I'm sorry. I'll contact you.

140
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,050
- Father.
- Hm? Oh.

141
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,020
What's wrong? Are they asking to raise the warranty again?

142
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,230
Hey, no. Nothing's wrong. You don't need to know.

143
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:02,200
Hey, let's eat dinner. You're hungry, right? Hurry, come in.

144
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,690
This is the highlight of the competition. The two players' rival match. There is only a few meters left!

145
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,890
There you go! A little bit more!

146
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,520
This is good! Just a little bit! A little more!

147
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,560
That's right! That's right! Gold medal!

148
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,750
Athlete Han Yi Ahn won the gold medal.

149
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:29,170
Hey, great job! Great job, my son!

150
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,670
Yi Ahn, play this again.

151
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,420
- Again?
- Yeah.

152
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,910
How many times is it going to be?

153
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:40,240
Even if you play it 100 times, I won't get tired of it.

154
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:45,640
My son, can I expect you to do well in the May competition?

155
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,220
Of course, whose son am I?

156
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,880
Right.

157
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,790
Now.

158
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,900
That's right! Speed's good! Just like that!

159
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,100
Just a little bit more!

160
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,280
These days, among the emerging sport stars

161
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,100
it's not easy to find someone as popular as Han Yi Ahn

162
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,500
Even so, if you ever change your mind, give us a call.

163
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,940
Ah, yes, hello? This is Han Yi Ahn.

164
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,410
Yes.

165
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,530
The advertisement modelling you talked about before...

166
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,850
Yes.

167
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,350
Eun Byul, let's go out now.

168
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,120
What are we going to do?

169
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,350
A date?

170
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,450
Let's go.

171
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,080
I'm so happy it's over.

172
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,820
What should we do? Go to the PC room?

173
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,830
I have somewhere to go. Sorry.

174
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,520
Hey, are you going to meet Go Eun Byul again?

175
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,120
I'm going first.

176
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,800
Eun Byul.

177
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,520
- This is totally your style, isn't it?
- Huh?

178
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,730
Yeah, it's pretty.

179
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,250
I'll go try this on.

180
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:45,020
No. What you're wearing now suits you anyway.

181
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,480
Do whatever you want.

182
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,710
Hold on a minute.

183
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,330
Han Yi Ahn

184
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:36,200
I was surprised when you said you wanted to meet here. Did you remember?

185
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,970
This library... Did you and I come here often?

186
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:46,060
Yup, our elementary school is near. We used to have lessons here once in a while.

187
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,880
I see.

188
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,860
You know...

189
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,910
Before I went missing,

190
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,870
did I ever mention someone chasing or bothering me

191
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,260
to you?

192
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,560
No, why are you asking that?

193
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:17,520
Oh right, the scar that I mentioned before.

194
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,100
It seemed like you got it during the school trip, just right before you met me.

195
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,630
Ah, really?

196
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,100
Why?

197
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,160
It's nothing.

198
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,880
Hey! I don't know what's going on but if something happens, tell me immediately.

199
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,340
- Got it?
- Yeah.

200
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,220
Follow me.

201
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,690
Hey, don't you remember?

202
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,980
I don't.

203
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,790
Hold on.

204
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:31,820
♫ I’m floating around alone ♫
♫ Everyone around me is leaving ♫

205
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,960
♫ Seats are emptying one by one ♫
♫ I blame myself for just watching ♫

206
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,720
♫ When I see your two eyes, tears come. ♫
♫ When lonely night comes the wind blows ♫

207
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,340
♫ When I see your two eyes, tears come. ♫
♫ When lonely night comes the wind blows ♫

208
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,220
♫ Should I fly in the wind, go somewhere?  ♫

209
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:57,520
♫ I'll stay by your side  ♫

210
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,640
Han Yi Ahn, I'm sorry.

211
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,720
For what?

212
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,570
Two people's childhood

213
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,900
became a memory only one person remembers.

214
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,630
That's why I said you better return this thing to its original state.

215
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,720
Hey.

216
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,910
Hey, Go Eun Byul.

217
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,970
You don't have to know. Because I'll tell you everything.

218
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,530
But, even if it gets tiresome, bear with it.

219
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,290
Talking about memories going back 10 years will take some time.

220
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,900
♫ It does not cheer me up. Where there's not even a moment of mellow ♫

221
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,200
♫ Give me a drop of water to me stuck in this brittle reality ♫

222
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:54,110
♫ My hopes that no one listens to  ♫

223
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,780
♫ Are just passing by  ♫

224
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,970
Min Joon, come eat!

225
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,540
Park Min Joon!

226
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,460
Yes!

227
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,580
You're not even going to greet me?

228
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,130
Did you sleep well?

229
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,480
Yeah, brat.

230
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,260
What do you mean "brat?" You need to respect your kids so they grow up well.

231
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,940
I had to give up the master bedroom because he's "going to a good college" and I can't watch TV because it's "too loud."

232
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,330
I can't even breath loudly because of him.

233
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,070
How much more respect can I show him?

234
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,820
I don't think that's something you should be saying.

235
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,390
Don't you see all the money I'm earning is due to Min Joon?

236
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,970
Aigoo, this household sure is holding up well.

237
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,130
A girl named So Young transferred into your class, right?

238
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,620
How did you know?

239
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,420
Even the new kid So Young's mom would hear about me.

240
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,710
If you get pushed by a student from the countryside, you know I'll be disappointed, right?

241
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,400
Yes.

242
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,880
In the group of wives with successful husbands, I couldn't say a word.

243
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,320
But because of my son, I get to live saying things freely.

244
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,740
Here. Eat a lot.

245
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,090
Sekang High School

246
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,340
What are you doing?

247
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,540
Ah, Class President, I accidentally dropped something.

248
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,220
- You came early.
- Yeah.

249
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,250
I woke up early today.

250
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,820
Is that so?

251
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,430
Love House Rules
1. Get up at 8 am. 2. Brush your teeth three times a day.

252
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:49,550
Whoa. The handwriting is exactly the same.

253
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,890
I'm so thirsty.

254
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,890
Hey! Stop stealing and start buying things yourself.

255
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,640
Aish.

256
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,920
Hey Gong Tae! Do what you usually do and sleep!

257
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,300
Why do you keep following this person and that person?
Hand that over!

258
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,460
Hey, you guys know that magnetic poles of the same polarity will push each other away, don't you?

259
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,910
Next to a lunatic,

260
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,660
another lunatic won't come.

261
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,630
Understand?

262
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,830
Oh my! What is he saying again? He's really weird. Let's go.

263
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:06,840
Seriously. Drink up.

264
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,930
Now, that's all.

265
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,940
Goodbye.

266
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,100
Goodbye.

267
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,240
Hello!

268
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,970
Hey guys! I have my shooting today.

269
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,650
What shooting?

270
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,370
I'm leaving first. Sorry.

271
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,610
It's not even on TV. If it's only on advertisement flyers then let's just get over it.

272
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,350
Our Hae Na is prettier, right?

273
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:41,100
Hey Gong Gi Tae, you usually start with flyers to appear on TV and star in movies.

274
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,450
Hey, as soon as the flyer comes out, there will be endless calls for me.

275
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,930
Good luck.

276
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,800
Go safely. Fighting!

277
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,060
Destroy them all.

278
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,760
Hello, hello.

279
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,960
Hello.

280
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,990
Athlete Yi Ahn, do well.

281
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:32,060
Han Yi Ahn. What are you doing here?

282
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,810
Oh, I have a shoot.

283
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,820
Really? Me too.

284
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:42,340
Hey, it looks like we're partners. That's so great!

285
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,480
Now, now let's start the shoot!

286
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,660
Now, get into your positions.

287
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,290
Please come this way.

288
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,900
Yes, this way.

289
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,130
Our Ga Young in the main spot.

290
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,800
Your uniform is so pretty.

291
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,930
Thank you.

292
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,230
It looks custom-made.

293
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,330
Han Yi Ahn! Come here!

294
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,600
Ah, yes.

295
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,120
Hey, I'll see you later.

296
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,700
Huh? Yeah.

297
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,790
Now, introduce yourselves.

298
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,390
Hello.

299
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:17,150
Hey, change your outfit. And you see them, right? Stand by over there.

300
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,900
Yes.

301
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,920
Now, with confidence

302
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,830
Let's go!

303
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,950
Nice!

304
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,800
Nice!
You're having fun!

305
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,100
Ah, that's good.

306
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,360
Let's be a little bit brighter!

307
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,850
Joo Young, smile!
Wow! Yi Ahn,

308
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,480
your pose is so great.

309
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,240
And Ga Young is on point.

310
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,960
The mains are very good.

311
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,460
Now happily.

312
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,700
A little bit happier.

313
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,830
And give a little pose.

314
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,150
Okay! That's great.

315
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,900
Smile in the back!

316
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,120
In the back, you have to smile!

317
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,710
Wait, wait. Cut! Cut!

318
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,880
Who is she?

319
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:07,470
Hey! Poop head! You!

320
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:08,770
Yes?

321
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,850
Are you the only one who stepped on poop before you got here?

322
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:15,080
What's with your expression?

323
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,600
I'm sorry.

324
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,030
The mains in the front had great expressions right now.

325
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:23,060
Because of you, we have to start over now!

326
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

327
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,540
That awkward poop head.

328
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,680
Yi Ahn, I'm sorry. We'll be finished soon.

329
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,360
Yes, it's okay with me.

330
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,260
Now, let's go again.

331
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,540
Now, cue!

332
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,530
Now, start!

333
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:51,310
Hey poop head, smile!

334
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,470
Yeah, it's good!

335
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,010
You go buy it!

336
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,750
Give me some snacks.

337
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,730
Cell phone, please.

338
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,800
Eun Byul.

339
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,550
Let's talk for a moment.

340
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:34,970
This bastard. Are you still out of your mind?

341
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:38,390
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry!

342
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:44,650
After a few punches, he's gotten a little scared

343
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,370
It doesn't affect him anymore.

344
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,200
About what I said last time. That was not all of it.

345
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,700
I don't know what you heard from your younger sister,

346
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,650
but the more you look at it, I am the victim.

347
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,070
So?

348
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,150
You must have had a hard time too,

349
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:14,070
but it hurts me to know that Eun Bi is like that.

350
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,530
I got hurt too.

351
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,430
So, let's pretend it never happened.

352
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,370
Something that never happened?

353
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,280
Do you think it's that easy?

354
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,470
Then? What are you going to do about it?

355
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,550
I need to think carefully about this.

356
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:45,350
I haven't made a decision yet.

357
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,330
It's not because you have a lot to hide?

358
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:11,290
You guys, let's not be like this, and let's just go for it.

359
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,730
Let's just say Go Eun Byul has a twin.

360
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:17,140
And that Kang So Young was forced to transfer after bullying her friends.

361
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,140
How's that? It's totally fair, right?

362
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,550
Do you want me to gather the kids and do it for you?

363
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,100
Why? Should we reveal yours first?

364
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,190
I'll see you later.

365
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,750
Ugh, this girl...

366
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:59,050
Hey! If you started it, then you should see how it ends!

367
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,420
I can't hold back when I'm curious!

368
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:05,940
From now on, whenever you see her, make sure you call me.

369
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,640
You understand–

370
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:50,880
Now I prepared a special lunch, let's eat with the mains and staff and let's have strength!

371
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,350
I'll eat well.

372
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:56,730
Oh, this is good. It's fantastical lunch.

373
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:00,320
Is this kimchi delicious? Share this with me.

374
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,510
Director, can I be excused?

375
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,260
All right. Enjoy.

376
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,260
Yes. Enjoy yours.

377
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,510
Hurry up and go. You being like this,

378
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,030
it makes my mood even worse.

379
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,500
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

380
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm pathetic, am I not?

381
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,530
What is?

382
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:55,620
I told the kids I'm a model and made a big deal.

383
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:59,530
"You look great, Cha Song Joo".

384
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,980
Han Yi Ahn.

385
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,190
Good for you.

386
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,990
What?

387
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:14,600
You have a dream, and you have the skills to fulfill that dream.

388
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,760
How blessed you are.

389
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:24,320
When I first started swimming, we did an activity.

390
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,600
Stuff like holding your breath underwater, planking, and diving.

391
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,040
And then we had to learn how to breathe, go up levels and learn to kick our legs.

392
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,610
If you miss one, you can't go on to the next one.

393
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:44,220
So, think of yourself as an aspiring swimmer starting off with learning how to breathe.

394
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,370
You,

395
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,220
when I saw you there, your pose wasn't even that good..

396
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,260
Hey, it's because I didn't show my full abilities today, but I am actually way better than you.

397
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,110
Who said anything about that?

398
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,620
I'm just saying it like it is.

399
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,090
Alright, you poop head.

400
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:12,900
Don't call me that too!

401
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,320
- Gong Tae Kwang.
- Hey.

402
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,720
Forget it. Hurry, go inside.

403
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:59,180
Why were you over there?

404
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,840
Today, don't call Go Eun Byul out.

405
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,660
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang. What is it?

406
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,800
Did something happen to Eun Byul?

407
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,880
You don't need to know.

408
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,970
Welcome.

409
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,080
Hello.

410
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,550
You're Prosecutor Kang Il-Ssan, right?

411
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,900
Yes, it's nice to meet you.

412
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,140
Please take good care of my Soo Young, Chairman.

413
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,410
Dad.

414
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,730
Oh, isn't that So Young?

415
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:47,440
I'm more thankful that a student with the best grades came to this school.

416
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,940
I know, right? What's her relationship with the chairman?

417
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,150
- Let's go inside.
- Yes.

418
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,150
Today is the day we switch seats, right?

419
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,480
Because there was an error in the random program,

420
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,360
We'll change seats in a way that should be an old memory bypath.

421
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,200
From the back row, come up and pick one up.

422
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,290
Wow, it's not like we're elementary students.

423
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:12,220
Hey, quickly, quickly.

424
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,710
You checked your seats, right?

425
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,840
Yes!

426
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,260
Now gather all your things and go.

427
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,630
Changing seats!

428
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,960
I'm here too.

429
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:20,160
Seat in your assigned seat, not anywhere you want.

430
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,330
Now, then. That's all.

431
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,880
Hey! Are you good at anything else besides swimming?

432
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,980
What about you? You're short.

433
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:42,790
♫  There’s an empty world deep in my heart, save me  ♫

434

455
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,290
Hey, what's with him?

456
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,860
Are these guys drawing romantic manhwa (comic books)?

457
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,060
It's already a series.

458
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,690
You can't see her. You can't see Song Joo.

459
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:34,860
You can't see her.

460
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,910
Hey, you little rascals, you must enjoy looking at Han Yi Ahn's photos.

461
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,480
That's not it. Look at this.

462
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,160
- Who is that?
- Cha Song Joo.

463
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,620
Cha Song... Wow, awesome!

464
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:52,110
Wow, it's more amazing that you guys found this out.

465
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,320
Hey! And I was thinking how big of a deal it was.

466
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,100
- I could do this much too.
- That's what I say!

467
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:01,140
Now, now. The first person who can find Cha Song-Joo

468
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:06,320
will receive a prize of $10. Find Cha Song Joo!

469
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,490
- Isn't that her?
- Hey! Isn't that Cha Song Joo?

470
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:12,280
Wow! Here's her forehead.

471
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,500
Hey! That is Cha Song-Joo.

472
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,980
Look! She's over here with her weird hair!

473
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,580
Guys...

474
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,450
Cha Song Joo.

475
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,410
It's pretty. Just my style.

476
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,500
How is it? Nice?

477
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,810
- Cha Song Joo.
- Song Joo.

478
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:49,320
Give me a minute. I want to be alone for a minute.

479
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,360
Don't follow me.

480
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,950
Are you okay?

481
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,350
Would you be okay if you were me?

482
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:18,920
When I first transferred and walked right into the classroom,

483
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,310
all I could see was you, because you were so pretty.

484
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,360
What are you saying?

485
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:31,080
Hey! You're way better than that main model.

486
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,290
Forget it.

487
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:39,770
My uncle is the representative of J Entertainment.

488
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:42,170
Should I introduce you to him?

489
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:50,670
My uncle kept asking me if there were any okay girls at school.

490
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,310
Really?

491
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,910
Cha Song Joo.

492
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,890
Did you overcome it?

493
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,900
Got over it!

494
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,360
Am I the type of person to get upset over something like that?

495
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,080
Now you're acting like Cha Song Joo.

496
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,990
It's really just a booger sized treat, but eat a lot.

497
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,850
Yes.

498
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,470
It's good.

499
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,860
Yi Ahn, you came?

500
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,690
Hi. Hey.

501
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,480
Hey, Han Yi Ahn, why are you so late?

502
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,860
I'm sorry.

503
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:31,180
Hey, order what you like. Do you want to eat this?

504
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,300
Eat some bread.

505
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,460
Oh, she came.

506
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,460
Who?

507
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,970
I'm really late, aren't I?

508
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:49,330
It's okay. Yi Ahn just came too.

509
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,830
Sorry.

510
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:56,550
I'll leave first.

511
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:00,150
Go Eun Byul. Go Eun Byul!

512
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,950
Sorry. See you tomorrow.

513
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:07,830
Han Yi Ahn. Yi Ahn! Han Yi Ahn!

514
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:10,600
What the heck? Seriously.

515
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:15,720
Maybe I shouldn't have come. It seems like Eun Byul doesn't really like me.

516
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,370
It's okay. Let's just eat, the three of us.

517
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:21,330
The three of us?

518
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:26,220
Anyway. Whenever you don't like something, your face scrunches up.

519
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,850
Hey! Your old temper is starting to return.

520
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:31,890
What don't you like about the transfer student?

521
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:36,460
Why? Is she a better student than you? Huh? Huh?

522
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:43,260
Hey, what's the matter?

523
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,590
There's something wrong, isn't there?

524
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:48,340
There's nothing like that.

525
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,890
Hey, I told you to tell me first if there was ever anything wrong.

526
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:54,530
Please, don't ask.

527
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:55,350
Go Eun Byul.

528
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:59,090
Han Yi Ahn. There are things I can't tell you

529
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:01,080
and things I don't want to tell you

530
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,950
and things I don't want you to find out!

531
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:08,250
Please! Don't ask me anything!

532
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,410
Am I...

533
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:17,350
Am I really nothing to you?

534
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,880
What aren't you telling me? Huh?

535
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,120
What is there for you to hide from me?

536
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,030
Just because of few words,

537
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:29,380
Is our relationship going to change?

538
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:58,580
Go Eun Byul!

539
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:01,170
- Go Eun Byul!
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

540
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,730
- That's what I'm saying.
- Ah, really?

541
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:07,670
Oh, it's Song Joo.

542
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,990
So Young said that she would introduce Song Joo to an entertainment company.

543
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:18,400
Her uncle owns it and the audition is tomorrow.

544
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,730
Hey, don't do that.

545
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:25,360
Why are you teasing me?

546
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,360
Song Joo, I'm sorry about yesterday.

547
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,360
Forget it.

548
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:44,040
-I heard you're auditioning tomorrow.
-Yeah.

549
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,970
That place. Is it legitimate?

550
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:49,320
Did you look into it?

551
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:54,260
You, what are you trying to say?

552
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:58,720
No. It's because I'm worried.

553
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,320
Go Eun Byul, mind your own business.

554
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,300
Kang So Young.

555
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:09,090
She could be someone you can't trust.

556
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:12,660
Hey, Go Eun Byul. Stop it.

557
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:17,230
You're not the type of person to do this between friends.

558
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:20,170
Stop disappointing me.

559
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:40,630
Go Eun Byul. Song Joo seemed really upset.

560
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:44,470
I just– It seemed like something Song Joo really wanted.

561
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:47,680
So I just made a rare opportunity happen.

562
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,320
If you hurt Song Joo, you–

563
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:53,320
I won't leave you alone.

564
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,000
Ah, I'm starving.

565
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,240
Eun Byul! Why are you coming now? Let's go eat.

566
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,100
No, it's okay. I really just don't have an appetite. You go eat.

567
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,050
Alright.

568
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,050
Teacher.

569
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,230
What are you doing?

570
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,240
Huh?

571
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,780
Nothing.

572
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:10,310
What are you doing, instead of eating?

573
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:16,120
I just wanted to be alone.

574
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:25,890
Hey, I really want to be alone this time.

575
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:28,790
That's what I mean.

576
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:33,430
Gong Tae Kwang, are you really that bored?

577
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,340
Hey.

578
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:41,910
Aigoo. This boring school, should I just drop it?

579
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:48,290
But if I quit school, what will you do when you miss me?

580
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:54,510
Back then, why did I dislike you so much?

581
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:59,740
You said I was pitiful. You said your time was too precious to even greet me.

582
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,470
I did?

583
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:02,540
Jerk.

584
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,790
Why? Is this time being wasted to death, too?

585
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:08,470
No.

586
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:13,740
Right now, I think I know why you're like this.

587
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:21,730
Because I didn't want people to hate me, I tried to get into rage and tried to bear with it.

588
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:24,070
I've done all kinds of things.

589
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,480
Like you.

590
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,060
Don't tell other people about this!

591
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,630
And don't look at me like that either.

592
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,100
- What? What is it?
- Teacher.

593
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,850
My withdrawal form... What's happening to it right now?

594
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:08,750
You signed it with so much confidence. Why?

595
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:20,220
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry.

596
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:25,620
Even I stay here, no one will know that you're my father.

597
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:29,010
Let's talk about this at home.

598
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:35,920
I changed my mind. I'm not studying abroad.

599
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,430
This discussion has already ended long time ago.

600
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,840
- I'll just keep coming to this school.
- Why?

601
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,560
The embarrassment you have caused is still not enough?

602
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:55,610
Think however you want.

603
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:59,560
You're probably really scared that someone might see us,

604
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,960
I'll be going.

605
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:11,670
School 2015: Who Are You

606
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,330
Did she kill her?
-Daebak!
-She commited suicide because of bullying.

607
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:20,790
- She died?
-Wow! But she really didn't seem like that.

608
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:25,810
- I'm getting goosebumps...
- I'm telling you, there is a reason why she transferred.
-What the heck...
-It's scary.

609
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:31,130
Wow, she's really shameless.

610
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:34,530
- What's going on?
- Tongyeong, right?
- Right.

611
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:38,800
- It's Noori Girl's High School.
- So it was her.

612
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,360
Was she transferred by force then?

613
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:52,150
Hey, people think that this is you.

614
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,680
It's not right, is it?

615
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,740
Good morning, my ass.

616
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,050
What?

617
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:17,790
- What is it?
- Was it you?

618
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:21,030
- What?
- The weird rumor that was spread.

619
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:23,580
What rumor?

620
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:27,690
The only people that know are you and Go Eun Byul.

621
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,660
Or should I say Lee Eun Bi, who is pretending to be Go Eun Byul?

622
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:39,010
Hey, I'm telling you that she really is Go Eun Byul!

623
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:41,670
Seriously, you are such a weird kid!

624
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:44,380
Should I introduce you to the hospital I went to?

625
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,530
Look carefully.

626
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:59,710
This is handwriting by Lee Eun Bi from Tongyeong and Go Eun Byul.

627
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,970
They're completely the same, aren't they?

628
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:16,170
I'm thinking about showing it to my father and getting him to inspect this.

629
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:20,030
Since it's like this already,

630
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:22,680
like you said, maybe we should diss each other.

631
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,820
Right?

632
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,290
It would be fair, then.

633
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,550
Yeah, that's right.

634
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:56,700
I don't know you, and you don't know me.

635
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:00,640
It's pretty fair. It's nice.

636
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,530
Should I also tell you a secret?

637
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:11,000
You know...

638
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,160
My name

639
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,880
is Go Eun Byul.

640
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:27,990
Hey.

641
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:32,790
- Gong Tae Kwang, what are you doing?
- Go Eun Byul, let's skip class.

642
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:36,630
I don't want to. You're crazy. What's with you?

643
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,850
Just follow me.

644
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:49,310
Hey! Hey, what's with you? Hey, Gong Tae Kwang, are you crazy?

645
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,300
♫There’s an empty world deep in my heart, save me ♫
Let go! Hey!

646
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,900
♫ There’s an empty world deep in my heart, save me ♫

647
00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:02,700
♫  I wanna reset, I wanna reset, I wanna reset  ♫

648
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:09,370
♫  Lonely eyes trapped in darkness. Is there anyone to hold my hand?  ♫

649
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:16,370
♫  I wanna reset, I wanna reset, I wanna reset  ♫

650
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:22,980
♫  Someone somewhere will know my miserable heart. It’s right in front of me but I can’t find it like an oriole bird  ♫

651
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:29,360
♫  I’m flying around by myself in this darkness in my lonely night. I’m flying around by myself in this darkness with a miserable heart  ♫

652
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:35,970
♫  There’s an empty world deep in my heart, save me  ♫

653
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:42,560
♫  I wanna reset, I wanna reset, I wanna reset  ♫

654
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,160
What's going on?

655
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:49,170
Tell me now.

656
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:54,170
Hold on. Hold on until later.

657
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:02,400
♫ I won't let you go ♫

658
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:19,680
Hey.

659
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,730
Can there be

660
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:25,530
at least one person?

661
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:30,540
A person to call you by your real name.

662
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:35,990
That person...

663
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,980
Can't I do it?

664
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:52,290
♫  On a sleepless night, in your lonely and empty room ♫

665
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:59,300
♫ When there's no one to listen to your story  ♫

666
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:05,700
♫ When hardships come to you like pouring rain  ♫
