1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,880
Episode 8

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,100
Hey, that was just one.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,330
You try it.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,490
Lower your stance like this.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,550
Try it.

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,010
Like this?

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,380
Look, do it correctly. Low like this.

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,810
Hey, are you okay?

9
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,150
You should have been careful.

10
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,250
Let me look at it.

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,170
What scar is this?

12
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:56,350
When I was 10, I first learned to ride a bike...

13
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,690
When you were 10?

14
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,530
Hey, did your memory come back?

15
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:08,270
But that's wrong. I was the one who taught you how to ride a bike in middle school...

16
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,990
You know me better than I do.

17
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,610
Go Eun Byul!

18
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,970
How did you erase everything?

19
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,910
Should I help you regain your memory?

20
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,710
No.

21
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:37,930
All this time, I was so frustrated that I tried so hard to regain my memory.

22
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,100
But maybe I shouldn't have.

23
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,000
It's just that I think I'll miss the time I couldn't remember anything.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,440
It's just that I think I'll miss the time I couldn't remember anything.

25
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,620
Han Yi Ahn, I'm sorry.

26
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:59,180
For making two people's childhood memories into one person's memories.

27
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,640
Even though I'm a lot different from the Go Eun Byul that you know,

28
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,340
we're still good friends, right?

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Hey, Go Eun Byul.

30
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,330
Eun Byul.

31
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,070
You're...

32
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:37,290
Go Eun Byul, right?

33
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,250
Han Yi Ahn...

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
I'm...

35
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,640
Actually...

36
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,420
Hey. You're so different

37
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,280
I'm thinking unbelievable things.

38
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,540
Let's go home. I'll drop you off.

39
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,820
I'm sorry, I must have lost my mind for a moment.

40
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:29,450
Eun Byul, being angry is for times like this.

41
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,370
Not when I'm worried about you.

42
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,750
Got it?

43
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,670
School 2015: Who Are You

44
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:06,850
When I was 10, I first learned to ride a bike...

45
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,110
Eun Byul, eat this.

46
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,570
Mom.

47
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,350
Hm?

48
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,410
When I'm home,

49
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:40,670
I have you and at school I have friends.

50
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,890
It's nice.

51
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,550
How about you, Mom?

52
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:59,400
Are you happy that I'm here too?

53
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,460
Of course.

54
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,870
That's a relief.

55
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,440
Why are you like that?

56
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,230
I was worried that

57
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,790
you might have a hard time every time you see me.

58
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:27,790
I can't hurt others in exchange for my own happiness.

59
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,590
Nonsense!

60
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:42,970
Eun Byul, if it's hard, do you want to transfer?

61
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,470
Do you want to transfer and start over?

62
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,520
You should be tired. Go and rest.

63
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,680
I'm okay. Continue what you are doing.

64
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,780
Can you not focus?

65
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,190
It's because of this you're losing easy points.

66
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,550
Are you preparing well for the English performance assessment?

67
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:56,250
It's not hard so get a 100% no matter what. No matter what.

68
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,490
If you get pushed back by So Young again, I won't stay still.

69
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,650
Huh! Son!

70
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,650
Understand?

71
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,310
Yes.

72
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,510
Fine. Continue working.

73
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,190
Ahjusshi,

74
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,560
I'll ride the bus today.

75
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,760
Will you be okay?

76
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,390
I'll see once I get on.

77
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,460
Hey!

78
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,720
Why didn't you workout this morning?

79
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,500
Oh...

80
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,080
I slept in.

81
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,580
I was wondering for a while.

82
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,210
Make sure to come out tomorrow. It's lonely running by myself.

83
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,080
Okay.

84
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,100
After my practice, do you want to go see a movie?

85
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,880
Good idea.

86
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,260
What do you want to see?

87
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,630
Aish!

88
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,070
How can you pass by like that?

89
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,530
Are you okay?

90
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,290
Yeah.

91
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,330
You look fine.

92
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,920
What are you doing?

93
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,880
I'm trying to eat lunch with you. Why?

94
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,390
You change your mind too easily.

95
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,950
It's my choice.

96
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,310
I can't stop you, Go Eun Byul.

97
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,310
Aish...

98
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:00,440
But Song Joo, did you have your audition?

99
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,100
No, the date got pushed back.

100
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,760
Yeah, my uncle was a little busy because of a business trip.

101
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,100
Ah...

102
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,730
Hi, Uncle. She looks average.

103
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,280
I told you. You just have to pretend to audition her.

104
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,150
It'll only take 15 minutes. Can you not do it?

105
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,000
Just ask her to do this and that. I heard she failed other auditions so what can she do.

106
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:41,020
S-So Uncle, once you get a date, please call me.

107
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,890
Kang So Young.

108
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,130
What are you doing right now?

109
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,780
Can you not see? I'm setting Song Joo's audition date.

110
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,500
I warned you.

111
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,360
If you hurt Song Joo, I won't stand still.

112
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,080
Tell her the truth

113
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,670
and cancel the audition

114
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,880
Why? Why do I have to do that?

115
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,800
You don't know why?

116
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,790
Yeah, I don't know.

117
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,040
I said I would give her a chance, not a pass.

118
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,020
I'm not done talking yet.

119
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:38,550
Eun Byul, you don't just look like Eun Bi but act like her too.

120
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,730
No wonder I get confused.

121
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,130
Omo, Han Yi Ahn!

122
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,670
It looks like you two have something to talk about.

123
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,260
Should I get going?

124
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,070
You fought with the transfer student again?

125
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,620
You didn't forget the movie tonight, right?

126
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,570
I'll call you after my practice.

127
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,190
Okay.

128
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,640
Be quiet!

129
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:12,740
Kang So Young already figured out that your handwriting is the same as Lee Eun Bi's.

130
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,600
Until when are you going to go around saying you're not (Lee Eun Bi)?

131
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:27,210
Has anyone seen my world history notebook?

132
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,650
- I haven't seen it.
- Has anyone seen Go Eun Byul's notebook?

133
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,500
- I haven't.
- I don't have it.

134
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,400
-Be quite, guys.
-They disappear everyday...

135
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,740
Prosecutor! You have to take these.

136
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,930
Oh yeah, this is the handwriting inspection results you requested last time. Do you want to take a look at it?

137
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,890
- Give it to me.
- Yes.

138
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:17,690
These two hand writings are 95% similar.

139
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,850
- So Young, let's go together.
- Oh, sure.

140
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,890
- Let's hurry up.
- I ate so well.

141
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,840
What's wrong? Are you okay?

142
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,720
I think I ate something wrong. My stomach hurts a lot.

143
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,390
Really? I'll tell the teacher. Go to the infirmary and rest.

144
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,980
Would you? Thanks.

145
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,060
Can you stay by yourself?

146
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,730
Go.

147
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:16,790
Today we will discuss about safety within school.

148
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,000
In case there is an accident at school, before the ambulance comes,

149
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,400
these are precautions to take to save your friends' lives.

150
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,050
So everyone focus.

151
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,470
The class president... hasn't come yet?

152
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,380
Yes, I'm here.

153
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,100
Starting with the front row, three of you come out.

154
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,680
Yes.

155
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,950
Because they suddenly lost their consciousness,

156
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,020
there is a chance their breathing has stopped.

157
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,690
To check, put your ear on their nose.

158
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:53,100
Then you put your hand on their chest and check their pulse at the same time.

159
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,090
Song Joo.

160
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,240
Reconcile with Shi Jin. Why is it like this?

161
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,970
I don't know.

162
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,150
Song Joo, you know...

163
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,360
What? What do you want to say?

164
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,180
The audition Kang So Young set up,

165
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,770
can you not go, really?

166
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:37,480
Hey, Go Eun Byul. You're talking about that again?

167
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,760
It's just that I heard her talking on the phone earlier and–

168
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,930
Do you have something against So Young?

169
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,730
If not, do you two know each other?

170
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,810
You really won't tell me. What's the matter?

171
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,700
Whether she's good or bad, I'm willing to face her myself.

172
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,620
Hey!

173
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,110
Look at this, look at this. Huh?

174
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,920
Hey, I told you not to make that face.

175
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,940
Open your eyes widely and put your chin up!

176
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,510
Alright, I got it. After I rest a bit.

177
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,160
Even still, it's good that I got caught with my lie.

178
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,600
Because in front of you, I don't have to worry about it.

179
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:59,120
Not funny? Hey. Huh? This isn't funny? Huh?

180
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,690
Not funny? Oh, you smiled!

181
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,920
Aigoo, really.

182
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,600
Woah!

183
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,970
Class 3! Why haven't most of you guys turned in your performance assessment assignment?

184
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,000
I won't accept anything submitted even a second later than 5pm. Okay?

185
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,320
Okay!

186
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,480
Soo Young, did you submit the assignment?

187
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,470
Yeah, I just have to turn it in.

188
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,250
Hey, what the heck?

189
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,790
- That's weird.
- What?

190
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:49,030
It was a little buggy earlier, too. What should we do? Did you do backup?

191
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:53,010
Hey! What are we supposed to do about this now?

192
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,790
-How long does it take to edit this?
-Even if we start now, an hour will not be enough.

193
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,370
What do we do?

194
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,250
-We're so screwed.
-What do I do?

195
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,870
Hey, what's this? What's wrong all of a sudden?

196
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,740
It seems like it's formatted.

197
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,660
What?

198
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,410
Hey, what about ours?

199
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,600
Ours doesn't work. It was definitely fine before gym class.

200
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,910
Does that make sense? All three at once?

201
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:32,340
Hey! Was there anyone in the classroom during gym class?

202
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:38,330
Ah, right. Hey, Kang So Young, didn't you go in earlier saying that you're sick?

203
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,870
No, So Young was in the infirmary, not the classroom.

204
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,570
Right?

205
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:51,830
Yeah. I was in the infirmary.

206
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:56,710
Did anyone say anything? I was just saying what I saw.

207
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,770
I don't know. This is so frustrating!

208
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,780
Is it Class 3 again?

209
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,000
I apologize.

210
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,460
What are you going to do?

211
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,740
We will do it by the rules.

212
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,510
By the rules you mean...

213
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,160
As much as we emphasized on the due date,

214
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,140
whether it was formatted or not, we will only the results submitted by 5pm.

215
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,630
But Teacher Ahn, the kids worked hard and-

216
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:49,630
Sure. They probably worked hard. Who wouldn't have?

217
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,110
But if we give them more time,

218
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:58,060
there is no guarantee that there won't be any kids trying to extend their time using similar methods.

219
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,400
Look, you may not want to believe it,

220
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,350
but if someone did cause this intentionally to Class 3,

221
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,670
the kids who are innocent become victims too.

222
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:16,250
Then...let the 3 affected groups turn it in by lunch time tomorrow

223
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,940
but with a 5 point penalty?

224
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,060
Teacher Kim, investigate this more

225
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:31,230
It's best if you are prepared for what happens next from students' parents.

Hey.

231
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,570
- Han Yi Ahn.
- Yeah?

232
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,170
What would you do if I had a twin?

233
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,900
What?

234
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,040
If there was someone who looked exactly like me,

235
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,060
and we went to school and us 3 had fun together.

236
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,770
If that happened, what would you do?

237
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:33,150
What would I do? I would be confused, of course.

238
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,300
That's it?

239
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,880
More? I would also be very tired

240
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,730
because there would be two ugly people with bad personalities.

241
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,030
Forget it. Go play around.

242
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,550
- Hey.
- Hey, don't do that.

243
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,730
Why? I'm playing around.

Is someone coming?

251
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,650
I invited some people so stay in your room until I call you out.

252
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,780
How long is it today?

253
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,440
Will you be able to eat properly

254
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,300
while worrying about what I'll do?

255
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:15,280
Wasn't it your deal to live quietly by not studying abroad?

256
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,830
Keep in mind that you don't have options anymore.

257
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:06,770
Hey, did you wait for a long time?

258
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,930
Yeah, a little.

259
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:33,270
It's time. Let's go.

260
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,140
Was the movie boring?

261
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,900
Your face is so serious right now.

262
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,610
I thought it was fun.

263
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,700
Then, that's a relief.

264
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,170
Do you want to stop by anywhere else?

265
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,560
Let's go.

266
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,740
It looks alright.

00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,000
Hey, look.

00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:29,590
I was waiting for you all this time. What else would I do?

305
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,600
Eun Byul, the bus came.

306
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,780
Go in.

Hey!

Hurry and go.

310
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:11,120
Since when were you so interested in Go Eun Byul?

311
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,380
I dont' know.

312
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:19,500
The old Go Eun Byul didn't even look at me.

313
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,040
Right?

314
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,440
What are you trying to say?

315
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:31,040
It means that the Go Eun Byul now needs me more than you.

316
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,680
You bastard, stop talking nonsense.

317
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,140
Who are you that she needs you so much?

318
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:42,520
Are you saying that the old and new Go Eun Byul are different people or something?

319
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,620
Why are you doing things that I used to do?

320
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,780
It doesn't suit you.

321
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:05,700
Oh, don't worry too much about what I said.

322
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,960
I'm crazy, remember?

323
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,660
Aish, this is so frustrating.

324
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,910
It's annoying to start over again but

325
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:39,570
why are they talking about losing 5 more points?

326
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:44,590
That's what I'm saying, why do we get in trouble? We're the victims.

327
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,390
But, I wonder who it is.

328
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:52,370
Well it won't be the three groups who got formatted.

329
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:22,970
Why were you in the infirmary and the classroom at that time?

330
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:29,170
I went to the infirmary first but because they didn't have a bed open, I went to the classroom.

331
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,040
I was sick so I slept at my desk face-down.

332
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,340
That's all, Teacher.

333
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,960
But why didn't you tell the kids the truth?

334
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,920
The kids were suddenly asking me so I was shocked.

335
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,690
Why would I do something like that?

336
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:54,190
Our group's notebooks were all erased, too.

337
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:57,630
Fine.

338
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:01,400
I got it for now. Leave.

339
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:22,700
What are you doing? Were you eavesdropping?

340
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,420
I was just passing by.

341
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,350
But I can't do that.

342
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,870
I'm getting angry.

343
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:39,000
Here she is.

344
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,520
Is it her?

345
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,040
Hey, Kang So Young. What are you?

346
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,780
What do you mean?

347
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:52,290
I heard the CCTV caught you in the classroom during gym time.

348
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,990
Why did you lie?

349
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:59,190
I went to the infirmary! You guys were suspecting me so I got shocked...

350
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,070
If you're shameless, why were you shocked?

351
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:06,750
Kang So Young, the world history notebook Go Eun Byul lost,

352
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:11,010
didn't you take it a couple days ago when we met that morning?

353
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:21,790
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

354
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,050
Wow. Look.

355
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,740
-She does have it.
-She did steal it.

356
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,960
I really didn't erase the laptops.

357
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,540
Think about it, our group's laptop got erased, why would I do that?

358
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,760
Since that morning, our groups's laptop have been buggy.

359
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,080
Right.

360
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:55,700
So because your group's laptop was buggy

361
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,580
you wanted to break other people's laptops?

362
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:02,340
And only the laptops of those who study well.

363
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,420
That's not true.

364
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,760
I told you I'm didn't do it!

365
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,800
Seeing things like this, it reminds me of that outcast article.

366
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,340
You really didn't do that (bullying) either?

367
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:25,320
Hey! Can you accuse someone like this without any evidence?

368
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,180
I had a lot of things to prepare, so I left late.

369
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,880
Around 3:10 pm?

370
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,520
Picking up the emergency kit from the infirmary and going to the gym,

371
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,760
took me about 15 minutes?

372
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,780
Alright.

373
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,680
Go on.

374
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:48,140
How did it feel when the kids looked at you like that?

375
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,180
What?

376
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:56,580
That. The things you did to my younger sister.

377
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,960
How did it feel to receive it?

378
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,920
It was nothing.

379
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,120
Did you think I would shake in fear like someone else?

380
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,180
I'm in disbelief.

381
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,800
You'll find out soon,

382
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,240
but I haven't messed with a laptop before.

383
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:28,080
Really? That's good.

384
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:36,240
Then use this opportunity to see what it feels like being accused for something you didn't do.

385
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,280
When you didn't do it,

386
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,640
no one listens to you,

387
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,300
and no one believes in you.

388
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,760
See how it hurts.

389
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,680
Hey.

390
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,200
Hey!

391
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,400
Now, it doesn't matter who you are.

392
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,340
I'm going to kill you.

393
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,440
I'll hold one!

394
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,980
I can go by myself. Why are you...

395
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,240
I am partly a homeroom teacher for a month, so it's a necessity that I know.

396
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,020
Let's go!

397
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,260
Okay.

398
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,960
Are you trying to get it restored?

399
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,160
Is it possible to figure the exact time they were formatted?

400
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,760
I'm not sure... That's a little...

401
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,040
One of them, its hardware broke.

402
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,080
The remaining two, it seems, were formatted.

403
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,980
If done simultaneously, they can be done in 5 minutes.

404
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,120
I had a lot to pack so I was late.

405
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,360
Around 3:10 pm?

406
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,220
I picked up the emergency kit in the infirmary and went to the gym

407
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:35,500
So it took me about 15 minutes?

408
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,160
Teacher Kim.

409
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,830
Teacher Kim!

410
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,800
Yes?

411
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,060
What are you thinking about that's making you like that?

412
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:53,360
The kids' laptops.

413
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,580
According to that worker, there is a high chance that the student who had the laptop with the broken hardware

414
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,000
could have formatted the other two laptops.

415
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,960
Yes, theoretically, it would be true.

416
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,020
What are you thinking about doing?

417
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,790
Well, I'll just talk about it with the students more.

418
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,500
Even after work, you think about the kids.

419
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,860
Class 3 students are lucky.

420
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,530
Yes.

421
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:33,320
For me! I don't even know where to lead the kids.

422
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:38,820
I don't even have the ability to lead them anywhere.

423
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,220
Yes. That's it.

424
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:48,860
Why? You're a teacher.

425
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:55,640
I don't like thinking about it as being a "teacher,"

426
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,200
but rather just an occupation.

427
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:02,140
I teach math well,

428
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,770
I write documents well and send notice papers pretty well...

429
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,100
Well...

430
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:12,920
That...

431
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,710
Would you like another drink?

432
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,620
Yes!

433
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,290
Cheers!

434
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:31,100
$30....

435
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,170
Here you go. We ate well.

436
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,870
Are you happy now that I have disappeared? -Jung Soo In

437
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:01,690
Teacher, are you not leaving?

438
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,430
We should go.

439
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:36,980
Are you happy now that I have disappeared? -Jung Soo In

440
00:43:56,030 --> 00:44:01,120
I got this checked and they said the hand writings were from the same person.

441
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:01,990
Dad.

442
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:05,890
Don't become a laughing stock and instead act smart.

443
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:22,140
Handwriting Analysis Report

444
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,350
These two handwritings are 95% similar and therefore it is assumed that they came from the same person.

445
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:41,570
School 2015: Who Are You

446
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,260
Go Eun Byul.

447
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,180
Go Eun Byul!

448
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,320
You're not going to answer?

449
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:39,930
You waited for a long time. You were really curious, huh?

450
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:47,180
No, no, no, no. Since you already knew.

451
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:54,410
How nervous have you been?

452
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:59,990
Fine, try everything you can.

453
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:08,510
I know that if I reveal you're Lee Eun Bi, it's the end for me too.

454
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:11,330
So you choose.

455
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:16,690
Can you backstab all your friends and leave quietly with me,

456
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:19,910
or, do you want to transfer quietly by yourself?

457
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:24,690
If I leave, will you be better off?

458
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,940
You don't need to know about that.

459
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,290
You can just disappear.

460
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:36,080
But, what to do? I can't do that.

461
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:40,240
You must be crazy now.

462
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,440
Do you have the confidence to tell everyone the truth?

463
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,360
I'm going to leave here.

464
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:52,370
First, I have to get rid of you.

465
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,930
After that.

466
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:34,610
Han Yi Ahn

467
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,710
Coach, Han Yi Ahn has been swimming like that for multiple hours now.

468
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:54,120
Hey, Han Yi Ahn! Hey, bastard!

469
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,230
Aren't you going to stop?

470
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:03,390
Get out. Get out!

471
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:07,170
Are you practicing or trying to relieve your anger?

472
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:10,380
Don't you know that taking care of your body is also a part of your skills?

473
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,100
I know it's burdensome, but what can I do?

474
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:18,920
Depending on the results of May's competition things will get decided and the seniors can...

475
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:25,940
Don't you want to receive medals and offers from good companies to go to a good college?

476
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,260
So you have to stay alert.

477
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:32,510
Don't waver and pace yourself well.

478
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,770
Han Yi Ahn, look me in the eye.

479
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,500
I believe in you, understand?

480
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:47,680
Yes.

481
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,890
The person you're really curious about is here.

482
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,370
Try finding her.

483
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:44,530
Lee Eun Bi

484
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:21,260
Hello?

485
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,120
Yi Ahn, Eun Byul is missing.

486
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,390
Go Eun Byul disappeared!

487
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,870
What would you do if I had a twin?

488
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:33,880
What would I do? I would be confused, of course.

489
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,560
Go Eun Byul

490
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:53,520
Go Eun Byul

491
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:02,890
The person you are trying to reach is unavailable. Please leave a message.

492
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:10,420
Yi Ahn? He was looking for Go Eun Byul and left.

493
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,630
Oh, Go Eun Byul, you've matured.

494
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:26,480
Even taking me home.

495
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:29,540
Hey!

496
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,920
Are you now making me carry your bag?

497
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,730
Hey, it's hard preparing for the competition coming up.

498
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:38,750
I'm working so hard my arms are like this.

499
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:44,800
Hey, you know how much energy is needed to swim, right?

500
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,140
Oh right.

501
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:50,100
You're really good at swimming.

502
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:55,690
So next time, don't be afraid of the water and try to swim.

503
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:58,630
Don't scare me like the last time you fell in.

504
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:07,220
Here. Stop complaining and carry it yourself. It's this light.

505
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,030
Idiot.

506
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:12,310
Do you really not know why I make you do something like this?

507
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,290
I go workout around your house every morning,

508
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:20,940
I skip all the earlier buses because I'm waiting for you,

509
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:26,750
and I call you out every hour I'm free from practice.
Why do you think I do that?

510
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,570
I have to go in now.

511
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,510
Take this.

512
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:49,220
You worked hard, Go Eun Byul.

513
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:52,840
Practice well.

514
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,300
I'm leaving.

515
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:15,830
You said you'll help me regain my memory, right?

516
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:19,700
Sure, I'll take responsibility and help you find them.

517
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:24,210
But once you find your memory, you must grant me one wish.

518
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:26,870
Promise.

519
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,740
Promise!

520
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,260
You have to fulfill my wish.

521
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:43,940
Even though I'm a lot different from the Go Eun Byul that you know...

522
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:47,900
we're still friends, right?

523
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:54,090
But, there are times I like the changed Go Eun Byul more.

524
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:06,440
♫ Even though you're lonely and sad, don't cry now  ♫

525
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:13,550
♫ I'll wordlessly hug you. I'll listen to your story.  ♫

526
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:20,450
♫ Look back, I'll be there  ♫

527
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:26,710
♫ I'll wipe away all the tears you shed  ♫

528
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:30,790
♫ Even your loneliness  ♫

529
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:48,580
Why didn't you come out to school today?

530
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,480
Are you hurt somewhere?

531
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,680
I just...

532
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,810
skipped.

533
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:01,950
Han Yi Ahn.

534
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,840
Yeah?

535
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,430
I...

536
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,580
have to tell you something...

537
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:19,850
What is it?

538
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:27,120
Actually,

539
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:33,490
it's been a while since I've regained my memory.

540
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,320
Really?

541
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:48,250
Go Eun Byul, do you remember?

542
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:52,740
When you remember everything,

543
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:57,580
you promised me you'll fulfill my wish.

544
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:05,790
Since you found your memories, I can tell you my wish, right?

545
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:17,430
From now on, tell me "yes" to everything I say.

546
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:22,470
You're...

547
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:25,980
Go Eun Byul, right?

548
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:36,130
♫ I pray for you ♫

549
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:42,830
Hey, it's not that hard of a wish.

550
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:51,930
♫ So that my voice can reach you ♫

551
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,910
I'm sorry.

552
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:59,160
I'm really sorry.

553
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:04,720
Don't say you're sorry. Say "yes" instead.

554
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,210
Why are you doing this to me?

555
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:14,670
Why are you not Go Eun Byul?

556
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,900
Then was everything you did to me a lie?

557
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,940
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

558
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,750
Who are you?

559
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,470
Let's go.

560
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:33,020
Gong Tae Kwang, let go of her hand.

561
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:39,270
Let go of her hand.

562
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:58,930
♫ There’s an empty world deep in my heart, save me ♫

563
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:05,820
♫ I wanna reset, I wanna reset, I wanna reset ♫
