1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,400
Mother of Go Eun Byul, missing person
Today, it has been 10 days

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,950
Mother of Go Eun Byul, missing person
since I have not seen my daughter.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,320
Mom, I'll be back.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,680
The child said this and left

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,670
and still hasn't returned.

6
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,730
How can I go home all by myself?

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,180
I couldn't stand seeing my child's empty room.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,620
My Eun Byul will most definitely be safe.

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,510
Of course... She has to be safe.

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,990
I will definitely find my daughter, and holding hands, we will go back home.

11
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,240
"Magical things happen to Sara every day."

12
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,540
Director!

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,710
"From now on, no matter what happens,

14
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,960
in this world somewhere,

15
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,330
there is most definitely a person that is thinking of me.

16
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,920
Now I will not be even a little bit lonely or sad".

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,060
Episode 2

18
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,940
Please look at her face once.

19
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,510
If you see her, please contact me.

20
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,930
Excuse me.

21
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,800
Ahjusshi, if you happen to see my daughter's face, please contact me immediately.

22
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,620
Yes, thank you.

23
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,580
This is my daughter...

24
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,960
Ahjusshi! Ahjusshi!

25
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,140
Please don't just throw it and leave. Please at least take a look at the face once.

26
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,990
- Please. This is my daughter...
- One second.

27
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:18,500
Yes, thank you. Yes, thank you.

28
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,960
Looking for a person.

29
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,660
Don't smile, you bad girl.

30
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,280
Seriously, where are you?

31
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,340
Mom is really worried.

32
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,540
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,690
Mom did everything wrong.

34
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,850
Eun Byul.

35
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,270
You'll come back to Mom again, right?

36
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,100
Mom is going crazy.

37
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,670
It's so hard for me, it's killing me!

38
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,280
Hello?

39
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,190
Yes. That's right.

40
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,240
School 2015: Who Are You

41
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,020
Thank you.

42
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,840
God, thank you.

43
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,910
Have you come to your senses?

44
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,580
It's Mom.

45
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,060
Mom?

46
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,140
Yes. That's right.

47
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,350
Can you recognize me?

48
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,890
Mom?

49
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,510
Mom.

50
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,270
That's right.

51
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,960
Mom.

52
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,510
Mom.

53
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,600
It's alright. It's alright.

54
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,500
Don't worry about anything.

55
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,310
Mom is here.

56
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,380
It's alright.

57
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,670
She is suffering from partial memory loss due to the trauma and stress she went through.

58
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:49,120
It may be temporary or she may never get her memory back.

59
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,320
So I'm not sure what to tell you about the speed of her recovery.

60
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,920
I'm going to get the car, so just wait a bit.

61
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,480
Okay.

62
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,020
I had heard that you ran away from home after getting kicked out of school...

63
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,960
Looks like you didn't have anywhere to go.

64
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:29,960
See. There's no one that talks to you and plays with you except me, right?

65
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,650
Now that you got kicked out, you want to go all in? Is that it?

66
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,730
Who are you?

67
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,290
Wow, you've improved a lot.

68
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,670
Do you not remember?

69
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,130
Then I'll need to jog your memory.

70
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,570
Ah, why are you being like this?

71
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,450
Oh my, let--

72
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,050
Let go of her!

73
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,530
You aren't hurt?

74
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,610
What's going on?

75
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,410
She just came out of nowhere.

76
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,480
Who are you to do this kind of ignorant act?

77
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,760
Please continue what you were doing.

78
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,630
Ahjumma, who are you to interfere in other people's business?

79
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,700
I'm her mother.

80
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,910
How dare you lay your hand on my daughter?

81
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,940
I can't ever forgive you! Don't move an inch, I'll report you to the police.

82
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,870
I– I'm sorry.

83
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,130
I mistook her for another person.

84
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,330
I'm sorry.

85
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,980
Are you okay?

86
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,870
Let's go.

87
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,930
Should I turn on some music?

88
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,390
Ten days ago, at school trip

89
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,430
Why did you come all the way here in the middle of your competition?

90
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,950
Is the school trip no fun?

91
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,570
Or are you not happy that I'm here?

92
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,410
Both.

93
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,550
Hey. The resort's food must not have tasted good.

94
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,530
Go Eun Byul, your personality gets bad when you're hungry.

95
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,350
If you are going to say things like that, just go.

96
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,550
Try to guess. Why might I have come?

97
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:35,420
Hint: The promise I made 7 years ago.

98
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,130
I don't remember and I don't want to remember.

99
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,070
I can go now, right?

100
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,580
What is it?

101
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,160
I'm telling you to just please leave me alone!

102
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,090
Why do I hear those words as

103
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,860
"If you leave me alone, troubles will come"?

104
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,470
Tomorrow, I have a competition, so I'm going someplace else.

105
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,530
Here, hit me. I'll get hit till you've released all your anger.

106
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,670
Chances like this aren't common.

107
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,370
Hit me.

108
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,530
I'm sick of it.

109
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,120
I'm sick of it all.

110
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,950
What's this?

111
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,710
What is it?

112
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,170
No. Look well.

113
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,090
I'm not the young Eun Byul anymore.

114
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:10,400
We've both grown up and a lot of things became different.

115
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,360
Now the only thing you can do for me

116
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,010
is nothing.

117
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,170
You're not even going to greet your sunbae?

118
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,860
Getting a gold medal, breaking a new record...

119
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,970
It's probably all laughable to you.

120
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,310
Why did you do that at the 100 meter race anyway?

121
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,820
Even an article came out. "Marine Boy Who's Scared of Water."

122
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,960
Marine Boy.

123
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,190
That's not it.

124
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,090
What was that gaze right now?

125
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,280
You look like you have a lot to say.

126
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,250
Say it. Say it.

127
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,920
There is nothing like that.

128
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,730
Look at that... Hey, won't you lower your eyes?

129
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,000
Stop this! I'm not in a mood to put up with this!

130
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,190
You, really!

131
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,790
I told you I'm not in a mood to put up with this!

132
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,990
What are you punks doing?

133
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,420
What are you guys doing?

134
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,420
What are you guys doing? Huh?

135
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,050
Look at these punks.

136
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,280
Since you have enough energy to fight, that means you didn't train hard enough.

137
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,900
I'm sorry. Gather in front of the swimming pool in 30 seconds. Run!

138
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,320
Yes!

139
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,230
You're not running?

140
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,780
I can't look at a guy who just believes in his ability.

141
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,770
If you're going to be this way, then quit.

142
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,920
The clouds are great.

143
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,710
Patient Gong Tae Kwang, it's dangerous if you go down!

144
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,960
Please come up here quickly!

145
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,210
That's what I'm saying... If you had released me earlier,

146
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,130
this wouldn't have happened.

147
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,480
That's why, if I die, whose responsibility is it?

148
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,390
Please, Tae Kwang!

149
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,850
I'm sorry! Noona did wrong. Don't be like that.

150
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,110
If I die, whose responsibility is it?

151
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:31,150
It's my responsibility. If you die, it's my responsibility! That's enough, right?

152
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:35,240
But, Noona, what's the point of taking responsibility after I die?

153
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,710
Should I have asked you out when I was alive?

154
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,370
What?

155
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,580
Hi, Go Eun Byul!

156
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,340
Meeting you like this feels very different.

157
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,960
Ah, that jerk, really.

158
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,030
She always accepts greetings, but there's never an answer back.

159
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,730
Do you not know what give and take is?

160
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:45,240
You risked your life and escaped just to eat one hamburger?

161
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,490
Eh! Are you crazy? I even risked my life.

162
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,990
I have to eat three, of course.

163
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,790
Crazy guy!

164
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,160
Hey. Eat all you want.

165
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,760
Gong Tae.

166
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,830
You... What do you want to do for a living later on?

167
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:20,300
Hey, it's so funny hearing you worry about me. Really funny.

168
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,910
Is this how my mom feels when she looks at me?

169
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,230
Eat slowly and go.

170
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,330
I want to stay until you finish eating, but

171
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:34,110
even for me who's used to people's eyes on me, I cannot cope up with this.

172
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,260
Hey.

173
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:36,920
What?

174
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,460
Go Eun Byul is admitted at my hospital.

175
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,460
Why the heck are you saying that now?

176
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,260
It's because I just found out!

177
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,890
Aish.

178
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,110
Yi Ahn, Eun Byul came to Seoul. I'll wait outside of Korea Hospital.

179
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,040
Yi Ahn!

180
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,400
Hey, Yi Ahn! Han Yi Ahn!

181
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:22,420
That fool. What if he gets hurt like that?

182
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,060
Excuse me. Where's the annex?

183
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,090
It's at the end of the hallway.

184
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,290
I'm sorry.

185
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,180
Aigoo!

186
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,160
Thank you.

187
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,470
You're not coming in?

188
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,860
Which floor are you going to?

189
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,010
Excuse me–

190
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,760
Hey!

191
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,970
Hey, Go Eun Byul!

192
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,260
No.

193
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,690
I'm not the young Eun Byul anymore.

194
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,940
We've both grown up

195
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,330
and a lot of things became different.

196
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,290
If going back one step is your decision,

197
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,210
then moving up one step is mine.

198
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:30,550
That's right. We've grown up and a lot of things are different now.

199
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,740
So what? It doesn't matter.

200
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,580
You have the wrong person.

201
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,490
♫ There’s an empty world deep in my heart ♫

202
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,660
Since you came, it's okay, Eun Byul.
♫ Save me, I wanna reset ♫

203
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,000
Who are you?
 ♫ I wanna reset ♫

204
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,690
Who am I?

205
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,680
Are you kidding me? It's not funny.

206
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,350
Please let go of me and talk.

207
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:00,350
"Talk?" (He's taken aback because she speaks formally.)
Go Eun Byul, you come here.

208
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:04,360
Go Eun Byul has completely lost it. Hey! Hey!

209
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,460
Better return this thing to its original state. Got it?

210
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,060
- Hey, this–
- Please let go of me and talk!

211
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,660
- All of it? Me too?
- Me too?

212
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,410
I don't even remember my name, either.

213
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,760
Daebak (awesome).

214
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,240
Thanks for coming.

215
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
We must have had a close relationship?

216
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,510
No.

217
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,860
Since I came out during training, I should go first.

218
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,820
I-I think I had plans, too.

219
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,880
We can go to the bus stop together.

220
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,150
- Go Eun Byul, we'll come again another time.
- Oh, okay.

221
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,890
Bye.

222
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,490
When you recover your memory, you tell me

223
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,670
if we were close or not.

224
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,740
We're here.

225
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,770
Get in and rest.

226
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,850
Eun Byul.

227
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,290
Your room is over there.

228
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,660
Okay.

229
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,100
Wow. Did I really make this?

230
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,970
It's nice.

231
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,970
Secret note.

232
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,410
Eun Byul! Come and eat dinner!

233
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,950
Okay, I'm coming!

234
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:44,370
- Look at this.
- That's cute.

235
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,760
When you were at this age, your father and we

236
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,260
went to the amusement park a lot.

237
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,120
I must have liked going on the amusement park rides.

238
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,820
No.

239
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,120
Your father did. You were scared and cried every time.

240
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,430
What?

241
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,350
Oh! It's true. I'm crying here too.

242
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,400
That's right.

243
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,890
But, why don't I have any baby photos?

244
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,440
Oh.

245
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:28,100
Once your memories come back, you'll know, so...

246
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,720
We met you when you were 5 years old.

247
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,060
What?

248
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,290
I'm adopted?

249
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,570
It's not something to be that surprised about.

250
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,010
You already knew all of it anyways.

251
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,620
Really?

252
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,310
But without worrying about all of that,

253
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:56,600
we are two people who are inseparable.

254
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,980
My daughter.

255
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:06,880
I must have been a really happy child.

256
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,130
It's nice.

257
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,870
Of course. You were so happy.

258
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,110
Oh my. It's already this late?

259
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,230
Hurry and go up. You have to go to school tomorrow morning.

260
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,040
Mom, sleep well.

261
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,150
Alright.

262
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,720
Sleep well, my daughter.

263
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,240
Bye.

264
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,400
Can't I just sleep here?

265
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,250
What's this?

266
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,380
It wasn't long ago when you locked your door and said not to come in.

267
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,010
I did that? I don't know about that.

268
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,640
I don't know either.

269
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,130
I don't want to sleep alone.

270
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,780
Mom, you smell good.

271
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,690
What are you doing? It's grossing me out.

272
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,710
I don't want to.

273
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,670
It's ticklish! Why are you being like this?

274
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,050
Isn't that Gong Tae Kwang?

275
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,800
Wasn't he supposed to stay in the hospital a bit longer this time?

276
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,870
Tae Kwang! Tae Kwang, your bag!

277
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,910
This isn't working. Let's smoke a cigarette and go.

278
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,980
Are you avoiding him?

279
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,430
If I'm with that punk, my fist isn't relaxed, and

280
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,990
I get annoyed!

281
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,200
The more I beat him, it feels like my mind is getting emptied.

282
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,240
Can't you do it well, huh?

283
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,210
Of course you're stronger. Let's go.

284
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,550
- I'll go alone.
- Okay.

285
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,040
What are you doing?

286
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,790
Did that jerk just say hi to me?

287
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,510
To me?

288
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,440
Hey, Go Eun Byul!

289
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,130
Hey, Gong Tae!

290
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,060
Hey, that kid is–

291
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,810
Hey, Go Eun Byul, you saw the pictures and names of the kids I sent you, right?

292
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,490
Yeah, I'm almost done memorizing them.

293
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:32,290
Oh, Eun Byul! It's so nice to have you back in school.

294
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,820
Hey! Good morning!

295
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,200
What is this? Woah!

296
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,660
Go Eun Byul.

297
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,400
Hey! What's this?

298
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,870
What is it? What is it?

299
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,010
Hello.

300
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:52,480
What's with her?

301
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,040
Hi?

302
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,130
Wow, wow, wow. Who is this?

303
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,090
Ms. K, who made a hot issue

304
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,280
with her disappearance case at the school trip?

305
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,040
Hey, get lost.

306
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,930
♫ I'll get lost, have a nice life. ♫

307
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,130
Eun Byul, this is your seat.

308
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,900
Sit down.

309
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,730
Eun Byul.

310
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,960
Hey, I have something to say.

311
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,770
Go Eun Byul, because of the accident, she has partial,

312
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,550
very partial, memory loss.

313
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,390
- Daebak.
- Seriously?

314
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,120
Wow, what is this?

315
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,140
If she's not like herself from before or if she acts weird,

316
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,030
help her and understand. Alright?

317
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,860
Hey, you really can't remember?

318
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,610
Wow. This is fascinating.

319
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,780
This is the first time I've met an amnesiac.

320
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,430
Me too.

321
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:56,120
She's not pretending? Maybe she has a secret to hide.

322
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,860
What nonsense are you talking about?

323
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,780
It's a joke, a joke.

324
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,230
Go Eun Byul. It's been a while.

325
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,980
Seeing that you can't even find your real seat, it must be real.

326
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,800
Daebak.

327
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,620
It's right here.

328
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,060
Hey, get lost.

329
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,860
♫ I'll get lost, have a nice life. ♫

330
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,210
Hi.

331
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,240
Hello.

332
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,840
I won't be able to live quietly anymore.

333
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,320
Hey. It looks like he's going to throw it.

334
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,990
Bastard, look at me well, if even one of my eyes blink.

335
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,410
- Huh?
- Hey.

336
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,220
Are you okay?

337
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,460
Hey! Hey!

338
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,220
I got it, I got it. We're not coming out.

339
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,080
Go Eun Byul, the teacher said to come by the office.

340
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,000
Where is it?

341
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,450
Follow me. They told me to come too.

342
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,760
Take it.

343
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,650
You're not going to do it?

344
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,470
Don't mess with me.

345
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:44,470
If possible, I'm trying not to be twisted, but lead a straight life.

346
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,230
It's a pity.

347
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:49,600
I wanted to get hit once and lay in the infirmary.

348
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,290
You crazy kid.

349
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,260
I told you not to do this!

350
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,480
Hi, Go Eun Byul.

351
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,740
Teacher Ahn, I bought this when we went to Tongyeong.

352
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,490
Since I've been so busy with lots of crazy events, I'm giving this to you now.

353
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:39,800
Teacher Kim. What is this?

354
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,660
It's a souvenir bought in Tongyeong.

355
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:47,620
So, why are you giving me a souvenir bought in Tongyeong?

356
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,960
What does it mean?

357
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,680
It's a little bit too small a gift to carry any meaning...

358
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,220
What kind of gift in this world is meaningless?

359
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,710
Even just giving someone a toothpick clearly carries the meaning that the person should pick their teeth.

360
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,780
Isn't that so?

361
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,970
No, no.

362
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,550
Teacher, I brought Go Eun Byul.

363
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,790
Hello.

364
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,850
Oh, alright.

365
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,330
I was worried, so I called you in. But you seem to look good.

366
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,430
Maybe it's a good thing.

367
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,880
What is?

368
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,500
If you forget bad events, your heart becomes relaxed.

369
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,420
Bad events?

370
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,120
No,

371
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,450
it's just something I said because I heard it was hard for you during the school trip.

372
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,600
Oh.

373
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,760
Min Joon, could you help Eun Byul out for a little while?

374
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,180
You might be busy studying, but

375
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,600
Class Leader, I'm requesting you.

376
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,770
Yes, it's alright.

377
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,180
Okay. Go now.

378
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,220
Yes.

379
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,850
We'll be leaving now.

380
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,550
That student, you know that we're keeping watch of her, right?

381
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,430
Yes.

382
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:06,620
Gong Tae Kwang started attending school again?

383
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,690
Yes, yes.

384
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:11,940
You have to treat Class 3 better so that they don't cause any more trouble.

385
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,610
If not, keep their mouths shut so that it doesn't spread to the outside.

386
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,700
Let's try to do at least one of these options well.

387
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,690
You know what this means, right?

388
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,850
Yes.

389
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:25,130
I'll pay attention to them so that there won't be any problem.

390
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,160
- Hey. Hey.
- Is it true?

391
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,320
Wasn't she reported missing, you said?

392
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,980
She disappeared during the school trip.

393
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,710
Really?

394
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,250
Go Eun Byul.

395
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,090
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

396
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,590
Eun Byul's mom?

397
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,050
What is it?

398
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,780
She said she will her to the private lessons again on Monday.

399
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,560
It's a relief the kid is back to normal, but

400
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,060
honestly, it worries me a little.

401
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,330
Can a girl who can't even remember her own name study properly?

402
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,270
That's right.

403
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,990
Oh well. We'll have to see.

404
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:41,290
But if you don't take kids that have problems out, then wouldn't it be hard to manage them?

405
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,990
That's true.

406
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,310
Excuse me!

407
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,310
What?

408
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,990
What's this?

409
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:15,110
What could it be? It's my heart and affection.

410
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:19,820
The truth is... Shi Jin's dad just came back from Paris.

411
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,820
A gift.

412
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,310
Take it already.

413
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:27,430
Seriously!

414
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,620
If Eun Byul gets out,

415
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:35,470
please add Shi Jin to Professor Kim's tutoring group.

416
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,730
I told you before.

417
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:41,180
The decision will be made after the midterm exam grades come out.

418
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,970
Also, I'm a precise person.

419
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,030
The teams are made according to the kids' abilities. No matter what you do, it's no use.

420
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,290
I know.

421
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:52,580
I'm not giving you this just because of that.

422
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:56,170
Unnie, your heart is good, and you're a great person.

423
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,750
Oh my.

424
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,530
Oh, Eun Byul's mom.

425
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,710
When did you come?

426
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:08,160
Min Joon's mom, why is it so hard to see your face?

427
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,100
I heard it all.

428
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,670
It's a decision the moms took, so what could I do?

429
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,720
Let's see her score and make a decision.

430
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,810
- Lee Shi Jin.
- Yes.

431
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,600
Go Eun Byul.

432
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,890
Yes.

433
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,860
Go Eun Byul, you're first in the class.

434
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,260
You did well.

435
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,070
At this important time, having memory lo...

436
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:03,190
Hurry up and recover, and from now on, let's only worry about keeping up your grades.

437
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,710
Yes.

438
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:19,370
Alright. I received a notice that they're cracking down on minors who frequent adult entertainment spots.

439
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:23,720
Entertainment lasts short, but your grades and student record will last forever.

440
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,030
You all know this well, right?

441
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,430
Yes.

442
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,550
Class dismissed.

443
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,300
Goodbye.

444
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,110
It's quite strange...

445
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:42,640
I didn't particularly want to do it, but since he told us not to, how come I suddenly crazily want to do it?

446
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,090
Hae Na. That's you.

447
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:50,180
The charm that bounces off the ground and soars to the sky, defying gravity.

448
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,630
I don't know!

449
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,680
Our Hae Na wants it. Should we all hang out together since it's been awhile?

450
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,690
- Call.
- Call.

451
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:08,950
Call!

452
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:15,160
My stomach hurts, my stomach hurts, my stomach hurts.

453
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,700
Let's go together.

454
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,150
Hurry and come follow us!

455
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,440
Mom

456
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,190
So annoying.

457
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,940
Let's go together!

458
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,520
Let's go.

459
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:39,010
We'll show you just how much fun we had before.

460
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,660
Let's go.

461
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:44,760
Hey. I forgot my wallet.

462
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,690
In the classroom? Do you want to go back?

463
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,190
I found it! My wallet.

464
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,330
Hey, are you by any chance

465
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:22,860
the 400 meter swim gold medalist, Han Yi Ahn?

466
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,950
Yes, that's right.

467
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,670
Congratulations! I saw your meet.

468
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,030
Thank you.

469
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:36,630
Excuse me, can we take this chance to take a picture together?

470
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,820
Sure.

471
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,400
Where does it look good? I look good here.

472
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,990
Look here.

473
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,290
But what grade and class are you in?

474
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,600
- 11th grade, classroom 3.
- Ah, 11th grade.

475
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,280
Huh? What?

476
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:04,130
Hey you, you're in the same class as me!

477
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,530
Because of my competitions, I didn't attend school.

478
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,490
But why don't you come?

479
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,110
Hello, Chairman.

480
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,250
Oh Han Yi Ahn. You worked hard.

481
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,860
It's all thanks to you, Chairman.

482
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,990
It's been a while, we should have a meal.

483
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,800
Yes, I will come find you along with the coach.

484
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,830
Alright. Contact me.

485
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,130
Excuse me.

486
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,890
Can you fit me into that?

487
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,270
I am Gong Tae Kwang, from the same class as him,

488
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:54,330
Chairman Gong Jae Ho.

489
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:58,420
I'm not sure. I think that would be a bit troublesome.

490
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,110
Wow, athlete Han Yi Ahn sure is great.

491
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:10,670
You even get to eat with the chairman.

492
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,420

495
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,630
Father! Come and eat.

00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:53,000
Yes. Aigoo.

Wow, it smells great.

498
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:00,960
You're going to be blown away when you eat it. Whenever I'm not home, you always eat ramyun.

499
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,480
That's not it, punk! What do you mean by "eating ramyun every day!"

500
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,280
I guess you also drink soju along with it.

Aigoo, aigoo, this kid! You have keen eyes.

Ahjumma,

507
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,230
I didn't know that my dad was such a funny person.

508
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:50,820
Seriously, this is funnier than what I've seen on Gag Concert for the past ten years.

509
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,000
Ah, this is just really awesome.

510
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,050
Oh, Father.

511
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:00,490
I respect you, Father. (Gag Concert reference.)

512
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,060
I respect your sense of humor.

513
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,660
Are you taking your medicine well?

514
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,410
But this...

515
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:15,760

That's Father's style.

00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,050
Isn't it?

523
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,550

Oh, that can't be.

529
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,740
One moment.

530
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,830
How could you just cut off the card without saying anything?

531
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,840
What does that make me out to be in front of the other kids?

Yes, Teacher.

Ah, seriously.

Aigoo, really...

Damn.

I will carefully think about that to do with you,

574
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:11,790
but for now, just go to your homes.

We're going in the same route.

581
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:03,500
Today, you spent about months of your allowance.

Tomorrow, I'll buy.

Do you really not remember

586
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:24,770
or are you just pretending not to?

587
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,960
Oh, sorry.

588
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:31,460
I guess we didn't have such a great relationship.

589
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,960
You must be really comfortable.

590
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,600
I'll go first.

00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,800
Young Eun.

592
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:54,350
Let's go separately.

593
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:22,510
It's really late. Should I pick you up?

594
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:26,350
No need, I will arrive in 10 minutes.

595
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:33,690
Was there anything else besides what you reported missing?

596
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:42,790
- Young Eun's mother.
- Omo!

597
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:45,230
What's going on?

598
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:47,730
My jewelry's gone, so I reported it to the police.

599
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:49,500
Did a thief break into your house?

600
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,890
They didn't just break in.

601
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:54,340
I invited and lived with the robber.

602
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,090
Is there anyone else except the helper ajumma?

603
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:01,430
It didn't disappear all at once. Just little by little.

604
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:03,940
Ah, the thief's a pro.

605
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,570
Oh, Young Eun!

606
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,940

Ah, really.

613
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,470
I told you to go out, but did I say you could stay out all night?

614
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:44,080
It's dangerous at night. You're going to get in trouble.

615
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,950
- Got it?
- Yes.

616
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:49,320
Why are you suddenly speaking so formally?

617
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,550
Mom...

618
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:56,700
It's all good if you had fun. Let's go!

619
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:28,260
Hey! Where are you going?

620
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,200
My morning exercise.

621
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,320
Morning exercise?

622
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,200
My alarm didn't even go off.

623
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:38,300
Why do my eyes suddenly open when it becomes 5 am?

624
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,760
I must've been a really hardworking person.

625
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,170
No. You slept a lot in the morning, so there were lots of times where you didn't even wash your face and went to school.

626
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:46,920
What? Really?

627
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,430
I wonder why then.

628
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:50,660
Is it an after effect of the accident?

629
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,560
Ah, what am I going to do?

630
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:57,510
I looked at the workbook I did before, and I don't get more than half of it.

631
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:00,560
You're in trouble, Go Eun Byul. What are you going to do now?

632
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,370
Your face is ugly, your body isn't great, and your personality is bad.

633
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:07,940
Other than being good at studying, you have nothing.

634
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,490
I'm leaving.

635
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:12,690
Hey!

636
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:17,650
It must be really frustrating not being able to remember.

637
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:24,280
The homeroom teacher said that I didn't look good during the trip.

638
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,190
I wonder why I disappeared?

639
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,960
Who knows?

640
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,660
Although...

641
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:35,650
You couldn't go to the trip because of your competition, so you wouldn't possibly know.

642
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:38,880
I went. Just a moment during the night.

643
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,200
The other kids didn't know about that.

644
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,560
Of course. I only went to see who I wanted to see.

645
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,830
Who?

646
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:52,170
Why would I let you know that?

647
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,630
Huh? What? Hey, wait a minute!

648
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:58,390
Hey, let's go together! Hey!

220.

650
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:17,080
I'll bet fifty dollars that you'll never find the password, and one hundred dollars that you'll break the lock.

651
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,130
Get lost.

652
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:22,390
Hey, what's in it that you've made it so hard to open?

653
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,850
Yeah...

654
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:28,090
- By chance...
- By chance?

655
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,170
Love letter?

656
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:32,150
Hey, if you're going to think these kinds of things, wake up from your dream!

657
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:36,840
There's probably bread hidden so you could eat it behind my back, probably mouldy by now.

658
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,880
That's it?

659
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:44,520
I'll have to try again later. Let's go.

660
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,180
By the way,

661
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,340
has Young Eun contacted you?

662
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:53,850
No. Why?

663
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:56,290
She didn't come to school.

664
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:58,230
You didn't know?

665
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:01,260
- Do I have to know?
- What?

666
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:18,100
You know about the jewelry your mom reported missing, right?

667
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,600
I don't know.

668
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:26,730
The CCTV captured someone selling it at a jewelry store.

669
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,960
Do you want to verify it?

670
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,880
This is you, right?

671
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,700
We met a few days ago at the police station, too.

672
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,510
Why did you do it?

673
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:57,300
Where's the rest of the stuff?

674
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,680
Where is Go Eun Byul?

675
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:19,300
- Yes?
- Go Eun Byul, open up your locker.

676
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:23,270
Ah... I don't remember the passcode, so I can't open it.

677
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:26,650
Class President, get a hammer.

678
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:31,030
Hammer!

679
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:41,300
Hey, move.

680
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,500
Woah!

681
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:58,950
Be quiet!

682
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,270
What's going on?

683
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:10,790
I'll handle it.

684
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,200
That's my mom's necklace.

685
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:23,190
Go Eun Byul, follow me.

686
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,850
Go Eun Byul, do you not hear me?

687
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:57,400
Han Yi Ahn! Stop right there.
