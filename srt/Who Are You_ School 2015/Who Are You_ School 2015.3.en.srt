Episode 3

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,210
A week after Go Eun Byul's disappearance

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,080
Hey, what is this?

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,760
Hey, I asked what this is!

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,250
It's a flower!

6
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,340
Who put this here?

7
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,990
Who came to school the earliest?

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,750
It was me, why?

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,150
Was this here when you came too?

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,750
I don't know if it was there or not.

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,790
Of course. Our Min Joon never looks sideways.

12
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,230
Look.

13
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,210
♫ Up, down, up, up, down, up...  ♫

14
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,780
Yoon Jae, you're too noisy.

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,860
I'm too loud, right?

16
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,550
Hey, if it was you, would you admit it was you?

17
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,170
Who did this? They seriously have nothing to do.

18
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,890
Why do stuff like this when she isn't even here?

19
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,410
Using their own money, going to the flower shop,

20
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,830
aigoo, even the presentation is pretty. This weirdo.

21
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,560
I'm not in the mood to fool around right now.

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,170
Hold it in.

23
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,960
It was that. Instead of Eun Byul, they were trying to get you pissed.

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,690
Yeah. Isn't it Go Eun Byul?

25
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,560
Whether there are flowers or poop on her desk.

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,510
Right.

27
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,790
Just because Go Eun Byul is gone, nothing would change.

28
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,200
The people who study will study, those who play will play, those who sleep will sleep.

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,140
I'm not asking everyone to be worried.

30
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,780
But,

31
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,970
isn't this too much?

32
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,640
School thugs?
Seo Young Eun - SeGang High School 11th Grade Class 3

33
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,010
Is there such a thing in high school these days?

34
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,950
There's probably nothing like a "shuttle" or "ping."
(Terms used to refer to different type of outcasts.)

35
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,080
But we're not concerned with each other.

36
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,670
We're too busy studying on our own.

37
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,670
Go Eun Byul?

38
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,150
We sometimes hung out, but

39
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,250
we're not close.

40
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,910
But I don't really want to talk about her.

41
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,920
I'm sorry, but can I go?

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,370
I have a lot of homework to do.

43
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,380
School 2015: Who Are You

44
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,370
That...

45
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,950
That's my mom's.

46
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,200
Did she steal it?

47
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,590
Go Eun Byul, follow me.

48
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,200
Go Eun Byul, do you not hear me?

49
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,840
Let go. I said let go!

50
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,090
I need to find out what happened and how it happened.

51
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,730
And after you find out?

52
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,000
If I did something wrong, I should be punished. If not, the misunderstandings should be cleared.

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,370
How?

54
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,060
What is that necklace? Did you steal it?

55
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,320
Or did you take it?

56
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,770
What are you going to say? If you don't remember anything, how are you going to clear up any misunderstandings?

57
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,790
By avoiding it,

58
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,650
will anything be fixed?

59
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,640
Who said to avoid it?

60
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,000
Then, what?

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,700
I did that because it was frustrating.

62
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,580
Before making sure of the situation, you were getting anxious.

63
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,310
What are you doing? This is not like you.

64
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,010
What is being "like me?"

65
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,530
Everyone is saying things,

66
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,420
so you don't know who to believe, right?

67
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,740
Listen carefully.

68
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,930
Right now, the person you have to believe

69
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,200
is not anyone else.

70
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,090
It's you, Go Eun Byul.

71
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,470
You can be a mean brat, often you're rude, and you do a lot of ugly things that I want to beat you up for

72
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,250
but that's only the outer appearance.

73
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,130
The immature and pathetic behavior of stealing and hiding other people's things,

74
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,380
you wouldn't do it even if you died.

75
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,430
Really?

76
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,980
Can I believe that?

77
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,720
Yeah.

78
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,580
So you're telling me that Go Eun Byul threatened you by saying that if you didn't bring out the necklace,

79
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,420
she wouldn't leave you alone.

80
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:43,660
So you touched your mother's things. Is that it?

81
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,170
Yes.

82
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,760
Really, why are you guys doing this to me?

83
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,910
Alright.

84
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,910
But, with Eun Byul's current condition,

85
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,700
you know it's hard to hear both sides of the story, right?

86
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,140
Are you just thinking that it's not even possible for Go Eun Byul to do something like this?

87
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,300
Because she is the best student.

88
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,130
I never said that.

89
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,890
I'm saying unless you bring your parents, there will not be a solution.

90
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,970
It can't be helped.

91
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,310
I heard from Detective Park earlier

92
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,470
that theft within the family is not considered a crime.

93
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:25,010
Since I'm the one who stole, and I returned rest of the items,

94
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,310
please act as if this never happened.

95
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,370
It's even embarrassing to me for the other kids know.

96
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,560
Hey, Kwon Gi Tae, take this!

97
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,070
Good job!

98
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,330
What did the homeroom teacher say? He said there was a misunderstanding, right?

99
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:51,400
"What is the point asking you? Just go to class."

100
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,060
That's what he said.

101
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,840
I think something happened, but it's too quiet.

102
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,900
It feels off. Also, the chrysanthemum that was on your desk...

103
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,950
Huh? Isn't that Seo Young Eun?

104
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,510
I told you it's not like that! Really!

105
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,290
What to do?

106
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,290
I think Young Eun's mom found out.

107
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,530
There's something I want to ask you.

108
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,440
The truth is, it was weird last time.

109
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,990
Young Eun was using a lot of money.

110
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,730
By any chance...

111
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,510
It's not like that. We aren't kids who go around attacking "pings" (referring to a type of outcast).

112
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,230
Right? It's not like that.

113
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:45,720
For now, it's true that the necklace was found in Go Eun Byul's locker.

114
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,240
This is ridiculous, really.

115
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,140
I request for School Violence Autonomy Committee.

116
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,970
I don't like that. Never.

117
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,100
She doesn't remember anything. There's nothing we can do.

118
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,380
Let's quietly move on.

119
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,040
I said I'll take care of it. Why are you concerned, really?

120
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,180
Even if we open up the committee, what will we gain?

121
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,350
"Seo Young Eun, the students' wallet, loser and outcast."

122
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,750
It's like announcing that to everyone.

123
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,280
Seo Young Eun, this is the school office.

124
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,680
What are you talking about?

125
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,730
You're what? You are an outcast?

126
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,400
Who are they? Show me their names, quickly!

127
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,740
Who is it?!

128
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,240
You're so pretentious.

129
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,410
Since when are you so worried about me?

130
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:42,750
Just act like you always have. Why are you acting like a nice mother all of a sudden?

131
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,600
You brat, why are you talking that way to your mom?

132
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,010
Aren't you going to ask for forgiveness this instant?

133
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,250
Why are you yelling at my daughter?

134
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,670
Do you treat the kids like this all the time?

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,810
Mother, when a teacher doesn't scold at moments like these,

136
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,340
then what should we be teaching the students?

137
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,810
I'll do the disciplining,

138
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,390
so you apologize to my daughter.

139
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,590
Quickly!

140
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,080
Young Eun!

141
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,860
Young Eun! Young Eun!

142
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,480
The phone you are trying to reach is shut off.

143
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,260
You will be directed to voicemail

144
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:45,510
Young Eun, let's talk for a moment.

145
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,880
I know it's embarrassing for me to be saying things like this.

146
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,420
Just go easy on them these days, okay?

147
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,750
There are times when you have to act like you don't know what is going on.

148
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,620
Teacher Kim, what is teacher's authority?

149
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:16,040
Teacher's claim of right? Teacher's prestige? No, it's not that.

150
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:21,670
I think it's teacher's authority to teach.

151
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,170
Not scolding the kids when they do something wrong

152
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,300
is giving up on teaching.

153
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:33,080
Just let go a little bit, please!

154
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,960
I mean, the only thing we'll be left with is suspension and a lawsuit.

155
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,940
A teacher also has to eat and live!

156
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,010
Ah really, I, really, this, really!

157
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:50,890
Anyway, about Seo Young Eun's mother,

158
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:55,560
I'm worried about how she will act from now on.

159
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,810
Auntie, give me chicken feet and soju...

160
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:11,030
Fried sausage, please.

161
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,190
Teacher Ahn, do you live around here?

162
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,260
Yes.

163
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,050
Teacher Ahn.

164
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,130
Not chicken's feet and soju, but sausage, is that right?

165
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,690
Yes, I'm really hungry.

166
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,380
What's up with you?

167
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:34,340
Today must have been really tiring for both of you.

168
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,980
You can let it all out while sharing a drink.

169
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,320
Yes. We should.

170
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,090
Teacher Ahn, let's have a drink.

171
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,360
All of us teachers met here, why don't you have a drink?

172
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,330
I don't want to.

173
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:56,600
Teacher Ahn, don't be like that and join us.

174
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,630
No, thank you.

175
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,570
Then... Should we go over there?

176
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,090
Auntie, please wrap up my food.

177
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,240
Then.

178
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,450
Teacher Ahn...

179
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,860
Does she like me?

180
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,880
Go Eun Byul

181
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,930
Beginning of 10th grade year

182
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,190
Hey.

183
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,500
Why are you by yourself?

184
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,580
From now on, let's get along with each other.

185
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,420
Message

186
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:33,390
Young Eun, there is a lot I would like to ask you. Please call or text me.

187
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,970
Eun Byul.

188
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,570
Aren't you Eun Byul?

189
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,430
Yes. Hello.

190
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:00,080
You came by to our house often in elementary school. Don't you recognize me?

191
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,460
Who are you?

192
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,940
I'm Soo In's mom.

193
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,190
Soo In.

194
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,940
Eun Byul!

195
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,610
Mom.

196
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,220
- Hello.
- Hello.

197
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,480
Why did you come to the store? I told you it would only take ten minutes.

198
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,900
I wanted to see you ten minutes more. You only have me, right?

199
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,440
Right, there's no one better than my daughter.

200
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,380
Let's go.

201
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,570
Mom, do you know Soo In? It seems we were close.

202
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,000
Yes, in elementary school.

203
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,310
Does she go to my school now?

204
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,290
Probably not.

205
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:45,680
It's late. I'll tell you later, so let's go home and eat.

206
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,470
What are you doing?

207
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,330
What else? Morning exercise, of course.

208
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:25,050
I'm already back from riding a lap. Exercise well.

209
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,450
- Hey, why are you doing this?
- Do another lap.

210
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,070
I don't want to. Why would I?

211
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,900
You have been eating way too much lately.

212
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,670
Eventually, you won't be running, you'll be rolling.

213
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,070
- Let's go.
- Hey, I'm tired!

214
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,680
Hey, did anything happen yesterday afternoon while I was at practice?

215
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,290
No, it's been calm until now. Though, that's been even more frustrating.

216
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:52,120
It will be fine. Trust me.

217
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:59,720
Hey, about what you said yesterday, at first I was a bit thankful, but thinking about it, it was upsetting.

218
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,030
What?

219
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,300
Hey. What did you say about me?

220
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,110
That I was rude, without manners, and deserved a beating?

221
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,640
If that's the case, then why are we friends?

222
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,920
That's what I'm saying.

223
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,760
Your wound is all healed. It looked pretty deep.

224
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,770
Here?

225
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,980
I wasn't hurt there.

226
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,240
Did I get hurt sometime?

227
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,970
As long as it's healed now, it's fine.

228
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,550
Seo Young Eun's mother has requested to open a School Violence Committee.

229
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,160
Although it's a good thing that a School Violence Committee is well utilized,

230
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,180
it seems it's occurring rather frequently.

231
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,780
Regardless of the students' own opinion,

232
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,520
Because of the parents making a huge fuss out of this situation,

233
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:57,630
I am confused whether this is a student's problem or a parent's problem.

234
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:03,680
But, as you know, Go Eun Byul is in a state where she doesn't even remember the incident...

235
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,070
- What should we do?
- We should be fair.

236
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:11,170
If all the kids caught in this situation say they don't remember anything, is that the end?

237
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,390
The kids in the class should know a little about the situation.

238
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,190
Yes.

239
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,410
For now, I will pass out the school violence investigation papers,

240
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,050
and gather the related kids and start interrogating them.

241
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,510
Hey, hey, hey! Daebak! Did you hear the talk about Seo Young Eun and Go Eun Byul's locker?

242
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,860
Hey, but still she wouldn't be the type to that, right?

243
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,580
Couldn't Seo Young Eun have framed her?

244
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,840
Hey, there's evidence.

245
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,630
Her having partial memory loss, isn't that also a lie?

246
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,070
Let's go.

247
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:05,050
Go Eun Byul, what kind of girl are you?

248
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,220
Hey!

249
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,690
Get in the car.

250
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,920
That's not funny!

251
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,900
Not that.

252
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,500
Aish.

253
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,320
I want to try to go down there with a rope too.

254
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,410
Like the first time we met at the hospital.

255
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,140
Wouldn't that make one's frustrated feelings a bit better?

256
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,410
While wearing that?

257
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,880
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang!

258
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,140
Were you close with me?

259
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,730
No way.

260
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,290
It's funny, right?

261
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,190
Having to ask that first to everyone I meet.

262
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,100
Should I tell you this?

263
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:34,540
You don't seem to know because of your memory loss, but it's all because I didn't accept you.

264
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:39,830
You used to chase me around. Your texts and calls annoyed me so much.

265
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,020
- Is that so?
- That's what I'm saying.

266
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,980
And... Should I tell you a secret?

267
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,180
What is it?

268
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,600
To tell you the truth, I'm that person's son.

269
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,490
The respected Segang High Chairman's crazy son.

270
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,210
Is it funny?

271
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,950
What?

272
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,340
Me. Whatever you tell me,

273
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,800
since I have no way of knowing if it's true or false,

274
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,150
it just seems like it would be fun to fool me.

275
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,760
That's not true. You're really not funny.

276
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,110
Hey, Go Eun Byul.

277
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,200
All right, all right. I'll tell you.

278
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:37,200
It's true that I broke the lock on your locker,

279
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,130
but it happened a long time ago, not this time. What's true is that

280
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:45,670
at that time, I got cursed at by you as much as you could, and

281
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,120
that's the only memory of us talking. The end.

282
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,320
Exactly! That's the facial expression!

283
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,880
In other words, you didn't treat me like a human being. This is a fact.

284
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,520
That jerk...

285
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,160
Counseling Room

286
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:14,150
That day, at the karaoke, whose card got suspended of transaction?

287
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:20,530
It was Seo Young Eun's. When we have fun together, Young Eun tends to spend a lot of money.

288
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:26,470
"I'll take you to a movie. I'll buy you something delicious."
She always says those kind of things.

289
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,890
I received some cosmetics as a present from Young Eun once.

290
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,760
You must have been close then.

291
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,140
It's not that.

292
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,700
But we do hang out once in a while.

293
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,990
Spending money is Seo Young Eun's hobby.

294
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:47,060
If the people in our class were ranked according to pocket money, she would probably be number one.

295
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,550
So you never forced her to do it.

296
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:52,120
Of course not. "She spends a lot because she must receive a lot."

297
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,760
I'm sure everyone thought that.

298
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,750
But, it really wasn't Eun Byul.

299
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,820
She never even accepted any presents from Seo Young Eun.

300
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,120
There's no way she would have made her do that.

301
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,590
And you're sure that locker is Go Eun Byul's?

302
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,180
That...

303
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,700
Yes.

304
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,220
What did you and Eun Byul talk about?

305
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,780
It wasn't anything special.

306
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,710
Then, why did you drag her away?

307
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,330
She seemed spaced out, so I wanted to shout at her once or twice to help her come to her senses.

308
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,720
That's why I took her away.

309
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:33,450
Teacher, lately I'm living very quietly.

310
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,790
Gong Tae Kwang wrote my name in, didn't he?

311
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,920
You don't really need to know that.

312
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,590
Really, if you just get rid of him, I'll keep living quietly from now on.

313
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,590
Gong Tae Kwang, in order to keep you comfortable, I even stopped entering the rooftop.

314
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:59,310
You don't have to. I'm not at all uncomfortable around you.

315
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:06,950
Let's say so. Today, I came because I have something to let you know.

316
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,160
It's good you came.

317
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,800
You and me are both bombs, are we not different in terms of type and quality?

318
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,310
You're just a grenade that explodes after one toss.

319
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:20,410
And I'm a time bomb that goes off at a determined time.

320
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:24,620
But, right now, my timer is exactly right here, you see.

321
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,280
Let's try to get along.

322
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,140
I heard Eun Byul ranked first this time too.

323
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,500
The results are very different from what you told us, Shi Jin's mom.

324
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:02,400
Well, I just said it seemed like it would happen. Did I ever say she'd definitely fail?

325
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,860
And you know there are those kids in school that play around all they want and still do well in their studies.

326
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,410
The hateful style.

327
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,060
I don't think putting them in the same group will work out.

328
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,270
Why?

329
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:19,500
I said I would decide based on the test.

330
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,620
And it bothers me since it looks like I changed up my mind.

331
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,720
They found a stolen item in Eun Byul's locker.

332
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,950
What?

333
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,830
They will be opening a school violence investigation soon.

334
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:34,470
Oh my, I really didn't see her that way–

335
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:39,030
Oh, right. My husband saw Shi Jin, didn't she tell you?

336
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:44,940
Ah, at school? That's because Min Joon's father is the school police.

337
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,640
That's true, but he saw Shi Jin at the police station.

338
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,780
How come... He saw Shin Jin at the police station?

339
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,040
I'm a little late, aren't I?

340
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,320
Something came up at the store.

341
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,680
I know you're busy, but still pay some attention to Eun Byul.

342
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,050
At this important time, you should at least refrain her from damaging other students.

343
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,660
What do you mean?

344
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,730
I mean, let's all get along together.

345
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,130
Well then, I will get in touch with you again regarding the revised list.

346
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,990
Shall we go?

347
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,070
Let's go.

348
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,930
Darling, I'm sorry, you just arrived but...

349
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:34,950
I also have an appointment, so I think I have to go. I'm leaving.

350
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,030
Oh, Hae Na, what did the teacher say?

351
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:50,520
A necklace was found in Go Eun Byul's locker, so why in the world does our time at the karaoke keep being brought up?

352
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,390
Seo Young Eun probably said something. What's with her, seriously?

353
00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:00,790
But, is there really no one who knows about the necklace?

354
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,480
There's something that's really weird about Eun Byul's locker...

355
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,960
But it's true that we used her as our wallet...

356
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,720
Hey.

357
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,020
Aish, so frustrating.

358
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,070
Anyway, it feels like we are stuck in a mess between two people.

359
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,590
Let's go.

360
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,180
Hey. What's the deal with Go Eun Byul?

361
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:44,080
I don't know. It's one of two. Either Go Eun Byul did something and forgot about it,

362
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,960
or Seo Young Eun made it all up.

363
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,910
Or Go Eun Byul's pretending that she forgot.

364
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:53,580
Anyway, Go Eun Byul's life is a shame itself.

365
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,110
Hey. Do you really want to talk like that?

366
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,850
What do you know?

367
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,700
Don't worry about them. Let's eat.

368
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,560
Hey outcast, eat well!

369
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,370
Eun Byul. Go Eun Byul. Are you okay?

370
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,320
Do you feel sick?

371
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,730
Hey, Eun Byul. You have a lot of stress these days, don't you?

372
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,280
Do you want to go to the school clinic and rest a bit?

373
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:41,020
No. I felt dizzy for a little bit, but it's better now.

374
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,390
Miss, how long has it been?

375
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:59,610
- Are you sleeping?
- Mom, don't poke me! They're falling off.

376
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:05,020
Ah, being like this is so nice.

377
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:12,360
The truth is, before you lost your memory,

378
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,340
there weren't many times you laughed out loud like you do now.

379
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:21,840
Really? I thought I had fun with you every day.

380
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,430
When you disappeared,

381
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:31,280
I reflected on myself a lot.

382
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:37,180
Focusing so much on school, I realized there were too many things I didn't know about my daughter.

383
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:45,850
I heard it all from Young Eun's mom. Why didn't you tell me?

384
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,770
Just in case... Because what if I really did it?

385
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:56,740
The thing that scares me the most is disappointing you.

386
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,740
If you did wrong, you just need to never do it again.

387
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:09,480
Your mom, as a mother, is trying to find a way to help you,

388
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,600
so let's not worry, and just go through it valiantly.

389
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,980
Got it?

390
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,740
Yeah.

391
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,980
Young Eun! Open the door!

392
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,680
Until when are you going to do this?

393
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,830
Do you really want to upset your mom?

394
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:38,650
I did all this so that you could attend school comfortably. So why aren't you going to school?

395
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,680
Young Eun!

396
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,450
I'm busy, so I'm going out. Let's talk again later.

397
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,520
Ha Yeon, when I went to buy my mom a birthday present,

398
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,820
I heard the flowershop owner and Seo Young Eun talk.

399
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,590
He asked her if she still needed chrysanthemums.

400
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,390
Really?

401
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:17,300
How mean do you think Go Eun Byul's acted to her to make her put a flower on her desk even though she wasn't dead?

402
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,510
Hey, what are you talking about?

403
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,530
Give it to me right now!

404
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:25,620
You only have to say three words, so why not get over it now?

405
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,850
Seo Young Eun. Happy?

406
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,940
As for Seo Young Eun, she is so to speak–

407
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,320
That's who you call a "ping".

408
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,690
"Ping?"

409
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:42,790
Well, it's not like anyone asked her but she spent the money on her own.

410
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:46,770
So I guess it is a little problematic to take responsibility for her.

411
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:53,230
But if she says it was the last resort in order to avoid being ostracized, then it becomes a different story.

412
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,500
That is true but, as you know, because Go Eun Byul has no memory,

413
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,940
even an investigation has no point. What should we do?

414
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,280
In Go Eun Byul's case, because her inner stress level is so high,

415
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,550
I worry it will affect her ability to regain her memories.

416
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:13,000
However, the victim's side is vigorously pushing their arguments.

417
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,780
The evidence is also clear, so I think we will have to open it.

418
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,400
Then, let's settle it like that.

419
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,530
Settle it.

420
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:30,080
- Opening of School Violence Committee -
Subject: Ms. Go in Grade 11 Class 3
Time: May 4th, 2015 at 11:00am
Location: Meeting room within school

421
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,510
Hey, look at this.

422
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:46,750
Seo Young Eun. Now stop avoiding us and let's talk.

423
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,980
Let me ask one thing.

424
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:58,060
You were treating her like a dead person by placing chrysanthemum on her desk, what are you scheming with the locker?

425
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:03,000
You told the head of the school that we made you pay for Karaoke, didn't you?

426
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,240
Young Eun, let's solve this with words.

427
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,820
Why would you do this to your close friends in the same class as you?

428
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,810
Since when did you think we were close friends?

429
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,240
You admitted it too.

430
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,130
That you guys considered me your free wallet.

431
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,320
No... At that time, that was...

432
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,700
Hey! Did we ever ask you to give any money?

433
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,160
You haven't.

434
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:36,360
You treat me like I'm invisible all the time but you ask me sometimes if I want to go somewhere with you guys.

435
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,580
That's the same as telling me to pay.

436
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:42,270
It's not because you really want to go with me.

437
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:45,000
You really saw it that way?

438
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,060
Your victim mentality is amazing.

439
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,640
Then, if you don't want to, say so.

440
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,370
That's right. It could all have ended if you said you didn't want to. And now what's going on?

441
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,660
Right.

442
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,530
It must be easy for you.

443
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,390
I should say that I don't want to go with you guys when you ask me if I want to come with you?

444
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:15,040
"Do you want to come with us?" Just to hear those words,

445
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,270
do you know how much effort I made?

446
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:26,530
Even if I clearly knew you all needed my money, not me, I couldn't say that I didn't want to go.

447
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,580
Do you know why?

448
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:36,310
Because I wanted to.

449
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,110
Because I wanted to have friends, even like that.

450
00:33:54,180 --> 00:34:00,700
Because I was so embarrassed, until the end, I wasn't going to go through with the School Violence Committee...

451
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,820
But right now, I changed my mind.

452
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:11,740
Since it already turned this way... Not only Go Eun Byul,

453
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:18,200
I'd like you all to get punished too.

454
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:37,730
Where did Seo Young Eun go? Does anyone know?

455
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,940
No one knows?

456
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,690
You as well, Class President?

457
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,840
I don't know.

458
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:56,850
Last week, we learned to define continuity of functions using a variable. (editor's note: It's a calculus lesson)

459
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:00,090
There are three conditions for discontinuous functions.

460
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,590
When the limit of f(x) does not exist, when f(a) does not exist,

461
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:06,800
and when the value of the limit of f(x) and f(a) is not equal.

462
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,130
Ok.

463
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,880
That answer is coming out in a second.

464
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,360
Really easy, isn't it?

465
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,820
No matter how difficult math is, could it be as difficult as you guys?

466
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:27,090
Now. This time...

467
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,090
Seo Young Eun.

468
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,110
What are you doing?

469
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:05,370
What would I be doing? I didn't want to bump into you guys so I came to take my bag first.

470
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:15,150
This locker door, it wasn't just now that it broke.

471
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:21,970
Gong Tae Kwang first destroyed it, then didn't we switch lockers?

472
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:24,530
Before the school trip.

473
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:34,260
You... Are your memories coming back?

474
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,610
So, I'm right.

475
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,080
Literature
Go Eun Byul

476
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,960
It turned out well.

477
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,870
Go and tell them. Seo Young Eun was putting on a show by her self and let out an explosion.

478
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,540
There's something I want to ask.

479
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:06,240
So labelling me as the perpetrator...

480
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,250
It coincidentally turned out like this because of our lockers?

481
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:16,220
Or did you do that because you really hated me?

482
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:21,600
Yeah. I hated you.

483
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,350
If I could, your student record,

484
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:30,190
your pride. I wanted to destroy it all.

485
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:35,040
In front of others, how it is to feel shameful and miserable,

486
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,460
I absolutely wanted to let you feel that.

487
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,190
Why?

488
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,790
Why did you want that?

489
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,600
You... You said you had recovered your memory...

490
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,490
Four students, please.

491
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,990
I'll pay for mine.

492
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,040
Eun Byul, it's okay. I'll do it.

493
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,940
It's not okay for me.

494
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,370
I'll pay for one with this.

495
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,290
But, what is it that you pay for every time?

496
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:40,970
Food? Movie tickets? Friends?

497
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:44,750
Or... Time?

498
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:48,720
What do you mean?

499
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,710
I'm right.

500
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:54,340
The time of people who only stay by your side so long as you pay.

501
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,710
I don't want to sell even ten minutes of my time to you.

502
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,400
What you said was right.

503
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,720
What?

504
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,080
Seems I really was a rude kid anybody would want to beat up.

505
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,480
Did you realize it now?

506
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,180
Thankfully, the misunderstanding of me as the necklace thief was cleared, but my heart is even heavier.

507
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,430
Why? Because of the committee on school violence?

508
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,620
Trying to apologize when I don't remember anything would be useless, wouldn't it?

509
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:04,680
And there's no way my memory would come back tonight just because I say that...

510
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,130
Hey, you finally escaped from being framed. Why so serious?

511
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,690
- Hey, stop it.
- No, I'm going to keep going.

512
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,180
Hey, stop it!

513
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,270
You!

514
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:20,120
Wait. Wait!

515
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:27,260
Hey, stop it!

516
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,320
Hello.

517
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,640
Hey! It hurts!

518
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,230
Oh my gosh!

519
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,210
Go Eun Byul!

520
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:13,690
School expulsion celebration ceremony.

521
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:50,520
Eun Byul! Hey, Go Eun Byul!

522
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,740
Eun Byul!

523
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,470
Are you okay? Huh?

524
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:11,900
Eun Byul. Eun Byul, come to your senses.

525
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,460
Come to your senses, Eun Byul!

526
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,820
Hey!

527
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,570
Where do you think you're going like this?

528
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,580
Love House

529
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,130
Oh, Eun Bi's here.

530
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,000
Eun Bi, are you okay?

531
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,090
Thank you, Unnie.

532
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:03,220
You're a gift that God gave me in place of a mom.

533
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,930
Get away. I said get away!

534
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,990
First, you crack the egg.

535
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:49,750
You pour large amounts of special sauce.

536
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:02,730
Lee Eun Bi

537
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,630
Why do you look so surprised?

538
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,870
But why are you so wet?

539
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,430
Did something bad happen?

540
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:30,190
You must be saying not to ask.

541
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:33,330
Just when I thought you wouldn't do that again.

542
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,490
All right, all right. I'll leave.

543
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,810
Next time, I'll knock.

544
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:43,100
Mom's sorry.

545
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,630
Hey, what's with you?

546
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,410
Eun Byul. Are you oka–

547
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:18,240
School 2015: Who Are You

548
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:31,310
Go Eun Byul

549
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:35,950
Go Eun Byul! The teacher is calling you.

550
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,580
Okay.

551
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:46,800
Like I said, due to the fact that the student Go Eun Byul did not regain her memories,

552
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,530
checking the truth of the accident is difficul-

553
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:53,460
No, Teacher. I remember.

554
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,980
What?

555
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:03,260
I don't remember everything, but I think I found part of it.

556
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,110
I put it in an empty locker for a moment,

557
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:17,560
because Detective Park suddenly came looking to the school and I was really scared.

558
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:21,560
I'm sorry for lying.

559
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,510
No.

560
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,040
Thank you for having the courage to speak up now.

561
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:33,180
Since they are still talking about it, I think I could tell them now.

562
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,660
I'll tell them directly myself.

563
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,480
Huh?

564
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:47,300
Since you say you regained your memory, tell us.

565
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:51,790
Was Seo Young Eun telling the truth?

566
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:56,970
Yes. That's right.

567
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:08,460
You are admitting the truth that you threatened Seo Young Eun, right?

568
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,220
Yes.

569
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,820
What kind of threat did you make?

570
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:22,080
The scariest words in the world that I know.

571
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:34,790
"Now, I won't be your friend."

572
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:42,400
Teacher! I think someone farted.

573
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,860
Something smells weird.

574
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:52,930
The feeling that everyone in the classroom hates me,

575
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,250
there is no worse feeling than that.

576
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:04,410
I know that feeling so well.

577
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:13,390
"I don't need a lot of people, just one person will do."

578
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:19,170
"Why won't anyone come by my side?"

579
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:27,030
The person who made Young Eun so terrified

580
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,460
was me.

581
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:40,900
♫ From now on, even you're lonely or sad, don’t cry ♫

582
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:48,060
♫ I’ll hug you without a word, I’ll listen to your words ♫

583
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:55,060
♫ Turn around, I'll be there ♫

584
00:49:55,060 --> 00:50:00,550
♫ I will wipe away all your tears ♫

585
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:05,650
♫ Even your loneliness ♫

586
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:28,730
♫ On a sleepless night, in the lonely and empty room ♫

587
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:35,850
♫ When there's no one to listen to your words ♫

588
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:40,230
♫ When hardships come to you like pouring rain ♫

589
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:43,610
The only thing that takes out the thorn in your heart

590
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,130
is your friend's hand.

591
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:49,240
Young Eun.

592
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:56,020
You're going to hold my hands, right?

593
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:03,260
♫ Even if the world causes you pain ♫

594
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:10,490
♫ From now on, even you're lonely or sad, don’t cry ♫

595
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:17,670
♫ I’ll hug you without a word, I’ll listen to your words ♫

596
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:24,670
♫ Turn around, I'll be there ♫

597
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:30,880
♫ I will wipe away all your tears ♫

598
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,650
♫ Even your loneliness ♫

599
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:44,400
Aish. Why isn't it returning?

600
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,260
Eh?

601
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,050
It completely died.

602
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:53,770
It's okay since it did good before it died.

603
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,630
You did well.

604
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:00,420
Don't mess around.

605
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,480
Aish.

606
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,050
My door is open!

607
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:15,230
What's going on?

608
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:17,740
You're not locking your door anymore?

609
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:25,430
Why? Does it not swipe because it's damaged?

610
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,500
I don't need it anymore.

611
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,170
I'm only going to get a little bit of allowance from now on.

612
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:35,260
You're being unusual.

613
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:40,670
I want to transfer.

614
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:43,560
I want to start fresh.

615
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:48,280
With my friends and with mom,

616
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:54,010
without using my money, I'm going to use a different method.

617
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,560
Eun Byul, are you done?

618
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,540
Yeah, I'm coming out, Mom!

619
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,570
Okay, quiet!

620
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:15,920
Starting from a misunderstanding, Go Eun Byul's school violence accusation

621
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,780
has been concluded well with a settlement.

622
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:27,160
I do have to announce bad news.

623
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:31,990
Seo Young Eun transferred yesterday.

624
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,230
Now, now.

625
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:42,050
It wasn't a forced transfer, but it was because she wanted to transfer.

626
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,470
Without a goodbye?

627
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:48,220
Young Eun said that she said her goodbyes.

628
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,250
No, she didn't.

629
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:53,970
Try texting her.

630
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:55,510
That's all for this morning.

631
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:57,550
- Go back safely.
- Goodbye.

632
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:00,050
Ah, right.

633
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,670
Did you guys know?

634
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:07,890
Young Eun was a really at drawing cartoons.

635
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:10,770
No way.

636
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,860
What is this?

637
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,210
Hey, daebak! Eun Hye, have you seen this?

638
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,220
What? What is it?

639
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:28,000
Wow. Let me see!

640
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,690
What is it?

641
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:40,410
What the heck?

642
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,970
♫ Trapped in a place with no wind ♫

643
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:54,490
♫ I swallow the familiar loneliness ♫

644
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:57,130
♫ The fairy tales I’ve drawn as a child get colored with gray ♫

645
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:59,820
♫ Disappearing behind the memories ♫

646
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,510
♫ I’m used to being silent, it’s more comfortable ♫

647
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:05,120
♫ There’s no way anyone would listen to my outcry ♫

648
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,730
♫ Slowly getting farther away and isolated ♫

649
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:10,330
♫ Now everyone has left with only me on this island ♫

650
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:12,630
♫ I have nothing else to do but ♫

651
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:15,270
♫ Rush time that is passing slowly ♫

652
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,840
♫ If I hold it in, will they know it? ♫

653
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:21,360
♫ Will someone warmly tell me it’s alright? ♫

654
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:26,500
♫ When I look into your eyes, tears are about to fall down ♫

655
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,520
♫ When the lonely night comes ♫

656
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,480
Why does she act annoying even till the end?

657
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,000
"How can she draw this annoyingly even till the end?"

658
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,730
What?

659
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:41,100
Hey. Does my face really look like this?

660
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:46,380
What?

661
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,200
♫ I will stay by your side ♫

662
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,600
♫ I know well, all your painful scars ♫

663
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,520
Go Eun Byul, thank you for reaching out your hand to me first.

664
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:02,510
After some time has passed, I would like it if we really reconciled.

665
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:06,730
♫ It’s too sad to wither as a flower yet unblossomed ♫

666
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:11,120
♫ Tomorrow, you will blossom again ♫

667
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:14,450
Do you want to drop by the school and leave?

668
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:17,460
♫ Can't comfort me ♫

669
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:23,610
♫ For me who’s trapped in this reality that has no mellow moments, give me a drink of water ♫

670
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:31,620
Let's just go.

671
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:44,210
Hey, why didn't you answer your phone today?

672
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:45,770
I left it at home.

673
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:49,150
You are so clumsy.

674
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,760
Hey, during training, I set an unofficial new record.

675
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,810
Really?

676
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:59,520
Oh, congratulations.

677
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:03,520
I can't really adapt to the new you.

678
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,640
What?

679
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,520
In the past, you would've said this,

680
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,380
"I don't care about unofficial records"

681
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:13,110
"If you set a record in the official ones, then you can come back and talk."

682
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:14,640
Go Eun Byul was cool.

683
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,340
I always told you to fix your attitude.

684
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:20,160
Aren't you listening to my words too well?

685
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:33,140
I need to go somewhere, so today let's go our separate ways here.

686
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,760
Alright.

687
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:40,960
I've been so frustrated these days trying to find my memories.

688
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,210
I shouldn't have done that.

689
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:45,470
Why?

690
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:50,570
It's just that I think I'll miss the

691
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:53,030
time I forgot about everything.

692
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:00,070
Han Yi Ahn.

693
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:03,580
Goodbye.

694
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:08,960
What the heck? Goodbye to you, too.

695
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:35,010
♫ How about you, I'm all about you ♫

696
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:38,310
Go safely!

697
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:41,260
Call me!

698
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:44,910
♫  Reset... Someone somewhere will know my miserable heart  ♫

699
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:48,350
♫ It’s right in front of me but I can’t find it like a oriole bird ♫

700
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:51,810
♫ I’m flying around by myself in this darkness, in my lonely night ♫

701
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:54,680
♫ I’m flying around by myself in this darkness,
with a miserable heart ♫

702
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:55,800
♫ There’s an empty world deep in my heart ♫
