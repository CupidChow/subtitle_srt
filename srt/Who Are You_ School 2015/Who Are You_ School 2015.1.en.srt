1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,670
Ah, school?

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,150
I don't really like going, but I feel anxious if I don't go.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,680
If by any chance I can't go to school anymore,

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,540
I feel like I would want to go again.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,600
It's weird, isn't it?

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,940
Lee Eun Bi
Noori Girl's High School located in Tongyeong, 11th Grade

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,580
The time I hate most at school is

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,300
when we have a break or recess.

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,070
I work around 3 part time jobs.

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:50,310
When I graduate, I have to leave the Love House orphanage and get independent.

11
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,240
My dream is to be a teacher.

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,760
I want to be a teacher who can catch onto the kids' lies,

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,510
the things kids say, and the things they hide.

14
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,550
Tongyeong, South Gyeongsang Province

Noori High School

16
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,690
♫ Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! ♫

17
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,620
♫ Happy birthday, dear So Young! ♫

18
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,780
♫ Happy birthday to you!♫
Ta-da!

19
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,890
Surprise!

20
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,840
What are you doing?

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,680
But that's not all.

22
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,220
Let go! Let go of me!

23
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,240
Step one! Ba-bam! Crack the egg.

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,270
First, you have to crack the egg.

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,430
Step two! Ba-bam! On top of it,

26
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,720
you have to pour a lot of flour.

27
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,390
Step three! Ba-bam! Lastly,

28
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:13,560
if you pour in the special sauce,

29
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,450
the special cake is complete!

30
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,080
So Young, happy birthday!

31
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,510
I'm kind of disappointed that there aren't any candles.

32
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,340
Thanks, guys!

33
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,540
I'm totally touched! I also love you!

34
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,550
Love you!

35
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,030
Lee Eun Bi

36
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,830
In the year 1908, the Gyeongbu Railroad along

37
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,070
with Japanese students that returned...

38
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,830
What was that special sauce you poured at the end?

39
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,190
Ah, that?

40
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:19,030
There was an optimistic expectation for the enlightenment of civilization.

41
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,020
The music sheet is attached to the lyrics and Scottish folk song...

42
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,820
What is this?

43
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,910
Eel fish sauce?

44
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,560
It's strong, right?

45
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,240
No matter how many times I used soap, the smell wouldn't go away.

46
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,690
Can you please get further away from me?

47
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,330
Yeah, I will do that.

48
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,820
Teacher! I think someone farted. Something smells weird.

49
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,640
Be quiet!

50
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,640
I will end the lesson here today.

51
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,210
Lee Eun Bi, come to the teacher's office.

52
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,540
It's not a day or two. Why are you the only one wearing your gym clothes?

53
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,180
I think I gave you a warning before too.

54
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,610
Could it be that someone is bothering you?

55
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,350
You have to tell me truthfully in order for me to help you.

56
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,180
No, there's nothing like that.

57
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:21,480
Who Are You

58
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,130
Episode 1

59
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,670
Young Woo! Seung Min! What are you doing right now?

60
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,730
- This is mine!
- I'm telling you that it's mine!

61
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,370
It's mine!

62
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,010
There is plenty of soup on the table. Why are you fighting?

63
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,050
That one doesn't have a lot of onion or radish.

64
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,310
You two... If you don't eat the vegetables, this unnie will...

65
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,860
This is all so that you...

66
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,160
Grow up strong and healthy!

67
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,730
Even so, Noona,

68
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,580
please let us off the hook this once!

69
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,150
You cute little rascals.

70
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,700
If you do this, then my heart...

71
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,190
You thought I'd cave in. But no, I will not.

72
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,860
Without leaving a single vegetable, eat every single thing!

73
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,920
- Everyone be quiet.
- Yes.

74
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,490
Put the plates in the sink. Brush your teeth thoroughly.

75
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,440
- You can do well right?
- Yes!

76
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:36,060
Challenge... Challenge (in Korean).

77
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,760
Ra Jin, what's wrong here?

78
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,270
I fell.

79
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,710
Why? How did you fall?

80
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,530
Just... While playing with other kids...

81
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,380
Look at my eyes and talk. It's okay.

82
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,660
Student, why are you making such a big deal when they are just playing as friends?

83
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,730
Ahjumma, it's called playing when the person is having fun.

84
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,190
But our Ra Jin wasn't enjoying it even one bit

85
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,910
- and she was hurt!
- So what?

86
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:00,350
Dong Woo, apologize sincerely to our Ra Jin.

87
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,080
Also, promise that you won't bother her again!

88
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,870
Until you do so, I'm not moving an inch from here tonight.

89
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,810
Unnie...

90
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:26,280
Why are you hiding? Just apologize. Hurry up!

91
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,450
Sorry... I won't do it again.

92
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,540
Promise?

93
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,270
Student, that's enough, right?

94
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,470
Let's go.

95
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,420
That girl is vicious. It must be because she doesn't have any parents.

96
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,390
Why are you playing with that kind of kids?

97
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,340
Mom! That hurts!

98
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,630
Should I carry you?

99
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,590
Ra Jin...

100
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:24,580
No matter how close a friend is, if you're hurt, you have to say so.

101
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,740
If you don't like it, say you don't like it. If you don't want them to do something, tell them they can't do it.

102
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,780
If you do that, they won't act so carelessly around you.

103
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,960
Okay?

104
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,000
Just like you did back there?

105
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,710
Yes.

106
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,300
Thanks, Unnie.

107
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:53,030
You are a gift that God gave me in place of my mother.

108
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:01,090
"Every day, magical things happened to Sara.

109
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,480
Every night she went back to the attic, new things appeared.

110
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,680
The shabby room turn into a beautiful room fit for a princess.

111
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,500
No matter what, if anything bad happens,

112
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,370
I'm sure there is someone in this world that thinks of me.

113
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,590
She was no longer sad

114
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,150
or lonely."

115
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,520
Eun Bi, could yout to come out for a second?

116
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,450
It was delivered today but it slipped my mind.

117
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,330
Seeing that it's from Gangnam, could it be the person that sent you the sneakers last time?

118
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,800
Yes, it seems so.

119
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,780
I don't know who it is, but they sure must like you a lot.

120
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,600
That person keeps sending you gifts.

121
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,760
Wow!

122
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,800
When I went to the store to buy my daughter one,

123
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,890
I bought another one as I thought of you.

124
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,860
Song Mi Gyung.

125
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,760
Hurry and look at the present.

126
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,860
How is it?

127
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,540
It's really pretty.

128
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,640
It's really amazing.

129
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,020
The sneakers from last time were also a perfect fit.

130
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,500
This is totally my style.

131
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,500
Seoul

132
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,370
Eun Byul! Go Eun Bul!

133
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,510
Mom. This isn't an around-the-world trip.

134
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,670
This is just a three night trip to Tongyeong in South Gyeongsang Province.

135
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,260
We're going to take a bus and then take some pictures of the Buddha temple. That's all.

136
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,580
Did I say that's not true?

137
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,720
Just why do I need so many things?

138
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,130
Just in case you didn't know what to take, I set everything up for you.

139
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:26,280
Pick just what you really want to take from here.

140
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,170
You've clearly said it.

141
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,230
You don't believe your mom's words?

142
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,440
What the heck?

143
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,300
- That's it?
- That's it!

144
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,260
Even so!

145
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,190
- Mom!
- Just a minute!

146
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,990
Wait just a minute!

147
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,140
Then this!

148
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,120
Just take this one thing with you.

149
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,330
If you play too much, you'll definitely get sick.

150
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,810
So just look at this for a bit whenever you have nothing to do.

151
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,370
This is really too much.

152
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,160
I haven't seen this shirt before.

153
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,240
I bought it with my friend.

154
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,040
Why are you so touchy about it? Do you think it'll get dirty if I touch it?

155
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,100
Here you go.

156
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,980
- I'll be going now.
- Ah, wait!

157
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,320
Eun Byul, just a second.

158
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,130
When it's cold at night, make sure to put this on.

159
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,150
You have a weak respiratory system, you'll get sick quite easily.

160
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,420
I will do that.

161
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,940
Mom, you know...

162
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,580
It's nothing.

163
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,670
I'm saying that for the time that I'm gone, you should rest.

164
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,500
I got it!

165
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,620
Have fun and come back safely, my daughter.

166
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,760
Mom, I'll be back.

167
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,920
Has Cha Song Joo still not come?

168
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,570
She's probably late because she's trying to get all pretty up first.

169
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,680
She's coming.

170
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,420
Here!

171
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,470
So annoying. No matter what, this uniform doesn't look good.

172
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,120
It's alright.

173
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,680
Your body is your edge after all.

174
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,680
Go Eun Byul, you've made a good observation,

175
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,170
Your shoes are pretty, guys.

176
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,690
Ta-da!

177
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,320
What the heck! It's so embarrassing!

178
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,640
Are you two dating?

179
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,420
You thought this was the end of it, didn't you?

180
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,180
We even matched our panties to perfection.

181
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,810
Ah, really...

182
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:10,490
Hot pink! You forgot, didn't you?

183
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,390
- I wore it.
- What a liar!

184
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,850
Your face always get so serious whenever you lie.

185
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,510
- Let's see.
- What!

186
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,950
- Stop it, Cha Song Joo!
- Ah! Come here!

187
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,740
Hold on, hold on!

188
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,310
What is it, what is it? What color is it? I want to see too.

189
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,110
Show you what?

190
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,030
Get lost!

191
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,660
Show us, show us!

192
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,730
Now, now, attention!

193
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,670
Attention!

194
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,020
I'll say it again,

195
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,880
to make an enjoyable trip the first rule is safety.

196
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,340
The second one is safety, the third one is safety.

197
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:55,030
If you're feeling weird or sick, you have to tell the teachers immediately so you can be taken to the hospital.

198
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:59,600
Don't leave the group without telling the teachers. Don't eat food from strangers.

199
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,310
- He sure likes safety.
- Yes.

200
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,930
Class President, are we waiting on anyone else?

201
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,430
Gong Tae Kwang is absent for personal reasons, and Han Yi Ahn has a competition.

202
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,150
Aside from those two, everyone is here.

203
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,960
This is the 400 m high school freestyle competition.

204
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,110
The competitors are going to start stretching.

205
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,570
The unique thing about this 400 m race is

206
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,450
that all the rookies made it to the final.

207
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,230
Ah, that's right. In the third lane, Han Yi Ahn from Sekang high school.

208
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,100
Fighting!
And the fourth lane's Kim Woo Jin from Woo Hyun high school.

209
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,480
The two are most likely the contenders.

210
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,420
- That's right.
- We're looking forward to it.

211
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,200
The race is about to start.

212
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,320
It's started!
♫ There’s an empty world deep in my heart, save me ♫

213
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,290
♫ There’s an empty world deep in my heart, save me ♫

214
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:58,860
♫ I wanna reset, I wanna reset, I wanna reset ♫

215
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:04,150
♫ Lonely eyes trapped in darkness ♫

216
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,850
As expected, the two leaders are already fighting for the lead.

217
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,060
♫ I wanna reset ♫

218
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,750
♫ Your smile that’s not sneering at me ♫
♫ Takes me away from disappearing ♫

219
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,890
♫ In the darkness, your smile shines brightly into my heart ♫

220
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,420
It's extremely close! In the third lane is Han Yi Ahn and in the fourth lane is Kim Woo Jin.

221
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,820
They are both fighting for 1st place.

222
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,620
The record is extremely good right now.

223
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,400
♫ In the darkness, your smile shines brightly into my heart ♫

224
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,560
♫ I wanna reset, I wanna reset, I wanna ♫

225
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,790
♫ Why don’t you know? Even if I’m a small existence ♫

226
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,290
♫ Don’t trample on me but go with me ♫

227
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,890
♫ Your careless words and actions break me down ♫

228
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,500
Is it Han Yi Ahn or Kim Woo Jin?

229
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,780
Han Yi Ahn is coming through!

230
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,920
Swimmer Han Yi Ahn breaks the record and earns the gold medal!

231
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,250
Han Yi Ahn just became a part of high school freestyle swim history.

232
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,200
Gold! Han Yi Ahn in lane 3 gets the gold medal!

233
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,590
Hey, what are you listening to?

234
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,010
Just...

235
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,730
- Let's listen together.
- Your makeup's messed up.

236
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,020
Where?

237
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,110
Three!

238
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,740
Thank you.

239
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,870
- Can I touch your gold medal?
- This?

240
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,090
Wow.

241
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,650
Congratulations, Han Yi Ahn!

242
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,450
You're lucky you earn a lot of medals.

243
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,430
But is this really gold? Give me just one!

244
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,160
No.

245
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:54,610
If you really want one, why don't you try and get one.

246
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,340
I'm not as good of a swimmer as you.

247
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,490
Whatever... I don't want it.

248
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,320
I don't want to give this one to you.

249
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,030
Instead, the next national competition. I'll give you the first medal I win.

250
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,590
- How about that?
- I don't believe you.

251
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:17,750
You won't even give me this not really important medal. But you're going to give me one from that huge competition?

252
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,870
Silly, I'm not giving it to you because it's not really important.

253
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,040
Aigoo. Forget it.

254
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,340
It's amazing that you can do well with that brain of yours.

255
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,610
Hey! What did you say?

256
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,460
Got the gold medal.

257
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,360
So what about it?

258
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,560
Just saying it.

259
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,960
Yay, we're at the rest stop now.

260
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,390
I can get to Tongyeong easily from here.

261
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,840
So what?

262
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,960
Just saying it.

263
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,760
How are you feeling?

264
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,170
You can't express it in words, right?

265
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,010
You have to do the 100 meter well tomorrow, too.

266
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,460
Yes!

267
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,160
Ah, Coach!

268
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,180
What? Tell me.

269
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,380
Nothing.

270
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,990
The classes are very small.

271
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,310
Over there. The one with the beige trench coat is the Pig Mom.

272
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,880
It's hard to see the faces of the mothers of our children's classmates.

273
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,650
It's harder than trying to meet Jo In Sung or Won Bin, right?

274
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,140
I know, right?

275
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,410
Honey, thank you.

276
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,040
Buy me food. Something really expensive.

277
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,890
Let's go in.

278
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,790
- You're here?
- Come on in!

279
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,950
You waited for a long time, right?

280
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:11,240
This is Eun Byul's friend's mother. Her husband is the chief of a plastic surgery hospital.

281
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,210
Wow. I would believe it if you said she's a model.

282
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,930
A mother who has a kid that needs to study has time to take care of herself.

283
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:21,380
I'm jealous. What's your secret?

284
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,750
I'm not sure.

285
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:27,860
Secret? The body I was born with?

286
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,330
I was joking.

287
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,910
Sit down.

288
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,170
I'll go first. I have to leave town this afternoon.

289
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,790
Should we go?

290
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,310
We just came. Just stay for 10 more minutes.

291
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,840
I have to go back too, so I won't stay for long.

292
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,660
Yes, we just arrived.

293
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,250
Then just 10 minutes.

294
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,800
Okay, just 10 minutes.

295
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:06,800
I really wanted to meet you once.

296
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,780
Yes.

297
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,790
But it's such a pity. We can't even eat together.

298
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,830
Please give me a call.

299
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,390
Shin Jung Min
"When I am involved, you will go up"

300
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,810
Oh my! Thank you.

301
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,780
Thank you so much.

302
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,840
What do I do?

303
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,750
Hey, Eun Byul!

304
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:40,090
I heard Han Yi Ahn won the gold medal. Isn't he so cool?

305
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,520
Really? He did well.

306
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,590
What? That's all?

307
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,880
Of course that's all. Was I the one who won it?

308
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,820
Aigoo, you fought again?

309
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,080
Why do you guys fight each other to your necks?

310
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,520
Hey, it's because ever since I was little, I've seen everything I was allowed and not allowed to see. Why?

311
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,470
Then what? Should we be dancing like this?

312
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,770
Oh my gosh.

313
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,740
Just because it's something that's in the past, it doesn't mean it never happened.

314
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,130
Jung Soo In...

315
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,510
Hey, do that thing again!

316
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,360
Aigoo. You're so clumsy.

317
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,080
Hey!

318
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,260
Hey, Go Eun Byul!

319
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,010
Oh! I saw Soo In's mom yesterday.

320
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:57,780
Soo In?

321
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,600
The one from last year at school...

322
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,380
Ah, her?

323
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,920
They're coming back. They live in Keritza tower.

324
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,480
I live there too!

325
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,600
But did something happen at school last year?

326
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,460
Ask Eun Byul's mother.

327
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,670
Didn't you say Eun Byul and Soo In were close?

328
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:25,400
Oh, no. A long time ago, they were in the same class once.

329
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,120
Did something happen?

330
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,110
No, there wasn't any time for anything to happen.

331
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:45,420
Eun Byul? Why are you suddenly acting like this?

332
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,480
It's nothing.

333
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,610
Did something bad happen?

334
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,500
I'm getting frustrated. Eat this and say something.

335
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,700
I don't feel like it.

336
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,900
You want it since you're smelling it, right?

337
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,950
Say ah!

338
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,370
I told you I don't want to! What's wrong with you?

339
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:11,200
Hey! Are you okay?

340
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,080
Hey, Eun Byul. Aren't you being a bit too much?

341
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:22,160
Everyone, it's Tongyeong!

342
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,380
Tongyeong

343
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:47,110
Ra Jin, you can stop now. Unnie's fine.

344
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,610
You're still hot.

345
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:57,180
I'm serious. Thanks to you, I'm all better, Ra Jin.

346
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,320
Did you worry a lot?

347
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:07,200
Unnie, if you go to school, you have a lot of friends,

348
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,780
and your popularity is great in Love House.

349
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,790
But if you're sick,

350
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,290
I don't have anyone.

351
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,460
Okay. I won't ever be sick again.

352
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,820
Should we make Ra Jin's favorite spicy rice cakes?

353
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,510
Yeah! Spicy rice cakes! Really spicy.

354
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,060
Alright.

355
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,450
Huh? Who is it?

356
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,120
Unnie! Come quick!

357
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,690
It's not much, but please have some.

358
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,130
Oh! Eun Bi's here.

359
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,190
Eun Bi! Are you okay?

360
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,180
Do you know how worried we were?

361
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,280
How did you come here?

362
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:03,070
We were originally going to volunteer at a senior house center.

363
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:06,520
But we heard Eun Bi was sick,

364
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,250
so we changed our plan on volunteering.

365
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,920
Is that fine?

366
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,690
We're thankful.

367
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:18,610
I'm open to Eun Bi's friends coming over anytime.

368
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:19,850
Thank you.

369
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,070
Anyway, eat!

370
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,350
Hey, outcast girl!

371
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,830
You do this. You're going to eat it.

372
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:50,660
Isn't this all being funded by the tax that our parents paid?

373
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:55,930
So if you have any sense, work for us too.

374
00:27:55,930 --> 00:28:01,020
Yeah. Don't just try to receive.

375
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:08,030
Unnie!

376
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,900
Oh my! It's you!

377
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,350
I've heard a lot about you from Eun Bi.

378
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:25,050
Your name is... What was it?

379
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,540
Ra Jin.

380
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,230
Oh, right! Ra Jin.

381
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:34,180
But why were you just doing that to my sister?

382
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,340
Ra Jin. That was...

383
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,340
Can't you tell just from looking?

384
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,900
We were just playing around!

385
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,810
Playing.

386
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:52,670
Playing around is when the person is also having fun.

387
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:57,380
Unnie, are you having fun right now? Or are you hurt?

388
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:08,090
It is just playing around. I'm having fun too.

389
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,530
Ah, so it is!

390
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:18,200
Then again, you're really popular.

391
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:30,470
Is that what you're doing? Playing with naive kids?

392
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,060
There's nothing my unnie can't do!

393
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,550
She can make spicy rice cakes really well too.

394
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,380
Right, Unnie?

395
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,800
Yeah.

396
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,900
Really?

397
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,000
What do you put in it to make it so good?

398
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,140
Maybe,

399
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,950
eel fish sauce?

400
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:06,220
Verification of Volunteer Work
Park Min Kyung

401
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:13,110
I'm really thankful for today.

402
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,180
Don't mention it.

403
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:21,200
By the way, I'm worried because I think Eun Bi is still very sick.

404
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,070
Lighten your expression, Eun Bi.

405
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:28,750
Aigoo, look at that sweat. Are you okay?

406
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:32,750
- That, Director...
- Ah!

407
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,470
The scholarship funding program that my father set up...

408
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,990
They're searching for a new group. So,

409
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,500
I was planning to suggest the Love House.

410
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,500
If you could do that I'll be really thankful.

411
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,130
Her father is a prosecutor for Kang Ilsan, did you know that?

412
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:56,150
Of course. Who wouldn't know him in Tongyeong?

413
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:01,550
I didn't recognize Love House savior's daughter.

414
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:07,200
You must have that warm heart from your father.

415
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,500
No. I owe a lot of things to Eun Bi.

416
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,820
Ever since I came from Seoul...

417
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,230
She's a friend that's helped me a lot.

418
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:23,050
Aigoo, our Eun Bi did that.

419
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:26,280
You guys worked hard, so eat already.

420
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,880
Daebak! I won!

421
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,820
Seriously, I have to get it right.

422
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,790
It's not even a joke.

423
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:44,880
This one. Okay, okay.

424
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,120
One, two. It's this.

425
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,170
- It's pretty!
- It's not a joke, right?
- Yeah.

426
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:48,800
How come you're still using the same old tricks as when I was a student? Not even 1% different.

427
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,690
I'm disappointed. I'm confiscating these.

428
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:57,970
- Teacher, I thought you would pretend not to see it once or twice. I'm disappointed as well.

429
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:03,180
You guys are all suffering because of having a tactless teacher like me.

430
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,090
I'm leaving.

431
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,790
Give me all of those.

432
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:27,440
So Young, can you meet me for a moment?

433
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:56,660
You're doing all kinds of things now. Telling a person to meet you in the late of night.

434
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,800
What do you have to say?

435
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,950
Just now... You said your father's scholarship fund

436
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,380
is looking for a new group.

437
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,190
Is that true?

438
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,300
Why? Are you interested?

439
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,330
I thought you would say no to that because of me.

440
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:21,020
The director of Love House is having difficulties lately.

441
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,780
This is not the situation where I can say no because I want to.

442
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:30,570
What are you talking about? If you're going to ask for a favor, do it right.

443
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:35,830
So what? Are you asking me for help, or saying you don't want it?

444
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:40,620
Help me. I'm begging you.

445
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:46,750
Did my dad come home? I'll just call him.

446
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:53,370
Ah, right. I left my phone behind.

447
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:57,730
Can I borrow it? This seems really urgent.

448
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,270
Where did she go?

449
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,500
Who is that?

450
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,610
A guy?

451
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,130
I'm going to crush you all soon!
You're going to live a rotten life!
If you mess with me once more time...

452
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,690
- What did he say?
- What?

453
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:43,150
Ah, there's going to be good news. Just wait.

454
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,240
A call is coming. Answer it.

455
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:55,300
- Hello?
- Lee Eun Bi! You bitch, are you asking for trouble?

456
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,270
Stinking bitch, you really...!
Lee Soo Mi

457
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,720
I'm going to crush you all soon!
You're going to live a rotten life!
If you mess with me once more time, I'm setting fire on your house.

458
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,110
Hey, scholarship?

459
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,170
You're funny.

460
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,070
Ra Jin, is that her name? She said this.

461
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:19,750
When she's older, she says she wants to be an amazing unnie like you.

462
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,110
She doesn't even know you're like this.

463
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:27,940
I'll pray that your sister will become just like you.

464
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,640
Goodbye.

465
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,880
Kang So Young.

466
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,940
You're really hopeless.

467
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:52,200
- What did you just say?
- You think you got everything you wanted?

468
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,060
But, did you know that?

469
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:01,430
In my eyes... From the first time you came in elementary school....

470
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:04,420
you looked pitiful.

471
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,360
Really?

472
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,790
You must have had a hard time hiding your true feelings.

473
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,780
Say more.

474
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,550
I told you to say more!

475
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,160
Go away. I told you to go away! Go!

476
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:41,210
If you think you can hit me. Hit me.

477
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,940
You can't even look at me straight in the eyes. But what?

478
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,900
You pity me?

479
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,160
So Young!

480
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,040
Eun Byul.

481
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,700
Stop! Stop.

482
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,810
Thank you.

483
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,760
How about Eun Byul?

484
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,470
How should I know? Let her be. It's annoying.

485
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,830
Eun Byul is a bit weird lately, right?

486
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,970
Actually, last night...

487
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:28,650
I know. She was studying in her room all alone.

488
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:31,320
She's my friend, but she can be so rude sometimes.

489
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,050
She just got angry at everything and ruined everyone's mood.

490
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:38,180
And then she just started studying.

491
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:41,400
It is weird.

492
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:47,700
Hey. Don't worry about Eun Byul, and let's play together, just the two of us.

493
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,060
What should we do?

494
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,370
Love House

495
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:08,440
Hello? Is this Love House?

496
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,970
Yes, hello.

497
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:14,760
I'm Eun Bi's friend, Kyung Ah.

498
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,960
I'm her friend from middle school.

499
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,650
Can you tell me Eun Bi's phone number?

500
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,170
- Are you going to order?
- Two Americanos.

501
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,160
Okay.

502
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,880
It's ₩5000. Thank you.

503
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:41,600
How can you do such a scary thing?

504
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:47,480
Go to the hospital and apologize before the school starts to call a meeting for this.

505
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,960
Isn't someone calling you?

506
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,140
It keeps ringing.

507
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:11,460
Customer number eight. Your coffee is ready.

508
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,000
Thank you.

509
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,480
Jung Unnie,

510
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,540
there's an urgent matter. Can I leave work early?

511
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,990
- Yes.
- Thank you!

512
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:45,000
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.
- You're shutting your eyes tightly, right?
- Yes.

513
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,470
I'm putting it on now.

514
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,760
It's finished.

515
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,480
Set your expectations high and ta-da!

516
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,020
Hey! Why? Hey, don't mess with it, it looks really sexy!

517
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:01,050
You told me you would do it just like yours.

518
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,980
- Let's go.
- Okay.

519
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,500
Let's go.

520
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,590
Is there anyone there?

521
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,580
Is it you again?

522
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:07,610
Until when are you going to do this?!

523
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,650
Hey, Lee Shi Jin!

524
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,780
- Cha Song Joo!
- What?

525
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,860
We are not able take the group photo because of you. Hurry up.

526
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,930
Okay.

527
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:43,100
- Let's go!
- Okay.

528
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,470
Hey! Let's take a picture. Gather around!

529
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:51,130
Gather around, gather around.

530
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,820
Come closer! Closer.

531
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,560
Together, ready?

532
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:10,770
Who Are You

533
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,050
Wow, look at this.

534
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:18,340
Did everyone come?

535
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,130
- For people who didn't come, raise their hand.
- Right here!

536
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,440
Three people left.

537
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,850
Everyone came except one person.

538
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:29,260
Who's that one person?

539
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,600
That person is me.

540
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:35,540
- Hey, quickly, who is it?
- Who is that one person?

541
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:43,110
What is that?

542
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,010
Teacher... Eun Byul...

543
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,930
Eun Byul isn't here.

544
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:51,570
Call her.

545
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:59,260
Her phone is off.

546
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:02,610
Hey, when is the last place you saw Go Eun Byul?

547
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,300
I saw her, Teacher!

548
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,070
I think she was pooping in the bathroom.

549
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:17,340
Eun Byul!

550
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:21,410
Eun Byul!

551
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:25,060
Eun Byul! I know you're in there. Come out quickly.

552
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:27,770
Eun Byul, let's talk--

553
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:43,140
Where the heck did this girl go?

554
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:46,430
Eun Byul! Eun Byul!

555
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:50,950
Eun Byul!

556
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,630
There's an announcement to be made.

557
00:45:56,630 --> 00:46:01,670
The Cable Car 'High Train' will be closing at 19:00.

558
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:06,640
- Have you seen her?
- Over there.
Those who want to enter the cable car please hurry.

559
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,870
Wait. Wait.

560
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:16,980
Stop there.

561
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,640
Aigoo, going through this multiple times doesn't help you find a person.

562
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,040
There are videos of so many people taken by a lot of cameras.

563
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:29,840
Possibly,

564
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:34,970
did Eun Byul say something special or do anything out of the ordinary?

565
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:37,860
She just looked like she was in a bad mood.

566
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,140
She gets sensitive sometimes.

567
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,740
How about you, Shi Ji?

568
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:44,300
Did you feel anything out of the ordinary?

569
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:46,700
Um...

570
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,300
What? Say it.

571
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,590
Yesterday night,

572
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:54,950
I saw Eun Byul fighting with a guy.

573
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,480
What?

574
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,200
A guy?

575
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:18,060
That saucy girl.

576
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,480
She doesn't even contact me.

577
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:33,500
Is she sleeping already?

578
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:39,840
Yeah, right, sleeping. She's probably playing around right now.

579
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:46,140
The person you're trying to reach has turned off the phone.

580
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:57,320
Hello?

581
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,760
Ahjumma!

582
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,760
Eun Byul...

583
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,820
Key...

584
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:51,570
100 m high school men's freestyle race will begin.

585
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:56,790
To all competitors, please enter the pool area.

586
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:17,550
Everyone's attention is now on Han Yi Ahn.

587
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:22,020
That's right. Honestly, at first no one really noticed Han Yi Ahn.

588
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:27,810
That's right, but it looks like he'll be a star after this tournament.

589
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,390
The race has started. But right now...

590
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:44,210
Han Yi Ahn didn't take his start.

591
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:48,070
Could it be that he couldn't start or that he chose to not start?

592
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,200
Eun Byul, where are you?

593
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,600
Eun Byul's mother--

594
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,800
Mom, I'm leaving!

595
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,190
Teacher...

596
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,910
My...

597
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,610
Where's my Eun Byul?

598
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:35,370
We are also waiting to be contacted about it.

599
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:41,310
The other kids are all there, but why isn't my Eun Byul there?

600
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:49,110
They all went together, but how come Eun Byul is the only person you didn't bring back?

601
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:50,840
Why?

602
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,990
How come my Eun Byul is the only one who can't go home now?!

603
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:55,680
Why? Why?

604
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,380
Eun Bul's mother, please don't be like this and calm down a bit.

605
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:02,540
No, let's just go. Let's just go quickly.

606
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:05,370
Teacher Han, you can't be like this right now. Let's go!

607
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:11,320
- The police are now searching, please wait for now.
- Who knows what would happen during the night?

608
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,390
Eun Byul... Eun Byul...

609
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:51,830
Our So Young needs counseling.

610
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:58,900
And to be sitting next to the student who attacked her is very frightening and painful for her now.

611
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,770
Student Lee Eun Byul,

612
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:13,430
apologize to student Kang So Young sincerely.

613
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,330
I...

614
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:31,100
Didn't do anything wrong.

615
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:38,680
I've thought about it, and thought about it,

616
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,290
and I thought about it one more time,

617
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,100
I

618
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,090
am innocent.

619
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:54,330
Calm down.

620
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:03,860
I ask the committee to make a wise decision and decide on the proper punishment for this.

621
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:05,960
Let's go.

622
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:18,480
Prosecutor Kang!

623
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:42,220
Your permission of withdrawal paper... It'll be processed in two weeks.

624
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,290
You can go now.

625
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:46,690
Teacher!

626
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:52,260
I'll take today's lesson to the end and leave.

627
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,350
Today's the last day of school for me,

628
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:59,690
and I don't want to leave like I got kicked out.

629
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:12,500
Lee Eun Bi!

630
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,170
I heard you got expelled?

631
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:25,470
After sending those threatening texts to us and sending So Young to the hospital, the punishment is rather mild.

632
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,280
Eun Bi,

633
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,880
don't be sad that you can't see me anymore.

634
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,750
I'll find where you work at later on and play with you a lot then.

635
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:40,420
So generous.

636
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,430
I have one last thing

637
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:45,850
I have to ask you.

638
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,290
Why are you like this to me?

639
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:55,860
Are you curious? Then I guess I'll have to tell you.

640
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,230
Just...

641
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,300
Because.

642
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,910
I hate you just because you're Lee Eun Bi.

643
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,120
It smells like Lee Eun Bi.

644
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:16,740
- Isn't this smell like a sand eel?
- I made that sauce.
- Of course.

645
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:19,710
Kang So Young, you,

646
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:23,280
how low are you going to go?

647
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:27,720
- You're at the lowest point right now.
- This bitch, really.

648
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,350
Guys,

649
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,260
close the curtain.

650
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:48,650
Stop it!

651
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:53,450
I told you to stop it! I told you to stop it!

652
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:19,640
♫ For you, who is sad and crying ♫
♫ For you, who is struggling ♫

653
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:24,530
Try smiling? Huh?

654
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,550
If you act up again,

655
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:35,600
this video...

656
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,450
I will spread it everywhere.

657
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:46,900
♫ Remember that you’re not alone ♫

658
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:54,190
♫ Even if the world causes you pain ♫

659
00:56:54,190 --> 00:57:01,400
♫  From now on, even when you feel lonely or sad, don't cry ♫

660
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:08,510
♫ I’ll hug you without a word, I’ll listen to your story ♫

661
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:15,500
♫  Turn around, I will be there ♫

662
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:21,770
♫ I will wipe away all your tears ♫
Lee Eun Bi

663
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:26,990
♫  Even your loneliness ♫

664
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:49,080
Lee Eun Bi

665
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,530
♫ It’s just a passing wind ♫
♫ I try shouting at the person next to me ♫

666
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:58,680
♫ But only silence is looking at me ♫

667
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,140
♫ I am walking along but why are they getting farther away? ♫

668
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:06,260
♫ Why am I standing alone? Why is only my world stopping? ♫

669
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,590
♫ I see them fading far away ♫

670
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:11,810
♫ Even if it’s just one person ♫,
♫ Please look back and hold my hand ♫

671
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:16,640
♫ Even if it's just once, please hold my hand ♫

672
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:21,370
Goodbye, my friends!
