1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,020
What do you mean hard?

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,410
There's someone who's protecting her with his life.

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,100
Lee Eun Bi went back to Tongyeong.

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,060
No wonder.

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,720
I was wondering why she was acting up while only being a loner.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,200
What can our athlete Han Yi Ahn do now that he regrets it?

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,440
Hey, Kang So Young.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,540
What do you want to say now?

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,490
You know what?

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,490
Han Yi Ahn gave up his game

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,410
and got into an accident while running to school.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,760
What?

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,030
Who was he trying to save to make such a rash decision?

14
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,420
He already knew that

15
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,710
it was Lee Eun Bi and not Go Eun Byul.

16
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,120
What is she saying right now?

17
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,170
Hey, Han Yi Ahn.

18
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,810
I have something I'm curious about.

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,530
The person you like...

20
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,380
Is it Go Eun Byul

21
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,250
or Lee Eun Bi?

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,430
Hey, transfer student.

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,110
That answer...

24
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,680
I don't think you have a reason to hear it.

25
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,250
Really?

26
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,540
I just thought Go Eun Byul would be curious.

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,090
Aren't you?

28
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,820
Kang So Young.

29
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,240
You have a skill of making someone lose their mind when you talk.

30
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,160
Why?

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,940
Are you going crazy wondering about

32
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,210
what would come out of Han Yi Ahn's mouth?

33
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,760
No.

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,250
Not at all.

35
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,000
Hey,

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,970
try lying while taking care of your facial expressions.

37
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,380
You're fooling around with

38
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,330
my sister who almost died because of you

39
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,950
and my best friend for 10 years?

40
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,470
Are you crazy?

41
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,690
I have no intentions of interfering with your hobby,

42
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,470
but find someone else while I'm asking nicely.

43
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,480
If you know that it doesn't work here, then just get lost.

44
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,740
School 2015: Who Are You

45
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,320
Episode 14

46
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,580
What?

47
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,370
Go Eun Byul, your anger is really great.

48
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,540
Hey, aren't you going to move it?

49
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,980
Did you hurt it then?

50
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,470
Your shoulder.

51
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,780
It hurt before then.

52
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,250
What?

53
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,130
Never mind.

54
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,420
Hey, but what's wrong with Gong Tae Kwang?

55
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,730
- What's wrong with Gong Tae Kwang?
- I mean, when he found out that I'm not Eun Bi,

56
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,810
he shouted asking where she was and ran out.

57
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,810
Then he went to Tongyeong.

58
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,430
- Tongyeong?
- Yeah.

59
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,490
He said he slept there.

60
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,790
Gong Tae Kwang.

61
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,560
He became crazier while I was gone.

62
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,030
Just try and come near me.

63
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,520
Hey, even if I go now, I can't go in class.

64
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,430
Alright, alright.

65
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,730
- Ra Jin, on the way to school, take Oppa to the terminal bus.
- Okay.

66
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,590
Hey, am I an idiot?

67
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,420
You're telling an elementary school kid to take me to the bus?

68
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,720
Hey, Ra Jin is 10 times more trustworthy than you.

69
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,370
Go safely.

70
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,870
Bye.

71
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,420
We'll be back!

72
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,290
Come back safely!

73
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,170
You're going to come, right?

74
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,100
Answer me. You're going to come, right?

75
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,300
Hey, walk correctly.

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,300
I'll wait.

77
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,520
Gong Tae Kwang.

78
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,180
Hey, kiddos.

79
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,000
Hey!

80
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,160
The math teacher said to self study.

81
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,170
I have a question to ask him.

82
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,660
Is the teacher in the office?

83
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,590
I think he didn't come today.

84
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,720
We didn't even have a homeroom meeting.

85
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,150
What is it?

86
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,460
- Should I take a look?
- Really?

87
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,740
I thought I would be disturbing you.

88
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,470
Psh, it's not disturbing me...

89
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,710
Let me see.

90
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,190
What is this?

91
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,440
A sports club admission form.

92
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,330
You're going to do badminton?

93
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,740
Oh, now you're also doing sports?

94
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,130
Joon Suk.

95
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,730
Husband, take off your buttons while I'm asking nicely.

96
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,770
Oh, yes.

97
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,300
- More.
- More?

98
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,410
More!

99
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,300
Alright.

100
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,410
Hurry, not leaving one.

101
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,720
- Unbutton them.
- Oh my.

102
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,260
More.

103
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,150
Oh.

104
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,440
Aren't you going to take off all of them?

105
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,420
Really?

106
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:44,060
Hae Na. This dialogue is a bit strange.

107
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,520
Hae Na, isn't wearing this enough?

108
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,800
Couple t-shirts

109
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,010
Look at this? Now I like it.

110
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,950
Thanks, our Gi Tae.

111
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,880
You need to smile.

112
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,490
Alright.

113
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,420
Wow.

114
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,530
I'm sorry for alarming you at this time, Min Joon's father.

115
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,280
No, it's okay.

116
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,980
But will you be fine?

117
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,080
I wanted to push this off until the kids finished first semester.

118
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,590
But I've hidden it for a long time,

119
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,670
so I don't think I can do that anymore.

120
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,180
Student Jung Soo In's case from one year ago,

121
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,700
I'll confess to it.

122
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,860
Eun Bi.

123
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,600
The correction for your social security number came out.

124
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,000
- The rock I had in my heart went straight down. You feel that way too, right?
- Yes.

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,460
You must have had a hard time until now.

126
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,730
It'll be fine now, so don't worry.

127
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,730
You said being a teacher is your dream.

128
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,920
You can just study hard from now on.

129
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,550
I will

130
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,350
file an adoption form as soon as possible.

131
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,210
Hello?

132
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,300
Eun Bi.

133
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,070
Eun Bi?

134
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,810
Mom.

135
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,580
You're not going to come to Seoul?

136
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,290
After seeing your little friends,

137
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,620
are you reconsidering?

138
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,340
Give me some time to think.

139
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,880
I'm sorry, Mom.

140
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,610
Alright.

141
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,100
Okay, let's talk again soon.

142
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,050
Oh Jung Ha?

143
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,110
Eun Bi?

144
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,960
You were alive.

145
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,080
How are you here?

146
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,840
I...

147
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,660
Whenever I thought about you,

148
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,600
I came here.

149
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,760
You're really shocked, right?

150
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
No.

151
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,500
I thought that it might not have been you.

152
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,220
Eun Bi.

153
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,830
Truthfully...

154
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:34,690
Until the day you left school, I hated myself for being cowardly.

155
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,890
So after I heard that you were missing,

156
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,430
I went out to that beach daily.

157
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:48,110
We can't recognize the face.

158
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,630
We covered the face up as best as we could,

159
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:55,010
but based on the outfit, it appears to be a female student.

160
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:59,210
Yes, yes. Please come quickly!

161
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,860
At first, I thought that it could've been you.

162
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,110
Even if it wasn't,

163
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:10,260
I wanted to punish Kang So Young, who went around saying that she didn't do anything wrong.

164
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:15,060
That's why I left your name tag there.

165
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,600
You became like this after helping me,

166
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,920
but I pretended like I didn't know till the end,

167
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,970
so I'm worse than Kang So Young.

168
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,040
No.

169
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,390
Being bullied...

170
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,490
How hard and scary it is.

171
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,730
I know better than anyone.

172
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,470
That being the only thing you could do,

173
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,560
I understand.

174
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,980
There were so many times

175
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,380
I wanted to go to you...

176
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,500
Like you did for me,

177
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,820
I wanted to help you.

178
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,970
I'm sorry.

179
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,560
I'm really sorry, Eun Bi.

180
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,760
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,690
Eun Byul! Yi Ahn, hi.

182
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,110
Did you guys make up after fighting?

183
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,610
We did, right?

184
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,370
We aren't fighting. I was the one who was wrong.

185
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:08,110
What would Han Yi Ahn do wrong to Go Eun Byul? It's the other way around. Right?

186
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,090
Hey. There is.

187
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,430
What? Tell me one.

188
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,090
See? There isn't any!

189
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,570
There isn't any.

190
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:30,390
Doesn't it seem like Go Eun Byul is getting back her rudeness as she gets her memory back?

191
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:35,210
Yeah. The kind Go Eun Byul is gone.

192
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,550
Hey.

193
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:57,130
How long has it been since you went in the water again that you're making that face?

194
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,410
You knew that it wasn't going to be like before.

195
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:06,610
I didn't know, but now that I feel it through my body, I'm not that happy.

196
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,850
So what? You're going to go back into your hole?

197
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,660
Don't worry.

198
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,720
Once I start, there won't be anything like that.

199
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,800
Then that's fine.

200
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,680
If you say that, then you're already halfway. Relax that expression and rest. Got it?

201
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,650
Okay.

202
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,510
Start.

203
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,240
You. I know it's hard for you whenever you see my face.

204
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,240
But I'd like it if you recovered quickly and

205
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,110
return to being the Han Yi Ahn from before.

206
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,870
High School Male Swimming, 400m

207
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,620
Unnie!

208
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,660
What is that?

209
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,260
A gold medal. It's real, not a toy!

210
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:38,540
Isn't this the medal

211
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,530
that was next to your picture in the funeral place?

212
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:46,720
Do you remember that? Our Ra Jin is amazing!

213
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,850
Is it a present from when you lived in Seoul?

214
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,640
Yeah.

215
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,960
But I have to return it to the real owner.

216
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,700
Originally, there's another owner,

217
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,520
but I received it from him and just held onto it for her.

218
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:14,460
Ah. But, can I touch it just one time?

219
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,300
Okay.

220
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,700
Wow. It's cool.

221
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:35,020
All along, I didn't know what to call you, so it was hard.

222
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,500
Go safely, Lee Eun Bi.

223
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:50,170
Unnie, you want to go to Seoul again, right?

224
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,090
What?

225
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,990
No.

226
00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:00,590
I heard you got a mom and made many friends.

227
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,490
Why?

228
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:08,230
Are you worried that I will leave to Seoul again?

229
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,940
No.

230
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:17,260
Now that I know you aren't dead, I'm not worried.

231
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,560
You want to go to your school,

232
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,740
and see your friends, right?

233
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,680
Ra Jin.

234
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,360
You don't have to stay here because of us.

235
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:39,300
Instead, on our birthdays, Children's Day, and Christmas,

236
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,620
please visit us.

237
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,100
Promise.

238
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,550
You're going to promise, right?

239
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:59,810
Okay. I'll promise.

240
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:28,370
Autopsy Report

241
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,870
Resignation Letter

242
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,820
There's no need for you to do this. Your punishment from the court will be light.

243
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,680
If you just wait, this will all settle. So stay still.

244
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,660
Teacher, if I receive punishment according to the law–

245
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,620
Stop speaking such weak and useless words!

246
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,460
That case was an accident!

247
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:09,800
It wasn't like you knew and just left it be, and it wasn't like I covered that up for my own interests!

248
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,140
But Teacher–

249
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:17,120
I could do only that for the students.

250
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,780
You hid the truth.

251
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,960
Since everyone already ignored the her,

252
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,700
even though she died, you made sure no one would remember her.

253
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:39,400
I am about to receive punishment for violating the Child Welfare Law.

254
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,260
Soo In, at that time, was only 15 years old.

255
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:49,620
For both of us, no matter what the situation, the child that needed protection, and

256
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,200
that's what we did.

257
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,640
Please stop.

258
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,960
If you can't stop, then I'll stop here.

259
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,130
What? You can't get your eyes off me because I'm so good looking?

260
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,720
I heard you went to Tongyeong yesterday.

261
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,810
You can't get in contact with her, right? She changed her number.

262
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:13,550
Really? I didn't know because I didn't call her.

263
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,510
Are you like this because you're mad I went to Tongyeong?

264
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,610
- No.
- Is it because you're envious?

265
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,770
- No.
- Then why do you keep looking at me?

266
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,050
What is it that you want to say?

267
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,050
Is she well?

268
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,830
Huh? Is she well?

269
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,640
Is she well?

270
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,230
Yeah, she's well.

271
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,570
Then that's good.

272
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,650
I knew she was going to be like that.

273
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:10,140
Why? You still can't believe me?

274
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,520
Then go to Love's House.

275
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:17,120
I heard that she went to Tongyeong for sure.

276
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:23,240
Our outcast came back from the dead, so we need to give her a big congratulatory party.

277
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:30,850
Are you crazy?

278
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,380
Hey! What are you doing?!

279
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:45,620
Kang So Young. Does it hurt since I stepped on yours?

280
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,700
You want to kill right now, right?

281
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,680
Yeah. I want to kill you.

282
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,980
When you stepped on my sister,

283
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,270
how do you think I would feel?

284
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,110
If you want to kill someone just when you step over their phone like this,

285
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,750
how do you think I would feel when I see you?

286
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:28,360
You... Aren't you going to move your foot?

287
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,430
Hey.

288
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,020
Who are you to keep telling me to come and go?

289
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,160
You know I don't talk with you.

290
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:22,090
If you don't hurry up and tell me, I'm going to leave.

291
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,730
Go Eun Byul.

292
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:34,680
How much do you know about Jung Soo In's incident?

293
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,720
Why are you curious about that?

294
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:46,250
Do you know how much Chairman is involved in that incident?

295
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,650
I also don't know in detail.

296
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:57,460
After Soo In ended up like that and we were waiting for the autopsy results,

297
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,750
the police said that the time of death was sometime in between 3:00pm and 5:00pm.

298
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,700
I heard there's no way it'd be after that time frame.

299
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:12,700
But when the autopsy results came out, the time of death was 7:30pm.

300
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:19,200
At Soo In's house, they believe she died during class time for sure,

301
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,630
but there was no evidence.

302
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,420
The autopsy report even says 7:30pm.

303
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,440
They didn't even accept the re-autopsy.

304
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,360
You're saying it's fabricated?

305
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,680
Since it's also a time the teacher's students aren't here,

306
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:44,370
they probably wanted to say it just happened

307
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,050
because she was here alone late into the night.

308
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,700
Alright.

309
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,750
You're here?

310
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,610
- Ahjumma, one udon please.
- Okay.

311
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,840
Why is your face like that?

312
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,380
Then what about you?

313
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,590
Is something wrong?

314
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,380
No.

315
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,480
Hey, should we both tell each other a concern?

316
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,070
If you want.

317
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:04,080
I have one disciple that I couldn't protect.

318
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:11,120
If I get the courage now to reveal the truth,

319
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,630
I'm going to end up taking another disciple's dad from him with my own hands.

320
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,700
It means in order to settle one child's wound,

321
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:29,090
I need to give another child a wound.

322
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:35,360
Being a teacher to both students,

323
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,720
what should I do?

324
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,930
It's the student father's fault from the beginning.

325
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,270
But, if it was me,

326
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,980
I would tell the disciple this.

327
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,190
"Convince the father one more time."

328
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:13,480
"Before it's too late, before they fall from another person's hands."

329
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:49,000
Father.

330
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,120
What is it?

331
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,760
Autopsy Report

332
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,840
What are you doing?!

333
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:24,020
There is nothing you know how to do and is this how you repay me for raising you?

334
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,630
Threatening your father by grabbing onto his weakness?!

335
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:34,290
Alright, what is it you want?

336
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:37,760
What are you trying to get from me by using this?

337
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,890
Tell me.

338
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,940
I don't know.

339
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:49,020
- What?
- I'm not sure, so I'm going to ask you.

340
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,900
I really hate you, Father.

341
00:29:53,900 --> 00:30:00,270
I thought the happiest person would be me if you crumbled and fell.

342
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:11,190
Even as I hold this in my hand, what is with this feeling that I cannot do anything?

343
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:19,750
Father, do you know?

344
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:39,570
This... Do what you want with it.

345
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:47,020
If that's what you choose, I will think of that as your response to my question.

346
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:17,610
After how many nights did I say I would be back?

347
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:21,390
14 nights!

348
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:24,780
Even if you want to see me, just wait a little.

349
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,700
Yes.

350
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,090
Unnie, go safely.

351
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:34,470
Noona, go safely!

352
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,770
I'll be going.

353
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,790
Unnie, bye.

354
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:48,000
- Bye!
- Bye, Noona!

355
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:54,120
I'll come again!

356
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,620
Chairman Gong Jae Ho!

357
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,710
- What's going on?
- Isn't that the chairman?

358
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:50,350
I guess he did something wrong...

359
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,150
This is Student Jung Soo In's autopsy report.

360
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,730
Predicted time of death: 4:30pm.

361
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,920
What is this?

362
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,810
All of the cover ups and false testimonies...

363
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,810
Are you saying you admit to all of them?

364
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:00,920
The person who should receive punishment for this is me.

365
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,780
The school trying to hide her death was by me.

366
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:09,580
Changing the time and reason for her death on the report

367
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,890
was also my doing alone.

368
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:18,450
Teacher Kim Joon Suk seemed to already know everything.

369
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:24,850
He was her homeroom teacher, so I don't think he can avoid the fact that staying silent is also a huge crime.

370
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:28,430
Teacher Kim Joon Suk did not stay silent.

371
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,420
Every time he tried to reveal the truth,

372
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:36,380
with all of my power and resources, I silenced him.

373
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:40,150
That's why I make this request.

374
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,650
Here are the drinks you ordered.

375
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,590
Yes.

376
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,140
Is your rehabilitation training going well?

377
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,890
Yeah. I'm sure it'll get better.

378
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:09,680
Han Yi Ahn. How much do you think you know about me?

379
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,720
I'm not sure.

380
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,590
When I was young, I thought I knew everything.

381
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:19,150
Honestly now, I'm not confident about that.

382
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:25,030
Before the whole school incident blew up, I didn't even know what was going on with you.

383
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:30,740
Same thing about Eun Bi?

384
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,280
Yeah.

385
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,420
Lee Eun Bi's lucky.

386
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,750
She now has a strong, reliable sister like you.

387
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,900
Hey.

388
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:54,200
Eun Bi, who tried to protect her outcast friend and becoming the outcast herself,

389
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,330
and me, who didn't know my friend was having a hard time and kept running away.

390
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,680
Who's do you think is more pitiful of the two?

391
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,470
Go Eun Byul, you must've really struggled a lot.

392
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,350
You're disappointed in me, right?

393
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:15,070
Hey. There should've been some sort of expectation for me to be disappointed.

394
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,110
Do you want to die?

395
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:24,860
Still, I feel a lot better telling you everything.

396
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:43,120
Mom. Did you not see the stuffed animal in my room?

397
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,080
The teddy bear?

398
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,810
Eun Byul put that in my room.

399
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,690
Why?

400
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:53,550
She sneezes a lot when there is fur flying in the air.

401
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,570
- When she sees a stuffed animal, she gets disgusted.
- Ah...

402
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,820
Who did you receive that as a gift from?

403
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,080
Oh, a friend.

404
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,760
I...

405
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,010
Do you think you could pass this on to Athlete Han Yi Ahn?

406
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,980
Athlete Han Yi Ahn?

407
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,190
What are you doing?

408
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,580
- Hey–
- Uhm–

409
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,900
You first.

410
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,750
I heard you went to Tongyeong.

411
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,200
Yeah.

412
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,490
I started rehabilitation during that time.

413
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,210
Hey, that was a good choice.

414
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:05,780
I did think that you'd be able to get back on your feet after you saw Unnie return.

415
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,500
I didn't know it'd be this quickly.

416
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,010
It's nothing like that.

417
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,710
It's okay.

418
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:19,670
Even though I wasn't able to do it, I still feel really good.

419
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:23,570
Now I don't have to worry about you anymore.

420
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,560
You have to return it to its true owner.

421
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,060
Since it's a promise you made, you keep it.

422
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,540
Han Yi Ahn, how is it now?

423
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,680
Has it become a bit more comfortable seeing my face now?

424
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:22,700
I know just because my sister came back doesn't mean my lies disappear, but...

425
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:28,660
Why? Are you really going to disappear?

426
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:34,940
Hey, even if I had a hard time because of you...

427
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,740
Alright. It's true I said some harsh words because I was so flustered,

428
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,020
but do you think I would really do that?

429
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:52,100
"If you leave, I'll feel good, relieved, and okay."

430
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,500
Would I really say that?

431
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,700
Thanks.

432
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,320
Then I won't avoid you now.

433
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,100
I can do that, right?

434
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,900
Yeah.

435
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,440
Sekang Foundation Chairman Gong Jae Ho Arrested

436
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,910
Lee Eun Bi

437
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,180
Lee Eun Bi

438
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,060
What, Lee Eun Bi?

439
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,660
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang, you...

440
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:30,940
Hello? Tae Kwang?

441
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,950
Hello?!

442
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,840
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang.

443
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,540
Tae Kwang, are you okay?

444
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:56,840
♫ When you have lost the way ♫

445
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:04,440
♫ I will shine a light ♫

00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:18,700

449

00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:41,940

456
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,640
Hello.

457
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:02,550
It seems like you're Tae Kwang's friend.

458
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:09,030
Yes, we're in the same class. My name is Lee Eun Bi.

459
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:14,630
Seeing that you're not surprised from seeing me, should I say

460
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:18,890
that you know a bit about Tae Kwang?

461
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:21,610
Yes.

462
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:26,970
He was a kid who always smiled

463
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,550
and was so bright.

464
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:36,530
When his dad and I became like this,

465
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:39,750
it hurt his heart a lot.

466
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,780
Since I make a living with this kind of life,

467
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:51,610
even though I see all of Tae Kwang's wounds and sadness ,

468
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:54,690
there were many times I ignored him.

469
00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:02,730
I didn't know how big of a scar it would leave on a child.

470
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:07,410
I'm a mom who doesn't even have the right to regret.

471
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,460
But on a day like today,

472
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:20,560
because there is a friend next to Tae Kwang,

473
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,180
my heart is more at ease.

474
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,100
Thank you.

475
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,800
Yes.

476
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,000
Oh, right.

477
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:48,880
Can you give this to Tae Kwang?

478
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,720
I'll leave it with you.

479
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:58,650
Alright, I understand.

480
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,740
Gong Tae Kwang, are you awake?

481
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,800
Do you feel better?

482
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:28,640
If you were that sick, you should have called someone.

483
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,260
You came even when I didn't call.

484
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,820
I'm not kidding.

485
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,460
You could have been in big trouble.

486
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,040
Did you worry about me?

487
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,420
Of course.

488
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:44,560
You're not even going to like me.

489
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,980
Are you allowed to do this?

490
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:54,630
So, should I leave?

491
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,850
No.

492
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:02,150
So,

493
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:07,770
thank you.

494
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:31,950
School 2015: Who Are You

495
00:49:56,270 --> 00:50:01,790
While cleaning her room after Soo In left like that,

496
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:03,690
that was her blog.

497
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:06,060
Let's try to get 1st place in math!
Raise your average score! Let's study hard! Hwaiting!
Aja aja ♥ hwaiting ♥

498
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:11,470
Your name was in all of her diary entries.

499
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:20,840
I think the times she spent with you were the happiest to her.

500
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:29,640
- What are you doing?
- Do you want to listen to this?

501
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:35,720
♫ During a whole day's worth of time ♫

502
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,480
♫ Given to us ♫

503
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:44,330
♫ What color could we paint it? ♫

504
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:54,690
♫ Na na na na na ♫

505
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:57,250
What is this?

506
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:01,060
♫ Don't worry ♫

507
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:06,390
♫ So what if you're a little awkward? Your gestures ♫

508
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:10,740
Hey. Let's go to the store.
♫ Are just beautiful ♫

509
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,150
Hey, what are you doing?

510
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:19,010
♫ During a whole day's worth of time given to us ♫

511
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,360
♫ What color should... ♫

512
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:27,120
Eun Byul, you can pretend you don't know me.

513
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:31,740
But you're still my one and only friend.

514
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:46,060
I think that's why I exaggerated more.

515
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:51,200
Because Soo In thought of you as her one and only friend.

516
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,410
If you had gone closer to her just a bit...

517
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:56,940
Because of that greed...

518
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:59,180
I'm sorry.

519
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:08,250
You must have had a hard time, too.

520
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:13,710
I'm sorry, Eun Byul.

521
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:41,650
Han Yi Ahn, I'm not the Eun Byul from long ago.

522
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:47,310
We've grown too much and a lot has changed.

523
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:10,610
But I wish you'll recover soon and return to the old you.

524
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:15,500
I'll also try to help you somehow.

525
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:18,890
Even if that means

526
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:24,070
I need to disappear.

527
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:56,100
What are you doing, Lee Eun Bi? Come out to eat.

528
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:02,030
Hey, I don't even have the strength to use my chopsticks since I'm sick.

529
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,520
Oh, this, this.

530
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,550
Hey, stop.

531
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:16,770
Stop.

532
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:19,960
Hey, but it looks like you.

533
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,480
Sorry. It looks tasty.

534
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:37,910
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang. Are you sure you don't have any appetite?

535
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:44,710
Is it because I was eating alone? I really had no appetite at home.

536
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,870
I'm not going to go to your house even if you faint, so you take care of your own body.

537
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,550
Geez.

538
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,720
Is no one home?

539
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,630
There is, the housekeeping ahjumma.

540
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,630
Anyone else?

541
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,490
There's no one.

542
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:12,450
You can't even peel that. Eat.

543
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:17,510
Thanks.

544
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:27,160
While you were sleeping at the hospital, your mom came by.

545
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:32,120
This.

546
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,390
Aren't you going to eat? Hurry up and eat.

547
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:09,810
♫ There’s an empty world deep in my heart, save me ♫

548
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:16,490
♫ I wanna reset, I wanna reset, I wanna reset ♫

549
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:24,190
♫ I won’t let you go ♫

550
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,450
Go in.

551
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:35,630
Gong Tae Kwang.

552
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:42,000
Should I tell you a method to pass time quicker when you're alone?

553
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:45,080
Is there such a thing?

554
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:49,160
There's only one way for me to pass time quicker.

555
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,980
- What is it?
- Being with you.

556
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:07,470
♫ My heart is thumping ♫

557
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:12,380
♫ I keep trembling ♫

558
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:17,410
♫ Every night, even when I can't sleep ♫

559
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:20,910
♫ It keeps growing ever more ♫

560
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:25,890
♫ I'm loving you, if only I can be with you  ♫

561
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:30,940
♫ I think of you, I say this because I'm in a good mood today ♫

562
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:37,380
♫ Baby for you, I dream in your embrace ♫

563
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:43,170
♫ You're my person  ♫

564
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:12,080
♫ I believe, I believe, I won’t fall down again ♫

565
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:18,740
♫ I believe, I believe, there’ll be no more tears ♫

566
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:28,410
♫ You know that tomorrow’s sun will rise ♫

567
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:29,370
♫ You never cry ♫
