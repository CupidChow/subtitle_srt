1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,600
Go in.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,620
Gong Tae Kwang.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,920
Should I tell you the way to pass time faster when you're alone?

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,040
There's no such thing.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,230
There's only one way for me to pass time faster.

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:25,990
What is it?

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,830
Being with you.

8
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:42,770
♫ I'm loving you ♫
♫ If I can be together with you ♫

9
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,770
♫ I think of you ♫
♫ It's such a good day for me ♫

10
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:54,230
♫ Baby for you ♫
♫ I dream in your embrace right now ♫

11
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,810
♫ You are my love ♫

12
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:05,290
♫ Sometimes I let go of your small hands in difficult times ♫

13
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:10,590
♫ I know, I know my heart ♫

14
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,630
♫ You are my everything ♫

15
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:31,030
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang, what was that?

16
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:38,770
Hey... I can't hear your voice at all right now.

17
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,150
Hey.

18
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,210
If you're going to hit me, hit me once.

19
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:01,730
If not, I can't bear to see your face, so go inside.

20
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,110
I'll leave first.

21
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,610
Hey.

22
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,590
I'm leaving.

23
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,030
Okay.

24
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,510
School 2015: Who Are You

25
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,730
Episode 15

26
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,070
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang.

27
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,430
You scared me.

28
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,810
Meet me on the rooftop.

29
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,010
Hey, what's wrong?

30
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,850
What is this? You coming up to the rooftop and everything.

31
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:30,130
Gong Tae Kwang, before it's too late, I have something to tell you.

32
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,070
What is it?

33
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,430
All this time I was too flustered

34
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,530
that I didn't even know my own heart.

35
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,590
I have something I couldn't answer to your question.

36
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,310
Tell me.

37
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,450
I guess I didn't hate Lee Eun Bi.

38
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,230
The reason I got mad wasn't because I hated her,

39
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,670
but it was because I liked her.

40
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,270
Hey, Han Yi Ahn.

41
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:58,590
- Whatever I saw or whatever I heard doesn't matter.
- Hey.

42
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,270
Whatever you say doesn't matter either.

43
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,160
So what? What are you saying?

44
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,980
It's not over yet.

45
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,330
Hey, Han Yi Ahn. I was like that from the start.

46
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:24,310
Nothing else mattered except for Lee Eun Bi.

47
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,030
So, what I'm saying is

48
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,070
that I'm just starting now.

49
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,950
Teacher Kim Joon Suk, that case already got covered and is finished.

50
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,510
But you're saying you want to submit a resignation letter?

51
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:55,410
Even school authorities are thinking of 3 months of reduced salary for you.

52
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,790
I don't have the confidence to teach the kids.

53
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,610
We're still in the middle of the school year, so I'm very sorry, Vice Principal.

54
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,770
If you really want that, I can't do anything.

55
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,650
Until we find a teacher to replace you,

56
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,240
please take care of it, so that the kids won't be disappointed.

57
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,250
Alright.

58
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,710
Good work for all these years.

59
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,350
Vice Principal, he came through the EPIK program
(English Program In Korea).

60
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,790
Native Speaker Teacher Assistant, Sam Hammington.

61
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,350
It's an honor to meet you. I'm Sam Hammington.

62
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,040
Nice to meet you. Welcome.

63
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,840
Vice Principal, I know how to speak Korean. Just talk comfortably.

64
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,240
He came from Australia, but he's good at speaking Korean.

65
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,300
You should have told me that earlier.

66
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,800
Anyways, work hard and you take care of him well.

67
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Alright, I understand.

68
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,520
Do your work.

69
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,500
I understand. Yes.

70
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,600
Where have I seen him?

71
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,100
Alright, listen to your teacher well,

72
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,220
and even if you can't understand him well, at least try to.

73
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,780
Okay, let's start today's class.

74
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,060
What were going to do in today's class is we're going to watch a few scenes from a movie

75
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,980
with the subtitles turned off, and then were going to discuss what we've seen in those scenes.

76
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,080
Hey, Teacher Sam, how old are you?

77
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,090
What are you going to do after finding out?

78
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,850
Oh!

79
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,790
Teacher Sam, this is my girlfriend.

80
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,900
Didn't ask, not curious.
(He used internet slang)

81
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,740
- Hul...
- Hulkki.
(Hull means "woah" and hulkki is cuter version of hul)

82
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,090
Daebak. Do you know kimchi?

83
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,970
Are you kidding with me?

84
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,510
You guys are really slow and dense.

85
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,150
Wow, that guy...

86
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,280
Gong Tae Kwang.

87
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,670
What?

88
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,150
You just seemed kind of disappointed.

89
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,330
Go away.

90
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,030
I had something I was curious about, but the answer is already out.

91
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,510
What are you talking about? What answer?

92
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,910
Gong Tae Kwang likes Lee Eun Bi?

93
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:36,190
Hey, why are you surprised? If you went all the way to Tongyeong even after seeing my face, it's obvious.

94
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,430
But, you...

95
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,420
What? Why are you looking at me like that again?

96
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,640
It's because I'm upset.

97
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,480
Imagine if a kid like you was following your younger sibling around.

98
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,500
What's wrong with me?

99
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,360
Anyways, Gong Tae Kwang, I know how you feel.

100
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,010
But what about Eun Bi? Did Eun Bi say she likes you?

101
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,610
Thank you.

102
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,900
Goodbye.

103
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,070
Come again.

104
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,220
You're better than me.

105
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,920
I was the part-time job queen in Tongyeong, Mom.

106
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,240
Oh, really?

107
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,120
But, is it okay for you to help me like this while you're looking for your transfer school?

108
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,180
What if your new school doesn't match your study pace?

109
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,020
That's why I'm planning on attending an academy. Is that okay?

110
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,420
What do you mean "is that okay"? Of course you need to.

111
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,260
I'll find out about an academy for you.

112
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,230
It's fine.

113
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,490
Welcome.

114
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,980
Gong Tae Kwang

115
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,890
What's up, Gong Tae Kwang?

116
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,500
You're here?

117
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,860
What is it that you want to say?

118
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,990
Hey, about yesterday... Were you really surpr–

119
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,460
- Gong Tae Kwang.
- Yeah?

120
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,120
I'm not sure.

121
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,580
Don't ask me stuff like that.

122
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,110
Then it's settled.

123
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,430
You didn't say sorry, so I won't say sorry either.

124
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:30,000
Hey. It seems like your face got red.

125
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,320
It didn't!

126
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,830
Hey!

127
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,390
Don't you know that I can't eat cucumbers?

128
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,270
Oh, it smells bad.

129
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,560
The food looks particularly yellow today.

130
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,700
If you gather people who are shameless and stubborn,

131
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,800
I never heard of anyone leaving me out of it.

132
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,550
They wouldn't be able to even squeak in front of our So Young.

133
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,050
Our Hae Na being stubborn is chic,

134
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,260
she's just a criminal.

135
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,680
Hey, look at her sitting still even as we're criticizing her.

136
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,070
Should we split them or not?

137
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,860
Hey, Go Eun Byul.

138
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,980
You think I'll crumble like this, right?

139
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,890
I know you are both alive and are playing with the kids.

140
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,490
You think you guys will be safe?

141
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,910
Kang So Young.

142
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,100
Look in the mirror. See what state your face is in right now.

143
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,420
Also, if you have time,

144
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,920
look into your heart as well.

145
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,540
What?

146
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,170
Just because you act strong and yell,

147
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,200
can it be covered?

148
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,510
I know because I've experienced it. Inside, you want to erase it,

149
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:49,800
and you want to run away from it like crazy, your heart.

150
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,010
Dad, should I get you some tea?

151
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,740
No thanks.

152
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,900
Then some fruits?

153
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,940
I don't need it.

154
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,580
Dad.

155
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,880
You know that girl in my class?

156
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,590
In Hugo's essay about Shakespeare, it says,

157
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,990
"The reason why the weeds spread everywhere

158
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,020
is because the wind is too soft."

159
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,840
Pardon?

160
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,680
Sloppy environments make weeds grow thick.

161
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,910
If you don't want get stepped on, there is only one way.

162
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,560
It's to step on it first.

163
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,740
No, I will just transfer...

164
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,800
Don't you know that my nomination is approaching?

165
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,890
My nerves are already on the edge because of your problem.

166
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:27,150
Don't talk about useless things, and for the time being,

167
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,590
live quietly or step on her first

168
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,440
and order her around quietly.

169
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,760
Do one of the two.

170
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,520
Hey, Lee Eun Bi!

171
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,180
Lee Eun Bi!

172
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,000
- Hey, give me your phone.
- What?

173
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,220
Hand it over, your phone.

174
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,640
Didn't we say we would meet each other comfortably?

175
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,670
Han Yi Ahn.

176
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,400
If we don't know each other's numbers, we can't meet comfortably.

177
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,870
It's very hard to meet then.

178
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,890
Gong Tae Kwang
Did you sleep well? Did you look into an academy?

179
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,600
What academy?

180
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,230
I have to match my studies before I transfer.

181
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,270
So I have to go register later.

182
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,150
Really?

183
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,310
- Should I go with you?
- What?

184
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,340
You can't.

185
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,200
Why not even "it's fine", but "you can't"?

186
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,970
Perhaps,

187
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,060
- did you promise to go with him?
- What?

188
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,260
Yeah.

189
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,680
Really?

190
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,700
That's good. I was thinking whether I should skip training for an hour or not.

191
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,200
I guess you're doing well with training.

192
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,230
Of course.

193
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,980
Lee Eun Bi.

194
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:27,060
You have to take responsibility for what you said, until I earn my gold medal.

195
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,080
What are you saying?

196
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,510
There's something like that.

197
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,920
Hurry up. We're going to be late.

198
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,950
Guys! I have something to say.

199
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,860
Our homeroom teacher...

200
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,170
I think he's quitting school.

201
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,470
Why? What? Why suddenly?

202
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,580
- Oh my!
- Why?

203
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,580
Hey, be quiet.

204
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,350
Is it because of the Jung Soo In incident?

205
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,970
Ah, he was the homeroom teacher of her class last year.

206
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,990
Is it because of that?

207
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,220
Until when is he coming?

208
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,200
Until a teacher to replace him is found.

209
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,350
What is this? I don't like changing teachers.

210
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,920
I know right?

211
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,390
So are you guys just going to let him leave?

212
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,500
You send me a text saying what? "Come to the rooftop"?

213
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,460
I texted "Come to rooftop, please." Did I text just "Come to the rooftop"?

214
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,520
Why did you call me?

215
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,180
Are you quitting school?

216
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,210
Gong Tae Kwang.

217
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,270
Do you know who I saw that started my dreams of becoming a teacher?

218
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,270
Who?

219
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,620
My homeroom teacher when I was in grade 11.

220
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,720
In order to find a runaway student, he spent all day and night running around, even to the countryside.

221
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,800
He was a passionate teacher.

222
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,760
He doesn't compare with me, who's trying to keep a safe distance with students.

223
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,760
He's cool.

224
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,770
Learn from him, that amazing teacher.

225
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,600
Do you know who he is?

226
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,370
He's your father.

227
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:16,010
After I met the chairman, he asked me a favor about you.

228
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,310
Forget about being a good teacher,

229
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,520
I don't know if I'm even a person on the straight path.

230
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:29,550
That's why I'm quitting. To think for myself.

231
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,160
Aish, seriously.

232
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,700
Then what about me?

233
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,980
Call me.

234
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,780
Whenever.

235
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,740
You little punk!

236
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,450
Why are you being like this? It doesn't suit you.

237
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,130
Ah, seriously...

238
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,890
Tell me. Why is my perfectly good car like this?

239
00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:01,530
Hey, look here. All I did was call you to move your car that's in front of someone else's store.

240
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,540
I didn't do this.

241
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,670
If it wasn't you, then who was it?

242
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,970
- Let's go talk at the police station, Ahjusshi.
- Just wait a minute.

243
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,530
- Let go and then let's talk.
- I said, let's go talk at the police station!

244
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,940
What are you...

245
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,040
Hey, hey, hey. Yi Ahn.

246
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,470
Hey, Yi Ahn!

247
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,670
Yi Ahn! Hey, punk! Hold back!

248
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,970
Don't be like this. Hold yourself back.

249
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:34,270
The holding cell? Go to the custody officer on first floor.

250
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,020
I said I'm not going to settle!

251
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,390
Ahjusshi, apologize on your knees first. Then I'll think about it.

252
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:30,580
Hey, hey, hey. Yi Ahn, sit down.

253
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,500
Look here, young'un. Let's settle on good terms.

254
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,340
There's nothing you did right either.

255
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,160
See, look at this. Why would I settle when he's coming out like this?!

256
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,260
These people! Be quiet!

257
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,440
Why are you just leaving after coming all the way here? You should go and see your father.

258
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,200
No.

259
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,640
The chairman is doing fine, so don't worry too much.

260
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,300
Please take care of him.

261
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,260
Okay.

262
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,160
Excuse me.

263
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:47,100
Could I get in on that too? I'm in the same class. My name is Gong Tae Kwang.

264
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,680
Chairman Gong Jae Ho.

265
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,960
Is your shoulder okay? Nothing hurts?

266
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,710
I'm okay.

267
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,910
Are you not hurt over here?

268
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,530
No, I don't feel it at all.

269
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,550
Let's go.

270
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,830
Huh?

271
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,230
Gong Tae Kwang

272
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,690
It's the same school.

273
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,230
Yi Ahn, is he your friend?

274
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,820
Yes.

275
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,320
Hello.

276
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:47,080
Wait a minute. Wow, you're really handsome as a chestnut!

277
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,120
Did you eat?

278
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,720
No.

279
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,400
That's perfect. We were about to eat. Come with us.

280
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,100
What?!

281
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,380
No, it's fine.

282
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,810
What do you mean "it's fine?" Come, we'll go together.

283
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:06,290
Hey, Yi Ahn. Let's go eat. I'm starving.

284
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,270
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

285
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,330
I dropped my phone.

286
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,250
Did you back up your data?

287
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,990
No. Please do it for me. Does it take a long time?

288
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,970
It depends on the situation. Do you have a lot of pictures or videos?

289
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:27,910
I have a lot of photos, and just a few videos...

290
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:35,480
Please save all the data, without leaving a single one out.

291
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:57,700
Aigoo, this kiddo. What kind of a man eats the rice so little at a time? Just put it all in and eat it.

292
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,300
Yes.

293
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,680
Eat a lot.

294
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,670
Aigoo, my kiddo. You eat well.

295
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,170
Want another dish? You have to eat a lot to gain strength so you can fight again.

296
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,770
Father, you're so...

297
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:19,590
I didn't do anything for you, but just because I'm your father, you come in with flying fists.

298
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,670
Thanks, son.

299
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,760
Hey, but an athlete like you

300
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,710
shouldn't get banged up like that. If you do that again next time, I'm going to punish you!

301
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,280
I don't care if I'm going to get punished. If the same thing happens next time, I'm going to do exactly the same thing.

302
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,650
What?

303
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,390
Aigoo, you kiddo.

304
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:51,750
Oh, by the way, why were you at the police station?

305
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,070
Did you cause an accident, too?

306
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:59,290
Usually, that's the case, but today...

307
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,910
It's nothing.

308
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:08,530
Oh. Okay. Eat a lot.

309
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,370
I ate well.

310
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:18,970
Okay. Come over our house sometime.

311
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,330
See ya.

312
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,470
Father, just a moment.

313
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,270
Okay.

314
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,790
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang.

315
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,670
What?

316
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:38,330
Are you going to ask if Lee Eun Bi's doing well again?

317
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,360
Are you okay?

318
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,760
Is what okay?

319
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,400
You! Are you okay?

320
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,760
What about me? Of course I'm okay.

321
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,180
- Hey.
- What?!

322
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,940
I told you. This is the beginning.

323
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,820
You're saying that again?

324
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,680
It's no fun since you already have a defeated expression on your face.

325
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,560
So...

326
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,240
Cheer up.

327
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,420
I'm going.

328
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,160
Legal Representative

329
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,840
Father

330
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,060
Father?

331
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,720
Father.

332
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,140
I'm home!

333
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:15,160
How was the academy? Did you like it?

334
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,860
Yeah. It's nice.

335
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,020
Where's Unnie?

336
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,490
In her room.

337
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,790
Eun Bi. I chose the school you're going to go to.

338
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,810
Really?

339
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,950
Here.

340
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,170
Victory High School

341
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:42,590
Unnie, isn't it uncomfortable sleeping on one bed with me?

342
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:47,670
Why would it be? Out of all the things I wanted to do with you,

343
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,070
one of them was chatting in bed with you like this.

344
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,910
Really?

345
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,670
Of course.

346
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:58,070
Unnie, you know what.

347
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,890
We chose the school I'm going to attend.

348
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:09,190
Really? You don't think you can go to Sekang High School with me?

349
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,830
Yeah...

350
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:19,530
But I really want to apologize properly to the kids for lying before I leave.

351
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,330
But you would be in an awkward situation...

352
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:30,050
No. The day you go to school, I'll have a fun day to myself.

353
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:35,890
Oh, by the way, sorry for moving your stuffed animal without your permission.

354
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,950
Who did you receive it from?

355
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,670
Huh?

356
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:46,170
Han Yi Ahn. At that time, he didn't know that I wasn't you.

357
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:52,750
If he knew it was me, he wouldn't have gotten a stuffed animal as a gift for me. He would've gotten hit.

358
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,250
Does Han Yi Ahn know that you don't like stuffed animals?

359
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,790
Of course.

360
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:02,290
Hey, let's sleep now.

361
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:23,720
Thankfully, I recovered 70% of the data.

362
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,400
Go Eun Byul, Lee Eun Bi.

363
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:37,610
Let's see how long you can

364
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,810
hold your neck up high and brag.

365
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,660
Hey, daebak, daebak.

366
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,110
The chairman's son goes to our school.

367
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,720
- What?
- What? Really?

368
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,910
What grade?

369
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,080
Hey, the chairman got arrested recently.

370
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,380
Wow, I wonder how he feels.

371
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,230
His father's name came up on the news in big letters that he's going to jail,

372
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,110
Gong Jae Ho.

373
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,760
- Gong?
- Gong?

374
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,200
No, no.

375
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,480
Then what is it? Does it mean he's Song Hee Young's son?

376
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,560
Hey, but isn't the chairman so two-faced?

377
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,660
Acting as if his teaching was so amazing in magazine articles.

378
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,410
Yeah, I don't like him.

379
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,530
- I don't care.
- I don't think that's it.

380
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,960
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang.

381
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,170
What is it?

382
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,490
Where are you going?

383
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,240
The restroom.

384
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,990
Wow, I almost peed myself.

385
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,120
Oh my.

386
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,780
I thought he was picking a fight.

387
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,520
You look so happy.

388
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,880
But, what are you looking at that you're so happy?

389
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,780
My son's letter.

390
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,360
He got first place again.

391
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,690
- Really?
- Really?

392
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,270
I don't know how I had this son when I'm a horrible father.

393
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:13,460
I feel so sorry. I wanted to take him off my family registry.

394
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,080
- Are you bragging right now?
- Yes.

395
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,480
I really hate you, Father.

396
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,990
When you lose everything and crumble and fall,

397
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,870
I thought the happiest person would be me,

398
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,280
but even while holding this in my hand,

399
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,250
what is this feeling of me not being able to do anything?

400
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,710
Do you know, Father?

401
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,430
Go Eun Byul, you're reading again?

402
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,360
Why are you asking when you can see?

403
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,970
Go Eun Byul, do you remember?

404
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:20,630
Long ago, I sat by you like this and waited until you finished your book.

405
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:24,100
After playing ball, you would ask, "Are you done reading?"

406
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,640
After play game of slap-match, you'd ask, "Are you done reading?"

407
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,690
You really annoyed me a lot.

408
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,520
Hey, do you know how bored I was?

409
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,750
Who's the one who stuck by even after I kept telling you to leave?

410
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,880
It's because I didn't want to leave.

411
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:46,470
You were shorter than me and couldn't study.

412
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,480
The Han Yi Ahn who used to cry whenever I screamed a little,

413
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,870
where did he go?

414
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,050
Yeah, what you're saying is all right.

415
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,620
We grew too much

416
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,780
and a lot changed.

417
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,760
Right?

418
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,110
Hey, Go Eun Byul.

419
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,380
I...

420
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,600
What?

421
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,790
Tell me.

422
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,690
I'm going to practice.

423
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,180
Jung Soo In

424
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,860
Soo In.

425
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,070
For coming so late,

426
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,480
I'm sorry

427
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:08,350
For pretending to not know you back then,

428
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,910
I'm also sorry.

429
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,990
But, I can come visit you

430
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,950
sometimes, right?

431
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,110
Since I'm your friend.

432
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,640
I heard you're quitting school.

433
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,930
Yes.

434
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,020
I don't think it's where I belong.

435
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,430
Then what are you going to do?

436
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:46,020
I suppose I have to become the person

437
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,880
who could be in that position again.

438
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,440
First of all,

439
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:12,050
I'm sorry for having to leave so suddenly like this.

440
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,890
And for not being able to stay with you until the end,

441
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,980
I feel so unsatisfied.

442
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,360
If I'm going to nag you one last time,

443
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,180
this time period you're passing through right now,

444
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:35,950
it's tiring and burdensome, and you're not going to know what's what.

445
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,410
But,

446
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,510
it's all okay.

447
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,370
Because all of you are only

448
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,820
18 years old.

449
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,570
That's all. Homeroom is over.

450
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,240
Attention.

451
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,400
Salute the teacher.

452
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,380
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

453
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,550
"Making a mistake is not what's shameful,

454
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:13,900
but not acknowledging your mistake is what's shameful."

455
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,930
I will remember your words well, Teacher.

456
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,130
- Teacher!
- Teacher!

457
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,890
Goodbye!

458
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,430
Farewell!

459
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:28,340
- Go back home safely!
- Farewell!

460
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,160
- I love you!
- I'm going to miss you!

461
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,360
Don't forget to take care of your meals!

462
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,560
Teacher, thank you for leading me away from a comfortable path to the right path. - Min Joon

463
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,430
Teacher, you'll see me on "Love on TV" show!! ^^
I'll visit you when I become an amazing celebrity.

464
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,460
Wait for me, teacher!!! - Song Joo

465
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,650
- Teacher! I have to tell you something!
- I love you!

466
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:49,820
Teacher, I love you.

467
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,550
Teacher, come visit sometimes!♡ Gi Tae said he would treat us all with bread~!! - Hyo Eun

468
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:56,200
- Please return!
- We'll listen well!

469
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,020
- Please don't go!
- Visit us!

470
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,430
Because of you, I studied hard!

471
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:05,910
I won't talk when you're teaching next time!

472
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,250
- Teacher, I love you!
- Get back safely!

473
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,980
Teacher, serious words don't fit you at all. - Yi Ahn

474
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,200
Now, I can call you Hyung, right? - Tae Kwang

475
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,620
What is this?

476
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,900
Go Eun Byul. I kept my promise.

477
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:01,910
This... When we were little,

478
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:05,750
when I get my first gold medal in the Intermediate competition, I promised to give it to you.

479
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,130
Really?

480
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,860
I am proud, Han Yi Ahn. You even remember that.

481
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,490
But, Go Eun Byul,

482
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,610
I

483
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:30,300
came to end it.

484
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,680
- With me?
- No.

485
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,650
For 10 years,

486
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,280
my one-sided love.

487
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,650
Hey, you can just end the one-sided love by yourself.

488
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:53,850
Everyone would probably tease about what a 6-year old toddler could know.

489
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,390
But, from then until now,

490
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,560
I liked you.

491
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,300
Han Yi Ahn,

492
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,620
I'm not the young Eun Byul anymore.

493
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,050
We've grown up too much, and

494
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,250
there are a lot of things that changed.

495
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:20,180
Whether you're just my friend or something more,

496
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,450
it's not like I haven't thought about it.

497
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,290
I know.

498
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:28,150
That you thought about that before.

499
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:32,690
That's why I was anticipating and

500
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,900
waiting for a long time.

501
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,790
But, Go Eun Byul,

502
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:42,480
before you thought about it with your head,

503
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,980
your heart

504
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:48,780
already knew.

505
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,080
You think so?

506
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,150
Han Yi Ahn,

507
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,030
after time passes,

508
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,740
there's a possibility that I might think that I have liked you a lot.

509
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,700
Why didn't I realize this sooner?

510
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,510
I might end up regretting it too late.

511
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:19,930
The fact that you, who looked at me for 10 years, might not be beside me anymore,

512
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:23,380
sometimes, suddenly,

513
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,010
even if I become too sad,

514
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,870
that's my share.

515
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:35,010
And your heart is yours.

516
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,420
Hey, Go Eun Byul,

517
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,430
I just said that I would end my one-sided love.

518
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,620
I'm not saying that I won't ever see you again.

519
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,290
Of course. Do you think I'm crazy?

520
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:51,990
Why would I not see you? You're really easy to make a slave of.

521
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,900
- Hey.
- What?

522
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,690
Aigoo, forget about it.

523
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,080
Move your hand!

524
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:03,180
Hey, is your shoulder okay?

525
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,220
It isn't this shoulder though.

526
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,710
You're gonna die.

527
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:40,600
Even if you don't believe it, I'm doing well in school and not causing trouble.

528
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,270
Alright.

529
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:47,340
You're a kid who does well by himself.

530
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:51,550
It's my fault for shaking you around and making you upset.

531
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:58,060
Maybe it's because I have a lot of time on my hands, but I'm starting to think a lot about life.

532
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:02,290
Eh, I didn't say that to hear you say that.

533
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:04,410
I'm just saying not to worry about me.

534
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,300
Your necktie looks good on you.

535
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:19,070
This

536
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:21,530
was a present from Mom.

537
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:23,880
Okay.

538
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,960
I don't know if you'll believe me again,

539
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,410
but a house without you

540
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,150
is very lonely.

541
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,860
For showing you this side of me...

542
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,950
I am embarrassed.

543
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:47,270
Before, I thought that you were embarrassing.

544
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,940
But now,

545
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,710
I'm relieved that my thoughts were wrong.

546
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,660
Tae Kwang,

547
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,500
I thought that I had a lot of things to protect and lived up to this point.

548
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,580
But at the last moment,

549
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:15,790
I thought that there was only one thing I have to protect.

550
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:22,740
That was you, Tae Kwang.

551
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:26,830
Visiting time has ended.

552
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:31,980
In the past, spending just 3 minutes with you was hard.

553
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,570
But now time is flying by so fast.

554
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,980
I'll be back.

555
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,450
Father.

556
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,500
Okay.

557
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,560
Tae Kwang,

558
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:17,440
I believed that I had a lot to protect.

559
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:20,880
But at the last moment,

560
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:26,900
I came to realize that there was only one thing I had to protect.

561
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:32,300
It was you, Tae Kwang.

562
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,770
Han Yi Ahn.

563
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:13,550
Are you coming home from the academy?

564
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:18,120
Nowadays, you aren't going on the morning exercises.

565
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,370
Because I always sleep in...

566
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,450
I was waiting for you though.

567
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,070
I can wait

568
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,900
for a longer time.

569
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,630
I have to get off.

570
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,860
Do you want to get off together?

571
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,020
Or,

572
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,980
do you want to stay together longer?

573
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:58,740
♫ There’s an empty world deep in my heart, save me ♫

574
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:05,470
♫ I wanna reset, I wanna reset, I wanna reset ♫

575
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:11,890
♫ I won’t let you go ♫

576
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:17,070
I'm going to school tomorrow.

577
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:19,090
To say my last goodbyes.

578
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:22,840
In the end,

579
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,600
you're going to a different school?

580
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,690
Yeah.

581
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:36,430
Tomorrow, for real, the name "Go Eun Byul" will be gone.

582
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:41,760
I don't like last goodbyes and all.

583
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:45,410
But it still turned out well.

584
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,930
You should start a new life.

585
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:51,820
Yeah...

586
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:59,140
While living as my sister,

587
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:04,310
I had a lot of things that I earned without effort.

588
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:06,140
What's that?

589
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:10,940
Mom, Teacher, and my friends' love.

590
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:15,970
Just because I was Go Eun Byul,

591
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,760
you too,

592
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,930
liked me.

593
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:34,190
Do you remember this place?

594
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:37,400
Of course, we came here often.

595
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,710
Yeah.

596
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,830
But,

597
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,100
it's my first time coming here

598
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,890
with Lee Eun Bi.

599
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:57,150
The food I eat with Lee Eun Bi for the first time

600
00:50:57,150 --> 00:51:00,030
and the first song I listen to with Lee Eun Bi.

601
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:11,010
From now on, it's going to be like that.

602
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,310
So,

603
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:18,360
in order to have a fresh start,

604
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,230
can you not leave?

605
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,100
Hey, Han Yi Ahn.

606
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:34,940
I can't go to you.

607
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:37,590
I can't go,

608
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:42,000
so can't you come?

609
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,180
If not,

610
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,650
just like when you called me,

611
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:52,550
can I go to you one more time?

612
00:51:53,910 --> 00:52:02,870
♫ Do you remember the day we first met ♫

613
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:08,630
♫ When you call, wherever it is ♫

614
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:16,030
♫ I ran out of breath, running to where you were ♫

615
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:27,100
♫ I’ll remember, I missed you so much, everything about you ♫

616
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:36,090
♫ Tonight, listen to my unfinished stories, my love ♫

617
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,110
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang.

618
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:13,300
What are you doing?

619
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:16,880
I'm right. It's Lee Eun Bi.

620
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,630
Hey, what brings you here?

621
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,840
I came to give my final greetings.

622
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,600
I specially asked my sister.

623
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,360
Do that. Even if you do that, you're not going to get further than Tongyeong.

624
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,460
Let's go.

625
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,310
Hey.

626
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,650
Do you want to eat black bean noodles?

627
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:56,280
Oh, it's going to be vacation soon.

628
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,200
- What are you going to do during break?
- I need to study.

629
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,730
Hey, what do you mean study? Let's all go on a trip together.

630
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:04,230
- Oh my.
- You like it, right? You like it?

631
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:06,400
- Call?
- Call.

632
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:09,010
- Call?
- How come you're the only one not answering?

633
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:10,990
What is this? You're trying to study by yourself.

634
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:14,250
- Really? Hurry up and answer.
- Come with us.

635
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:16,960
Alright. Let's go.

636
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,180
- She said she's going. You said you are.
- You said you're going.

637
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:23,220
Then you bring gimbab, I'll bring fried tofu rice balls, and what will you bring?

638
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:24,380
For me, pig's feet.

639
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:25,880
- Pig's feet?
Hey, pig's feet, seriously?

640
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,420
It's going to be good, right? Where should we go?

641
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,640
- Where should we go?
- Where should we go? The beach?

642
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,870
Do you have anywhere you want to go?

643
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:45,920
Hey, Go Eun Byul, I guess you're busy.

644
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,230
What are you doing after putting Lee Eun Bi in school?

645
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:51,480
Kang So Young, why?

646
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,500
Are you bored since I'm gone?

647
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,780
Yeah, I'm bored.

648
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,930
So, I planned a small event.

649
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,540
If you're curious, do you want to come?

650
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,550
I'm sorry, I'm not someone so free.

651
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:10,490
That's a pity.

652
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:15,720
I have a really interesting video that I shot in Tongyeong.

653
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:22,180
Do you know who the main character of it is?

654
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:05,070
I...

655
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,910
Guys.

656
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:17,820
Hey, Eun Byul what are you doing standing there?

657
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,660
Why, are you going to sing a song?

658
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:24,100
I guess not. Stop it.

659
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:53,730
I...

660
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,900
I have something to tell you guys.

661
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,670
Actually...

662
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,880
We've finally gathered at one spot.

663
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:03,910
I told you didn't I?

664
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:06,220
Tongyeong's Lee Eun Bi

665
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:08,580
isn't dead.
