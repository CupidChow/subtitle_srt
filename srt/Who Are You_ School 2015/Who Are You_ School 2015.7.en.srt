1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,770
Look at it properly.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,030
Lee Eun Bi's handwriting, from Tongyeong, and Go Eun Byul's handwriting.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,270
It's totally the same, right?

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,780
I'm thinking of asking my dad to get it examined.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,120
Should I, also, tell you a secret?

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,350
My name is Go Eun Byul.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,330
Don't trust anything I say.

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:30,580
Since it's like this, like you said, maybe we should start revealing things.

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,540
Right?

10
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,910
That way, it'll be fair.

11
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,770
Alright, do it. I'm also really curious.

12
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:52,490
But, when both of you reveal, who would it hurt more?

13
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,170
Hey! Gong Tae Kwang!

14
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,080
Why? You don't have any confidence?

15
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,660
Then, you also be careful until the results come out.

16
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,710
Go Eun Byul, let's skip class.

17
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,150
Hey, hey, why are you doing this?

18
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,370
♫  There’s an empty world deep  ♫

19
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,680
♫  in my heart, save me  ♫

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,090
♫  I wanna reset  ♫
♫  I wanna reset  ♫

21
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,310
♫  I wanna reset  ♫

22
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,650
♫  Lonely eyes trapped in darkness  ♫

23
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,890
♫  Is there anyone to hold my hand?  ♫

24
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,290
♫  I wanna reset  ♫
♫  I wanna reset  ♫

25
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,550
♫  I wanna reset  ♫

26
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:11,680
♫  I won't let you go  ♫

27
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,170
♫  I won't let you go  ♫

28
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,250
Hey!

29
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,230
Can't there be at least one person?

30
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,370
A person to call you by your real name.

31
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,210
That person...

32
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,250
Can't I be the one?

33
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,590
School 2015: Who Are You

34
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,290
Episode 7

35
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,680
Hey, I talked with Kang So Young just now, and it's not Kang So Young.

36
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,760
Kang So Young is from the school next door and she followed her dad's work into Seoul.

37
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,400
You guys don't need to make false rumors.

38
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,450
Especially you, Sung Yoon Jae! You're dead!

39
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,850
She says she isn't. She says she isn't.

40
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,420
What is my real name?

41
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,720
You said you would call my name.

42
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,460
What is my real name?

43
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,370
Go Eun Byul.

44
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,870
You're Go Eun Byul.

45
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:20,660
So please act like Go Eun Byul.

46
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,440
I don't really know why but

47
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,210
I really hate seeing you shrivel up in front of Kang So Young.

48
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,650
So I told you not to worry about my business.

49
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,820
Then make it so I won't have to worry.

50
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,470
Step down on her so she doesn't investigate behind your back.

51
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,060
Because you're Go Eun Byul.

52
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,360
Kang So Young already figured out that your and Lee Eun Bi's handwritings are the same.

53
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,870
Until when will you just go around saying "I'm not (Lee Eun Bi)?"

54
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,640
That's why, I will help you.

55
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,260
So you can live as Go Eun Byul.

56
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,500
It's "m." So what is "k?" I made a mistake.

57
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,350
Sorry.

58
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:37,530
Hey Gong Tae Kwang. This is a warning. Be on time to class.

59
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,830
Yeah, yeah.

60
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,910
Weird psycho.

61
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:55,090
Now this is your math performance assessment results.

62
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,590
It must've been hard since there's only one person that got 100%.

63
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:04,670
I'll leave it here. So check it and I hope for the best for the other performance assessments.

64
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,270
You got it?

65
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,730
Yes!

66
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,270
I'm leaving.

67
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,740
Goodbye.

68
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,050
It's not Park Min Joon, but Kang So Young?

69
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,910
Look at Go Eun Byul's grades.

70
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,430
It looked like Go Eun Byul didn't have a problem with studying. I guess she does. She's done for.

71
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,770
- She's totally ruined.
- Let's go.

72
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,030
Aigoo.

73
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,120
Move out of the way.

74
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,240
Min Joon, are you okay?

75
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,460
Yeah, I'm okay.

76
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,350
Yes–

77
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,180
Why are you here already?

78
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,660
Are you hurt somewhere?

79
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,640
I wasn't feeling good so I left early.

80
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,400
And not because something happened at school?

81
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,120
Yeah.

82
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,240
Should we go to the hospital?

83
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,120
It's not to that extent.

84
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,380
Your face doesn't look too good.

85
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,500
Then you should have just gone home and rested. Why did you come here?

86
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,450
I'll just stay by your side for a little bit and go. Then I will get better I think.

87
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,180
Eun Byul!

88
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,250
You're Eun Byul, right?

89
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,850
I'm Soo In's mother.

90
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,580
Hello.

91
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,980
Yes.

92
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,300
What brings you here...?

93
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,960
I stopped by to buy some things for my daughter.

94
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,380
H...Hello.

95
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,550
Yes, Eun Byul.

96
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:15,570
You said you weren't feeling well. Hurry up and go home.

97
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,490
Yeah.

98
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,840
Goodbye, Eun Byul.

99
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,780
Hey!

100
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,460
Where did you go?

101
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,660
What does it matter to you?

102
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,460
I'm asking why you're curious about that?

103
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,730
Listen to the lecture.

104
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,270
Are you worrying for me right now?

105
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,650
Yeah. I'm totally worried.

106
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,270
So do well.

107
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,370
What the heck?

108
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,640
I told you to tell me first if something happens!

109
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,880
What do you have to hide from even me?

110
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,480
That our relationship would change with just a few words,

111
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,960
is that all you and I amount to?

112
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,570
Go Eun Byul

113
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,950
Han Yi Ahn, there are things that I can't tell you,

114
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,920
things I don't want to tell you,

115
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,870
and things I don't want you to find out.

116
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,940
So please, don't ask me anything!

117
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,320
♫ When you feel that no one is beside you ♫

118
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:41,500
♫ Remember that you're not alone ♫

119
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,110
-What are you doing?
-Let's go.

120
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,930
How can you forget everything without even leaving a single thing?

121
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,760
Did you not want to remember me?

122
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:03,000
♫ Without a word, I'll hug you, I'll listen to you ♫

123
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,930
♫ Turn around, I'll be right there ♫

124
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:16,000
♫ I'll wipe away all your tears ♫

125
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,530
♫ Even all your loneliness ♫

126
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,680
Hey, Han Yi Ahn!

127
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,290
What?

128
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,320
My...

129
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,230
bicycle chain fell off.

130
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,050
So what.

131
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,630
I'm saying that my bicycle chain fell off!

132
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,290
So?

133
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,250
I...can't go to you.

134
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,250
Since I can't go,

135
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,350
can't you come to me?

136
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:13,810
♫ So that my wish can reach you ♫

137
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:21,570
♫ The closed door is opening slowly now ♫

138
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:29,300
♫ I cry from my wounded heart and sometimes get exhausted ♫

139
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,800
Hey, why are you crying? Are you crying because your chain is stuck?

140
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,800
That's right. I'm crying because of my bicycle.

141
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,460
Aigoo. Go Eun Byul, when will you grow up?

142
00:14:48,650 --> 00:15:01,250
♫  I pray today as well ♫

143
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,190
Is it delicious?

144
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,380
No, it doesn't taste that good.

145
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,100
It's not good, but you're eating this well?

146
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,190
I'm just forcing myself to eat it because I'm hungry.

147
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,540
You, you're trying to be sneaky and move on like nothing is wrong.

148
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,790
If you're stressed, don't just make a fuss, and tell me.

149
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,060
Because that's like Go Eun Byul.

150
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,300
Everything? You can understand it all?

151
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,080
Yeah, everything. All of it.

152
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,810
We're going to be late for school. Let's go.

153
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,420
I want to be late though.

154
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,410
Then you do that.

155
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,820
Let's go together!

156
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,060
Go Eun Byul

157
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,670
I don't know what you heard from your little sister but,

158
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,700
if you think about it, I'm more of a victim.

159
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,630
Our outcast, you haven't changed a bit.

160
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:29,200
Hey, Lee Eun Bi. It's been a while.

161
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,750
Hey, do you know what I went through at Tongyeong because of you?

162
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,940
Lee Eun Bi

163
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,730
Everything? You can understand it all?

164
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,260
Yeah, everything. All of it.

165
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,420
So, act like Go Eun Byul.

166
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,680
Instead of acting like you did something wrong.

167
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,860
Go Eun Byul

168
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:47,050
♫  There’s an empty world deep in my heart, save me ♫

169
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:53,660
♫  I wanna reset , I wanna reset , I wanna reset ♫

170
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:58,820
♫  Lonely eyes trapped in darkness, is there anyone to hold my hand? ♫

171
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,040
♫  I wanna reset , I wanna reset , I wanna reset ♫

172
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,040
♫  I wanna reset , I wanna reset , I wanna reset ♫

173
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:14,000
♫  I won't let you go  ♫

174
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
♫  I won't let you go  ♫

175
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,010
Hello Go Eun Byul.

176
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,360
You were absent yesterday.

177
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,070
Were you really sick?

178
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:44,260
Or did you run away after listening to what Gong Tae Kwang said?

179
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,980
What did he say?

180
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,330
Saying it in any place like this,

181
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,260
are you okay with it?

182
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,110
Kang So Young.

183
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,390
Follow me.

184
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,870
Ah, my legs are killing me.

185
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,290
You said you were really surprised yesterday.

186
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,360
Are you talking about the newspaper article?

187
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,250
Surprised? When Lee Bun Bi is alive and well.

188
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,920
Are you not scared of me?

189
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,650
Scared?

190
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:40,730
Wow, our outcast who used to tremble at the sight of me, has grown a lot.

191
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,650
Such a pity.

192
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:53,480
Of all the schools you could have attended, why did it have to be Sekang High?

193
00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:00,230
If you hadn't met me, like nothing had happened at all,

194
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,940
you could have started anew.

195
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:07,650
Don't act all tough.

196
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,310
It's hard to watch since it's so unfitting of you.

197
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:17,570
On the day I first transferred here, the moment I looked into your eyes I knew.

198
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:25,040
The expression that said "I'm totally ruined."

199
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:33,070
So you're going to examine the handwritings?

200
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:39,830
No matter what you say,

201
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:45,450
I have the confidence to make no one believe you.

202
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:51,130
Will you be okay? With just that?

203
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:00,690
It must be tiring for you if you get kicked out again and have to transfer.

204
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,870
Ah, I guess it wouldn't be transferring.

205
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,270
If what you did to my little sister is revealed,

206
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:14,190
it's not school, but another place you'll have to go.

207
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,380
You know where it is without me having to say it, right?

208
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:24,590
Where is that? Where is it?

209
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,290
If you can do anything, then try it.

210
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,370
Try it!

211
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,180
My little sister might have not done anything when she was bullied, but

212
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:40,160
not me. You saw me wrong.

213
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,620
Who saw who wrong,

214
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,410
I guess we'll know soon.

215
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,360
How is school?

216
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,380
It's good.

217
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,580
Except for one thing.

218
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,540
What is that?

219
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,000
You know the girl from Tongyeong,

220
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,070
from the Love House?

221
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,290
Are you talking about the dead girl?

222
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,980
Yes. Lee Eun Bi.

223
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:04,940
In our class there is a girl that looks exactly like her.

224
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,160
Oh my!

225
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,900
She said she was her older twin sister that was separated from her,

226
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,260
but something's weird.

227
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,420
Look at this.

228
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,460
It's the same, right? It looks like Lee Eun Bi is alive.

229
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,840
Saying such ridiculous things.

230
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,530
I'm sure of it, Dad.

231
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:30,660
Dad, can you please get it examined?

232
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:47,630
Honey! You didn't even listen to the child to the end.

233
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,880
You... I left the status I built and worked hard for throughout 10 years.

234
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,100
Did you forget the reason why we moved to Seoul?

235
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,950
I know. I know, so

236
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,200
I am trying to clear my name as a suspect of killing a friend.

237
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,740
No matter what anybody says, the case ended with her being the perpetrator,

238
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,550
while you are the victim.

239
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,420
Instead of stirring up things, just study.

240
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,780
Even so, the rumors–

241
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,970
What strength does that rumor have? It shouldn't last more than one or two years.

242
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:25,240
Instead of looking weak, and talked about, forget about yourself.

243
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,290
-She killed her, then?
-Daebak.

244
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,690
Yeah, they say she did.

245
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,930
The girl was getting bullied and committed suicide.

246
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,660
She died?

247
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,290
Murder is too much.

248
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,710
Kang So Young didn't kill her.

249
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:07,130
If she died because of Kang So Young, that's murder.

250
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:19,290
Lee Eun Bi, while being alive and well, you make me like this?

251
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,670
I...won't ever give up.

252
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,260
2015 Grade 11 Semester 1 - Math Performance Assessment

253
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,820
I asked Professor Kim for a pre-test.

254
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,330
I already checked it. It's true that I made a mistake.

255
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,390
Is that so?

256
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:54,310
Yes, the answer was right, but I drew the graph a bit incorrectly so I think points were taken off.

257
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,130
Why did you make that kind of a mistake?

258
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:00,750
Don't you get frustrated when you do well on the writing portion but get points off for performance?

259
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,240
Mom, it's just .5 points.

260
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:08,270
Son, don't look a .5 like it's funny. Even a .1 can split your chance.

261
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,650
Son, you understand what your mom does for living, right?

262
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:18,410
How can I teach others to win when I have a losing son, huh?

263
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:23,090
Would people believe in the success tips taught by a mother who has a failing son?

264
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,690
I don't fail.

265
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,910
Of course.

266
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,640
Shall we go out and eat now? Hurry up and come out.

267
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,360
Yes.

268
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:42,010
That's right. How much did Kang So Young get?

269
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,230
I don't really know.

270
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:08,110
My wallet. Aish.

271
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:09,690
Hey, Mi Suk.

272
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,470
Student, you're not gonna swipe your card?

273
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,770
Ah, the kid I know has it, please wait a second.

274
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,170
- Hey!
- Two people, please.

275
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,850
Me?

276
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,060
Oh, you came?

277
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,010
Thank you.

278
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,900
Since we are thankful, can I get your number?

279
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,990
I'll repay you.

280
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:12,470
You know the transfer student, right? Her mom is coming soon.

281
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:15,110
Ah, that kid named Kang So Young?

282
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,030
Yes.

283
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:21,590
I heard that she's the only student that got a perfect score on her math performance assessment.

284
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:25,010
Oh my God, when I see students like that, Gangnam and wherever,

285
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,250
there must be people that are separately better.

286
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,290
Hello, I am So Young's Mom.

287
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,910
Ah, hello.

288
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,810
Yeah.

289
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,610
I am Min Joon's Mom.

290
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,810
Yeah.

291
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,890
Please take a seat.

292
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:01,560
I heard you were really busy, so I'll get straight to the point.

293
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,580
I understand that my daughter will go through the level test but,

294
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,830
I brought it so you can reference it.

295
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:13,050
Oh my, oh my, what in the world.

296
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,550
She is first class in all subjects.

297
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:19,150
Oh my, take a look at this.

298
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,490
Don't make such a fuss.

299
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:30,530
May 2014 National Academic Assessment - Grade Report

300
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,810
It's excellent.

301
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,330
But, it's full right now.

302
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,170
Can't one more fit...?

303
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,640
Why?

304
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,940
Is it because you're afraid that if someone with better grades than Min Joon comes in, his rank will drop?

305
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:02,200
Of course not.

306
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,640
If it's a misunderstanding, I apologize. I heard that piggy moms

307
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,080
only make teams with those whose grades are a tad bit lower than their own children.

308
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,780
Oh my, really?

309
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,840
No, I'm not saying that Min Joon's mom is like that.

310
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,640
Well, it could totally be a misunderstanding since you don't know the atmosphere here.

311
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,980
What do you mean I don't know? My So Young had a famous tutor

312
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,170
fix her study habits steadily even back in Tongyeong.

313
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:39,910
You guys know the English performance assessment is about making a Tongyeong tourism brochure, right?

314
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,730
-Ah...
-Dang it.

315
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:46,610
Quiet! You guys went on a field trip there so it's not hard.

316
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:52,660
I have divided you guys into teams of 3. I hope you guys bring great results while working together. Class President?

317
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,570
Check it individually. That is all.

318
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,560
-Let me see.
-Look, look!

319
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,350
Oh?

320
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:06,470
Ah, why did it have to be this team... Dang it.

321
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,620
What about you?

322
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,240
Is the English teacher even willing to give us points or not?

323
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,460
What are you going to do? Let's first decide on a team name.

324
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,300
"No Dream No Hope Team".

325
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,150
Team name, my ass. I'm dying. There's no answer for our team. "No Answer Team"?

326
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,850
It's "Impossible Team".

327
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:30,550
(They were trying to word play with the ending sound "Jo" which sounds like the word "team".)

328
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,530
Hey Kwon Gi Tae, you went on the school trip.

329
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:38,090
Pictures? You have pictures, right?

330
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,960
Of course. I have tons.

331
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,940
Here.

332
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,830
Hey. How can you even check if it was Tongyeong or Youngtong with these pictures?

333
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,850
Forget it. We're "Screwed Up Team".

334
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:05,060
Actually, don't do that. Let's just all pitch in $50. I'm going to outsource it.

335
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,070
-Deal.
-Deal.

336
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,060
I have practice so I'll be leaving first.

337
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,610
What about the money?

338
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:12,220
"No Money Team."

339
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:16,300
"Card works, Team?"
 (Word play)

340
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,220
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang!

341
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,450
Don't give trouble to Go Eun Byul.

342
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,910
Me?

343
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,910
And not you?

344
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,830
Don't cause any accidents to hurt her either.

345
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,960
- Hey! That–
- See you.

346
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,520
Hey! Athlete Han Yi Ahn!

347
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:54,060
I'm not going to trouble Go Eun Byul and will never hurt her.

348
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,390
So mind your own business.

349
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:19,190
Hey, look at this! In this picture, only you're not here.

350
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:22,820
This is when you disappeared suddenly. You know how worried we were?

351
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,430
-Right
-Really?

352
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:37,090
Come closer! Closer!

353
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,460
Together! Ready?

354
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,100
Oh right. The scar on your neck that I told you about,

355
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,530
seems like you got it during the trip just before you met me.

356
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,440
I don't know. Then Go Eun Byul can take the Miruk Mountains,

357
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,670
Hyo Eun can do the Dongpirang Town. I'll do the sea tunnel. All good?

358
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:11,400
Sure. Let's begin with the introduction and edit another time.

359
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,500
Go Eun Byul.

360
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,720
Go Eun Byul, focus.

361
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,230
Oh, what did you say?

362
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:30,530
I want to check my call records from a month ago.

363
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:36,680
Yes, you can check at the store or online.

364
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,830
2015, April 27th.

365
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,090
9:45 pm.

366
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,080
Hello?

367
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,590
Hello?

368
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,170
Is this Eun Byul?

369
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,100
-Lipgloss? This one?

370
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,510
- Should I try it on?
- Should I do it for you?

371
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,090
-I can't put it on.

372
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,840
Is this good?

373
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,110
Why isn't Cha Song Joo coming?

374
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:07,390
How do I know that? If you're curious, call her then.

375
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:12,180
Hey, sorry, sorry, I'm a bit late.

376
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,600
Yeah.

377
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,430
- What about your tutoring? Did it end?
- Yeah.

378
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:23,080
Lee Shi Jin.. What's wrong? Did something bad happen?

379
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,260
I don't have time, so let's hurry and decide our parts.

380
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,020
Those are pictures from our trip.

381
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:36,810
Yeah, that's right. Only our Eun Byul is not in this picture.

382
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:42,160
Ah, if only we dragged her out of the bathroom, she wouldn't have gone missing.

383
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,120
- Bathroom?
- Yeah.

384
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,400
Ah, you called for her that time.

385
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,290
The bathroom before we took the group picture?

386
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,480
Yeah, there.

387
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,780
Hey, Lee Shi Jin, Cha Song Joo,

388
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,420
What?

389
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,420
We can't take the group picture. Hurry and come.

390
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,070
Okay.

391
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,740
- Let's go.
- Okay.

392
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,590
- But, Lee Shi Jin.
- Yeah?

393
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:22,280
You didn't hear a scream after you came out of the bathroom?

394
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,510
A scream?

395
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,680
What does that mean?

396
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:34,690
Hey, Lee Shi Jin, what happened when you went back to the bathroom by yourself for your pouch?

397
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:41,000
Huh? Why aren't you saying anything? What is it?

398
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,030
Seriously, something is off.

399
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:52,040
What do you mean something is off? What are you imagining right now?

400
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,930
Are you saying I did something bad to Eun Byul?

401
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:59,300
No, it's just that you can say that she was fighting with a man just fine,

402
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,170
but why aren't you saying anything about what happened in the bathroom?

403
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,780
If there is something weird, you should've told me or

404
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,860
you should've brought out Eun Byul.

405
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:17,940
Ah, I forgot my pouch in the bathroom. Wait a sec.

406
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,840
What's this? You're normally on top of things. Go get it.

407
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:46,930
It's you again? Until when are you going to keep doing this?

408
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,880
Eun Byul...

409
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,890
Is she talking on the phone?

410
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,430
Yeah, I knew something was off, but

411
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:20,120
when I called for her, she didn't respond.

412
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,110
It's just that since Eun Byul was in a bad mood since the day before

413
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:27,380
I just thought she was fighting with someone on the phone,
and I thought probably nothing was wrong.

414
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,420
Hey, does that even make sense?

415
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,070
During our trip, I liked it when it was just us two so,

416
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,920
I acted like nothing was wrong. That's the truth.

417
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,000
- Hey,
- But, I...

418
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,510
I was so sad and regretful after Eun Byul disappeared. Were you the only one in pain?

419
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,980
I had more of a tough time!

420
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,740
Shi Jin...

421
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,770
You don't even know anything.

422
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:06,790
I was surprised because you suddenly called me.

423
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:11,900
Sorry, I had something to ask you real quick.

424
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,290
What is it?

425
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:20,350
By chance, did you call me the night we went on my school trip?

426
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,100
Do you remember?

427
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:32,400
You met me that night.

428
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,830
Daebak! I won!

429
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:38,650
-Dang it.
-Now you have to get it.

430
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,850
It's not even a joke.

431
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,250
Okay, okay.

432
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,670
Yun Mi Joo

433
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:04,890
This... is you, right?

434
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,670
Just because it's in the past, it doesn't mean it didn't happen.

435
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,170
Jung Soo In

436
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:14,330
Look at it carefully. Soo In sent it.

437
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:21,050
Exactly. Are you the one sending weird messages under Jung Soo In's name?

438
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:28,910
Why? Is there something you feel guilty about?

439
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:31,890
So why did you do something this scary?

440
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:36,290
You have Soo In's cell phone, right?

441
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,430
Give it. Where is it?

442
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,630
Where is it?!

443
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:44,270
What are you doing? It's not me! I'm not doing it!

444
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,630
Where is Soo In's cell phone?

445
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,790
If you keep this up, I'll die too!

446
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:06,890
I received that message too.

447
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,490
Soo In

448
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,550
did send it.

449
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:17,410
Are you crazy?

450
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,990
How does a dead girl send a message?

451
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,890
She keeps

452
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,750
appearing.

453
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:36,010
She appears every day.

454
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:38,970
I'm scared to death,

455
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:42,930
but I can't tell her to stop.

456
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:47,310
Because to Soo In...

457
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,970
I feel so sorry.

458
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:09,630
Soo In... Why.... How did she die?

459
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,150
I don't know either.

460
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,210
One day at school,

461
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:21,250
I just heard that Soo In had died the night before.

462
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:29,650
What kind of relationship did I have with Soo In?

463
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:36,990
Why was I distressed to the point of getting haunted by visions?

464
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:42,750
From what I know,

465
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:49,690
it might not be as much as me, but you hated Jung Soo In as well.

466
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:01,910
"Eun Byul... It's okay if you ignore me. You're still my only friend."

467
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,810
Oh.

468
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:38,030
Mom. Can I sleep with you today?

469
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:40,850
Of course. Come here.

470
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:55,850
Mom. You know...

471
00:44:55,850 --> 00:45:00,690
Yeah. What is it? Tell me.

472
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:12,150
It's nothing. If I'm next to you, I think I can sleep well.

473
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:34,950
School 2015: Who Are You

474
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:39,870
- Hello, Teacher.
- Oh, hello.

475
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,770
Hello!

476
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:45,110
Stop!

477
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:50,170
Come.

478
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:58,550
I said that if you wear just a shirt, it's against morals, right?

479
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:04,190
More, more, more, more.

480
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:07,450
More, more, more–

481
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:12,370
You cut it all off, so there's nothing to pull down!

482
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:15,790
Teacher, did you have a blind date yesterday?

483
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:17,470
It didn't go well?

484
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:21,310
What? Don't change the subject!

485
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,550
Hello!

486
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:34,390
Who– Who are you?

487
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:38,250
I'm the new student teacher, Jung Min Young.

488
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:46,890
Teacher, even on your first day at school, you forgot your pants.

489
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:48,750
Sorry?

490
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:58,010
Why are you scolding her? We don't live in that kind of era now.

491
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:02,370
Let's go. Come over here.

492
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:14,570
Everyone!

493
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:16,690
I met a girl!

494
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:19,630
Whoo!

495
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:21,510
Sit down.

496
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,910
Woah.

497
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:25,050
Everyone sit down!

498
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:32,290
Starting from today, this is your new math student teacher for a month. Teacher Jung Min Young.

499
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,490
Teacher, please introduce yourself.

500
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:38,430
Hello everyone. Please take care of me for a month.

501
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:44,150
Teacher, Teacher, Teacher, Teacher! How old are you?

502
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:46,150
Do you like pasta?

503
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:48,390
I can make you that pasta.

504
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:51,690
I'll take your questions slowly.

505
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,950
You're overreacting again.

506
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:59,970
Remember, she's not your friend, noona, or unnie, but your teacher.

507
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:01,030
Understand?

508
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:02,250
Yes!

509
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:07,350
That's all. You don't need to answer all of their questions.

510
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:14,070
Ah, I'm about to poop.

511
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:16,190
It's really urgent.

512
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:23,070
Teacher, you remember me, right?

513
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:27,390
Of course! I told you we'd meet again.

514
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:33,230
Actually, can you pretend not to know me?

515
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:34,430
Why?

516
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:38,610
I actually... My family is expecting me to do things right.

517
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,830
And so I have a situation where I need to focus on my studies.

518
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,270
So before I go to the military–

519
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,970
Really? That's good.

520
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:50,570
If there's a problem you don't know, ask me anytime. You have my number, right?

521
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:55,550
Yes, I do know your number but Teacher...

522
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:09,670
What are you doing?

523
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:11,950
Photosynthesis.

524
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:26,260
Hey, why is your face like that?

525
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,240
Gong Tae Kwang,

526
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:36,080
there is someone I don't want to reveal my secrets to

527
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:42,420
and someone who I want to tell everything.

528
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,380
But if they are the same person,

529
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,380
what should I do?

530
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,920
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang! Don't trouble Go Eun Byul.

531
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,870
Don't cause any accidents or hurt her, either.

532
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,050
Just...

533
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:06,800
Don't do anything.

534
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:42,940
After thinking, and thinking,

535
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,880
and thinking about it once more,

536
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:51,420
I don't have anything to be ashamed for.

537
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,250
Dad!

538
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,800
Oh.

539
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,790
What is it?

540
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,890
Let's go.

541
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,240
Where are you?

542
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,490
I'm finishing my practice and about to go home.

543
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:48,920
Then, I'll go to your gym right now.

544
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,920
Hey.

545
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:53,970
Hey! Eat everything.

546
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:56,140
How can an athlete leave out the carrots?

547
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,960
Hey. I doing it because of you.

548
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,830
You don't like carrots.

549
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:03,810
Really?

550
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:09,700
This is great. You were picky about a lot of things.

551
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,510
Use this chance to fix them.

552
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:18,620
Hey. What did I like and what did I hate?

553
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:24,490
You liked vanilla for ice cream, lattes for coffee, and strawberries for fruit.

554
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:29,450
And you hated carrots, broccoli, and raisins.

555
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:33,090
You know more about me than I do.

556
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:39,190
Of course. After my father, you're the person I see the most. Did you forget that too?

557
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:48,320
Even though I'm a lot different from the Go Eun Byul that you know,

558
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,680
we're still good friends, right?

559
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,960
After I see how you do.

560
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:06,040
But, I like this changed Go Eun Byul more at times.

561
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:16,280
You want to eat it?

562
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:20,700
Hey!

563
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:29,010
♫ Sunlight along the streets and breeze that feels good ♫

564
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:32,670
♫ Blows gently ♫
This looks exactly like you.

565
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:37,840
♫ The road to go to you  ♫

566
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,690
♫ makes my heart flutter and happy ♫

567
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:40,850
No!

568
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,850
♫ I missed you a lot ♫

569
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:44,760
- Go this way!
- I don't know!

570
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,730
♫ You smile is still so warm ♫

571
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:55,550
♫ I'm really thankful for that ♫

572
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:59,650
♫ These words I wasn't able to say for so long ♫

573
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:04,600
♫ I really liked you  ♫

574
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:10,660
♫ Do you still... Do you remember? ♫

575
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:16,220
♫ Like the time that we first met  ♫

576
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:20,530
♫ If you called me, I would go to you ♫

577
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:22,200
-Three skips.
-Three.

578
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,550
Three.

579
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:28,450
Here it goes

580
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:32,340
Hey, that was just one.

581
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:38,850
You try it.

582
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:43,970
Lower your stance like this.

583
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:46,290
Try it.

584
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,480
Like this?

585
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:54,460
Look, do it correctly. Low like this.

586
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:02,440
Hey, are you okay?

587
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:11,620
You should have been careful.

588
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,110
What scar is this?

589
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:22,880
When I was 10 I first learned to ride a bike...

590
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,100
When you were 10?

591
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:29,750
Hey, did your memory come back?

592
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:34,770
But you're wrong. I was the one who taught you how to ride a bike in middle school...

593
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:44,370
You know me better than I do.

594
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:46,970
Go Eun Byul!

595
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:50,670
How did you erase everything?

596
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:55,370
Should I help you regain your memory?

597
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,240
No.

598
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,700
I was so frustrated all this time

599
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:05,340
so I tried hard to regain my memory. But I shouldn't have.

600
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:07,560
Hey...

601
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:14,430
It's just that I think I'll miss the time I couldn't remember anything.

602
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,120
Han Yi Ahn, I'm sorry.

603
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:25,710
For making two people's childhood memories only one person's memories.

604
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:32,010
Even though I'm a lot different from the Go Eun Byul that you know,

605
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:35,630
we're still good friends, right?

606
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,150
Hey, Go Eun Byul.

607
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:51,720
Eun Byul.

608
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,980
You're...

609
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:12,250
You're Go Eun Byul, right?
