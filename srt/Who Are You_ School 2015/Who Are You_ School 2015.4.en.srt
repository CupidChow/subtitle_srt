1
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,370
Could identical twins really have telepathy?

2
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,390
As we share more things, I ask myself that question as I see myself on the mirror.

3
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,640
Eun Bi, what did you wear today? What music did you listen to?

4
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,590
Song Mi Gyung
To Eun Bi

5
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,230
As I went to the department store to buy clothes for my daughter,

6
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,400
I thought of you, Eun Bi, and bought one more.

7
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,620
Song Mi Gyung.

8
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,140
How is it?

9
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,940
Ah, so pretty.

10
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,660
I dreamed the same dream again.

11
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,420
I remember meeting Mom for the first time when I was 5 years old.

12
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,770
12 Years Earlier, Orphanage
It was three days after I returned to the orphanage.

13
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,990
To me who was deeply hurt after going through the dissolution of my adoption,

14
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:53,080
a pretty, angelic woman came and talked to me.

15
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,690
Hey.

16
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,880
You don't remember me?

17
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,740
Before, at Love House in Tongyeong.

18
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,860
I saw you a few times.

19
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,970
You've gotten really pretty.

20
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,250
What? Dissolution of adoption?

21
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,830
Yes. Eun Byul returned three days ago.

22
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,780
She doesn't say a word.

23
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,750
How pitiful.

24
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,600
Eun Byul!

25
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,750
Do you want to go to my house with me?

26
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,750
I couldn't say at that time because her embrace was so warm

27
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,420
that the child she met at Love House was

28
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,970
not me, but my identical twin, Eun Bi.

29
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,860
And that I was never at the Love House.

30
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,960
I could not say it.

31
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,570
No, I didn't want to say it.

32
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,200
If I knew at that time the truth that the one that Mom met at Love House was Eun Bi,

33
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,950
and that I had an identical twin,

34
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,510
could I have been truthful at that time?

35
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,610
She left her phone and left again.

36
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,120
From Lee Eun Bi

37
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,780
Please forgive the fact that I couldn't tell you face-to-face

38
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,850
and had to leave behind a letter like this.

39
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:12,840
I am the one that lived at Love House, Lee Eun Bi.

40
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,610
Our face is the same so when I was rescued,

41
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,610
I think there was a misunderstanding.

42
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,000
Thank you for the warm memories

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,460
and... I'm sorry.

44
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,130
Tongyeong

45
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,380
I was a patient that was admitted here about a month ago.

46
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,960
Could I check to see if there was another person that was brought in along with me that day?

47
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,860
Name?

48
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,390
Go... Lee Eun Bi.

49
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,180
I can't verify that.

50
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,210
I see.

51
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:28,990
Yes, that's right. That day, was there another person that was saved along with me?

52
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:34,720
She wasn't saved. A dead body was found in the same location a few days ago.

53
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,220
A dead body?

54
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:22,060
Lee Eun Bi

55
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,470
Lee Eun Bi

56
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,850
School 2015: Who Are You?

57
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,370
Episode 4

58
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,450
Hey!

59
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,800
Chairman, you know that in a few days it's Tae Kwang's birthday, right?

60
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,590
What should be done?

61
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,510
Tell him to pick out a present that he likes.

62
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,850
Should I prepare a special birthday meal for you to eat with him?

63
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,490
I will tell you after I check my schedule.

64
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,250
Sekang High School

65
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,830
Go Eun Byul still hasn't come?

66
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,500
There's no one that received any call about it?

67
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,340
Yi Ahn, you didn't get any calls?

68
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,260
No, I didn't get any.

69
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,300
Up to where did we go last lesson?

70
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:34,530
Love House

71
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:46,260
Hello, my name is Song Mi Gyung from Seoul.

72
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:52,840
I see, but what brings you here from Seoul?

73
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,500
Song Mi Gyung...

74
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,760
My goodness, you came to see Eun Bi didn't you?

75
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,240
How did you know?

76
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:16,960
Our Eun Bi was so happy whenever you sent a package from Seoul.

77
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,580
How could I not know?

78
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,500
A special package?

79
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,680
These are the only relics.

80
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,570
I was telling myself, "I should get rid of this. I should get rid of this."

81
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:38,310
But because I was hesitant, it's left as it is.

82
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,740
What are you talking about? Relics?

83
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,520
What to do?

84
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,920
You didn't come because

85
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,170
you heard about Eun Bi's death?

86
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,850
What?

87
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,030
At school, that poor child

88
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,660
was severely bullied by her friends.

89
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,990
I told her she can bring her friends anytime.

90
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,820
And seeing as she even went through expulsion...

91
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,050
She must have been hurt so much...

92
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,440
It's all my sin.

93
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,450
I, who was supposed to be in place of her mother,

94
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:39,380
didn't know anything to the point of not knowing how she wanted to kill herself...

95
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,680
Is it alright to open this?

96
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,500
Yes. Of course.

97
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,040
Where is

98
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,370
this child right now?

99
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,200
Eun Byul, where did you go?

100
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,430
I was looking for you everywhere.

101
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,390
You...

102
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,600
You're my Eun Byul, right?

103
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,730
This... This.

104
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,760
I tied this around your neck when you went to the school trip.

105
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,970
Remember.

106
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,250
When I found you at the hospital, you had this with you.

107
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,440
Please.

108
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,960
Please think about it. Please?

109
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,380
I'm sorry.

110
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,510
I don't really know, but

111
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,810
I think this happened because Unnie saved me.

112
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,880
I'm sorry.

113
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,940
Why do you keep startling me? It's not true, Eun Byul.

114
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,120
It's not true, it's not true, right?

115
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,290
Eun Byul, it's not true.

116
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,890
It's not.

117
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,210
I'm sorry.

118
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,030
You bad girl! You bad girl!

119
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:04,300
Why are you making me so upset? You want to see me go crazy?

120
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,140
It's not true! Why are you being like this, seriously?

121
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:16,190
No. No.

122
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,840
My Eun Byul is still alive.

123
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,600
No, my Eun Byul hasn't died yet.

124
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,110
She hasn't died yet! She hasn't died.

125
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,170
No... No...

126
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,800
No, no...

127
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:49,210
My Eun Byul... My Eun Byul is still alive.

128
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,910
- Ah, yes.
- Hello, Teacher.

129
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,610
But you see, I had a big spending a few days ago.

130
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,470
It will be my pay day in a few days, so give me a call then.

131
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,850
Still, I haven't had an accident in 12 years.

132
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,260
I'm definitely not going to have an accident. Yes.

133
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,930
My bloody $1200...

134
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,370
Teacher, the world doesn't turn around the way you want it to.

135
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,880
Who knows about it in advance when they get into an accident?

136
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,530
Should I lend you my allowance?

137
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:35,160
You smell. You were smok–

138
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,510
Tae Kwang, don't worry.

139
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:46,190
Keeping a safe distance in all matters in my motto.

140
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:52,270
Between the front car and the back car. And also between teacher and student.

141
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,050
What the heck are you saying?

142
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,680
Find your math notebook!

143
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:15,860
My mom said that you should come and take the level test.

144
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,580
Why? You waited a long time.

145
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,250
She mentioned the fee is quite burdensome.

146
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,350
No, I'll go. Will a lot of people take the test?

147
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:30,060
- There's two, I think. You and Lee Shi Jin.
- Lee Shi Jin?

148
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,350
What about me?

149
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,740
Did you not hear from your mom?

150
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,960
She said you wanted to get into our team.

151
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,370
I guess the cutline isn't as high as I thought it would be.

152
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,600
Well, there's nothing special to prepare.

153
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,150
I can't live because of you, Mom!

154
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:51,200
Because it's obvious I'm not going to make it, they're just pretending to give me a chance.

155
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:57,270
What do you mean why? It's probably because you said something!

156
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:02,010
Do you think that if you become close friends with Min Joon's mom, I'll become just like Min Joon?

157
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:07,550
Do you really think my grades will go up just because I squeeze in between them?

158
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:12,950
Oh, I don't know. I don't know! I'm hanging up.

159
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,910
Why are you so down since the morning?

160
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,910
It's because my mom made a bad friend.

161
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:34,410
Star Song Hee Young announced her third marriage.

162
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:43,080
The groom is a businessman six years younger than her. The wedding will be held privately.

163
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,930
Have a happy marriage, Song Hee Young!

164
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,810
You came? Do you have anything special you want to eat tomorrow?

165
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:57,960
No. Whatever you cook is delicious, anyway.

166
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:17,060
Wow! There are balloons!

167
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,150
Wow.

168
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,520
It's so nice, Tae Kwang. You get a birthday party

169
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,130
and you get to see your mother after a long time.

170
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,670
Oh, your mom must have come.

171
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:39,610
Ahjumma, you can't tell her that I'm hiding here.

172
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,500
I'm going to surprise Mom. It's a secret.

173
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,550
Alright. I understand. A secret.

174
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,950
Did the shooting end well?

175
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,830
You know about it. With the spy you planted.

176
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,590
Did you think I didn't know about that person following me all month long?

177
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,640
This is divorce paper. Send me this as soon as you're done.

178
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,460
What are you doing?

179
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,020
You didn't marry me because you loved me.

180
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,840
Our meeting, Tae Kwang's birth, and our marriage was all a mistake, wasn't it?

181
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,550
That's why... I'm getting punished right now.

182
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,380
Tae Kwang and I are your punishment?

183
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,590
Tae Kwang!

184
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:14,660
Aigoo. How can you eat alone on your birthday?

185
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,430
I don't care about that, Ahjumma.

186
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,930
Why? Take a few spoonfuls when it's warm.

187
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,530
I don't really like it.

188
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,680
Alright. Seaweed soup isn't supposed to be eaten by the birthday boy, anyway.

189
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,450
The mom who gave birth is the one that's supposed to eat it.

190
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:47,260
Ah, Chairman said he's sorry that he can't have a birthday meal with you.

191
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,330
so he said that you could pick a really great present.

192
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,830
Alright, then. I ate well.

193
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,380
Oh, over there! Over there!

194
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,560
What? Did something pass by?

195
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,690
That girl over there... She's very pretty, isn't she?

196
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,760
Aish!

197
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,590
Aish, my neck! It hurts!

198
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,160
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang.

199
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,520
Hey, are you alright?

200
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,480
No.

201
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,530
I'm sorry.

202
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:06,420
Teacher, this is not your style to ram into something.

203
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:10,150
You have to keep a proper distance to be safe.

204
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:14,210
Between the front car and the back car. And also between teacher and student.

205
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,090
You already know it all!

206
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:23,040
What should we do? This is going to cost a lot.

207
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,920
I'll have to have insurance take care of it.

208
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,550
Customer, your contract with car insurance ended on May 3rd.

209
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,690
You're going to use insurance, right?

210
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,670
I guess I have to do that.

211
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:04,990
Working part-time jobs, taking care of all the kids,

212
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,740
I heard you had a very hard time.

213
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,210
What do you mean hard?

214
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,760
I did it because I liked it.

215
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:19,580
You were trying to live so strong even without any parent and then those...

216
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,650
Those disgraceful people.

217
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:34,880
Without having anyone at your side, how hard it must have been

218
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,920
that you would think those terrible thoughts.

219
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:46,420
If you ever need any help, contact me.

220
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,220
Yes.

221
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,710
I was really thankful for all this time.

222
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:02,280
Also... Although I didn't do it on purpose,

223
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,690
I'm very sorry. Because of me...

224
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,210
Goodbye.

225
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:02,620
I must have been a really happy child.

226
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,250
Oh, Mom!

227
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:11,140
Mom, I don't want to sleep alone!

228
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:15,690
Mom's scent is really nice.

229
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,670
I feel as though I'm still dreaming.

230
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:30,830
Thank you for coming back.

231
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,500
Mom.

232
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,830
Mom.

233
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,490
That's right.

234
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,660
Mom.

235
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,300
Mom.

236
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,510
Why do I still feel like you're my daughter?

237
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,230
Whether I don't believe it,

238
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,970
or whether I don't want to believe it,

239
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,860
in my eyes you still

240
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,830
seem like my Eun Byul.

241
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,810
Like a few days ago, do you want to erase all of your memories

242
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,830
and go with me?

243
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,280
If I sent you away right now,

244
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:43,190
I don't have the confidence to continue living.

245
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,580
Can't you just

246
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:52,550
live as Eun Byul?

247
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,670
That's ridiculous!

248
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:07,500
How... How could I do that?

249
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,240
Like when you didn't know anything.

250
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,320
Us...

251
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:19,290
You and I, let's live together.

252
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,010
Okay?

253
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,330
We are planning to attend the competition tomorrow afternoon.

254
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,440
It's meant to choose the representative for Seoul for the nationals.

255
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,750
It will just hurt my mouth to say how important this is twice.

256
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,830
You guys know I can only choose two people for each event?

257
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,760
Yes!

258
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,980
And since it's decided that Han Yi Ahn would do the 100, 200, and 400 meters,

259
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,840
the rest of you, choose and tell me your decision.

260
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,640
Yes.

261
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,340
What's wrong with your voices? Huh?

262
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,540
And be completely alert. Okay?

263
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,820
Yes.

264
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,730
Dismissed.

265
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,780
Thank you.

266
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:32,780
Hey, you take all the good ones and tell the rest of us to pick the leftovers.

267
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,230
Oh, Sunbae. Why are you being like this again?

268
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,660
Since you're getting a chance so easily, you're just fooling around.

269
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,370
Why? Try to fight back again.

270
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,750
I'm sorry.

271
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,730
There won't be anything like that again.

272
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,570
Oh, cold.

273
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:42,740
Hey, come back to your senses. Are you going to be like Go Eun Byul?

274
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:47,680
I have something to show you.

275
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,550
Ta-da! Hey, they're picking out models for uniforms.

276
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,150
So I'm going to submit this.

277
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:57,020
If I make it, I'll treat you with something really nice.

278
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,570
I wish I can get accepted and debut.

279
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,620
Do you really want to be a celebrity that much?

280
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,650
Yeah!

281
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,010
I envy you.

282
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,710
Really?

283
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,100
I have another one. Should I give it to you?

284
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,600
It's not that.

285
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,100
It must be nice. Having something you want to do.

286
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,010
It's only good if I actually make it.

287
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,450
It's a problem you can think of later.

288
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:37,300
How could I have a hundred things I hate, but not have a single thing that I like?

289
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,340
Oh, I don't know why I'm alive.

290
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:10,360
♫ There’s an empty world deep in my heart, save me ♫

291
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:16,850
♫  I wanna reset, I wanna reset, I wanna reset  ♫

292
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:23,450
♫  Lonely eyes trapped in darkness ♫
♫ Isn't there anyone to hold my hand?  ♫

293
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:29,970
♫  I wanna reset, I wanna reset, I wanna reset  ♫

294
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,050
♫ Someone somewhere will know my miserable heart ♫

295
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:37,340
♫ It’s right in front of me but I can’t find it like a oriole bird ♫

296
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,570
♫  I’m flying around by myself
in this darkness, in my lonely night ♫

297
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:44,660
♫  I’m flying around by myself
in this darkness, with a miserable heart ♫

298
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,670
- You're leaving already?
- Yeah.

299
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,540
Hey! Let that go! You can't do it!

300
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,230
What do you mean I can't? Let me do it.

301
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:11,530
You brat. Your body is your wealth. You shouldn't be using too much strength on something like this.

302
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,480
Things like this are just exercise.

303
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,610
Hey, you could hurt your shoulders doing like this.

304
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:19,460
It's alright.

305
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,120
- Father.
- What?

306
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,060
It must be hard, right?

307
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,110
Just wait a little bit.

308
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,720
- I'll swim dilligently–
- This useless talk...

309
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,960
Do I give the impression that I'll live off my son and not work?

310
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,490
You know I didn't mean that.

311
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,660
Ah, look at this. Look at this, look at this.

312
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:43,540
Hey, these oil stains don't come out so easily.

313
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,950
Only cover yourself with water, okay?

314
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,320
You know what hope I'm living for, right?

315
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,430
Yes.

316
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,280
Alright. I'll be back.

317
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,590
- Father.
- Yeah?

318
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,570
Don't skip any meals.

319
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,120
Alright. You too.

320
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,380
Go.

321
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,150
I'll come in after parking the car.

322
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:52,890
What are you doing instead of getting ready for school?

323
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,530
I will go starting tomorrow.

324
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,800
What are you saying? Hurry and get ready.

325
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,260
I am worried because you look really sick.

326
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,030
Why the formal talk all of a sudden?

327
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:07,800
Nothing has changed. Do what you usually do.

328
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,650
Please don't be like that and please eat.

329
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:13,240
I'll also eat after dropping you off.

330
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:17,250
I will take the bus by myself after seeing you eat.

331
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,700
Again.

332
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,820
"I'll go take the bus, Mom." (Informal speech.)

333
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,620
Yes.

334
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,430
Mom.

335
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,810
Alright.

336
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,940
Then, should I eat?

337
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,390
It looks good.

338
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:50,210
My daughter is the best.

339
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:00,210
Even though you don't know you are not familiar with these streets, can you still ride the bus?

340
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:04,840
I've traveled around with my friends here and there, so I'm okay now.

341
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,360
Mom.

342
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,360
Alright, then.

343
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,390
Oh, at this rate, I could really be late.

344
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,640
Go Eun Byul

345
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,740
Unnie.

346
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:20,030
Can I really live as Go Eun Byul?

347
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:25,770
I'll always believe that you are with me.

348
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,630
To make you not feel embarrassed,

349
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,690
I'll live my life to the fullest.

350
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:16,080
You missed class. Were you sick?

351
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,330
No.

352
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,970
Then... You skipped class?

353
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,150
Yeah.

354
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,220
Are you really Go Eun Byul?

355
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,590
Go Eun Byul...

356
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,300
Go Eun Byul!

357
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,810
You're not going to answer?

358
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,320
Can I borrow the notes from yesterday's history class?

359
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,000
And I was wondering why you didn't come yesterday.

360
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,110
Thanks.

361
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,180
Go Eun Byul, let me borrow your scissors.

362
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:34,200
Daebak! When you lose your memory, does your handwriting change too?

363
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,910
- Really?
- Yeah, look at this.

364
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,120
- It's different, right?
- Wow, that's so interesting.

365
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,740
What are you looking at?

366
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,410
Wait.

367
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:55,180
Eun Byul, look at this. This is a letter that you wrote for me long time ago.

368
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,130
It's completely different.

369
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,810
It's cool to you too, right?

370
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:00,790
Yeah.

371
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,980
It seems so.

372
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:10,460
In movies, even if someone loses their memory, their bodily traits stay the same.

373
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,580
Like being good at sports or playing piano.

374
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,750
Oh, that's right.

375
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,690
Hey, Han Yi Ahn.

376
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,560
If you had amnesia, do you think you couldn't swim? No, right?

377
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,760
Who knows? I could not know how to.

378
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,230
I'll do it later.

379
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,950
The bell rang, so where are you going?

380
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:51,130
I am going to the school clinic and get some medicine. I have a headache.

381
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,080
Gong Tae Kwang! The bell rang. Go back to class!

382
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:11,560
Teacher! I told you I'm recovering from an accident.

383
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,110
If you're not feeling well, just go to the hospital now.

384
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:17,380
It's not to that extent, but up to

385
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,710
2 hours?

386
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:26,140
I'll go to the office and come back so you stay here quietly.

387
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,710
Yes.

388
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:09,330
Gong Tae Kwang. I heard you got in an accident. Are you hurt?

389
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,060
Don't talk to me. I'm in serious condition.

390
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,410
You told me that last time

391
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,730
that I didn't treat you like a human being.

392
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:28,200
And that we only spoke once.

393
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,210
Then you must not know anything about me.

394
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,180
There is something.

395
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,300
What is it?

396
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,100
You have amnesia.

397
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,630
That's right.

398
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:49,020
I don't know you, and you don't know me either.

399
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,660
That's fair. I like it.

400
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,770
You like it? Being an amnesiac?

401
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,730
Should I tell you a secret?

402
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:17,000
Don't believe anything I say.

403
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,580
I'm a big liar.

404
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,630
More than me?

405
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,470
You know...

406
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,670
My name

407
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:30,410
is Go Eun Byul.

408
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,300
Aigoo, seriously.

409
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,130
I knew you would do this.

410
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:43,440
If you study that hard, it would be strange not to go crazy.

411
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,410
I can't lose from this, then.

412
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,540
You know the top star Song Hee Young?

413
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,490
This woman is my mom.

414
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,460
Did you call me, Chairman?

415
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,260
Joon Suk.

416
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,870
Yes, Teacher.

417
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:15,740
It seems that Tae Kwang was playing again.

418
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,430
Don't worry about the accident fees.

419
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:21,260
No. I will do as I see fit.

420
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,650
If we can't do anything about Tae Kwang...

421
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:31,720
With no consideration for you, I am treating all my class' children equally.

422
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,330
I know you're really disappointed in me.

423
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:41,960
Disappointed? I have no right to say that.

424
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:47,010
Thinking back that being a teacher is for making a living too...

425
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:49,040
It's not too bad.

426
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,130
I will go now.

427
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,840
Hello.

428
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,650
Can at least you keep the good memories?
- Jung Soo In

429
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,340
Can at least you keep the good memories?
- Jung Soo In

430
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,050
You came to my house often when you were in elementary school.

431
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:38,400
Do you not know me? I'm Soo In's mom.

432
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,740
Jung Soo In?

433
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,570
What?

434
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:50,450
Nothing. I just got a weird text.

435
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:56,800
But, Teacher, is there a Jung Soo In in our school?

436
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,220
Perhaps.

437
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,630
It's almost impossible to remember all the students' names.

438
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:23,630
Oh my, daebak! Song Hee Young is our chairman's ex-wife!

439
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:28,910
Chairman is really pitiful. He's just living alone, but Song Hee Young is having her third marriage.

440
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:34,430
Aish! I bet Chairman has a lover, too. Maybe a really young woman?

441
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,040
Quit it, you punk.

442
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,850
My mom said she heard this from another person.

443
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:43,150
This woman is known for marrying rich guys and then asking for a huge settlement afterwards.

444
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:48,700
There's a rumour that as a result of the settlement, our gym is only half of its original size.

445
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,120
You guys are so loud.

446
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:02,090
Wait.

447
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:06,200
Hey, you crazy bastard, didn't I warn you already?

448
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:13,690
You really went crazy this time, huh?

449
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,870
Hurry up and stop them! Gong Tae Kwang might die!

450
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:20,990
If I go in, I would die.

451
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,350
Gong Tae! Why are you being like this?

452
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:26,700
I'll go tell the teacher!

453
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,000
Teacher! There's trouble! Gong Tae Kwang and Kwon Gi Tae are fighting.

454
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,630
What? These kids...

455
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:06,180
You're laughing? Laughing?

456
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,480
Hey, Gong Tae Kwang, don't do it!

457
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,410
I said let go!

458
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:30,290
Eun Byul, are you alright?

459
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,390
Eun Byul, are you okay?

460
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:43,130
Stop it, you bastards! Go Eun Byul got hurt!

461
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:44,740
What are you?

462
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,200
What are you doing?

463
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:56,360
Gong Tae Kwang, Kwon Gi Tae. Follow me.

464
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:10,900
Are you alright?

465
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,590
Yeah.

466
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,960
Is your arm okay?

467
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,440
It's alright.

468
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,540
The heavens helped you.

469
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,740
So, why did you interfere in the middle of Gi Tae and Gong Tae's fight?

470
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:29,060
Imagine if you were like the old Go Eun Byul. You would have said they were noisy and left to go to the library.

471
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:37,910
Hey, Go Eun Byul. Honestly, I was going to wait until your memory came back to tell you.

472
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,670
You've been weird since that trip.

473
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:43,560
How was I?

474
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:47,680
When we were at the resort, I saw you fighting with some guy.

475
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,180
There was a wound on your neck.

476
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,990
Wound?

477
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:57,550
The cut went away. It looked pretty deep before.

478
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:02,530
Oh, so I got hurt during the trip.

479
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:05,570
You stopped talking to us and had a really bad-temper that time.

480
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:07,870
There were lots of weird things.

481
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:11,590
But, what man? Who was he?

482
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:14,540
It was too dark, so I couldn't see.

483
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,580
He was really tall...

484
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:20,180
By any chance, was it Han Yi Ahn?

485
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,390
Yi Ahn wasn't even there.

486
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:26,510
Really? No one saw Han Yi Ahn?

487
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:32,460
I told you he was at the swim meet during the trip. I even phoned him.

488
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:41,190
Hey, Go Eun Byul.

489
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:42,950
You're not hurt?

490
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:45,440
I wasn't even hurt much.

491
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,570
If that happens again, I'll be really angry.

492
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:53,630
You told me that you briefly came by during the school trip.

493
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:56,390
Did you see me then, by any chance?

494
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:02,820
Although, since you went to your swim meet and missed the trip, you have no way of knowing.

495
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:06,160
I went. Just for a bit at night.

496
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,480
The other kids don't know, though.

497
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,460
Of course. I went to see the person I wanted to see.

498
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:17,610
Did you see me?

499
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:20,150
I didn't.

500
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,770
Song Joo and Shi Jin said

501
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:31,710
that they saw me fight with some guy at the resort.

502
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:33,740
So seriously that I would get scars.

503
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,840
Hey, that–

504
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,130
Who is it?

505
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:41,510
Do you perhaps have any suspicions on who it could be?

506
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:43,580
Who knows?

507
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,960
Get ready to leave school by tomorrow and start preparing to study abroad.

508
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,760
Why?

509
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,400
Is going to the mental hospital for 1-2 months not enough?

510
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:26,450
I think us not seeing each other is the medicine.

511
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,650
Of course.

512
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:32,520
Now the truth is coming out.

513
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:35,880
Medicine, what a bullshit.

514
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,140
You just want me to get out of your face.

515
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,150
You know

516
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:56,220
what day it is today, right?

517
00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:03,310
I don't care about gifts, but what about having a meal, all three of us, for the first time in 10 years?

518
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:07,830
I'll even congratulate Mom on her 3rd marriage.

519
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,610
Time after time, in everything you do,

520
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:20,560
you're just like your mother. You can't express your feelings in a normal way or in any way that makes sense.

521
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:35,200
I'm curious. Do I resemble her because I'm her son?

522
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,050
Or does everyone living with you end up like this?

523
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:41,180
You pathetic bastard.

524
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:44,080
Until when are you going to behave so childishly like this?

525
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:48,510
If you can't handle it, get out of this house!

526
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:51,610
No, you said you're in the process of receiving a punishment.

527
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,880
You said making me and giving birth to me was your sin!

528
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:59,160
Then you should just keep receiving the punishment!
It wouldn't matter if I died, would it?!

529
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,160
Is that something you should say to your father?.

530
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,430
Think carefully.

531
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:15,450
What did I see

532
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,900
and grow up listening to

533
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:23,170
to have me grow up this way?

534
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:52,830
I'll regret it. I won't regret it. I'll regret it.

535
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:57,860
I won't regret it. I'll regret it.

536
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:04,280
I won't regret it.

537
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:18,460
Go Eun Byul. I have something to tell you. Come out for a moment.

538
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:13,440
What are you? Popping out of nowhere.

539
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,070
It's my choice.

540
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:21,130
Hey, why did you interfere in someone else's business...

541
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,330
Is your arm okay?

542
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:27,420
I'm okay, so don't concern yourself.

543
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:32,540
By any chance, was that you saying that you are not okay so I should be concerned?

544
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,350
You said your words were lies.

545
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:37,350
Think what you want.

546
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,320
Hey.

547
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:50,420
But today, I really want to be alone.

548
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:54,150
Did I say anything?

549
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:58,750
Aigoo, you really can't understand words properly!

550
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,870
One, two, three!

551
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:28,030
Now, go to the side.

552
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,910
I'm letting go. I'm letting go.

553
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,200
- I'm letting go.
- Don't do it!

554
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:25,040
Sit at your seat and be quiet!

555
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,050
Our class has a new student.

556
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,790
She might feel a bit lost because she's new,

557
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:38,520
so I'm counting on you to help her a lot and take care of her until she's adapted herself.

558
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,490
Come in.

559
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:04,290
Introduce yourself.

560
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:09,180
- I'm a transfer student from Noori Girl's High School in Tongyeong, Kang So Young.
- Tong Young.

561
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,900
Tong Young.

562
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:17,640
From now on, let's be good friends.

563
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,900
Please take care of–

564
