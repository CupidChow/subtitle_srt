1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:06,270
Uh, the words Swim Genius... are nice. It's nice, but...

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,950
it's burdensome.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,370
At first, I didn't even float properly.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,250
It was once also difficult to go down a lane because I couldn't breathe.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,850
And it angered me to see the backs of the better swimmers.
'Han Yi Ahn - Sekang High School Swim Club Member'

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:23,350
Since then, I started coming one hour early and leaving two hours late.

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,150
I made a decision.

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,330
That I would never see anyone else's back in the water.

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,320
I'm not a genius. Would they be disappointed?

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,530
What?

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,940
Someone dear to me?

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,510
Of course swimming is not everything.

13
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,710
There's my father and...

14
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,280
I... was really frustrated all this time.

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,230
I tried my best to get all my memories back... but I shouldn't have.

16
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:17,740
Just because the time that I couldn't remember anything...
I think I will miss it a lot.

17
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,350
Goodbye!

18
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,500
Han Yi Ahn, goodbye.

19
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,690
I will regret it. I won't.

20
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,850
I'll regret it.

21
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,850
I won't. I'll regret it.

22
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,400
I won't!

23
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,350
Go Eun Byul, I have something to say to you. Come out for a minute.

24
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:08,070
♫ There’s an empty world deep in my heart, save me ♫

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:14,100
♫  I wanna reset , I wanna reset ♫

26
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,000
♫  I wanna reset. Lonely eyes trapped in darkness  ♫

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,100
♫  Is there anyone to hold my hand?  ♫

28
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,600
♫  I wanna reset  ♫

29
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,660
♫  I wanna reset  ♫

30
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,300
- I'm letting go!
- Don't!

31
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:34,530
♫ I won’t let you go ♫

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,100
♫ I won’t let you go ♫

33
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,680
Go Eun Byul, I have something to say to you. Come out for a minute.

34
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,220
Medal...did you leave it and go?

35
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,260
Yes, I promised to give it to you.

36
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,060
Although you probably don't remember.

37
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,220
Thanks.

38
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,810
Eun Byul, Merry Christmas!

39
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,170
From Yi Ahn

40
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,690
Take your seats. Attention!

41
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,050
There is a new transfer student in our class.

42
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:10,420
Help her until she adjusts to the new environment and pay attention to her.

43
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,800
-Come in!
-Come in?

44
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,720
Fantastic!

45
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,760
Introduce yourself.

46
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,620
I'm Kang So Young that transferred from Noori Girl's High School in Tongyeong.

47
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,480
- Tongyeong.
- We went there.

48
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,020
Wow! Tongyeong.

49
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,370
Let's get along well.

50
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,820
Please look aft–

51
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,440
What's wrong?

52
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,000
Please look after me.

53
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,210
Applause.

54
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:28,160
School 2015: Who Are You

55
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,930
You have to go meet them, right?

56
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,170
You know that, right?

57
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,770
- Right.
- Really?

58
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,120
Can I sit here too?

59
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,790
Yes, of course. Sit down.

60
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,460
We went to Tongyeong for a school trip not too long ago.

61
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,480
Oh really?

62
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,130
You always lived in Tongyeong for your whole life and then moved to Seoul?

63
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,740
Yeah. My dad got transferred to Seoul.

64
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,630
Prosecutor?

65
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,160
Cool!

66
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,230
Sunbae, please eat this during training.

67
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,060
Thank you.

68
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,190
Yi Ahn, you're going to train?

69
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,620
- Snack time!
- Asa! (Yeah!)

70
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,540
Isn't he a swimmer?

71
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,740
Yeah, that's right.

72
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,460
You two seem really close.

73
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,060
Who? Eun Byul and Yi Ahn?

74
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,480
They have been friends since they were 8.

75
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,080
I'm going to the bathroom.

76
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,760
You...don't remember me?

77
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,170
I...don't remember.

78
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,250
Why? At Tongyeong...

79
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:32,260
hospital, I made a mistake towards you.

80
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,750
Do you not remember?

81
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,910
Then I guess I need to jog your memories.

82
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,030
Ah, why are you doing this? Let go of me.

83
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,270
Let go of her!

84
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,610
How dare you touch my daughter like that? Don't move. I'm going to report you to the police.

85
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,510
A-h, I-I'm sorry.

86
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,180
I think I got the wrong person.

87
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,670
That was you, huh?

88
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,140
I'm sorry about that time.

89
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,070
There was this friend I didn't have a good relationship with

90
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,360
and I mistook you for her.

91
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,270
Friend?

92
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,500
Just because you don't have a good relationship,

93
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,090
you do those kinds of things to your friend?

94
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,940
There are reasons for that.

95
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,550
Don't misunderstand. Let's get along well.

96
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,490
You got it?

97
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,990
-Yes...

98
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,140
There's a national exam coming up, you know that, right?

99
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,190
The time period in which you translate and memorize English questions on EBS (Educational Broadcasting System) programs and get good grades has passed.

100
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,880
Okay.

101
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,680
Just learn at least one English word in that tie. Okay?

102
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,010
Okay!

103
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,760
You, girls... Even when you forgot to do your homework when you come to school...

104
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,620
you absolutely always have to put on makeup, don't you?

105
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,430
Rot, skin!

106
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,120
What are you doing?

107
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,820
Because I wasn't the one that got hit

108
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,830
I was going to just let it go, but

109
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:36,920
for the sake of peace in our classroom, I made a special decision.

110
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,580
Clean. Start.

111
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,670
Come this way.

112
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,850
Look at each other.

113
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,970
The punishment isn't about the cleaning.

114
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:04,710
It is not to avoid each other and be in sync with each other. Clean.

115
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,570
What is this bastard?

116
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,980
Ah, Teacher!

117
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,470
Hey Gong Tae, what are you doing?

118
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,560
I know, right? What am I doing?

119
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,560
Once class is over, come home straightaway.

120
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,070
If you're in such a hurry, why don't we go together?

121
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,740
What rule is applied if the limit is in the form of f(x) divided by g(x)?

122
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,730
L'Hôpital's rule.

123
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,790
That's right! L'Hôpital's rule.

124
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,130
Then let's try solving it.

125
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:28,160
Using L'Hôpital's rule, if the limit of x is close to 2,

126
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,370
when you take the differential of the denominator...

127
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,530
- One.
- Exactly.

128
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:41,810
If you take 1 and take the differential of the numerator, it becomes f(2) - 2f(x) prime.

129
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,620
It's important here. In L'Hôpital...

130
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,080
Just get her into arts or sports now

131
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,440
or have her receive counseling.

132
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,760
She's still in her 2nd year of high school, but counseling already?

133
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,720
Honey, pay as much attention to your child as you do to your body.

134
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,870
Going to counseling in the third year is the same thing as going to a doctor when you're already in the last stage of cancer.

135
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,800
No matter how good that doctor is, he can't do much for the patient.

136
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,260
No matter how good is the counselor, he can't do much for a senior.

137
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:23,200
If she gets counseling once, will she actually be able to go to Korea University?

138
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:29,060
There are patients who can get cured in one step but there are others that need more time.

139
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,640
Just know that you need to be thankful that you met me before it was too late.

140
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,360
Did you do well?

141
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,660
Yes.

142
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,050
Ah, you're Min Joon.

143
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,750
Ah, hello.

144
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,980
But...

145
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,680
I'm Shi Jin's mother. You know Shi Jin, right?

146
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,080
Lee Shi Jin?

147
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,380
Oh Shi Jin. Come here.

148
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,920
Greet her. She's Min Joon's mother.

149
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,170
Hello.

150
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,080
Oh, yes.

151
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:12,880
Aigoo, she seems really nice. You resemble your dad, don't you?

152
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,240
I've prepared for all the admissions, so get ready.

153
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,520
MDT Overseas Studies

154
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,890
Hey!

155
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,890
Today I really

156
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,150
want to be alone.

157
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,300

Tongyeong N Girl's Highschool Student Commits Suicide Because of Bullying

160
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,760
Eat well.

161
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,880
Outcast

162
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,200
Sender: Jung Soo In
Recipient: Eun Byul

163
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,190
Jung Soo In?

00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:06,400
Eun Byul, I won't bother you anymore. How about meeting tomorrow for the last time? I will wait for you at the library.

165
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:17,080
Oh? A library book number?

166
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,020
A 808.3-3-23-12

167
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,150
A 808.3-3-23-12

168
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,600
Is this not it?

169
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,720
Doesn't it seem like it's going to hurt? Do it once.

170
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,780
It'll be okay, right?

171
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,160
Good thing you got the call.

172
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,100
You did great!

173
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,730
Hey, Go Eun Byul. I got a call for the second round of the uniform model audition!

174
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,110
Cha Song Joo, congratulations!

175
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,450
At this rate, won't you totally be a star?

176
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,670
How about it? Should I give you my autograph in advance?

177
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,550
It's Lee Shin Jin.

178
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,580
Lee Shi Jin.

179
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,900
Ah, this is your spot, right? Sorry.

180
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Thanks.

181
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,650
Can you show me around the school during lunchtime?

182
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,810
What?

183
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:46,050
What are you saying? Go Eun Byul still gets lost around this school.

184
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,370
What are you talking about?

185
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,450
Because there was a sort of accident at the school trip

186
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,530
Eun Byul kind of lost her memories.

187
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,390
At Tongyeong?

188
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,540
What to do?

189
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,510
What do you mean "what to do?" Our Go Eun Byul's not letting herself be bothered by that!

190
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:08,120
- Right, Eun Byul? It's going to come back ,right?
- Hmm.

191
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,070
Transfer student! Come here.

192
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:47,260
I was kind of worried about eating by myself. Thanks.

193
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,260
Drink some water.

194
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,570
Of course you eat by yourself. Does someone feed you?

195
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,730
Don't worry about the things he says.

196
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,440
I heard you two were friends since you were 8.

197
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,090
Yeah, that's right.

198
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,790
You must be close.

199
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:19,630
Wow! Han Yi Ahn, your personality is great. You're friends with this jerk?

200
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,780
Jerk?

201
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:31,720
But...even with a second glance, you look too much alike.

202
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,640
Eun Byul? With who?

203
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,970
There's someone.

204
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,760
A girl that was in the same class as me in Tongyeong.

205
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,120
Just how much does she look alike?

206
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,710
It's not even about looking alike. They look exactly, exactly the same.

207
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,410
I would believe it if she came back from the dead.

208
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,880
Does that make any sense?

209
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,070
How frustrating! Then, should I send you a picture of her?

210
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,420
I'll call you later.

211
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,250
You...must be a little upset.

212
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,620
About what?

213
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,700
Still, she's a long time friend, but she can't even remember your name.

214
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,340
You must have been close with her.

215
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,380
I just thought that it would be like that.

216
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:38,810
Of course. That's why I'm hitting Go Eun Byul ten times everyday these days.

217
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,770
Sorry, I said useless things.

218
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:50,670
No. You said you were Kang So Young, right?

219
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,750
Since you're quick to catch on things, you shouldn't have any problem adapting here.

220
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,080
I'll go ahead.

221
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:05,070
Why aren't you listening?

222
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,220
Okay, okay!

223
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,820
Are you okay?

224
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,320
Hey Gong Tae, what did you do?

225
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,220
If you're taking a photo, isn't my face a lot better than theirs?

226
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,900
What do you mean a photo?

227
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:37,000
You were trying to take our pictures without us knowing?

228
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,800
Sorry.

229
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,090
I just thought that you guys looked pretty playing together like that.

230
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:49,290
Hey, did you have to take it secretly, though? My face is very expensive, you know.

231
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,510
Gong Tae, you take the picture.

232
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:55,020
Hurry.

233
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,350
If you're pretending to take a picture but take a selfie instead, I'll kill you.

234
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:02,680
I don't want to have my picture taken. I'll be leaving first.

235
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,410
Why?

236
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,460
Hey Go Eun Byul!

237
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,650
Of course, that's the way it should be. Her acting like a jerk is more normal.

238
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,540
I thought she was acting weird before.

239
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,000
Move.

240
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:32,550
I got a call from your father. I heard you decided to go abroad.

241
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,910
Did you also agree to this?

242
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:43,010
If that is Father's wish, then I guess I have to do it.

243
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,380
Withdrawal Application

244
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:59,320
After you sign this, you know that there are two weeks to think about it more, right?

245
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,780
Whatever.

246
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:18,300
Hey!

247
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,730
Excuse me, you're athlete Han Yi Ahn, right?

248
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:25,680
I contacted you last time. I'm Lee Sang Yoon from K-Project.

249
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,080
Ah, I see.
Lee Sang Yoon
K-Project Inc.

250
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,030
Oh, isn't this a really big company?

251
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,450
I know you turned us down, but we thought it was a real waste, so we came looking for you again.

252
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:41,000
Because it's hard to find someone who is becoming a rising star in sports these days as much as you.

253
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,420
I'm sorry but I have an important competition in May.

254
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,970
I think I'll have to pay attention to my practices.

255
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,020
I see.

256
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,660
Even so, if you change your mind, please give us a call.

257
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,550
Okay.

258
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,920
What do you mean you have no time? We could do it when you're free.

259
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,490
Hey, it's not up to me.

260
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,760
♫ I’m floating around alone ♫

261
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,290
♫ Everyone around me is leaving ♫

262
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,710
♫ Seats are emptying one by one ♫

263
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:44,860
♫ I blame myself for just watching ♫

264
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,480
What are you doing?

265
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,550
♫ Slowly getting farther away and isolated ♫

266
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,270
♫ Now everyone has left with only me on this island ♫

267
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,160
Are you sleeping?

268
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:06,130
♫ Will someone warmly tell me it’s alright? ♫

269
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,800
-What are you doing?
-Why?

270
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,990
What? Why?

271
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,890
♫ Flying in the wind, should I go somewhere? ♫

272
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:25,290
♫ I will stay by your side ♫

273
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,370
-Hey.
-What?

274
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,750
I'm hungry.

275
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,530
Let's go.

276
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,190
Is the gold medal safe and sound?

277
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,780
Yeah.

278
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,880
But what kind of promise was it?

279
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,410
The promise I made to give you my first gold medal in the nationals.

280
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:07,700
You said that you had a competition during the trip.

281
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,220
Is that when you won it?

282
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:15,140
I went to Tongyeong that night, but I came back without being able to give it to you.

283
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,400
You were...really angry.

284
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,270
I went there at night, for a short time.

285
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,980
The other kids didn't know about it.

286
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,770
Of course.

287
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:32,090
I only went there to see the person that I wanted to see.

288
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,710
Are you done eating?

289
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:50,330
We came here often back then.

290
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:54,140
We ate ramyun everyday, like right now.

291
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,650
We did?

292
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,630
Ah, that's harsh.

293
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:06,240
How did you erase everything without even leaving a single thing?

294
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,980
Should I help you recover your memories?

295
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,790
No.

296
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,800
You don't want to remember me?

297
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:46,170
Unnie, did you know?

298
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:49,960
Han Yi Ahn must have really liked you.

299
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:05,180
Missing Person

300
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:12,890
Daebak! Is this the girl you met in Seoul?

301
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:17,230
When Lee Eun Bi died, she was reported as missing. What the heck, are they twins?

302
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,070
Missing?

303
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,810
Eun Bi...

304
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,230
Eun Byul...

305
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,810
Eun Byul. You were really offended, right?

306
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,890
I'm sorry. Without much thought I–

307
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,920
I'll be more careful in the future. Stop being mad now.

308
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,660
Go Eun Byul, it's all my fault.

309
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,950
She said she took it because it was really pretty.

310
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,970
Accept my apology.

311
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,910
Hey, why don't you just accept it?

312
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:40,420
Wow. She's so tough.

313
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,010
I think Go Eun Byul's memory has returned.

314
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,370
Her bad personality's back.

315
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,900
I know, right?

316
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,600
Eun Byul.

317
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,600
Who?

318
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:14,000
Are you perhaps...Soo In?

319
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,670
I heard that you lost your memory.

320
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,790
I see it hasn't returned yet.

321
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,700
Soo In...

322
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,890
died, a year ago.

323
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,070
Do you want to keep all the good memories? -Jung Soo In

324
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,560
Eun Byul! You are Eun Byul, right? You came over often when you were in elementary school. You don't remember me?

325
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,500
Jung Soo In?

326
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,410
I'm Soo In's mother.

327
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,660
Go Eun Byul!

328
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,070
A 808.3...

329
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:02,370
Eun Byul, even though you pretend to not see me, it's okay. You are still my only friend.

330
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,350
Eun Byul, even though you pretend to not see me, it's okay. You are still my only friend.

331
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,570
School 2015: Who Are You

332
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:55,760
Eun Byul cut class and she's not answering her phone.

333
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,810
But I think So Young, the girl that transferred, is a pretty good person.

334
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,550
Go Eun Byul doesn't seem to fancy her too much.

335
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,520
Go home.

336
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,340
Gong Tae!

337
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,000
Just until the bus stop.

338
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,510
-What is it?
-It's Go Eun Byul's.

339
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,560
-Go Eun Byul?
-Yeah.

340
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:18,120
Gong Tae! What are you going to do if you take that?

341
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,970
You have to bring it tomorrow morning!

342
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,670
He's being a bit strange, isn't he?

343
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,160
Wasn't he always strange?

344
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,120
That's true. Anyway.

345
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,100
You want to go eat tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes)?

346
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,130
I have to go to tutoring.

347
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:39,280
Aww, my poor child. You can't even eat anything delicious.

348
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:45,560
From now on solve all the problems.
Start!

349
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:52,150
Problems with this much difficulty... You must solve one question per minute.

350
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:58,460
One minute has passed. Move on to the next problem.

351
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:02,000
Whoever can't solve each problem in a minute,

352
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,320
don't even dream about going to S. University.

353
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,740
One minute has passed. Next problem.

354
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:33,350
Hey, Min Joon. Does that girl even understand the lessons?

355
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,370
Ask Lee Shi Jin yourself.

356
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:39,010
What level is she? Before, she didn't even answer any of the questions.

357
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,530
Aren't her grades a lot lower than ours?

358
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:44,820
If we were going to let her in anyway, why did she take the level test?

359
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,860
Why do you think?

360
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:51,240
She came instead of Go Eun Byul.

361
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,080
Because of Lee Shi Jin, your tuition was cut by $500.

362
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,480
We need to treat her well. She's like our saviour.

363
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,960
Right?

364
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:35,610
Hey rascal, if you had an injury then you should have told me first!

365
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:39,220
Do you know that there are a lot of people who received serious injuries when they tried to hide their minor injuries!

366
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,940
Coach, I'm still okay.

367
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,240
Don't do this competition and take care of that first.

368
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,270
I have to go on this competition!

369
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,920
Do you want to give up swimming after this competition, then?

370
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,280
If you guys feel anything suspicious, let me know right away.

371
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,600
Yes!

372
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:03,290
Coach! Coach! Coach!

373
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,220
Can't I quit private tutoring?

374
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,710
Why are you saying that?

375
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,330
I don't want to do it.

376
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,580
It doesn't match my level.

377
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,950
That's your problem.

378
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,660
You are so weak.

379
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,200
You need to try harder and match the level!

380
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,800
Are you going to quit without even trying?

381
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,400
Why are you crying?

382
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,490
I got it.

383
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,610
Then let's change to arts or sports.

384
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:13,510
Should we do fine arts? Min Joon's mom said that if you go to an expensive class, you could make it.

385
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,740
Music is not your thing.

386
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,210
Mom...

387
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,740
This is so aggravating!

388
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:25,150
What do you want to do in college! What do you want to do?

389
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,890
I said I'll do anything for you no matter what you want to do! Why are you crying?

390
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:35,100
Omo, omo. Look at her. Lee Shi Jin! Omo.

391
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,680
Shi Jin! Shi Jin!!

392
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,200
Where are you going?

393
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:50,540
I'm crying because I don't have anything I want to do. Why?

394
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:56,220
I should be smart like dad or have a pretty face like mom.

395
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,290
Why did you make me like this?

396
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,780
There's nothing I'm good at.

397
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:31,970
That kid followed me again today.

398
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:56,880
If I had turned around, I could have found out who it was but I was scared that I might see the person that is bothering me.

399
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,920
I'm scared.

400
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:55,850
That kid turns off the lights and shuts the door when I am alone.

401
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:01,190
And before I find her, she disappears.

402
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:10,440
I can't tell my mom or make a noise about this

403
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:16,420
because I am a child who deserves this punishment.

404
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,320
What are you thinking about that you don't even know that there is a person here?

405
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,240
What's wrong?

406
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,800
There's something going on, isn't there?

407
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,880
Han Yi Ahn.

408
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:39,620
You said you'd help me recover my memories, right?

409
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,090
Help me.

410
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:49,300
I need to know how I was in the past.

411
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,670
I really want to be the Go Eun Byul from the past.

412
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:07,220
Okay, I will be responsible for your memories and find them.

413
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:12,550
But if I find your memory, you need to grant my wish.

414
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:15,750
Promise.

415
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:18,850
Promise!

416
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,210
Grant a wish.

417
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,650
What are you doing?

418
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,310
Go in.

419
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:08,000
Okay.

420
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,220
I'm giving you ten seconds.

421
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,950
What?

422
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,790
Aish!

423
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,450
What is it?

424
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:56,360
Aren't you here to give her bag back? Since you gave it, it's done.

425
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,050
Nope. I came to see Go Eun Byul.

426
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,650
See you tomorrow.

427
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,960
Aish.

428
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:36,130
Employees of Tongyeong City Hall show real love to the "House of Love"

429
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,380
Hello?

430
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:09,820
Hello?

431
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:13,130
Ra-Ra...

432
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,910
Unnie?

433
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,240
Eun Bi Unnie?

434
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,940
Hello?

435
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:29,470
♫ For you, who is sad and crying ♫
♫ For you, who is struggling ♫

436
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:30,410
Ra Jin.

437
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:37,330
♫ I’ll sing this song for you with all my heart ♫

438
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:44,500
♫ When you think you’re alone, when you suddenly start to cry ♫

439
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:50,340
♫ When you feel like no one is by your side ♫

440
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:57,370
Eun Byul.
 ♫ Remember, that you're not alone ♫

441
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:04,640
♫ Even if the world causes you pain ♫

442
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:11,850
♫ From now on, even you're lonely or sad, don’t cry ♫

443
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:19,010
♫ I’ll hug you without a word, I’ll listen to your words ♫
Right. If you want to cry, then cry.

444
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:24,660
♫ Turn around, I’ll be here ♫
When we're having a hard time, let's not hold back our tears

445
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,240
and live crying together.

446
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,610
♫ I’ll wipe away all your tears ♫
Okay?

447
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:35,490
♫ Even your loneliness ♫
Okay, Mom.

448
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,570
Eun Byul, you don't need anything?

449
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:56,210
No, it's okay.

450
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,090
- Should I buy you clothes?
- There are already a lot in my closet.

451
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,240
Eun Byul.

452
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:14,900
If there's anything you need or want, tell me all of it.

453
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,630
Usually daughters could do that type of thing to their moms.

454
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:19,840
Understand?

455
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:31,070
Mom... by chance, the diary in my room...

456
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:34,780
Never mind.

457
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:40,560
I feel like my test grades will go down this time... What should I do?

458
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,350
Don't be worried.

459
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:47,470
But Mom, I'll try my best.

460
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:49,260
Of course.

461
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,690
I'll help you.

462
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:53,900
Eat everything.

463
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:03,100
Oh, Eun Byul.

464
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,810
Eun Byul! Hey.

465
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,780
Hi, Yi Ahn.

466
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,150
Hey, did Gong Tae give you your bag?

467
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:09,120
How?

468
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,390
I was worried he would just throw it away somewhere.

469
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:15,570
Aigoo.

470
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:17,210
Sorry.

471
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,860
What?

472
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,890
I told you that I'd contact you after I secure the instructors list.

473
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:43,230
There's no need for that.

474
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:45,680
When you make the teams, take Eun Byul out of it.

475
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,500
Aigoo. There must be something you're upset about, huh?

476
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:55,480
Honestly, I put her in out of nervousness since everyone else is dying to do the private lessons.

477
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:00,570
There were a lot of times I felt sorry for Eun Byul whenever I saw her.

478
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:04,070
Now I don't want to make it difficult for the child because of my greed.

479
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:08,220
Oh, I'm about to cry.

480
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:13,250
Honey, that seems like love, right? It's irresponsibility.

481
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:17,090
Think about it again. If you leave, you could possibly never return.

482
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:19,390
I know.

483
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:23,350
I...came to end it.

484
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,480
This is Tae Kwang's drop out request.

485
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,810
He said that if it's his father's wish, he would go.

486
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,230
I suppose that means that's not his choice.

487
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:50,560
When will it be taken care of?

488
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,370
Must you...send him away?

489
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:58,460
Tae Kwang is causing trouble to make me look at him.

490
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:01,820
It's better for his sake that I'm not around him.

491
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:06,640
You're justifying your action like this again.

492
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,370
Just like one year ago.

493
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:14,610
Joon Suk, just listen to me.

494
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:20,800
I'll be keeping this safe.

495
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,460
If Tae Kwang causes any incidents one more time, I will not report it to you, Teacher.

496
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:28,060
But I will take care of it with my own hands.

497
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:42,430
Hi.

498
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:44,650
Hi.

499
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:52,570
Hey, about Eun Byul...

500
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,450
Go Eun Byul? What?

501
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:57,900
When she had memory loss, did she not recognize you guys either?

502
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:01,740
Is that all? She seemed like a totally different person.

503
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:06,770
That's right. That tough Eun Byul, as soon as she sees me, goes

504
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,750
"Hello." That's what she did.

505
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,850
When she lent Lee Shi Jin her book,

506
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,950
she said the handwriting changed drastically.

507
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:18,170
Ah. Really?

508
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:21,460
Totally awesome, right?

509
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:24,660
But why are you so interested in Go Eun Byul?

510
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:31,670
No, it's just interesting.

511
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,080
- Bye.
- You want to go too?

512
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:42,960
Yeah, let's go.

513
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,980
Go Eun Byul, aren't you going?

514
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,350
Ri An, let's go to the convenience store!

515
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:48,220
We'll be going.

516
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:59,010
Eun Byul, can we talk?

517
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,730
What do you have to say?

518
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:13,100
Actually...

519
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,100
there's something that concerns me.

520
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,910
I don't want to hear your concerns.

521
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:21,670
Find someone else.

522
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:24,200
When I was in Tongyeong...

523
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:30,260
there was a famous outcast in our class.

524
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:34,900
In middle school she was the class president and did well.

525
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:40,660
After showing off and butting in she became an outcast instantly.

526
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:46,360
Two years ago, at Tongyeong Noori Middle School

527
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:54,330
Oh Jeong Ha and her head/body ratio 5, the golden ratio.
(being sarcastic for being short)

528
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:57,620
A true shorty.

529
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,770
Guys, stop this!

530
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:20,810
Especially Kang So Young. Don't you think you're being too much?

531
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:31,160
Oh, class president! I never knew you were the righteous kind.

532
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,120
Eun Bi is the best! Wow, she is so brave!

533
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:37,300
Class president, would a head/body ratio 5 (shorty) become a head/body ratio 8 (tall and attractive body type) just because you defend her?

534
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,520
Stop saying "head/body ratio," over and over again.
('head/body ratio' sounds like the word 'idiot' in Korean)

535
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,660
It will make idiot #5, who is listening, feel bad.
('head/body ratio' sounds like the word 'idiot' in Korean)

536
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:50,290
Teacher.

537
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:57,060
I have something to tell you.

538
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,540
Lee Eun Bi.

539
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,990
Do you know what you've done?

540
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:11,220
I'm done after a three-day suspension, but

541
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:14,480
our poor Jung Ah

542
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:20,170
will go from being idiot #5 of our class, to being idiot #5 outcast of the whole school.

543
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,680
What are you doing? It's dangerous!

544
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,980
Don't bully a weak person!

545
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,920
If you have something to say, say it to me.

546
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,130
Will you be okay?

547
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,550
Alright, if you want me to,

548
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,330
I'll just do that.

549
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:51,140
Honestly, it was just joking around among friends.

550
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,300
Because of her death,

551
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:59,880
I, who has no fault, had to transfer.

552
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:12,820
So? What is it that you want to say?

553
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:18,340
Can a dead person come back to life?

554
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:26,140
I'm talking about living another person's life and tricking everyone around her.

555
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:32,690
So I'm planning on finding out

556
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:38,000
if that outcast died or lived.

557
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,690
Your friend died

558
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:48,560
but that's the only thing you can think about?

559
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:52,770
You're quite pitiful.

560
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:59,600
I'm my eyes, since elementary school onwards,

561
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,380
you seemed very pitiful.

562
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:10,370
I knew you would say those words.

563
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:16,730
Our outcast, nothing has changed about you.

564
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:25,280
Lee Eun Bi, long time no see.
