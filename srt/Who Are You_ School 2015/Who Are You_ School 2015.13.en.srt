1
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,270
Mom.

2
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,030
Mom.

3
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,490
Eun Byul.

4
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,380
You...

5
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,800
You're not hurt anywhere?

6
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,680
Yeah.

7
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,020
I'm fine.

8
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,420
Why is your face like this?

9
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,140
What is up with your face?

10
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,260
Mom.

11
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,860
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,970
How?

13
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:55,250
How can you do this? How can you? How?

14
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:01,690
Whether you are alive or dead, you have told me!

15
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,370
I couldn't, Mom.

16
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,790
But,

17
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,050
I'm so happy to see you.

18
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:32,570
Eun Byul. You really are okay, right?

19
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:40,130
This isn't a dream, right? Do you know how much I suffered

20
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,630
whenever I thought of you?

21
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,770
Sorry.

22
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,030
Unnie.

23
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,830
Eun Bi.

24
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,860
Who Are You: School 2015
Episode 13

25
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,800
Then Unnie,

26
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,500
where were you and what were you doing all this time?

27
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,000
Huh?

28
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,200
The place I lived a long time ago.

29
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,060
The orphanage where I met you for the first time.

30
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,080
Why?

31
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,640
Why did you hide without a word?

32
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,320
When we were younger,

33
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,400
the child you met first

34
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,310
was Eun Bi, not me.

35
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,310
What?

36
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,280
When we went to the field trip in Tongyeong,

37
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,200
I knew Eun Bi was living a tough life,

38
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,900
and I knew it was late,

39
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,100
but I thought it was correct to switch places.

40
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,340
That way, I thought I would be able to live.

41
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,600
I didn't even dream

42
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,320
that you were watching over me.

43
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,380
Tongyeong School Trip

44
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,560
Are you crazy?

45
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,240
Hey, Lee Eun Bi. Get your act together! Huh?!

46
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,160
The girl you've protected, Oh Jeong Ha. What is she doing while you are suffering here?

47
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,160
No matter how much you bother me,

48
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,400
I think I'm right.

49
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,800
What is she saying?

50
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,400
Get your act together!

51
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,900
Why are you trying to teach me? You can't even take care of yourself.

52
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,140
Hey. Her dream is to become a teacher.

53
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,300
Can a person who hit a friend

54
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,230
become a teacher?

55
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,440
She can't.

56
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,760
What would the children learn by seeing her?

57
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:12,470
Huh? Huh?
-In that moment, with the thought everything was because of me,

58
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,830
I couldn't do anything.

59
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,030
I couldn't greet Eun Bi confidently.

60
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:24,270
And I couldn't go back to school like this after what happened with Soo In.

61
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,880
♫ When you have lost your path ♫

62
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,800
♫ I will shine a light ♫

63
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,870
Eun Bi! Wake up!

64
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,750
Eun Bi! What should I do?

65
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,660
Eun Bi. Open up your eyes!

66
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,420
Eun Bi! Wake up!

67
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,680
Eun Bi!

68
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,530
Isn't anyone there? Anyone!

69
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:58,360
Isn't anyone there? Please call 911!

70
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,290
Did you call this student's family?

71
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:09,070
No. She gained consciousness, but couldn't remember anything.

72
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:14,790
Her name, age, address, and everything. I called the police for now.

73
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:23,270
♫ I hope you won't cry over wounded heart and get exhausted ♫

74
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,860
Before returning everything the way it should be,

75
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,550
just as much as Soo In and Eun Bi,

76
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:35,190
I needed to be miserable, that's what I thought.

77
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,010
No. Perhaps,

78
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,110
I wanted to find a place away from Soo In.

79
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,810
After Soo In died,

80
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,870
I had tough times.

81
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:59,810
All these times, the bad things I did keep on popping up,

82
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,130
so I was scared.

83
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,120
Also,

84
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,800
seeing the updated school websites made me realize.

85
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,610
If I don't take out the thorn, the scar

86
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,610
would be

87
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,090
infected again.

88
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,720
"The kids who neglected her killed her."

89
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:42,620
How hard must've it been for you all this time alone?

90
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,110
I feel pathetic and hateful at myself for not knowing all this.

91
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,530
Eun Byul.

92
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,770
I'm really sorry.

93
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,730
No, Mom.

94
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,690
I'm sorry.

95
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,550
Unnie.

96
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,350
Even though I'm seeing you this closely,

97
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,950
I still don't believe it.

98
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,770
It's like that for me, too.

99
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:42,610
I had a lot of things I wanted to do with you.

100
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,870
Let's do them all one by one from now on.

101
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,710
What a relief.

102
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,060
I was worried I'd get punished by you.

103
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:06,070
Of course you're going to be punished. Anticipate it after your body recovers.

104
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,860
- Welcome.
-Yes.

105
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,510
Have a seat.

106
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,090
Yes.

107
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,390
Thank you for working out such a bothersome issue for me.

108
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,490
Don't mention it. It's no problem.

109
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,950
I heard you are going to receive a nomination. I congratulate you ahead of time.

110
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,150
Yes, it appears to be that way.

111
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,410
Please help me a lot.

112
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,000
Isn't that So Young?

113
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,320
I'm more thankful that a student with such impeccable grades would come to our school.

114
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,870
Though I'm thankful that you helped me with my issue,

115
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:40,750
I cannot agree to the request for political funds. As you well know,

116
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,320
The foundation's money is not my own.

117
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,540
I thought I could get through to you,

118
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,390
but it appears you're a stiff person.

119
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:59,090
This is off-topic, but after looking into a rumor going around about Miss So Young,

120
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,940
when she was in Tongyeong,

121
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,090
apparently she bullied a girl of similar age to death.

122
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:10,080
It's a world where it's illegal to falsify your address due to school district system.

123
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,380
Would you be okay with that?

124
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,430
Please forget the incident you suppressed.

125
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,780
Then, we may just do that.

126
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,720
After skimming through Jung Soo In's case,

127
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,500
I found an interesting document.

128
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:57,370
What do you think? It's a bit different from what was announced in public.

129
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,500
I heard that person responsible for investigating this has quit.

130
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,440
If I try to find something, there's nothing I won't be able to find.

131
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,480
Prosecutor Kang.

132
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,020
Then, please think about it

133
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,420
and contact me.

134
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,120
Hey.

135
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,770
Don't stare at me.

136
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,810
We look so alike that it's weird.

137
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,770
Same here.

138
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:18,170
It's gonna take a while for me to adjust.

139
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,640
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

140
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,980
Stop copying me.

141
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,950
-This is funny.
-Yeah.

142
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,330
Unnie.

143
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:51,020
Thanks for saving me.

144
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,820
Hey. Forget it.

145
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,610
And, I'm more thankful that

146
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,690
you came back alive.

147
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,310
So what?

148
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,740
Unnie.

149
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,910
Go back to school.

150
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,930
How about you?

151
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:34,250
I'm going to find my name.

152
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:39,470
There are many things to do as Lee Eun Bi.

153
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,970
I will show you.

154
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,460
So that you don't have to be sorry or worry about me anymore.

155
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,480
Okay.

156
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,720
I also am not going to run away anymore.

157
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:05,050
Before it's too late, I have something to do.

158
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,150
Are you talking about Jung Soo In?

159
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,540
Yeah.

160
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,740
Even though it won't be easy.

161
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,160
Do you like it?

162
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,160
I also had a time where I wanted to throw everything away.

163
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,080
The only thing I want

164
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,630
is for you to find what you truly want.

165
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,400
♫ Do you remember ♫

166
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,470
If you don't want to see me, then hurry and start your rehabilitation training.

167
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,160
Then I will stop bothering you.

168
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,300
Since yesterday I started rehab...

169
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:40,700
♫ I ran out of breath, running to where you were ♫

170
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,470
♫ I’ll remember ♫

171
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,400
♫ I missed you so much, everything about you ♫

172
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,430
Hey.

173
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,980
- Eun Byul!
- Go Eun Byul!

174
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,460
- Have you been well?
- Have you been well?

175
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,150
What is she saying?

176
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,260
Did you have a good night last night.

177
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,340
I kinda missed you guys a lot.

178
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,190
You did something wrong to us didn't you?

179
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:08,560
That's right, you saw us at school, but you still missed us that much?

180
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,460
Yeah, my face is the type to miss and want to see over and over again.

181
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,110
Trying to act pretty.

182
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,320
Hey, where are you going?

183
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,160
She said you're embarrassing.

184
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:31,420
Hey, I heard in the main office. Is Eun Byul transferring tomorrow?

185
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,190
No, no way, she never said anything like that this morning.

186
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,490
No, I definitely heard the vice principal telling our homeroom teacher. Right?

187
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,020
I heard it too.

188
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,440
No way, there's no way she wouldn't have told us.

189
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,540
She came to school with us today.

190
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,200
It's true that she's transferring.

191
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,770
Today will be the last day to see Go Eun Byul here.

192
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,530
So today,

193
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,610
I even prepared a transfer present.

194
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,630
What is that?

195
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:21,060
The Tongyeong Lee Eun Bi that was all over the internet,

196
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,380
I told you she was alive.

197
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,500
Where do you think she is right now?

198
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,710
Where is she?

199
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:33,470
The person that you believe is Go Eun Byul,

200
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,490
she is that very Lee Eun Bi.

201
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,590
What kind of nonsense is she saying?

202
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,300
What are you saying now?

203
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,850
Hey. Take it easy.

204
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:53,510
Kang So Young, didn't I tell you to stop? Say something that makes sense.

205
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,970
Go Eun Byul, what is she saying now?

206
00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:00,920
An orphan, outcast, and even received an expulsion. She is instead,

207
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:06,640
Living as Go Eun Byul, pretending like she lost her memory.

208
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,750
Think about it carefully, guys.

209
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:17,140
Even if she lost her memory, the changed Go Eun Byul

210
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,600
wasn't weird at all?

211
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,400
Kang So Young,

212
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:32,800
it's pitiful, but you're wrong about both.

213
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,710
First, I'm not transferring.

214
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,130
Second, I am Go Eun Byul.

215
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,750
Do you have proof?

216
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,130
Why do you need that?

217
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,830
Do you need proof that you're Kang So Young?

218
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,070
Is that so?

219
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:09,550
But I have proof that you aren't Go Eun Byul.

220
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,930
You know that really well too.

221
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,100
Hand it over then.

222
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,250
Korea DNA Center

223
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:24,150
Go Eun Byul and your handwriting comparison results.

224
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:28,410
If this isn't enough, do you want to take a fingerprint test?

225
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:34,170
Handwriting, you just have to write and have a finger print? You'll find out when I do it.

226
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,850
But the need to do all of that is gone.

227
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,730
I remembered all my memories.

228
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,090
This time, I should ask you some questions.

229
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,600
You.

230
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,440
What did you do to my younger sister?

231
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,460
Physical abuse at any time.

232
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,460
Grabbing someone's hair in public is a given.

233
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:09,080
Throwing dirt. Unfair misjudgment.

234
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:19,500
Because of you, a person died and you don't even blink an eye.

235
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,300
What?

236
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,380
Fighting violence with violence is low even for amateurs.

237
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,530
Go Eun Byul is cool.

238
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,510
Wow.

239
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,550
Gong Tae Kwang, your hairstyle changed a bit.

240
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,650
Did Shi Jin reject you?

241
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,710
I shouldn't care about others.

242
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,550
Yes?

243
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,490
I am 11th grade, Class 3's Go Eun Byul.

244
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,780
Should a student come so freely into the chairman's office?

245
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,960
Other students probably don't have much of a reason to meet you.

246
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,060
The occurrence of a chairman personally involving themselves in a student's transfer

247
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,950
-is not common.
- Student!

248
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,230
I can't transfer.

249
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,570
No, I won't go.

250
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,020
Do you think that the school's decision is a joke?

251
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,850
If you need to reopen the disciplinary committee, reopen it.

252
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,400
I no longer have a reason to transfer.

253
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,460
This kid...

254
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,080
I'm so tired of it all.

255
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,920
What?

256
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:13,210
Go Eun Byul, seeing how you treat him, I guess your memories really did come back.

257
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,790
I was really shocked earlier.

258
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:17,300
Kang So Young was attacking her again,

259
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,070
but Eun Byul was like...

260
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:27,090
How much more is Kang So Young going to bother you?

261
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,400
I think she's really whatever.

262
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,220
It's okay.

263
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,220
Whatever she does, I'm not scared of her at all.

264
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,520
Hey. Rooftop.

265
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,260
Rooftop!

266
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,860
Hey, why are you avoiding me?

267
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,870
What?

268
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:58,110
I told you that day that I just...

269
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,720
Just what?

270
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,160
Say it right now then.

271
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,730
Just say it.

272
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,050
Kang So Young attacked you again? Were you okay alone?

273
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,050
Of course I'm okay.

274
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:20,300
Hey, do you know that you really don't look okay right now?

275
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,650
Do you want to die? Hey, Gong Tae Kwang–

276
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,510
Hey!

277
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:34,620
Because a lot of nonsense is coming up in my head right now, just stay still.

278
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,010
What kind of thoughts?

279
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,950
Hey! Move it.

280
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:47,760
Hey, why are you like this?

281
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,160
You... You're acting a lot like the old Go Eun–

282
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,610
Have you been well, Gong Tae Kwang?

283
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,280
I am Go Eun Byul.

284
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,660
You changed a lot.

285
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,960
You're Go Eun Byul? Really?

286
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,290
You're really Go Eun Byul?

287
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,940
What happened?

288
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,040
I heard.

289
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,440
That you helped Eun Bi a lot during that time–

290
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,150
What about Lee Eun Bi?

291
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,620
Where is Lee Eun Bi?

292
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,230
- What?
- Where is she?!

293
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:42,190
♫ I believe I believe, I won’t fall down again ♫

294
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:48,800
♫ I believe I believe, there’ll be no more tears ♫

295
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,660
♫ You know that tomorrow’s sun will rise ♫

296
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:58,650
♫ You know that tomorrow’s sun will rise ♫

297
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:01,570
♫ You never cry  ♫

298
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,480
Lee Eun Bi!

299
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,820
♫ You never cry ♫

300
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,410
Lee Eun Bi!

301
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,430
Eun Byul–

302
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,330
I'm not used to it.

303
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:35,170
Mom. I'm really okay.

304
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,300
Slowly.

305
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,400
I'm sorry I couldn't call your name sooner.

306
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:55,920
We'll correct the death registry first and change things one by one.

307
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,100
I feel like I'm dreaming right now.

308
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,870
I'm that happy,

309
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,240
so don't make that expression.

310
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,590
Okay.

311
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:26,370
Now with me, Eun Byul, and Eun Bi,

312
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,850
let's live happily all three of us.

313
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,850
Forget the painful past, okay?

314
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:51,130
It's a relief you started earlier.

315
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,560
Although the recovery for the joint movement should come first,

316
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,990
Since your body is sculpted as a swimmer, it'll be okay to work on your muscles.

317
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,910
Even if it's hard, it'll be best to get rehabilitation treatment consistently.

318
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,740
Okay.

319
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,840
Teacher Ahn?

320
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,010
You heard that the Ministry of Education has placed a English native teacher, right?

321
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:20,090
Yes. After training, he come to work.

322
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,620
Take care of him well.

323
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,960
Yes. I will.

324
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,380
Teacher Jung. Please see me for a moment.

325
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,200
Yes.

326
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:44,330
Is there any evidence that I posted that?

327
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:49,000
There's something I saw by coincidence,

328
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,890
but about the new math teacher,

329
00:32:53,890 --> 00:33:00,640
she is the sister of the girl who passed away last year, Jung Soo In.

330
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,130
You are Jung Soo In's sister right?

331
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,120
Why did you hide this?

332
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,210
You never asked.

333
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,380
No.

334
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:16,610
Let's think thoroughly.

335
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:20,740
After the dead girl's story came up, the school flipped out.

336
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:25,000
But if that girl's sister is a teacher in this school,

337
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,650
it's so obvious it might as well be a video.

338
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,740
Please bring evidence.

339
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,170
I heard you applied to this school to seek revenge.

340
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:39,650
This can cause serious problems to this school.

341
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:44,310
Please just leave quietly.

342
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,940
Teacher Jung.

343
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:00,540
I've childishly tried texting and threatening

344
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:04,760
to make sure people remembered Soo In and suffer.

345
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,660
You said that my method was wrong, right?

346
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,820
It becomes a method in which you could hurt yourself.

347
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,480
The one who uploaded the post on the discussion board.

348
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,850
That isn't me.

349
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,890
I know. It was me.

350
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:27,630
I will tell them the truth so that you do not get kicked out of here for this reason.

351
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,920
No, forget it.

352
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:36,240
I'm getting kicked out, not because I wrote that message, but because I'm Soo In's sister.

353
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,330
I'm sorry.

354
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,700
I will try, still.

355
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,570
I'll go in by myself.

356
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,080
Ra Jin.

357
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,600
It's me.

358
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:12,210
Is it really Eun Bi unnie?

359
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,180
Unnie!

360
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,280
- Noona!
- Unnie!

361
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,210
Look! I told you she wasn't dead!

362
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:37,930
Of course not! She died, but she came back after reading my letter.

363
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,820
Letter?

364
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:44,000
Young Ho wrote on the school's wishing tree.

365
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,780
Wishing that you would come back alive, he wrote a letter every day.

366
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,440
You did?

367
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:06,600
Unnie. You went somewhere far because you had a hard time here, right?

368
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:14,120
Young Ho and Seung Min don't cause trouble anymore and became nice.

369
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,270
It's not like that.

370
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:21,360
Also, I will help you a lot,

371
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:26,770
so don't leave us behind and go somewhere.

372
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,270
Okay.

373
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:42,390
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

374
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,560
Do you have to do that?

375
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,270
I'm sorry, Mom.

376
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:04,590
But, I have to clean something up from here.

377
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,070
Okay.

378
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:13,670
You're coming back, but I'm acting like this for nothing, right?

379
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,600
You're coming back. To our home in Seoul.

380
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,580
Okay. I get it.

381
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:29,660
I'll be home first. Rest for a few days.

382
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,240
Okay, Mom.

383
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,830
Gong Tae Kwang?

384
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,710
Hey, Lee Eun Bi. What the hell we--

385
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:28,310
Gong Tae Kwang.

386
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,560
How are you here?

387
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,440
What do you mean? I took a bus.

388
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,170
What is up with you? Why are you here?

389
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:38,470
- It just became like this.
- It just did?

390
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,700
Is it all if it becomes like this?

391
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:45,020
Is it all if you leave without a goodbye or a word?

392
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,540
Gong Tae Kwang. I didn't come here to be here forever.

393
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,090
Hey. Do you call that talk?

394
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,430
If you came here forever then you shouldn't have left.

395
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,420
Don't bother Eun Bi Noona!

396
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,580
What?

397
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,280
Guys. It's not like that.

398
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,400
I saw you yell at Eun Bi unnie!

399
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,860
He's a bad oppa, right?

400
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,370
Hey, that.

401
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,640
Calm down.

402
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,680
You calm down, you.

403
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,190
Hurry up and leave after eating.

404
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:40,180
- Do I have to go?
- If you don't,

405
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,900
what about school?

406
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,180
Wow, I've been too good lately.

407
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,500
I don't normally go to school that well.

408
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,010
Why are you guys not sleeping when it's so late?

409
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:04,110
Get up now. One, two–

410
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,870
Did you brush your teeth?

411
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,510
Seung Min, you're going right to the bathroom to brush, then go to bed.

412
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,510
Okay.

413
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,470
Young Ho and Ra Jin, you guys go right to bed.

414
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,750
- Okay.
- Okay.

415
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:36,380
If you don't leave within one hour,

416
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,200
you're going to miss the last bus.

417
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,250
Really?

418
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:44,300
Alright.

419
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:57,730
So, are you happy that Go Eun Byul returned?

420
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:59,590
Yeah.

421
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,900
I like it to the point of not being able to believe it.

422
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,820
Go Eun Byul was the same.

423
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,700
What?

424
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,250
She has a bad hand habit.

425
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,690
I got hit today too.

426
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:22,710
What about you?

427
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,620
What are you going to do now?

428
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,990
I don't know.

429
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,350
I feel like my place is here originally,

430
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,570
but I also feel like I need to go back to Seoul.

431
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:40,700
One thing I'm sure of

432
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,130
is that from now on, my place is not being someone else,

433
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:50,550
but it's something that I get to choose and decide.

434
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:56,790
Do that. Wherever you go, tell me before going.

435
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,110
Go now.

436
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,340
Alright.

437
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,390
Hey.

438
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,800
Gong Tae Kwang.

439
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,480
I've been wanting to say these words for a long time...

440
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:44,990
Thanks for everything.

441
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,520
Making it so I don't have to lie in front of you,

442
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:57,090
calling my name first,

443
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:59,920
and always making me smile.

444
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:04,880
Also,

445
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:10,470
for not being able to become that kind of a person for you,

446
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,300
I'm really sorry.

447
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,600
Hey, stop there.

448
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,700
Goodbye,

449
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,570
Gong Tae Kwang.

450
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,800
But, you know what?

451
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,560
What?

452
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,740
I missed the last bus.

453
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,630
What?!

454
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,920
Hey.

455
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:20,640
You said you know everything. Until when are you going to keep doing this when you know?

456
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,260
Until the words sorry stop coming out of your mouth.

457
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,230
Okay?

458
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,740
Should I do it too?

459
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:33,040
Brush my teeth?

460
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,700
Hey, Han Yi Ahn.

461
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,410
Oh.

462
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,620
What brings you here at this time?

463
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:31,830
Hey, do I need to have a reason when I wanted to meet you?

464
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,660
What?

465
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:43,770
Oh, right. I was hesitating whether to tell you or not since you might misunderstand,

466
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,740
but I started rehabilitation.

467
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,620
What rehabilitation?

468
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,060
Of course, my shoulder.

469
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,200
Shoulder?

470
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,010
Alright, you're going through rehab, but why would I misunderstand?

471
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:08,680
If I start rehabilitation, you're going to start saying things like,
"I won't bother you. I won't see you anymore. I'll disappear."

472
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,520
You'll say those kinds of stuff.

473
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,520
Hey, Han Yi Ahn.

474
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:24,670
Do you think or not? A shoulder is everything to a swimmer.

475
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:27,510
How did you get hurt?

476
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,050
You should have been careful.

477
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:34,250
Hey, why

478
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:37,300
do you keep talking about other things?

479
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:40,520
You don't know why I got into an accident?

480
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:50,160
Han Yi Ahn.

481
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:54,410
During the school trip,

482
00:47:54,410 --> 00:48:00,120
after separating with you, it really bothered me.

483
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:05,130
But, at that time, I didn't have the time to think about someone else...

484
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,610
You...

485
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,490
What are you?

486
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:14,670
Hey, that hurts. Let go and talk.

487
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:17,510
You...

488
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,710
Sorry.

489
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:32,130
You have the right to be angry. I won't play around or get annoying

490
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:35,110
until you're not angry.

491
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,920
I won't even hit you.

492
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,140
For real.

493
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,160
I promise.

494
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,250
Go Eun Byul.

495
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:52,820
Yeah, it's me.

496
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,500
Long time no see, Han Yi Ahn.

497
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,820
I'm not in the mood to be fooling around.

498
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,970
What the...

499
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:18,710
How am I supposed to take in this unbelievable situation?

500
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,790
I had a reason I couldn't tell you.

501
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:25,220
I'll tell you everything slowly.

502
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:30,020
Hey, I said I'm really sorry.

503
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:30,790
Go Eun Byul.

504
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:34,230
I'm also depressed and really sorry.

505
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:37,070
So, why don't you just let it go?

506
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:42,670
Is this all you could have done?

507
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:49,530
When you disappeared and when you returned?

508
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:55,980
How I felt when you died

509
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:01,410
and how I would feel when you who's supposed to be dead suddenly shows up fine in front of me.

510
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,690
You've never thought about it, even once, right?

511
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,030
Hey.

512
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,950
Even if I'm ignorant and rude, do you really think that I would have done that?

513
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:17,810
Then you shouldn't have made it like this!

514
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:21,400
Like you're saying, why are you getting so mad over this?!

515
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,520
Right, you're always like this.

516
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:33,110
The worry I had for you was so big.

517
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:35,830
Let's say that's why I'm doing this.

518
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:42,530
Because you've safely returned, I'm happy, thankful, and it's a relief,

519
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,110
but because I can't comfortably smile,

520
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,370
I'm sorry.

521
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:08,870
School 2015: Who Are You

522
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,620
Teacher.

523
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,220
Yeah, Eun Byul.

524
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:33,190
I got my memories back.

525
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:38,330
Because they returned, I'm not going to run away or avoid it,

526
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:43,850
and I want to apologize to Soo In.

527
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:50,730
- Eun Byul–
- Truthfully, before I lost my memories,

528
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,470
I dreaded and hated coming to school.

529
00:51:56,470 --> 00:52:03,310
That night, one year ago... Ever since I touched Soo In's shoulders and hand,

530
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:08,810
Soo In was following me.

531
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:14,100
At school, on the streets,

532
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:17,900
and even at home,

533
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,540
she was there.

534
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,540
I'm sorry.

535
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:31,550
Because my classmates might treat me the way they treated her,

536
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:35,120
I really hated it and it made me scared.

537
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:41,680
No matter how much I regret it, I won't be able to go back to that time.

538
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:49,460
I still really want to reveal the truth.

539
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,510
Don't you want to do that too, Teacher?

540
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,470
You're right.

541
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:04,660
Because I was lacking, I'm sorry for putting this on you as well.

542
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:07,680
I'll correct everything right away.

543
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:16,610
You pig, you pig, you pig bastard.

544
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,360
Wow he's super strong!

545
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:34,440
It is the police department's hope to take responsibility for all of the country's people

546
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:46,180
Lee Eun Bi!

547
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,720
Hey, aren't you going to wake up?!

548
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,930
Here, here.

549
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:04,250
Hey, I got it!

550
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:07,290
Get up!

551
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:09,480
Hey!

552
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,450
Goal, goal!

553
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:15,260
Geez!

554
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,540
Hey, Lee Eun Bi!

555
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:21,970
Hi, Unnie!

556
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,350
Hey, hey.

557
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:25,560
Hurry up and play.

558
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,410
Hey hey hey!

559
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:31,410
What are you doing there? Hurry up and come here.

560
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:35,640
Hey, let's play. It's Lee Eun Bi!

561
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:39,750
♫ Out of the countless people ♫

562
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,510
♫ The fact that I met you ♫

563
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:50,900
♫ It must be fate ♫

564
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:55,300
♫ When I’m going to you ♫

565
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,400
♫ Wherever that is  ♫

566
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:06,300
♫ So you can hear it ♫

567
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:12,100
♫ I'm calling out  ♫

568
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:19,820
Han Yi Ahn, you asked me this before, right?

569
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:27,420
Why I didn't tell the truth when my memories came back.

570
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:35,270
I guess I knew it would turn out like this between you and me if I told you everything.

571
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:49,140
Hey, until when do I have to be cautious around you?

572
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:54,700
Since when were you a person that was cautious of others?

573
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,790
I got caught.

574
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:02,310
But why did you hurt that shoulder?

575
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,000
It was an accident.

576
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,300
What accident?

577
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,910
During training?

578
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:11,260
It's not like that.

579
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,850
You should've been careful.

580
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:17,510
What is this during an important time?

581
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:21,740
But, where's Lee Eun Bi right now?

582
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:28,750
Tongyeong, Love House where Eun Bi used to live.

583
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:32,290
Tongyeong?

584
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,470
She's really gone back?

585
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,470
Not sure.

586
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:46,690
Mom and I are also waiting anxiously for Eun Bi's decision.

587
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:52,810
She'll return if her memories here were good,

588
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:56,890
and if not she's probably going to say that she'll stay at Tongyeong.

589
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:04,290
How did it seem when you saw her?

590
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:08,250
Did Eun Bi have a hard time?

591
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,060
What do you mean hard?

592
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:20,990
There's someone who's protecting her with all his life.

593
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,960
Did Lee Eun Bi go back to Tongyeong?

594
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,180
No wonder.

595
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:38,660
I thought why you were acting up when you were just a loner.

596
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:46,570
Aigoo, what can our athlete Han Yi Ahn do now that he regrets it?

597
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:53,340
Hey, Kang So Young. What do you want to say now?

598
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:56,860
You know what?

599
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:04,200
Han Yi Ahn gave up his game and got into an accident while running to school.

600
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:11,790
- What?
- Who was he trying to save to make that kind of a rash decision?

601
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:18,300
At that time, he already knew that it was Lee Eun Bi, not Go Eun Byul.

602
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,410
What is she talking about now?

603
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:29,400
Hey, Han Yi Ahn. I'm curious about something.

604
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:33,660
The person you like,

605
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:40,050
is it Go Eun Byul or Lee Eun Bi?

606
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,900
