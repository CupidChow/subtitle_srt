=The Rise of Zhao Jiadi=

2
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,820
(Adapted from "Out of His League"
by Fenghuo Xizhuhou)

3
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,940
=Episode 19=

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,759
Something happened!

5
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,479
Chen Hongxiong bribed
Tianyi Heavy Industries

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,530
with a hefty sum
to end their collaboration with us.

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,640
I reached out
to the other manufacturers,

8
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,439
but none of them

9
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,679
would take our order.

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:57,840
Jiadi,

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,399
is there any other way?

12
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:07,159
We still have time.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,100
We'll produce it ourselves.

14
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,439
Ourselves?

15
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,000
Us?

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,840
This is the only way.

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,799
That's brilliant.

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,280
Splitting production
across multiple suburban factories

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,799
and setting the lab

20
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,599
in a remote, old area.

21
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,200
Not only does it prevent tech leaks,

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,760
but it also saves us on rent.

23
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,040
All five factories are ready.

24
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,159
I've also recruited

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,280
retired core engineers
from Tianyi Heavy Industries.

26
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,840
They're at your disposal.

27
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,120
And me, too.

28
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,000
That's great.

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,760
The order is due in ten days.

30
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,319
And the workflow design alone

31
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,239
takes five days.

32
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,920
Producing 50 machines

33
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,760
in such a short period

34
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,040
is impossible.

35
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,840
There's only one solution.

36
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,519
We develop the workflow

37
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,920
and begin assembling the machines
at the same time.

38
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,599
Without a complete workflow chart,

39
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,959
there's no way the factories
can assemble the machines.

40
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:04,920
Listen.

41
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,079
First,

42
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,879
we run experiments here

43
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,840
to finalize the workflow.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,300
Then, we keep the factories updated
in real-time on the assembly process

45
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,090
of filter materials, Reverse Osmosis
membranes, and filter cartridges.

46
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,080
Next, we deliver the core component,

47
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,560
the smart water purifier chip,

48
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,080
to the factories
for quality checks and assembly.

49
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,400
That way,

50
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,919
once the workflow design is completed,

51
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,400
all 50 machines
can begin production immediately.

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,479
Mr. Chen,

53
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,520
lately, Chai Yanzhi

54
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,120
has been buying up factories

55
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,199
and hiring

56
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,080
retired engineers
from Tianyi Heavy Industries.

57
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,639
Should we look into this?

58
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,560
They're just a bunch
of good-for-nothing.

59
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,120
They won't amount to anything.

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,199
Do you think

61
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,439
Zhao Jiadi still stands a chance?

62
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,360
No.

63
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,879
If you want to be crowned,
you have to bear its weight.

64
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,479
When there's no conflict of interest,

65
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,120
everyone supports him.

66
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,800
But when their interests are threatened,

67
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,919
how many will still stand by him?

68
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,960
(This setback)

69
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,280
(has instead)

70
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,439
(hold us all together.)

71
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,400
(With the urge and common belief,)

72
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,599
(we fight together.)

73
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,879
(No success comes without hardships.)

74
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,159
(I believe)

75
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,520
(we will create a miracle.)

76
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,719
Mr. Chen,

77
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,560
Zhao Jiadi and his team

78
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,520
are working day and night at the base.

79
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,919
It's said that students
from Haicheng University

80
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,170
are helping them voluntarily.

81
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,080
But if he thinks he can pull this off

82
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,479
with a bunch of good-for-nothing,

83
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,560
he's just delusional.

84
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,080
How stupid.

85
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,680
How will you ever understand
what Zhao Jiadi's doing?

86
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,599
Yet you're here gloating,

87
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,199
thinking you've already won.

88
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,560
Fifty machines were completed on time

89
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,720
and delivered here.

90
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,480
Tomorrow, we hand everything over

91
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,639
to the Haicheng municipality.

92
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,839
Good work, everyone.

93
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,439
You must be tired.

94
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,319
Go and rest.

95
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,120
Bye.

96
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,160
Finally, we can rest.

97
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:48,759
Right.

98
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,690
Let's grab something to eat.

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,560
Bye.

100
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,040
Boy, stones aren't fun.

101
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,079
Let's play with fireworks.

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,720
I don't know how.

103
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,439
Don't worry. I'll teach you.

104
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,439
Hold tight.

105
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,319
Hold tight.

106
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,480
Raise it high.

107
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,720
This is fun.

108
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,879
Fire!

109
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,439
Be good, and go home now.

110
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,590
The police have arrived.
You'll take over from here.

111
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,959
Mr. Chen, this isn't

112
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,199
what you said to me.

113
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,240
Mr. Chen.

114
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,800
You can't do this to me, Mr. Chen.

115
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,279
I pay you

116
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,160
for your loyalty.

117
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,240
Otherwise,

118
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,360
why wouldn't I keep a dog instead?

119
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,720
Don't forget.

120
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,319
Your daughter's good life

121
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,839
came from me.

122
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,839
Hello, Boss.

123
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,519
I'm here.

124
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,319
Once I get the stuff,

125
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,439
I'll bring them over.

126
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,600
Got it.

127
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,060
The police are investigating
the cause of the fire.

128
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,319
Had you lost your mind?
You just ran in there.

129
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,199
You could've died.

130
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,920
I was anxious.

131
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,879
Those machines are
the result of our hard work.

132
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,000
They're all burned.

133
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,199
I can't accept this.

134
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,839
I regret it now.

135
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,079
Was it my stubbornness
that dragged you all down with me?

136
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,360
I underestimated Chen Hongxiong.

137
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,160
If this goes on like this,

138
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,279
you won't be safe either.

139
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,279
I'd rather give up.

140
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,360
Boss,

141
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,600
do you remember

142
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,360
what I was like when you first came?

143
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,040
You told me

144
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,720
that people forget how to stand

145
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,639
if they kneel too long.

146
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,120
Boss,

147
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,600
don't let Chen Hongxiong
get away with this.

148
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,639
Do what you must.

149
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,480
Did you enjoy the fireworks display
last night?

150
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,200
You think you can beat me?

151
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,480
Of course.

152
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,159
You have nothing now.

153
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,559
Still dreaming of
turning the table around?

154
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:03,759
Zhao Jiadi,

155
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,440
mark my words.

156
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,240
You're a hopeless rogue,

157
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,240
just like your dad.

158
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,559
In this life

159
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,200
or even the next,

160
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:16,320
you'll never be a hero.

161
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:55,759
Mr. Baliang.

162
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,879
Are you hungry? Let's go eat.
