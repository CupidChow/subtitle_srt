(Three Years Later)

00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,330
(With this ten thousand yuan
scholarship,)

6
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,940
(Chen Jiahao, third-year student)
(my living expenses are secured.)

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,060
(at Haicheng University)
(My mom will be burdenless.)

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,960
That is not cool.

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,439
You changed dorms
without telling me.

10
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,380
I am in a good mood today,
so let us go eat together.

11
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,340
No thanks, Ma Xiaotiao.

12
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,879
You've got some money there.

13
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,439
Isn't your family loaded?

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,120
Exactly.

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,239
We never noticed
for three whole years at university.

16
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:17,719
(Scholarship)

17
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,880
You have to buy us a meal today.

18
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,480
You're not free, huh?

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,220
Alright, I'll leave you to it.

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,239
Same old rule.

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,640
Hao will be buying this meal.

22
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,599
Don't go yet.

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,599
Who are you?

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,519
I have ten thousand yuan too.

25
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,239
Do you want it?

26
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,519
(Could he be)

27
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,760
(the kingpin of Tanshan,)

28
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,040
(Zhao Jiadi?)

29
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,439
No thanks, I don't even know you.

30
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,879
I'm not taking it.

31
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,959
Aren't you in need of money?

32
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,800
I have money.

33
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,800
We are classmates.

34
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,860
We should help each other.

35
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,410
I have something to do, so I'm off now.

36
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,240
Go ahead and pick it up.

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,400
Lend me a hand.

38
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,280
Hurry up. Quick.

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,479
(Chen Jiahao.)

40
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:37,759
We are classmates.

41
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,500
So we should help each other.

42
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,879
Why haven't you reported it
to the school?

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,479
Do you not want your money back?

44
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,240
They've bullied me for three years.

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,439
I didn't want to make a scene,

46
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,759
so I changed dorms.

47
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:00,759
Your cowardice and tolerance\ will only make things worse.

48
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,560
I'm meeting them tonight.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,880
You're coming with me.

50
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,759
Drink it, it's especially for you.

51
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,479
I... I can't drink.

52
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,280
Can I not drink it?

53
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,400
Drink it.

54
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,520
If it weren't for you,

55
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,220
would Zhao Jiadi and I
have a falling out?

56
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,479
You should know what to do.

57
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,919
I'll drink it.

58
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,159
Do you have a death wish?

59
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,599
Sorry...

60
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,159
Did you know how expensive my outfit is?

61
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,919
Ma Xiaotiao.

62
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,680
Continue your act.

63
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,620
Pretending to be a rich kid, huh?

64
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,719
Your so-called branded clothes
are all counterfeit.

65
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,120
But here's the thing.

66
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,520
Your stupidity is genuine.

67
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,000
Please don't...

68
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:01,479
Zhao Jiadi.

69
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:01,919
Let's talk it out.

70
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't push your luck!

71
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,759
What's the matter, Ma Xiaotiao?

72
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,919
They dared to dine and dash
in Ms. Cai's place.

73
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,400
No.

74
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,039
Well, how bold you are.

75
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,719
I'm nothing but easy-going.

76
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,199
You should at least get me this much.

77
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,079
Ten thousand yuan.

78
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,800
I have it.

79
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,490
Here's ten thousand yuan.

80
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,120
(Zhao Jiadi.)

81
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,079
(I'm going to teach you a lesson today.)

82
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,890
I don't believe
that's ten thousand yuan!

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,990
Pick it up and count it!

84
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,680
Yes, pick it up!

85
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,890
- Hurry, pick it up!
- Pick it up!

86
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,519
I will pick it up.

87
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,180
I will pick it up.

88
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:40,480
Go!

89
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,810
- I will pick it up.
- Chen Jiahao.

90
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,480
It's fine, I can pick it up.

91
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,680
Whose takeaway is this?

92
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,360
Over here.

93
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,000
Aren't you the campus belle?

94
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,506
(Yuan Shu, third-year student)
Was the part-time job you mentioned

95
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:57,839
(at Haicheng University)
food delivery?

96
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,800
Drink with me for a bit and I will pay you
for the part-time job.

97
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,160
Fifty-eight yuan, pay up.

98
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,399
Chen Jiahao, pay up.

99
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,240
What are you waiting for?
Pay for the food.

100
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,920
(Zhao Jiadi, you're trying
to play the hero, huh?)

101
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,560
(Ma Xiaotiao, you...)

102
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,040
Chen Jiahao.

103
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,170
If you act like this,
people will just find you weak.

104
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,879
They will think you are a pushover.

105
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,680
If you don't stand up today,

106
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,160
you will be trampled on forever.

107
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,639
If you keep kneeling,

108
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,560
you will never stand again.

109
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,000
Chen Jiahao, do you want to fight?

110
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,639
Stop it

111
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,839
or I will fight back.

112
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,879
Zhao Jiadi.

113
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,510
You won't get away with it today.

114
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,279
Get him!

115
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,360
- Get him!
- Hit him!

116
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,279
Bear this in mind.

117
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,800
Students must not fight

118
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,160
unless it is self-defense.

119
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,400
Otherwise, never get physical.

120
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,839
I've called the police.

121
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,319
Zhao Jiadi, I was wrong.

122
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,079
I apologize to you.

123
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,730
The one you should apologize to

124
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,519
is not me.

125
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,160
Chen Jiahao.

126
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,600
Sorry.

127
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,120
Zhao Jiadi.

128
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,120
Here's your money.

129
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,000
I got it back.

130
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,959
Chen... Chen Jiahao?

131
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,319
Give me back that ten thousand yuan!

132
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,959
Give it back to me!

133
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,980
(Cai Yanzhi, Chairman of Donglei Group)
(Cai Yanzhi,)

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,500
(Cai Yanzhi, Chairman of Donglei Group)
(known in the field as Ms. Cai,)

135
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,900
(Cai Yanzhi, Chairman of Donglei Group)
(nicknamed Green Bamboo Leaf Green)

136
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,420
(Cai Yanzhi, Chairman of Donglei Group)
(is the chairman of the business giant)

137

(Cai Yanzhi, Chairman of Donglei Group)
(Donglei Group)

138
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,199
(and the widow of Haicheng's
former richest man, Yang Qingdi.)

139
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,439
(She is a well-known
and powerful local figure)

140
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,160
(with businesses all over Haicheng.)

141
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,920
(She is also the actual controller
of the commercial streets)

142
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,800
(around Haicheng University.)

143
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,439
- Ms. Cai
- Good evening, Ms. Cai.

144
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,410
I'll leave you all to it.

145
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,759
(He's a student,
but he uses a classic Patek Philippe.)

146
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,880
Do not think
the police ruling of self-defense

147
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,990
means we will let it slide.

148
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,370
You still have to compensate us
for the dining bar's damage.

149
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,560
Can I have something to drink?

150
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,279
Tell me how you want to solve this issue.

151
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,630
There's no solution to it.

152
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,639
What?

153
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,480
Ma Xiaotiao, put that down.

154
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,279
Put that down.

155
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,399
Looks like you came prepared.

156
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,160
I'd like to discuss
something bigger with you.

157
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:19,800
Go on.

158
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,759
You are the real controller
of these two commercial streets.

159
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,160
But the profits here

160
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,759
are pitifully low.

161
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,040
The core problem is

162
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,759
that there are shops but few customers.

163
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,270
This area isn't thriving at all.

164
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,039
Give me one month.

165
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,519
I will turn this street
into a sea of people.

166
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,399
Your shops and land

167
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,759
will naturally soar in value.

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,600
Ms. Cai.

169
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,759
We can't just trust him like that.

170
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,919
What if he tricks us?

171
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,639
I'm full.

172
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,840
Do you need anything for that?

173
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,519
Of course.

174
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,159
An initial capital of one million yuan.

175
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,639
One million yuan?

176
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,360
Ms. Cai, he is not worthy.

177
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,360
One month.

178
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,879
If I fail, this house is yours.

179
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,080
(Tangchen Yipin.)

180
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,090
(It's a house
that's worth at least five million.)

181
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,480
Ms. Cai, are you letting him off
just like that?

182
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,000
I didn't ask to meet him today.

183
