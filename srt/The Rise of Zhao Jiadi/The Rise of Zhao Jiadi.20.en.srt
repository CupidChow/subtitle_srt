(Adapted from "Out of His League"
by Fenghuo Xizhuhou)

00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,940
=Episode 20=

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,679
Mr. Baliang,

5
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,399
Hao is right.

6
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:50,399
We should

7
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,840
stick to our dreams

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,759
and keep striving.

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,960
For this goal,

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,210
we should keep working forward.

11
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:56,640
By the way,

12
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:58,640
Li Ran, Zhang Kuan,

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,479
and Rammstein are not coming.

14
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,340
They all gave the same reason.

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,599
Ideals are fragile
in the face of reality and power.

16
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,480
A bunch of cowards!

17
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,799
Mr. Baliang, I have to say this.

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,040
If it weren't for you,

19
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,319
I'd still be

20
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,519
a worthless trash.

21
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,760
But after meeting you,

22
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,760
I finally found meaning in my life.

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,799
Mr. Baliang,

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,079
this is what I'm going to say.

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,920
No matter what you do in the future,
I'll always be your loyal friend.

26
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,599
Say something.

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,940
There's nothing to say.

28
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,040
Mr. Baliang,

29
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,200
what does that mean?

30
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,000
You all don't have to bear this with me.

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,400
I'll take full responsibility

32
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,599
for the breach of contract.

33
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,480
Are you drunk?

34
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,560
I'm serious.

35
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,650
I shouldn't have dragged you into this

36
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,840
for my own dream.

37
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,319
Graduation,

38
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,000
getting jobs,

39
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,719
marriage, and starting families.

40
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,199
I messed up your life

41
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,840
because of my ignorance.

42
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,719
So,

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,680
I'm a proud scoundrel.

44
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
After this, we all go our separate ways.

45
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:26,879
Mr. Baliang,

46
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,759
you've got to be kidding.

47
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,599
We've worked together for so long,

48
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,960
this can't be how it ends.

49
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,039
Nothing's certain until the end.

50
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,479
Give her the seat.

51
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,890
I convinced Tianyi Heavy Industries

52
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,560
to restart the collaboration.

53
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,599
Please sit here.

54
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,000
Thanks.

55
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,080
Excuse me, another chair, please.

56
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,960
Zhao Jiadi,

57
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,039
as long as you sell the patent,

58
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,159
Tianyi will send over
their team and equipment

59
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,520
right away.

60
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,800
That's great news.

61
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,570
Let's have a drink.

62
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,350
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

63
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,719
On what condition?

64
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,560
They said

65
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,630
the patent has to be credited to you

66
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:12,599
and no others.

67
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,890
Then I'm not selling.

68
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,319
Zhao Jiadi,

69
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
now it's not the time
to throw a tantrum.

70
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:26,199
As long as we have something
to hold on to, we have a chance.

71
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,879
If we can get past this hurdle,

72
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,759
we have the chance to start over.

73
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,719
A hurdle?

74
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,879
This is my principle and bottom line.

75
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,800
I have nothing to lose.

76
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,600
I'll start from scratch if I have to.

77
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,280
Zhao Jiadi,

78
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,520
do you know how rare this chance is?

79
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,919
How can you be

80
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,400
so stubborn?

81
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,479
Enough.

82
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,719
That's easy for you to talk.

83
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,319
That's enough.

84
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,180
- You...
- All right.

85
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:52,800
Let's go.

86
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:56,960
Zhao Jiadi,

87
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,840
I misjudged you.

88
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,280
Go on.

89
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,560
Why are you looking at me?

90
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:11,840
Leave.

91
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,080
Leave.

92
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,360
And you two,

93
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,560
all you know is acting tough.

94
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,240
You're not cut out for business.

95
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,480
Leopard!

96
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,160
Get lost.

97
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,839
Don't worry.

98
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,720
I'm fine.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,600
Bye.

100
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,120
(Baliang,)

101
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,959
(I know you won't give up.)

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,150
- Mr. Baliang.
- Mr. Baliang.

103
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,800
Boss.

104
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,399
Come.

105
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,000
Come on in.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,220
Boss, I'd like to have a drink.

107
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,759
Bring more friends here.

108
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,230
I'll give you a discount.

109
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
Hello, here's your milk tea.

110
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,920
Leopard,

111
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,879
refill the tea bucket.

112
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,990
There's one more bucket left.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,240
We're almost out of syrup.

114
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,199
Later,

115
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,879
I'll order more.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,680
Hurry.

117
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,399
Zhao Jiadi is really something.

118
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,519
Be patient, everyone.

119
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,199
One cup per person.

120
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:58,680
(Everyone,)

121
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,879
(I'm Zhao Jiadi
from Haicheng University.)

122
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,880
(I'm sure many of you
who've been following this tech forum)

123
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,959
(probably know my name.)

124
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,480
(I'm writing this letter)

125
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,319
(because I have a dream.)

126
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,439
(I believe this world)

127
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,160
(shouldn't be stagnant,)

128
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,399
(dark,)

129
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,720
(and pedantic.)

130
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,920
(This world needs fresh air.)

131
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,160
(This world)

132
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,279
(should be driven by conscience,)

133
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,920
(not by money or fame.)

134
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,759
(What makes us human)

135
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,079
(is)

136
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,560
(Carp Tea)
(our ability)

137
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,079
(to create a better future.)

138
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,680
(A month ago,)

139
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,399
(my team and I)

140
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,680
(upgraded the 3R smart waste processor.)

141
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,480
(Just as we were about)

142
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,759
(to introduce it to the world,)

143
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,439
(some people tried to block us)

144
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,600
(and steal our work.)

145
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,560
(I tried. I fought back.)

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,519
Hey.

147
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,399
(But I failed.)

148
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,240
Look at this.

149
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,279
(Even so, I believe)

150
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,079
(technology)

151
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,199
(should benefit the whole world,)

152
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,920
(and not be a tool for capitalism.)

153
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,360
(Therefore,)

154
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,399
(I've decided to open-source)

155
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,350
(all the upgraded technologies
invented by 3R Green Future)

156
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,319
(for free.)

157
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,600
(If it's a torch,)

158
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,879
(I hope someone will carry it)

159
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,480
(and fight for their dreams.)

160

(Sharing technology
for the benefit of all)

161
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,260
(is the right way
for technology development.)

00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,680

(One week later.)
Zhao Jiadi,

167
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,680
come down. You've got deliveries.

Zhao Jiadi.

170
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,199
I'm here.

171
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,120
Over here.

172
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:46,959
You're Zhao Jiadi?

173
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:47,680
I am.

174

Mister, where did these come from?

They're from Jingbei,

and the University of Technology.

This morning,

the Green Future launch event

187
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,879
was held at the municipal auditorium.

Zhao Jiadi,
the student who leads the project,

189
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,639
cut the ribbon with municipal officials.

has dealt a major blow

193
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,200
to our traditional industries.

194
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,000
As of now,

195
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,120
the stock is plummeting.

196
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,399
The estimated loss is
at least 200 million.

197
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,440
