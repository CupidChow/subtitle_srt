=The Rise of Zhao Jiadi=

00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,820
(Adapted from "Out of His League"
by Fenghuo Xizhuhou)

3
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,940
=Episode 22=

4
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,230
Excuse me.
Here's your beef offal noodles.

5
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,500
This is your beef noodles.

6
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,120
I made ten million yuan
before graduation.

7
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,400
You lost.

8
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,400
Tell me.

9
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,799
Do you really want
to shame your own father?

10
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,400
Don't forget.

11
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,560
I started everything from scratch.

12
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,400
All that I have today, I earned.

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,239
Well...

14
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,780
I guess you're half as impressive
as I was back then.

15
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,239
Stop flattering yourself,

16
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,599
Zhao Sanjin.

17
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,040
Do your words still count?

18
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,599
In my life,

19
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,910
I have met countless people.

20
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,439
I can forgive small mistakes.

21
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,159
And I deal with big ones.

22
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,599
However...

23
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,200
The one I can never figure out

24
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,920
is you,

25
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:05,959
Zhao Jiadi.

26
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,879
So it's true.

27
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,560
Even if I earned everything
with my own hands,

28
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,120
you still believe I owe my success

29
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,840
to you.

30
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,879
Everything I wanted to prove

31
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,639
means nothing to you.

32
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,360
Jiadi.

33
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,280
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm off,

35
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,159
old man.

36
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,080
Figure out a way
to access the data in it.

37
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,639
What is this?

38
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,039
It's Jinhai's lifeline.

39
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,919
He is your husband.

40
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,280
Are you that scared of him?

41
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,560
And I am his wife.

42
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,439
I've now chosen to side with you.

43
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,439
This is why

44
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,439
I like your kind the most.

45
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,199
You're just like dogs.

46
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,120
You follow those

47
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,520
with a bone.

48
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,040
I came to work with you.

49
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:21,920
You?

50
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,079
Are you even worthy?

51
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,399
If you're not sincere, forget it.

52
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,199
You think

53
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,720
you still have the right to back out?

54
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,079
To make way for Zhao Jiadi,

55
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,199
Zhao Xin even stripped your brother
of his position.

56
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,481
And your son still wants to fight
with Zhao Jiadi over the company?

57
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,800
He's just a mere cannon fodder.

58
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,839
As for Jinhai's shares,

59
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,560
Yangge must get half of them.

60
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,519
That depends on
whether this document is worth it.

61
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,839
(It turned out)

62
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,439
(that Zhao Xin
was behind Qi Wufu's fatal car accident)

63
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,480
(ten years ago.)

64
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,120
(With his overseas wire transfers)

65
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,720
(and secret illegal accounts,)

66
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,839
(it's enough to destroy him.)

67
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,040
If Zhao Xin gets out,

68
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,439
I'm done for.

69
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,000
As long as I'm here and this is here,

70
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,680
he's not getting out.

71
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,980
(Reward Notice)

72
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,140
(Jinhai Group Work Injury Report)

73
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,240
He killed the boy's father,

74
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,399
then raised him for twenty years.

75
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,800
Zhao Xin, that bumpkin,

76
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,920
does have some guts.

77
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,639
Mr. Zhao Xin.

78
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,590
According to our investigation,
you're linked to a homicide case.

79
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,290
Please come with us
and cooperate with our investigation.

80
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,519
A homicide? How could that be?

81
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,279
I have no idea.

82
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,639
These two hicks

83
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,439
really think they can take me on?

84
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,839
Chen Hongxiong.

85
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,680
Do you know

86
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:11,240
what's the quickest way
to deal with a scheming rat like you?

87
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,639
Do you know

88
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
you look even better now

89
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,560
than you were?

90
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,319
You're probably unaware of it.

91
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,439
Your parents' fatal car crash

92
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,960
had something to do with Zhao Xin.

93
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,090
You were adopted by him
when you were small.

94
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,920
You thought he was like a father to you.

95
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,519
In fact,

96
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,959
he just sweet-talked you

97
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,680
into being his servant.

98
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,759
Take a look at this.

99
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,879
Kill me if you want to.

100
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,740
(Reward Notice)

101
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,680
It would be my pleasure

102
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,600
to be killed by you.

103
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,240
These are the photos
from your dad's crash site.

104
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,279
It took me a lot of effort

105
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,600
to retrieve them
from the police archives.

106
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,199
And Zhao Xin's face

107
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,279
is clearly in the shots.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,920
All these years,

109
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,759
your dad's murderer
has been right beside you.

110
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,959
How ironic.

111
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,199
Join the Tran Organization.

112
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,839
I will help you get revenge.

113
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,240
How about it?

114
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:44,720
In your dream.

115
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,279
It's my problem.

116
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,600
So stay out of it.

117
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,319
Madam.

118
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,000
Mr. Zhao was taken away by the police.

119
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,360
(Sanjin, oh, Sanjin!)

120
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,439
(That day has finally come.)

121
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,200
Madam!

122
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,879
Somebody help us!
