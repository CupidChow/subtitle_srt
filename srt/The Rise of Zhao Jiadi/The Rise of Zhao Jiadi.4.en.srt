00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,870
=The Rise of Zhao Jiadi=

2
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,820
(Adapted from "Out of His League"
by Fenghuo Xizhuhou)

3
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,940
=Episode 4=

4
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,920
Mu Hongli.

5
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,590
What do you think about the project
on starting a business outside campus?

6
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,470
None of your business.

7
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:55,240
Zhao Jiadi.

8
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,079
What is it?

9
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:56,920
Move aside.

10
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,260
I'm on my way to pick a project.

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,159
That's perfect.

12
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,920
I came to discuss
project selection with you.

13
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,830
Would you like to team up with me?

14
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,320
Nope.

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,560
You'd better not regret it.

16
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,040
Don't forget.

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,079
I'm the excellent student representative
of the business school.

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,519
The milk tea from this shop is nice.

19
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,200
Do you like it?

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,040
I plan to use this shop as my project.

21
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,239
That will be
my token of affection for you.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,840
But it's a pity.

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,239
This shop is about to close down.

24
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,280
I know.

25
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,480
I'm going to bring it back to life.

26
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,079
What a boaster.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,910
You forgot your milk tea.

28
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,599
It's yours now.

29
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,599
(I'll make milk tea
as the starting point for the project)

30
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,280
(and fulfill the bet with Zhao Sanjin
along the way.)

31
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,200
Mr. Baliang.

32
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,560
Is the start-up fund from school enough?

33
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,439
No problem is too big for Mr. Baliang.

34
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,490
(Based on my study
and data collection these days,)

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,359
(the daily footfall here is over 3,000.)

36
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,150
(It triples
or quintuples during holidays.)

37
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,319
(University students account for)

38
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,760
(62.5% of it.)

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,040
(If Boss takes over this milk tea shop,)

40
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,120
(with our brains together,)

41
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,560
(we're bound to make it work.)

42
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,079
This milk tea is delicious.

43
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,280
I cannot even pay my mortgage now.

44
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,920
And my wife wants to divorce me.

45
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,520
She said I was deceived.

46
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,400
I've been guarding this shop
for four or five years.

47
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,150
But I haven't been able to run it well.

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,919
There have hardly been any customers.

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,759
What good is tasty milk tea, then?

50
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,120
Sparrow.

51
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,159
Give me the contract.

52
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,919
You don't need
to invest anything at first.

53
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,680
Make six hundred thousand in a month?

54
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,319
How is that possible?

55
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,520
It's hard enough
to make two hundred a day here.

56
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,919
If there's a loss, I will pay you sixty.

57
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,300
(Three Days Later)

58
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,450
You said there would be a large crowd

59
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,280
at half past seven.

60
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,090
But I don't see any.

61
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,080
Five minutes left.

62
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,719
Sirs.

63
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,159
Would you like a milk tea?

64
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,479
The original price is ten yuan.
There's a 50% discount today.

65
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,790
It's 50% off. Should we get one?

66
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,560
Sorry.

67
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,159
We've marked the price up.

68
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,879
It's 15 yuan a cup.

69
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,719
Let's go. Forget it.

70
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,039
Are you even helping me here?

71
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,360
You are forcing me to the edge!

72
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,719
Three minutes left.

73
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,400
I'll have one of that.

74
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,240
Fifteen yuan.

75
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:11,680
Forget it.

76
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,439
Mister.

77
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,599
Please have mercy on me!

78
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:15,840
One minute left.

79
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:17,879
You!

80
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,840
Time's up.

81
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,840
Here they are!

82
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,879
What a big crowd!

83
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,000
(Carp Tea)

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,879
Come.

85
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,439
Please come inside.

86
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,560
- Sir, one cup for me.
- Please come inside.

87
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,360
- Sir, one cup for me.
- Here.

88
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,319
That doesn't make sense.

89
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,719
Wasn't that milk tea shop
about to close down?

90
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,272
- How come it's suddenly so popular?
- I'll have one too.

91
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:50,870
I heard they've had a new owner.

92
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,240
It's a young man, no less.

93
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,400
I think he studies

94
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,919
at a nearby university.

95
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,800
Oh, right.

96
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,360
I think he's from Haicheng University.

97
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,159
A student?

98
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,240
What's his name?

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,280
I think it's

100
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,879
Zhao something Di.

101
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,000
Zhao Jiadi.

102
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,639
This is all you have got, huh?

103
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,960
(Hiring actors to form a queue?)

104
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,800
(What a trivial trick.)

105
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,240
I heard the milk tea here
is really good.

106
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:16,720
Here's your milk tea.

107
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,800
Only 100 cups are available each day.

108
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,910
Recommend it to your friends too.

109
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,279
You'll get discounts.

110
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,319
Well, here's your milk tea.

111
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,240
Pudding green milk tea, thank you.

112
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,590
Didn't you only invite fifty people?

113
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,480
How come so many turned up?

114
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,300
I don't know either.

115
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,720
Nearly two hundred people showed up.

116
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,910
They're all from
the nearby commercial streets.

117
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,279
I don't know them.

118
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,279
Is my milk tea ready?

119
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,079
How many cups left?

120
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,680
When will it be my turn?

121
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,920
Another three cups
of snowy oolong milk tea.

122
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,680
Six cups of strawberry yogurt.

123
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,519
Well, Leopard,

124
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,600
top up the tea barrel.

125
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,279
Four more cups
of pudding green milk tea.

126
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,670
We have only one barrel of tea left.

127
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,920
And syrup is running out too.

128
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:41,879
Hold on.

129
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,480
I'll order more immediately.

130
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,279
Go now.

131
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,000
Zhao Jiadi is something else.

132
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,120
Everyone, please be patient.

133
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,800
Each person is allowed only one cup.

134
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,240
(Carp Tea)

135
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,879
Hongli.

136
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,000
Carp Tea? They changed the sign.

137
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:52,720
How strange.

138
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,800
Was this milk tea shop
ever this crowded before?

139
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,639
I heard they've had a new owner.

140
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,160
And he's from our campus.

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,720
With this crowd,

142
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,120
we won't get to have it today.

143
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,110
We'll come again tomorrow.

144
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,639
Sure.

145
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,040
Let's go.

146
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,480
Okay.

147
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,879
Zhao Jiadi?

148
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:09,800
Well...

149
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,560
A stroke of red carp touches the heart.

150
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,399
It's named after you.

151
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,480
Are you happy with it?

152
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,040
From now on, you get free milk tea here.

153
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,079
Zhao Jiadi, I never noticed that.

154
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,399
I used to think you were

155
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,720
a clueless straight man.

156
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,950
As long as she says yes to it.

157
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,639
What a sweet talker he is.

158
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,950
Hongli, do you think
he is handsome than ever?

159
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,590
Stop talking nonsense.

160
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,759
Zhao Jiadi, it's my treat today.

161
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,560
Two cups of brown sugar fresh milk.

162
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,240
He is lactose intolerant
and does not like sweet stuff.

163
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,560
Who are you?

164
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,839
I am...

165
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,839
His sister.

166
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,070
We aren't biologically related.

167
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,500
But we're childhood sweethearts

168
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,720
who grew up together.

169
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,399
Baliang.

170
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,240
I'll have two cups of coconut oolong.

171
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,399
Sure.

172
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,639
Well, Mr. Baliang,

173
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,240
should we make coconut oolong first

174
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,959
or brown sugar milk tea first?

175
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,000
Customer is king.

176
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,260
So just make both together.

177
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,879
But there's only one machine.

178
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,519
Can't you read the room?

179
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,879
With two important customers here,
we must not neglect either.

180
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,839
Coconut oolong

181
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,160
is a classic choice.

182
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,519
It's not too sweet,

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,570
but it comes with a lasting aftertaste.

184
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,240
Take a sip

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,120
and it lingers long.

186
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,720
Brown sugar fresh milk
is nothing but innovative.

187
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,319
Though brown sugar is sweet,

188
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,879
it goes perfectly with milk.

189
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,319
- Baliang.
- Jiadi.

190
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,990
- Which one will you have?
- Which one will you go with?

191
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,319
Little did I expect

192
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,320
Mr. Baliang to have a hard time
making a choice.

193
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,639
Both are the best flavors.

194
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,680
Each has its own charm.

195
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,879
What else do you want to have?

196
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,240
I'll order them for you.

197
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,680
Do you have that one and only flavour?

198
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,439
Baliang's favorite flavor

199
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,160
is the most unique one.

200
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,800
Looks like

201
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,000
you could use some help here.

202
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,319
This is my business partner, Ms. Cai.

203
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,360
The milk tea shop
is at risk of closure.

204
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,270
So I need to have a word with her.

205
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,680
Alright, then.

206
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,959
I have a meeting, so I'm off.

207
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,759
I have class, so I'm leaving too.

208
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,120
Sister.

209
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,199
Looks like there are more than
one classic flavours.

210
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,590
Let's try them together after this.

211
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,240
Sure.

212
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,040
We'll try them together.

213
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,959
One month is almost up.

214
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,160
What I want is genuine prosperity,

215
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,600
not just temporary bustle.

216
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
I know that.

217
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,040
Whatever we do, the results matter most.

218
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,839
Some kindling.

219
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,240
Some firewood.

220
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:49,079
We will make it burn.
