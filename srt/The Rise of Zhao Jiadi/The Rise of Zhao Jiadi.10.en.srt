=The Rise of Zhao Jiadi=

2
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,820
(Adapted from "Out of His League"
by Fenghuo Xizhuhou)

3
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,940
=Episode 10=

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,320
(Zhao Jiadi, I'll say it again.)

5
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,119
(Without me, you're nothing.)

6
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,000
Only ten days left.

7
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,640
It's not too late to regret it.

8
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,159
I can up the stakes.

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,399
Fine. Ten million after graduation.

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,560
As long as you make it,
I'll do what you say.

11
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,439
I already said it.

12
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,359
Once I make it, you apologize to my mom.

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,240
As for who I am,

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,900
I'll figure that out

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,079
before graduation.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,959
Interesting.

17
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,560
We meet again.

18
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,599
The business Empress, Qi Dongcao.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,439
You really live up to the name.

20
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,719
Smart and beautiful.

21
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,400
A girl like her working under some thug

22
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,280
at Jinhai Group?

23
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,879
What a waste.

24
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,640
Showing up uninvited

25
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,640
is typical of your generation.

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,040
Chen Hongxiong,

27
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,719
you might as well
change your name to Chen Hoaxer.

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,680
You stalked me all the way
to a noodle stall.

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,359
I'm here for Zhao Jiadi.

30
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,640
I heard you and your dad

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,680
are playing some very interesting game.

32
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,400
I'm intrigued.

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,120
Zhao Jiadi,

34
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,480
need a hand?

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,680
From you?

36
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,239
Why?

37
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:07,319
When you spend money,
it's to have fun, right?

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,879
If I can make that nouveau riche
bumpkin eat dirt,

39
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,159
it'd be enough
to keep me happy for days.

40
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,680
So how do you plan to help?

41
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,599
If you can best me, then I'll help you.

42
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,560
I'm really starting
to take an interest in you.

43
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,319
But the loser has to pay the price.

44
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,319
What do you have to offer?

45
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,039
A stake in the milk tea shop.

46
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,879
How much?

47
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,159
Let's say...

48
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,479
twenty percent.

49
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,680
I thought you'd go all in.

50
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,280
No need to go big.

51
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,719
Just enough is enough.

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,199
What are we playing? You pick.

53
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,719
You decide.

54
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,919
What?

55
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,879
Certainly.

56
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,159
You pick.

57
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,479
Interesting. I like it.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,960
Alright, let's get this game started!

59
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,039
Boss.

60
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,960
Garlic, please.

61
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:01,719
Coming!

62
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,039
You two want a game, huh?

63
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,080
Alright.

64
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,719
Let's go. Peel garlic, bet odd or even.

65
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,439
Pick one.

66
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,800
Age before wisdom. You go first.

67
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,199
Zhao Jiadi.

68
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,360
"Jiadi" as in top
of the imperial exam list.

69
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,879
It means best of the best.

70
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,120
And "one" is an odd number.

71
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,039
So, you believe in destiny.

72
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,439
Which means you can only pick even.

73
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:40,919
That's fine.

74
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,759
I believe in destiny too.

75
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,360
Alright then.

76
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,039
Let's play your little game.

77
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,240
Odd.

78
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:03,800
Even.

79
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:05,919
Odd.

80
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,120
Even.

81
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,439
Odd.

82
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,839
Even.

83
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,079
Odd.

84
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,199
Even.

85
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,399
Odd.

86
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,199
Even.

87
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,279
Odd.

88
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,680
Looks like destiny's still on my side.

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,160
Draft a share transfer agreement now.

90
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,490
Make it out to Tran Organization.

91
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,839
Yeah, do it immediately.

92
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,519
Boss, the contract
will be signed tomorrow.

93
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,680
Kid, you're a pretty decent gambler.

94
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,079
Way more interesting than your old man.

95
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,600
I didn't get to see
that bumpkin eat dirt,

96
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,319
but I did get to see
something even more fun.

97
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,199
See you around.

98
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,680
Most expensive garlic
in all of Haicheng.

99
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Won't you try some first?

100
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,800
Garlic's not my thing.

101
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,519
Coffee suits me better.

102
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,360
My new secretary's really good at this.

103
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
You're always welcome
to drop by for coffee.

104
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,439
I'll be waiting.

105
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,879
This kid is kind of interesting.

106
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,839
That guy is a fool.

107
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,590
Boss, even if you refused to pay

108
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,519
after losing the game,

109
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,920
what could he do about it?

110
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,199
So you're saying

111
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,600
I bested a fool?

112
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,319
That's not what I meant.

113
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,279
Then are you saying

114
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,920
I misread the situation?

115
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,879
That I didn't consider
the consequences of losing?

116
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,319
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,639
I misspoke.

118
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,759
Or do you think

119
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,439
my word

120
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,560
is not even worth two million?

121
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,519
Please forgive me.

123
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,759
A beautiful coffee cup

124
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,480
makes me hesitate to smash it.

125
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,519
So,

126
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,040
you'd better learn when to keep quiet.

127
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,639
Not everyone at the table

128
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,480
deserves to play the game.

129
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,240
But I'm already at the table.

130
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,199
And I'm not leaving.
