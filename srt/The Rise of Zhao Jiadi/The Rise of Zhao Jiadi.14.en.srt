=The Rise of Zhao Jiadi=

2
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,820
(Adapted from "Out of His League"
by Fenghuo Xizhuhou)

3
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,940
=Episode 14=

4
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,039
The shares in the commercial street
are just the first step.

5
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,079
Next up,

6
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,679
there are still plenty of battles
with Chen Hongxiong.

7
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,560
- Mr. Baliang.
- Cai.

8
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,840
Slacking off again?

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,479
Not a bad, huh?

10
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,399
You're like a bad penny.

11
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,880
Cai, don't get it wrong.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,799
I didn't fight you
for Yang Qingdi before.

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,280
But this time with Zhao Jiadi,

14
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:07,519
I won't give up so easily.

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,439
I didn't mean that.

16
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:10,920
Why are you overthinking it?

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,079
So you're saying

18
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,599
he's up for the grab?

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,840
Besides,

20
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,680
Zhao Jiadi

21
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:22,000
doesn't meet your dad's standard
for a son-in-law anyway.

22
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,280
His standards don't matter.

23
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,599
But I know your judgment, Cai Yanzhi.

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,239
It won't be wrong.

25
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,719
Let's have another drink.

26
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,280
Green Leaf Tech really
pulled its weight this time,

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,560
yet I got nothing
in return as its heir.

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,719
I'm upset.

29
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
So, what do you want?

30
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,519
Come on, finish this drink.

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,120
We'll call it even.

32
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,400
I'll let it slide.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,680
I'll drink it for my Mr. Baliang.

34
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,719
Alright.

35
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,159
Not good enough. Come on.

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,520
One more shot.

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,280
Why are you looking at her? Look at me.

38
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,120
This drink really hits.

39
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,560
Wait, I'm feeling dizzy.

40
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,719
Maybe you should take her home.

41
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:37,919
Alright.

42
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
Take me home.

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,560
Lie down first.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,479
Lie down.

45
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,280
Lie down, come on.

46
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,159
So long.

47
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,039
I'm going too!

48
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:47,879
I want to go home!

49
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,840
Wait for me.

50
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,360
What are you doing?

51
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,520
Texting Hongli, of course.

52
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,520
Didn't you see it?

53
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,039
She's the one chasing after our boss.

54
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,639
Stop texting her.

55
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,840
Zhao Jiadi?

56
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,400
Since you're already here, don't leave.

57
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,759
You're drunk. Get some rest.

58
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,000
Zhao Jiadi, are you in there?

59
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,879
Weren't you taking her home?
Why are you still here?

60
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,840
You sure took your time getting here.

61
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,240
Where is she?

62
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,319
Inside.

63
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,280
Take care of her. I'm heading out.

64
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,560
Sometimes,

65
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,479
I really wonder...

66
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,120
Are you even really
a third-year student in college?

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,840
You're drunk.

68
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,080
You were expecting someone else?

69
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,280
It must be Chen Jiahao.

70
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,000
I didn't order anything.

71
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,279
(Yuan?)

72
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,600
I was delivering barbecue over here.

73
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,720
Then...

74
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,639
I saw you and a drunk girl

75
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,639
go into the room.

76
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,240
I bought you hangover pills.

77
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,279
Appreciate it.

78
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,120
That was thoughtful.

79
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,439
So much for staying out of it.

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,639
You just swooped in halfway.

81
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,360
That's not cool, you know.

82
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,240
How is she doing?

83
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,279
She's fine.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,959
Actually, I came to tell you
something important.

85
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
When I was compiling the CET-4 list,

86
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,120
I noticed your name wasn't on it.

87
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,120
CET-4? I'm not taking that exam.

88
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,319
One more thing.

89
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,879
It's about Ms. Jiang.

90
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,120
She found out
you didn't register for CET-4.

91
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,000
She's furious.

92
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,680
She's searching the campus for you.

93
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,839
Let her.

94
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,319
She won't catch me anyway.

95
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:15,959
I...

96
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:21,240
Come inside.

97
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,480
If you like someone, just say it.

98
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,680
Be honest with him.

99
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,519
Do you have something to tell me?

100
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,800
I've wanted to thank you

101
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,480
for the other day.

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,720
Ever since you dealt with Zheng Kun,

103
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,600
things in the student council
have been better.

104
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,399
Students from poor families

105
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,800
are no longer looked down on.

106
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,600
I just wanted to say...

107
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,000
Can't we sleep on weekend nights?

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,439
Now, this should be fun.

109
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,879
Why is it you?

110
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,480
What are you doing here?

111
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,759
Skipping CET-4

112
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,160
to check into a hotel?

113
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,639
And why are you here?

114
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,240
Our dorm's water got cut off.

115
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,879
Tell me, what is it about Zhao Jiadi

116
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,079
that makes everyone like him?

117
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:19,439
Nonsense. She's our homeroom teacher.

118
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:21,959
Ms. Jiang.

119
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,000
You came all this way

120
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,959
just to push me to take CET-4?

121
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,079
Zhao Jiadi, watch your attitude.

122
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,240
I am your homeroom teacher.

123
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,519
Jiadi.

124
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,839
Zhao Jiadi?

125
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,360
Who's that?

126
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,480
Jiadi?

127
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,439
My girlfriend.

128
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,879
I'll talk to you later.

129
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,959
Join us.
