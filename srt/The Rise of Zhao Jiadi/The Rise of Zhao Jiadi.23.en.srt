00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:45,960
(Memorial)

5
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,079
Respected leaders,

6
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:50,600
guests,

7
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,280
and friends.

8
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,159
Mr. Liu is here, Fangfei.

9
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:54,799
Ms. Huang.

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,990
Thank you for coming, Mr. Liu.

11
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,280
Zhao is in trouble.

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,799
And Zhao Jiadi is unreliable.

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,200
I honestly have no idea what to do.

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,280
Mr. Zhang.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,640
I'm counting on you.

16
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:07,280
Ms. Huang.

17
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,040
From now on, I will be in charge

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,079
of the company.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,200
Send me the financial report later.

20
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:12,840
Sure.

21
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,280
Thank you.

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,200
Rest assured.

23
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,680
I will give full cooperation to you.

24
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,239
Ruiyang,

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,200
you need to pay more attention

26
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,439
to operations after all.

27
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:25,159
All of us are overwhelmed with grief.

28
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,879
(Sorrows come with tears)

29
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,799
Now, let us

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,840
(May her spirit live on)
honor Madam Zhao Guifen together.

31
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,680
Baliang.

32
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,500
You've been kneeling here
for over two hours.

33
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,560
Grandma wouldn't want
to see you in this state.

34
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,719
You still have responsibilities to bear.

35
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,640
You are Zhao Jiadi.

36
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,719
What's the point

37
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,760
of my life now?

38
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,680
Go back.

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,759
Take over Jinhai Group.

40
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,719
Do what you need to do.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,479
That's what truly matters.

42
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,360
I came to build an empire
with bare hands.

43
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,319
Baliang,

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,439
I need an heir.

45
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,439
You have to return home eventually.

46
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,240
So you already knew.

47
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,800
Then why did you not know

48
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,280
that Zhao Jiadi is my son?

49
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,639
Jiadi.

50
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,560
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:43,919
You!

52
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,319
Chief Financial Officer.

53
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,039
You took my job

54
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,439
and this is how you work?

55
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,719
Starting today,

56
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,719
I'll be in charge
of all financial matters.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,800
You're fired.

58
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,960
Mr. Zhao hired me.

59
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,159
Who are you to dismiss me?

60
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,039
Mr. Zhao?

61
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,560
He is never coming back.

62
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,960
Anyone else have a problem?

63
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,400
Feel free to leave with him.

64
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,240
Dismissals were always made by Ms. Qi.

65
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,800
We only listen to her.

66
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,360
Like I don't know what you are?

67
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,680
Have you forgotten
what happened between us?

68
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,160
You forced me into it.

69
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,079
You still think Qi Dongcao

70
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,560
is going to stand up for you?

71
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,680
In your dream!

72
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,040
Zhao Xin is her dad's murderer.

73
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,959
She can't wait for Jinhai to collapse.

74
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,759
Starting today,

75
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,319
this company belongs
to the Huang family!

76
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,160
Huang Ruiyang.

77
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,990
What is Zhao Jiadi doing here?

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,300
Has it been so long
since you got put in your place

79
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,180
that you forgot who you are?

80
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,680
Your family is finished, Zhao Jiadi.

81
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,990
And you still have the nerve
to show your face here, loser?

82
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,680
Do I look like I'm afraid of you?

83
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,560
I'm not sure about my family's fate.

84
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,000
But you sure are done for.

85
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,879
You already had your chance.

86
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,560
And you didn't learn from your mistake.

87
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,600
A leopard can't change its spots.

88
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,240
Mr. Huang Ruiyang,

89
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,959
you're under investigation for bribery.

90
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,040
Please come with us.

91
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,079
What?

92
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,639
You must be mistaken.

93
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,639
I didn't do anything!

94
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
From this day forward,

95
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,360
Jinhai Group

96
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,439
will officially be run by me,
Zhao Jiadi.

97
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,639
Anything Zhao Xin could do, I can do.

98
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,290
And what he couldn't do,

99
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,519
I'll get it done.

100
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
If you stay,

101
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,879
you're family to me.

102
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,600
If you leave,

103
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
I won't stop you.

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,079
Easier said than done!

105
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,920
Your stepmother, Huang Fangfei,
ran off with all the group's money.

106
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,240
Our partners are lining up
at the door to collect debts!

107
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,360
And Mr. Zhao is in jail!

108
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,040
The company is without a leader now.

109
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,590
We have given our all
for the sake of Jinhai.

110
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,279
We've given it our best years.

111
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,519
All our effort is wasted now.

112
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,560
How will you make that up to us?

113
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,199
You might as well sell off the assets

114
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,360
and split what's left!

115
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,279
Here's ten million.

116
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:58,170
It'll be used
as the group's emergency fund.

117
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,800
Everyone who stays
will receive compensation.

118
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,000
I promise within six months,

119
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,120
not only will Jinhai rise again,

120
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,600
I'll turn it

121
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,570
into the biggest commercial empire
in the country.

122
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:11,319
Whether you stay or not,
that is up to you.

123
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,720
(Resignation Letter)

124
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,839
(CEO Qi Dongcao of Jinhai Group)

125
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,480
(formally announced her resignation.)

126
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,839
(She went on to start Jinchao Group.)

127
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,160
(Sources say)

128
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,360
(the reason for her departure)

129
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,680
(was tied
to Chairman Zhao Xin's arrest.)

130
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,920
(The court hereby declares)

131
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,920
(that Defendant Zhao Xin)

132
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,839
(is found guilty
of intentional homicide.)

133
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,560
(He is sentenced to ten years in prison)

134
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,560
(suspended for two years.)

135
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,079
Zhao Xin.

136
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,720
Aren't you just a dog?

137
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,399
Yes...

138
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,959
That's more like it.

139
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,279
Scram.

140
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,439
Crawl out.

141
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,680
(Zhao Jiadi.)

142
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,560
(The game has officially begun.)

143
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,160
Boss.

144
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,120
Mr. Baliang.

145
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,839
Mr. Baliang.

146
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:30,560
Jiadi.

147
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,120
We will always have your back.

148
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,079
I am still your startup mentor.

149
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,519
(My name is Zhao Jiadi.)

150
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,279
(My story is just getting started.)

151
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,869
(After a retrial by Haicheng Court,)

152
00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:03,541
(evidence was found insufficient
to convict Zhao Xin.)

153
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,758
(The previous verdict was overturned.)

154
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,960
(Zhao Xin was declared innocent.)

155
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,570
(Chen Hongxiong is under investigation)

156
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,785
(for arson and commercial crime.)

157
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:10,460
(Police have officially summoned him.)
