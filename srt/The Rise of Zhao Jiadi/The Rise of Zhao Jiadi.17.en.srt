=Episode 17=

4
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,280
Hao.

5
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,690
How much money do I have left?

6
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:50,280
Hang on.

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,439
With the first dividend
from Ms. Cai's shares

8
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,359
and the shop's steady profits,

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,520
we have

10
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,280
a total of

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,439
8,736,278.20 yuan.

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,159
Just one more step to win the bet.

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,799
Right.

14
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:08,920
Donate it all to the university.

15
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,239
Every last cent.

16
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,280
(Hey.)

17
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,640
(This is Zhao Jiadi.)

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,280
(40 days ago,)

19
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,079
(I stood up for all the freshmen)

20
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,040
(and took down Zheng Kun.)

21
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,599
(Now,)

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,860
(I've earned 9 million
from starting a business.)

23
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:36,719
(Some admire me.)

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,200
(Some envy me.)

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,100
(But that's not the point.)

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,319
(I want to use this money
to buy something. Hope.)

27
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,519
(Like me,)

28
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,840
(you just need a chance.)

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,760
(If I can do it,)

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,799
(so can you.)

31
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:54,959
(Because)

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,719
(no one is born trash.)

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,480
We're all treasures
waiting to be discovered.

34
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,159
Impressive.

35
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:02,920
- Right.
- Yes.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,799
(I believe)

37
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,799
(everyone has value.)

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,840
(And even if we lose everything,
we'll earn it back again.)

39
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,360
(Haicheng University Bulletin Board)

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,220
It's really happening.

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,400
Classic Zhao Jiadi.

42
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,422
Impressive.

43
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,568
(Important Notice)

44
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,808
(The First
Campus Startup Incubation Center)

45
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,180
(Is Officially Open)

46
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,960
We promoted the program.

47
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,719
Why isn't anyone showing up?

48
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,280
They probably think

49
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,340
we're just messing around.

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,000
Fair enough.

51
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,370
Nobody trusts free stuff

52
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,560
that come out of nowhere.

53
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,000
It's not a freebie.

54
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,590
It's a real opportunity.

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,680
Someone will come.

56
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,840
Excuse me,
is this where I apply for the program?

57
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,080
Yes!

58
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:45,919
Yes.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,439
Yes.

60
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,390
You got the right place.

61
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,000
Come in.

62
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:49,639
Please come in.

63
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,439
Tell us about your project.

64
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:52,719
It's a water purification device.

65
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,080
Good.

66
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,599
And its primary purpose?

67
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,879
Its main purpose is
to help people be lazy.

68
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,180
All technological progress

69
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,199
serves human laziness.

70
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,520
So what's the main use case?

71
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,360
Dorm rooms.

72
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,560
Who doesn't want to stay in bed
all day in the dorm?

73
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,319
With this,

74
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,479
you won't even need
to get up on cold winter nights.

75
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,840
Its filtration level is so high,

76
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,000
it can turn urine into purified water.

77
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,000
And it takes up very little space.

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,080
100,000.

79
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,560
I'll sell you the patent for 100,000.

80
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,680
Deal.

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,380
If it passes the test, I'll buy it.

82
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,280
Yes!

83
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
100,000?

84
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,199
This is a high-efficiency
soundproof shield.

85
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,520
How efficient?

86
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,439
Put it on, and no matter

87
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,319
what movie you're watching,

88
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,960
your roommates won't hear a thing.

89
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,800
What matters most in this century?

90
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,000
Privacy.

91
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,199
And it's only 150,000.

92
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,759
150,000?

93
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,400
I'll take it.

94
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,520
Really?

95
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,199
What's that you're holding?

96
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,560
A deadly weapon I made.

97
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,120
Why does it

98
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,560
look like a speaker?

99
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,159
It's a German war machine.

100
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,159
What does it do?

101
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,159
It can crush anything hard
in this world.

102
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,719
What has it crushed so far?

103
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,520
Love letters I wrote to her.

104
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,240
She left in such a hurry that day.

105
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,879
I wanted to send her off,

106
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,360
but we were so close, yet so far.

107
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,120
In the end, I couldn't catch up.

108
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,560
How much for it?

109
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,040
100,000.

110
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:33,959
Okay.

111
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,120
Deal.

112
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,120
Yes!

113
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,879
It can purify water.

114
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,560
I'll take it.

115
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,560
Good eye.

116
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,279
It can dry your hair in under a minute.

117
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,279
1,000,000.

118
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,480
I doubt that'll work.

119
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,360
How about 10,000?

120
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,879
Deal.

121
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,959
This one shakes to pump water. 50,000.

122
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,040
Sold.

123
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,480
It can quickly dry your clothes.

124
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,319
Small ones, at least.

125
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,399
5… 50,000.

126
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,639
500 it is.

127
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,360
Thanks.

128
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,120
This one lights up when powered.

129
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:01,959
I'll pass.

130
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,439
No, that's not

131
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,720
what I meant to pitch.

132
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,480
This is actually a vacuum cleaner.

133
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,660
You can have it.
I don't want it anymore.

134
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,399
All right.

135
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,480
One at a time.

136
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,040
Just leave it here.

137
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,720
No rush!

138
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,839
So all this stuff cost you 9 million?

139
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:31,000
These things by themselves
aren't worth 9 million,

140
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,350
but I can make them worth that much.

141
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,480
And how's that?

142
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,319
As Emperor Taizong said,

143
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,480
"All the heroes under heaven
are now within my grasp."

144
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,800
What?

145
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,319
Don't believe me?

146
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,959
Take it easy.

147
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,199
Zhao Jiadi spent a fortune

148
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,680
and got a pile of junk.

149
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:56,600
Used it all to build
an entrepreneurship hub.

150
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,000
Absolutely foolish.

151
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,240
How could you possibly
understand Zhao Jiadi?

152
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,519
And here you are, gloating.

153
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,600
Zhao Jiadi,
I won't let you have the last laugh.

154
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,399
He may be offering hope

155
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,920
and building himself up.

156
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,279
But when you light

157
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,519
a flame of hope,

158
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,920
you'd better be careful
not to get burned.

159
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:33,639
Go.

160
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,199
Hype him up.

161
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,800
Help him expose
all his weaknesses under the spotlight.

162
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,439
Understood, sir.

163
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,800
Boss.

164
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,360
We got invited to the National
University Entrepreneurship Summit!

165
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,471
Is that a big deal?

166
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,240
Of course.

167
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,680
All the other schools
are top-tier 985 universities.

168
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,230
Haicheng, Fujiao University.

169
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,940
Harbin Institute of Technology.

170
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,680
University of Science and Technology.

171
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,199
(Invitation)
These top schools

172
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,759
all send delegates.

173
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,639
Mr. Baliang.

174
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,940
It's one of the highest honors

175
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,199
a student entrepreneur can earn.

176
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,040
(Tran Organization is the main sponsor.)

177
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,399
And Haicheng University only got invited

178
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,800
thanks to you.

179
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,959
(This is an open trap.)

180
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,160
Zhao Jiadi,

181
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,480
let's make history together!

182
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,480
Yes! Let's make history!

183
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,279
Make history!

184
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,439
Make history!

185
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,920
Do you really think
you're ready to win honors

186
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
as you are now?

187
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,360
Are you fully prepared?

188
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,800
Can you change the world?

189
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,759
I can.

190
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:55,920
Can you?

191
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,279
We can!

192
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:02,839
I can too!

193
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:03,720
I can!

194
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,000
I can do it too!

195
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,399
You sure?

196
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:07,920
Yes.

197
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,000
All right.

198
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,399
Then let's go
to the Entrepreneurship Summit.

199
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,000
And come back with some awards.

200
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,040
All right!

201
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:16,879
Let's do it!

202
00:08:17,134 --> 00:08:18,240
(Haicheng University:
A Startup Boom Begins)

203
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,540
(Geniuses Hidden in Ordinary Colleges)
Good.

204
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,360
Excellent.

205
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,519
How's everything else going?

206
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,439
All handled.

207
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,639
With the press release circulating,

208
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,399
Zhao Jiadi is in the spotlight.

209
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:33,039
Even the summit noticed

210
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,320
and made an exception

211
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,560
to invite Haicheng University.

212
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,919
(The best way to destroy someone is)

213
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,799
(to destroy their confidence.)

214
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,759
(This will be interesting.)

215
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,440
But will Zhao Jiadi actually attend?

216
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,879
The worst thing for ordinary people

217
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,360
is having hope.

218
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,960
This is an open trap.

219
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,679
He'll go for sure.

220
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,600
Boss.

221
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,519
The Entrepreneurship Summit
is just around the corner.

222
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,600
You really think all that stuff
you bought for millions

223
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,320
is going to work?

224
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,919
When combined,
these seemingly useless patents

225
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,320
form

226
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,399
the most powerful
renewable energy processor.

227
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,960
Will it really work?

228
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,600
We're just one piece short.

229
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,490
Once we have that,
it'll all come together.

230
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,200
Ms. Jiang.

231
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,480
I believe I've explained

232
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,840
the issue with the chain reaction.

233
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,039
Looks like I'll have
to handle the solution myself.

234
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,159
That's right.

235
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,840
We need you.

236
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,360
Ms. Jiang is not only
our English teacher,

237
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,590
she also holds a master's degree
in Electrical Engineering.

238
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,840
With her representing our university
as our technical advisor,

239
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,919
we'll have a much better chance.

240
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,000
Our top priority now

241
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,120
is improving

242
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,660
the performance and stability
of the wastewater treatment system.

243
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,519
We've run at least
100 experimental tests

244
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,990
on the precision
of the semi-permeable membrane

245
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,039
in the filtration system,
the material selection

246
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,279
for the high-energy soundproof shield,

247
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,759
and the intelligence of the controller.

248
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,870
We also have a team of young engineers

249
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,960
with a strong research
and development spirit.

250
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,690
For cutting-edge solutions,

251
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,360
Yuan Shu's got it covered.

252
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,559
The set of code I designed

253
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,799
can greatly improve computing efficiency

254
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:12,080
and boost the machine's
data processing capability.

255
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,190
The filtration system.

256
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,159
The filtration system is powerful.

257
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,120
It solves the traditional

258
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,279
energy industry's problem
of excessive water waste.

259
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,690
The high-efficiency soundproof shield.

260
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,320
The high-efficiency soundproof shield
addresses the sound

261
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,500
and light pollution caused
by high-powered electrical appliances.

262
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,159
That'll take care

263
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,590
of the commercialization barrier.

264
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,720
The German war machine.

265
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,690
Combined with the crushing capability
of the "German War Machine,"

266
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,440
it's sure to work.

267
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,519
With a high-precision filtration system

268
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,960
and the German War Machine

269
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,399
pulverizing large particles
from the water,

270
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,840
Idealist 1's purification processor

271
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,759
will exceed everyone's expectations.

272
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,240
The prototype is fully assembled.

273
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,399
Everyone,

274
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,320
prepare to witness a miracle!

275
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,860
(Water In, Sediment Removed)

276
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,740
(Clean Water Tank)

277
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,120
I'm so nervous.

278
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,240
Will it actually work?

279
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,279
It worked!

280
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,240
- We did it!
- It worked!

281
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,190
- We did it!
- We did it!

282
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,960
We did it!

283
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,879
We did it!

284
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,000
We did it!

285
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:53,679
We did it!

286
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,320
Awesome!

287
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,080
It worked!

288
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:55,759
Cheers!

289
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:56,799
Cheers!

290
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,519
(Ms. Jiang will be joining us)

291
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,720
(at the summit as our advisor.)
