(Adapted from "Out of His League"

00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,940
=Episode 16=

4
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,000
Don't worry about me.

5
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,390
I'm fine.

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,130
Finish your noodles,

7
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,640
then go do what you want.

8
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,320
Got it.

9
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:58,880
Owner.

10
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,700
A bowl of vegetable noodles, please.

11
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,920
Coming right up.

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,760
I lost my job.

13
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,070
How are we going to pay
your tuition next semester?

14
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,680
Mom,

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,350
I'm not going back to university.

16
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,430
I'll work and support you.

17
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,640
If we can't change our fate,

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,950
maybe we should just accept it.

19
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,600
Maybe this is what we should do.

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,590
Go back to the village

21
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,790
and marry someone simple.

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,400
There's no place for us

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,350
in Haicheng anymore.

24
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,760
I have talent,

25
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,640
but nowhere to use it.

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,640
Why is there no place

27
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,040
in this vast world for people like us?

28
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,680
Tangchen Yipin. Take this.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,070
With this house,

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,710
you'll have a place to stay.

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,230
No, it's too much.

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,200
It's just a place to live.

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,000
Besides, I need help

34
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,790
keeping it clean.

35
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,350
Consider it a job offer.

36
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,840
I can't accept this.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,070
Shu, we can't accept this.

38
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,520
I just want you to know

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,430
that you don't have to beg to survive.

40
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,430
You can stand up

41
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,470
and earn the life you want

42
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,150
through your own effort.

43
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,590
You're right.

44
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,470
I've studied hard for years,

45
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,590
waiting for my chance.

46
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,910
All I've ever needed
is a shot at success.

47
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,790
Then I'll give you that chance.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,520
Ma'am.

49
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,280
As long as I'm here,
Yuan Shu will be fine.

50
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,720
The Chancellor is expecting me.

51
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,280
I need to go.

52
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,870
Shu.

53
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,280
Let's go.

54
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,150
Who's he?

55
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,000
Zhao Jiadi.

56
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,910
Zhao Jiadi.

57
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,750
No chess today.

58
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,680
I'll show you my real chessboard.

59
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,310
This is where

60
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,240
Haicheng University began.

61
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,560
Let me tell you

62
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,080
its story.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Decades ago,

64
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,430
Haicheng University was just

65
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,710
a vocational school

66
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,590
attached to a machine factory.

67
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,310
I graduated from here.

68
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,120
The Chancellor told me,

69
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,710
Haicheng, and my life,

70
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,360
(Utility Model Patent Certificate)

71
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,630
were meant for more.

72
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,430
Director.

73
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,360
(From vocational college to university.)
Our program was finally upgraded!

74
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,630
It was the hope of a whole generation.

75
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,030
I once promised

76
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,870
I'd make this institution

77
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,030
famous in Haicheng,

78
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,870
but I didn't succeed.

79
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,310
Years have passed,

80
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,300
and Haicheng University
is still the same.

81
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,590
My students still have talent

82
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,430
but nowhere to use it.

83
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,870
They're getting old,

84
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,430
just like me.

85
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,280
Let me give it a try.

86
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,070
Zhao Jiadi, it's a long road ahead.

87
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,920
I need you.

88
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,870
I'll do everything I can

89
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,270
to fulfill your dream, Chancellor.

90
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,480
I promise

91
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,160
this will be my starting point.

92
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,830
Then I hand this chessboard over to you.

93
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,270
No idea who took down the billboard

94
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,510
and got us chewed out.

95
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,630
Who else?

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,480
Green Leaf Tech employees, obviously.

97
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,270
They're advertising everywhere.

98
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,060
(Green Leaf Tech)

99
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,390
Heard Green Leaf Tech's stock

100
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,560
is about to skyrocket.

101
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,630
Really? Never heard that.

102
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,830
How does it feel to have
your life affected by others?

103
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,800
So that's how it is.

104
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,310
Zhao Jiadi really is something.

105
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,220
Good morning, Mr. Chen.

106
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,040
Come on.

107
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,190
Pop a bottle of good wine.

108
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,800
Starting today,

109
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,950
I'm going to have some fun with him.
