=Episode 3=

4
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,420
Why did you come in without knocking?

5
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,560
We're having a meeting here.

6
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,840
Were you discussing

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,240
how to undermine everything?

8
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,399
Wang Houde.

9
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,240
You colluded with Tran Organization
in secret deals,

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,719
making the company overpay
for some useless land.

11
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,200
And you benefited from it.

12
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,519
The board has decided to dismiss you.

13
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,200
I will take over your duties.

14
00:01:14,029 --> 00:01:15,040
(Jinhai Group,
Notice of Employee Dismissal)

15
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,319
Notice of dismissal?

16
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,079
On what grounds?

17
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,439
Where is your evidence?

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,590
Chief Executive Officer Wang Houde
was appointed by my brother-in-law.

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,600
The investigation
is not even finished yet.

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,239
So I advise you to watch your mouth.

21
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:32,400
Procurement Director Huang Ruiyang

22
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,680
reached an agreement with Wang Houde,

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
taking kickbacks in multiple projects

24
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,400
and lining his own pockets.

25
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,500
You should have a look.

26
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:44,938
(Jinhai Group)

27
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,140
(Notice of Employee Dismissal)

28
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,640
Employee dismissal?

29
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,120
Warehouse duty?

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,319
This is an insult.

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,120
What gives?

32
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,200
Qi Dongcao.

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,200
Do you truly think

34
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,680
you could become Jinhai Group's CEO
on your own?

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,719
It was all thanks to my brother-in-law!

36
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,719
You colluded with Chen Hongxiong.

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,479
Mr. Zhao knew about it long ago.

38
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,120
He hates betrayal the most.

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,759
As for your brother-in-law,

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,840
you should see him
at the family banquet.

41
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,759
Just wait and see. I will be back!

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,199
How insensible of Ruiyang!

43
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,000
If he hadn't begged

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,439
to work and learn from you,

45
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,680
I would never have suggested

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,000
letting him intern here.

47
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,439
Dongcao was being merciful to him.

48
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,280
If it were me, I would have told him
to return to the hometown

49
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,599
and not to show his face
in front of the Zhaos again.

50
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,080
You are his sister,

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,479
but you aren't the same.

52
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,560
The issue has been settled.

53
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,550
Pigeon should have
finished school by now.

54
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,639
You should go pick him up.

55
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:14,759
Alright.

56
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,400
Dongcao.

57
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,319
Do you also think

58
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,120
that I made a mistake?

59
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,400
This is your family affair.

60
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,800
It's not my place to comment on it.

61
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,120
You must have a reason

62
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,199
for doing so.

63
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,439
Dongcao.

64
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,919
I took you in

65
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,439
when you were eight.

66
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,719
You grew up with Baliang.

67
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,960
In my heart,

68
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,879
you have long been part of our family.

69
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,639
And I have always seen

70
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,000
you as my future daughter-in-law.

71
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,120
So, doesn't that make it
your family affair too?

72
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,319
Everything I have done

73
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,680
is to pave the way for Baliang.

74
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,039
Fine, forget it.

75
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,930
Let's drop the subject.

76
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,190
You have just taken over the group.

77
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,159
There must be a lot of work to handle.

78
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,620
I'll leave you to it, then.

79
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,960
Dongcao.

80
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,439
Do you think that as a student,

81
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,839
Baliang could earn ten million yuan

82
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,959
after graduation?

83
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,090
It's impossible for others.

84
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,040
But Baliang can make it.

85
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,920
Mu Hongli.

86
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,959
Read this passage for us.

87
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,639
If life deceives you,

88
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,439
do not be sad or impatient.

89
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,439
On gloomy days, stay calm.

90
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,519
Believe that happy days will come.

91
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,399
The heart always longs for the future.

92
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,519
But now it is often gloomy.

93
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,839
Everything is fleeting.

94
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,519
Everything will pass.

95
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,319
And what has passed

96
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,800
will become dear memories.

If Life Deceives You by Pushkin.

98
00:05:12,736 --> 00:05:15,370
(Russian Department Representative)
If Life Deceives You by Pushkin.

99
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,319
Mu Hongli, the representative
of the Russian Department

100
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,319
and the student I admire most.

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,279
Her Russian is as superior as mine.

102
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,240
I hope all of you

103
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,639
can learn from her.

104
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,439
That was good.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,360
But she can work on the intonation.

106
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,399
Who is that?

107
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,519
Does he even know anything?

108
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,160
Mr. Zhang hates
this kind of person most.

109
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,160
This is going to be fun.

110
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,000
Indeed.

111
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,519
Mu Hongli is my proudest student.

112
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,000
I have been teaching
for more than ten years.

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,759
So I don't need you to show off here.

114
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,199
Stand up.

115
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,199
Did you hear me?

116
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,759
How unruly.

117
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,639
You dared sleep in class.

118
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,839
What is your name?

119
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,199
Zhao Jiadi.

120
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,959
Top of the class.

121
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,399
That's a good name.

122
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,360
It is the 'Jiadi'
from 'finest family in Jiangnan'.

123
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,160
Whatever.

124
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,680
You have no respect for discipline.

125
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,800
Not only did you sleep in class,

126
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,920
but you also talked nonsense.

127
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,279
Well,

128
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,600
students like you are not welcome here.

129
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,639
I did not even enroll in this class.

130
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,319
I bet you're not here to study Russian.

131
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,920
So please do not disturb

132
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,000
the other students.

133
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,160
I was auditing your class.

134
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,800
I did not mean to disturb anyone.

135
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,199
You are good.

136
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,800
But you can be even better.

137
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,439
You should read
"A History of Russian Literature."

138
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,800
It will help you much

139
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,199
with your improvement.

140
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,120
"A History of Russian Literature", huh

141
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,000
Who is the founder
of Russian literature?

142
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,519
Do you know
the three giants of Russian literature?

143
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,000
Do not think that knowing a little

144
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,839
means you can show off.

145
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,040
The founder
of Russian literature is Pushkin.

146
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,759
The three giants are Turgenev,

147
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,360
Dostoevsky,

148
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,279
and Leo Tolstoy.

149
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,690
Who is author of "The Chameleon"?

150
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,199
Chekhov.

151
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,079
The gathered storm clouds

152
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,600
are like green flames

153
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,319
burning over the bottomless sea.

154
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,360
The sea grabs the flash of lightning

155
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,839
and douses it in its abyss.

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,800
"The Song of the Stormy Petrel"
by Gorky.

157
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,920
Do you think you are impressive?

158
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,639
Listen here.

159
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,839
This is a Russian class,

160
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,240
not your platform to show off.

161
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,160
I doubt

162
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,160
you even know how to write in Russian!

163
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,319
If you can write even one word,

164
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,560
I will let you off
for disrupting my class today.

165
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,720
Do you think he can write it?

166
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,000
(He's actually writing
the whole thing down.)

167
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,840
(If life deceives you,
do not be sad or impatient.)

168
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,730
(On gloomy days, stay calm.)

169
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,610
(Believe that happy days will come.)

170
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,345
(The heart always longs for the future.)

171
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,000
(But now it is often gloomy.)

172
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,788
(Everything is fleeting.)

173
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,488
(Everything will pass.)

174
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,120
(If Life Deceives You by Pushkin)
(It's the first chapter from the poem.)

175
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,559
(What a genius.)

176
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,919
See you later, sir.

177
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,279
Well...

178
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,919
Are there really reckless fools

179
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,759
in this world?

180
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,080
What a lunatic.

181
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,960
Thanks.

182
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,260
That's the second Russian sentence
that you taught me.

183
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,600
What do you mean?

184
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,919
Yeah, I'm a lunatic.
