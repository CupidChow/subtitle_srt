00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:48,030
- (The 5th National University)
- a bet?

6
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,658
- (Entrepreneurship Summit of 2007)
- Sure.

7
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,461
- (will be held in Haicheng.)
- You don't stand a chance

8
00:00:51,461 --> 00:00:52,460
- (Reportedly,)
- against me anyway.

9
00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:54,196
(this year's summit includes 18 teams)

10
00:00:54,196 --> 00:00:56,190
(from prestigious schools such as)

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,058
- (Huaqing, Jingbei, and Fujiao.)
- Then let's see

13
00:00:59,774 --> 00:01:01,160
- (Chen Hongxiong,)
- Zhao Jiadi

14
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,740
- (CEO of Tran Organization,)
- ends up on.

(Pei Qian,
Chairman of Green Leaf Technology,)

16
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,879
(and a delegation)

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,959
(of economic experts)

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,220
(who advise major enterprises.)

Marching into the tiger's den

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,680
knowing it's dangerous, are we?

21
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,359
I haven't seen a tiger yet,

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,319
but there is a bear.

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,719
Looks like you're ready.

24
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:21,640
Not really.

25
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,790
But I couldn't refuse
such a warm invitation.

26
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:24,719
You set the scene.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,439
How could I not show up?

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,239
Please.

29
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:32,510
(5th National University
Entrepreneurship Summit)

30
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,180
Hello, everyone.

31
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,480
I'm Li Yang,

32
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,990
a PhD candidate from Fujiao University.

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,519
The project I'm presenting is

34
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,599
a smart vertical parking system.

35
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,000
This system requires
minimal land and offers

36
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,480
highly efficient space utilization.

37
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,719
It effectively addresses

38
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,879
the issue of limited parking space
in urban areas…

39
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,719
This is
the Poseidon Marine Engine System.

40
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,439
It enables massive ships
to carry loads over 100,000 tons…

41
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,159
These are projects from Qingbei.

42
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,799
Artificial intelligence technology
and industrial robotics.

43
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,239
My name is Zhou Yu.

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,780
I'm a postdoctoral researcher
at Beicheng Technology University.

45
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,640
The product I'm presenting is
a smart city system.

46
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,359
Its core concept is
"one chip, one city."

47
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,790
Contact the three teams I picked
and get those contracts signed.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,319
What's that thing? It's heavy.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,719
Greetings.

50
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,479
The next contestant is

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,639
Zhao Jiadi,

52
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:20,560
a student
from a local, ordinary university,

53
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,479
Haicheng University.

54
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,580
Let's welcome him.

55
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,479
What's that?

56
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,080
Haicheng University?

57
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:27,680
Don't know.

58
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,439
Never heard of it.

59
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,520
Who knows?

60
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,960
Hello, everyone. I'm Zhao Jiadi.

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,319
That's right.

62
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,120
I come from an ordinary institution,

63
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,800
Haicheng University.

64
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,919
Great!

65
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,680
Never heard of it.

66
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,590
Must've pulled some strings to get in.

67
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,759
Bit overconfident, huh?

68
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,759
Kind of dumb.

69
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,039
This is our startup project.

70
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,233
(3R Smart Station)

71
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:02,980
(Automatic Purification
and Filtration System)

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,039
Zhao Jiadi.

73
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,680
Haicheng University.

74
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,240
What kind of project is that?

75
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,840
A garbage processor?

76
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,800
Figures, it's trash.

77
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,120
How's he going to compete against

78
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,319
the elite university entries?

79
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,240
Before I begin my presentation,

80
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,560
I'd like to pay tribute

81
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,760
to all the former chancellors
of Haicheng University.

82
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,639
The spirit of idealism you uphold

83
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,919
made me realize

84
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,199
that even if one comes
from an ordinary university,

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,790
they should never
underestimate themselves.

86
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,280
Because life is about
so much more than that.

87
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,000
That's why

88
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,520
my team and I

89
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,280
named this device Idealist 1.

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Starting from this model,
we aim to create

91
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,000
Idealist 2, 3,
even thousands or millions

92
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,919
of improved upgrades in the future.

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,340
(Pei Qian)
Now, allow me to demonstrate.

94
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:55,520
(Chairman of Green Leaf Technology)
Now, allow me to demonstrate.

95
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,700
(Pei Qian,
Chairman of Green Leaf Technology)

96
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,220
(Manual, Pump, Automatic)

97
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,240
First,

98
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,553
(Water Intake and Filtration)
wastewater goes through

99
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:03,080
(Water Intake and Filtration)
a preliminary residue screening,

100
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,199
(Crushing and Soundproofing)
followed by a specially developed

101
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,719
(Secondary Filtration)
super activated carbon filter

102
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,280
(Sterilization and Purification)
for secondary purification.

103
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,879
(Clean Water Tank)
This achieves

104
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,520
a purification effect
down to 0.001 microns,

105
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,039
removing over 95%

106
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:16,639
of bacteria and microorganisms,
then continues

107
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,120
through sterilization and decomposition.

108
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,040
Hold on.

109
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,319
To my knowledge,

110
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,279
Denmark is one of the world's

111
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,399
most advanced countries
in eco-friendly waste

112
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,040
and wastewater treatment.

113
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,879
Even with cutting-edge technology,

114
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,199
their wastewater treatment rate

115
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,439
struggles to exceed 90%.

116
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,199
So I doubt your Idealist 1 is

117
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,199
anything more than just an ideal.

118
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,040
It doesn't meet
the standards of our summit.

119
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,519
Actually, in August of last year,

120
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,399
Denmark publicly announced

121
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,199
that their waste

122
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,160
and wastewater eco-treatment rate

123
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,639
had exceeded 98%.

124
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,279
Ms. Qin, surely you shouldn't be using

125
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,100
- a decade-old theory to question me?
- You…

126
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,079
Ms. Qin,

127
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,480
he's right.

128
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,399
I checked online.

129
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,879
I'm a judge at this summit.

130
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,370
I have the right to question things.

131
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,160
Even if your data is certified,

132
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,959
it's only theoretical.

133
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,480
It's hard to apply in the real world.

134
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,920
What we value in an invention is

135
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,759
not only conceptual innovation,

136
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,560
but practical value as well.

137
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,360
Theories are just the beginning.

138
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,990
As for practical application,

139
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,560
I invite you to test it yourself.

140
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,460
With the summit organizers' permission,

141
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,639
my team and I have provided

142
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,839
a batch of purified water

143
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:29,040
for this event.

144
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,920
Before being purified, that water

145
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,439
was urban wastewater.

146
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,279
What?

147
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,519
This is filtered sewage?

148
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,360
That's disgusting!

149
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,319
I'm not finished.

150
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,160
This water has already

151
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,680
passed inspection by China's

152
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,160
Water Environment Research Institute.

153
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,959
(The water tastes fine.)

154
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,079
It meets all 13 sanitary standards

155
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,200
for drinking water quality.

156
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,439
Please be assured
that it is safe to drink.

157
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,319
A product made
from problematic materials

158
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,079
will first and foremost
cause psychological discomfort.

159
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,160
Just like a person's past.

160
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,399
No matter how polished
they appear later,

161
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,759
their true nature can't be erased.

162
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,920
Ms. Qin,

163
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,240
that comment is inappropriate

164
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,319
for someone in your position as a judge.

165
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:13,879
Zhao Jiadi,

166
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,959
as an expert in economics,

167
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,879
I can responsibly tell you

168
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,879
(Water Intake and Filtration)
that even if this "project" of yours

169
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,240
(Crushing and Soundproofing)
is produced, no one will buy

170
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,959
(Secondary Filtration)
this machine

171
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,160
(Sterilization and Purification)
you assembled from junk parts.

172
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,800
It's a worthless product.

173
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,560
I'll invest in this project.

174
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,199
While rapid technological development

175
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,279
has brought economic growth,

176
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,399
it has also worsened
environmental pollution.

177
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,720
The eco-treatment offered by Idealist 1

178
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,399
provides a model
for sustainable development

179
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,530
and ecological civilization.

180
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,040
Its significance is far from ordinary.

181
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,199
What was your intention in designing

182
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,680
and building this machine?

183
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,240
For the future.

184
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,600
Go on.

185
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,360
I come from

186
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,680
a scenic, peaceful village.

187
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,439
But as society develops rapidly,

188
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,199
that tranquil pastoral life

189
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,959
is being destroyed.

190
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,759
Resources like blue skies, clean air,

191
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,399
and fresh water,

192
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,000
things that once belonged

193
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,120
to all of us,

194
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,680
are now luxuries.

195
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,079
That's why

196
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,759
I wanted to start by changing
a single drop of water.

197
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,680
To change the world,

198
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,040
and help it return

199
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,720
to the way it was meant to be.

200
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,480
That is my intention.

201
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,319
Well said.

202
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,480
Makes perfect sense.

203
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,240
- Great!
- Well said!

204
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:37,839
Amazing!

205
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:38,639
Great!

206
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,920
Looks like I seized

207
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,160
the opportunity you gave me.

208
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,950
Sorry to disappoint you.

209
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,520
Instead of embarrassing myself,

210
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,879
I gained an investment.

211
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,519
Zhao Jiadi.

212
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,040
Game over.

213
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,879
Every bit of momentum I gave you

214
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,800
was just to make your fall
hurt even more.

215
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,839
Now get ready to taste

216
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:20,160
what it's like to make me angry.

217
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,920
(Haicheng Morning News)
Good morning.

218
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,040
Welcome to Haicheng Morning News.

219
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,920
Here's an important update.

220
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,720
Sources reveal that Pei Qian,

221
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,519
chairman of Green Leaf Technology,

222
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,740
recently suffered a sudden heart attack

223
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,360
and was rushed to the ICU.

224
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,919
His current condition remains unknown.

225
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,380
(In Operation)
His daughter, Pei Luoshen,

226
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:37,600
(In Operation)
is set to take over the company.

227
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,000
However, not long ago,

228
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,070
tabloid media released

229
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,990
a video of her allegedly
sneaking into a hotel late at night

230
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,799
with several male models.

231
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,260
She responded that she was just

232
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,919
watching a game with friends.

233
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,430
Green Leaf Technology's stock
hit its limit down that same day,

234
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,850
triggering panic among shareholders.

235
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,720
What surprises might

236
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,039
this unconventional heiress bring

237
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,159
as she steps up
to lead Green Leaf Technology?

238
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,639
Let's stay tuned.

239
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,519
Everyone.

240
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,990
A company cannot go
a single day without leadership.

241
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,590
I've decided to temporarily assume

242
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,020
my father's position
and exercise the chairman's authority.

243
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:04,720
I object.

244
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,840
Hand it over.

245
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,900
This is the full record and evidence

246
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:13,320
of your years of embezzlement
and bribery in the company.

247
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,559
If you walk away quietly now,

248
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,759
I might just spare you from prison.

249
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:22,879
But that doesn't mean

250
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,440
we'll accept a pretty face like you

251
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,399
as chairman, making decisions.

252
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,919
All you ever do is generate
tabloid materials.

253
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,690
Who's going to take responsibility
for the company's stock price?

254
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,159
Tabloid materials?

255
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,780
If we're talking about that,

256
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,759
maybe I should take
some notes from you, Mr. Ma.

257
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,759
Do your wife, your kids,

258
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:47,679
and the other shareholders know

259
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,279
just how wild you've been?

260
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,000
I support her.

261
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,120
Anyone else object?

262
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,519
I've got plenty more documents here.

263
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,110
Everyone's welcome
to claim them any time.

264
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,360
I withdraw my objection.

265
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,679
Same here.

266
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't object either.

267
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,679
I support her.

268
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,200
Great. Meeting adjourned.

269
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,559
Dad,

270
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,879
your move was brilliant!

271
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:25,679
Look.

272
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,540
Everyone in the company still thinks
you're lying in a hospital bed.

273
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,759
I've given this company
decades of my life.

274
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,200
It's about time I took a break.

275
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,279
The future belongs

276
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,480
to your generation now.

277
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,519
This was all Zhao Jiadi's idea.

278
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,279
Impressive, right?

279
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,120
You seem to think highly of him.

280
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,399
You sure he's the one?

281
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,159
Not going to take another look around?

282
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,000
He's

283
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,360
different.

284
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,480
The fish took the bait!

285
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,159
According to reports,
after taking over Green Leaf Technology,

286
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,559
Pei Luoshen decisively
dissolved the board.

287
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,310
She then reacquired

288
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,320
all shares from the former
major shareholders

289
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,320
and redistributed them

290
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,399
to company employees.

291
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,300
She also signed Green Leaf Technology's

292
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,279
first university-enterprise
partnership agreement

293
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,399
with Haicheng University.

294
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,720
Representatives from Haicheng University

295
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,519
also attended the signing.

296
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,360
Now, please allow me
to introduce the winner

297
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,960
of the National University
Entrepreneurship Summit,

298
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,679
and the recipient
of the Green Leaf Trust grant,

299
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:34,879
Zhao Jiadi.

300
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,799
Thank you, Ms. Pei, for your trust.

301
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:41,799
I will not disappoint.

302
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,080
I will work with Green Leaf Technology
to create a better future.

303
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,679
After Zhao Jiadi teamed up
with Green Leaf Technology,

304
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,679
the company's stock price has soared.

305
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:55,440
Rumor has it they've just completed
the 3R system upgrade.

306
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,679
The Haicheng city government is prepared
to purchase 50 units in one go.

307
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,039
If Zhao Jiadi succeeds,

308
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,480
he'll pose a massive threat
to our organization's

309
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,720
traditional industrial sector.

310
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,500
(Tran Organization)

311
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
50 units?

312
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,879
Sure he can manage

313
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,440
all of that?

314
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,240
I understand.

315
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,890
Thank you to Green Leaf Technology
for providing us with this venue.

316
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,240
We're about to embark
on a brand-new journey here.

317
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:28,399
(2007 3R Green Future)
I plan to name

318
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,679
this upcoming product,

319
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,559
Green Future.

320
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,399
Great! Love it.

321
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,250
Something's happened.

322
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,279
Chen Hongxiong spent a fortune
lobbying Tianyi Heavy Industries

323
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,530
and forced them to terminate
their collaboration with us.

324
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,279
I reached out
to several other manufacturers,

325
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,000
but none of them

326
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,240
will take our order.

327
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,279
Jiadi, any other ideas?
