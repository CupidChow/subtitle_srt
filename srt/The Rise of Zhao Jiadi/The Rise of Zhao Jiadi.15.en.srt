=The Rise of Zhao Jiadi=

2
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,820
(Adapted from "Out of His League"
by Fenghuo Xizhuhou)

3
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,940
=Episode 15=

4
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,799
Hongli, what are you doing here?

5
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,280
I heard you drank too much.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,980
I was worried about you.

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,759
And...

8
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,439
we haven't seen each other in a while.

9
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,159
Still thinking about that day?

10
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:03,719
I didn't take it to heart.

11
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,000
Ya told me

12
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,519
you were having
a celebration dinner today.

13
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,719
I thought...

14
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,000
you'd come find me when it ended.

15
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:16,920
It's my fault.

16
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,359
I promise you

17
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,560
I'll only love you, Mu Hongli.

18
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,319
Forever and always.

19
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,799
No second thoughts.

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
I'll be loyal to the end.

21
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,000
No secrets.

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
Go get her.

23
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,120
Okay.

24
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,400
Hongli!

25
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:53,599
Hongli!

26
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:54,799
Hongli!

27
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,159
Hongli!

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,239
It's not what you think.

29
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,120
If I ever betray you,

30
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,439
I, Zhao Jiadi...

31
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,159
Stop swearing.

32
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,439
I believe you.

33
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,400
(This is your last chance.)

34
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,919
(Leave the country now.)

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,159
(It's not too late to negotiate.)

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,479
Zhao Jiadi.

37
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,240
I really do like you.

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,159
But there are things

39
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,719
beyond my control.

40
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,080
Hongli.

41
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,000
Did your mom say something to you?

42
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,759
Tell me. Let me handle it.

43
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,840
It's fine.

44
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,439
See you at school tomorrow.

45
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,840
I must go now.

46
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,639
(Jiadi)

47
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,520
(I'm sorry.)

48
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,599
(I can't be with you anymore.)

49
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,800
(Named after you.)

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,879
Do you like it?

51
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,479
From now on,
your milk tea is on the house.

52
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,000
That's what makes it one of a kind.

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,719
(The fool I once thought he was)

54
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,360
(turns out to be gifted.)

55
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,360
(The vagrant I once judged)

56
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,960
(has a great sense of justice.)

57
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,960
(I only love you, Mu Hongli.)

58
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,719
(Forever and always.)

59
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,639
No second thoughts.

60
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
I'll be loyal to the end.

61
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,400
No secrets.

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,400
(Maybe I just wasn't brave enough.)

63
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,240
(But, I'll never regret loving him.)

64
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,120
(Get it together.)

65
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,719
(When it's time to let go, let go.)

66
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,319
You're not from the same world.

67
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,479
What you have now

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,159
is beyond his wildest imaginations.

69
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,159
He was fortunate
to have your affection.

70
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,120
Leaving him is a blessing for him.

71
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,479
Let's go.

72
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,520
Mu Hongli.

73
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,240
Now, that is a friend worthy of Hongli.

74
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,959
A friend came to see you off.

75
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,000
Talk to her.

76
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:30,959
You won.

77
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,120
Don't you think

78
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,240
Baliang's love

79
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,560
is worth standing up for?

80
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,720
Some things

81
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,759
are just not mine to decide.

82
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,360
I can't let him go.

83
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,519
But I have to leave.

84
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,040
You'll regret it.

85
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,160
Sir, please drive faster.

86
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:09,959
Please.

87
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,560
Okay.

88
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,360
You are relentless.

89
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:47,959
Zhao Jiadi.

90
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,560
Hongli is not your stepping stone.

91
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,519
She deserves someone better than you.

92
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,959
Are you mad because I struck a nerve?

93
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,120
People should know their place.

94
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,000
Struggling desperately

95
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,360
only makes you look more ridiculous.

96
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,519
Sounds like you're pretty pleased

97
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,399
sitting comfortably
in that high chair of yours.

98
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,560
Of course.

99
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:15,120
Whether it's education,
wealth, or status,

100
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,680
our family ranks

101
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,519
at the top of society.

102
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,600
You're just part

103
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:23,319
of the other ninety percent.

104
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,399
You're the absolute average.

105
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,759
What's wrong with that?

106
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,759
I'll proudly be

107
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,279
an honest, upright

108
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,600
ordinary person.

109
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,839
Are you high-roading me?

110
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,040
My daughter will rise above the rest.

111
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,600
She should be with someone
who matches her.

112
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,040
(One day, I, Zhao Jiadi,)

113
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:49,000
(will make you all regret this.)

114
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,399
(I really do like you.)

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,040
(But there are things)

116
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,959
(beyond my control.)

117
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,560
(Zhao Jiadi, you're just a stray!)

118
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,439
Get lost.

119
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,920
I'm not a stray.

120
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,160
Go away, stray!

121
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,360
You're the strays!

122
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,480
You're a stray!

123
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,199
I'm not!

124
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,600
Get lost, stray!

125
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,079
Come on.

126
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,560
Let's go.

127
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,680
He is a stray.

128
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,680
Did you get into another fight?

129
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,720
Your dad's not here.
Stop causing trouble.

130
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,199
We can't afford to offend people.

131
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,439
- Why did you fight?
- Mom...

132
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,800
They said I'm a stray.

133
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,560
I'm sorry, Baliang.

134
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,040
(I was wrong. I'm so sorry.)

135
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,279
(Dad is back.)

136
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,399
(No one will call me a stray anymore.)

137
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,680
(Mom and Dad are married.)

138
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,519
Congratulations!

139
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,658
(Double happiness.)

140
00:07:35,658 --> 00:07:37,190
- Congrats.
- Congrats.

141
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,160
Hong.

142
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,920
I hired an English tutor for Baliang.

143
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,279
Are you dumb or what?

144
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,959
You can't even spell a single word.

145
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Just like Zhao Shanghong.

146
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,959
You're a bumpkin.

147
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:45,959
This is a waste of time.

148
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,160
Like mother, like son.

149
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,279
You're hopeless.

150
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,360
(Don't think)

151
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,920
(I don't know about you )

152
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,879
(and Huang Fangfei.)

153
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,350
And you still treat me like this?

154
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,519
Have you no shame?

155
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,439
Shut up or get out!

156
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,160
Fine, I'll go!

157
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,920
Mom, why are you leaving?

158
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
Don't go.

159
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,240
Baliang.

160
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,439
Mom will miss you.

161
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,279
I'm so sorry.

162
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,759
Mom!

163
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,920
(Mom, don't go!)

164
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,439
Baliang!

165
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,120
You're drunk.

166
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,000
No.

167
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,879
I'm completely sober now.
