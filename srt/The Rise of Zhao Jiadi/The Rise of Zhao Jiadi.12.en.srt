00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,870
=The Rise of Zhao Jiadi=

00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,820
(Adapted from "Out of His League"
by Fenghuo Xizhuhou)

3
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,940
=Episode 12=

4
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,520
This private pool of mine

5
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,799
can cleanse all your bad luck.

6
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:58,920
How do you feel now?

7
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,159
If you want to do big things,
you need a calm mind.

8
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,000
I still prefer the tea you brew.

9
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,079
So, your so-called help

10
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,159
was turning into a broke loser?

11
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,319
I'll win it all back.

12
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,799
Then tell me, how exactly do you do it?

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,280
Let's start with Chen Hongxiong.

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,239
Yang Qingdi, Chen Hongxiong...

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,400
and your father, Zhao Xin.

16
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,200
(Three different backgrounds,)

17
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,079
(yet each made
a name for himself in business.)

18
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,519
(On the surface, they're competitors,)

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,920
(always clashing in the market.)

20
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,400
(But behind the scenes,
they respected each other.)

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,280
(Later, through Yang
Qingdi's mediation,)

22
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,000
(they agreed to
jointly develop a plot of land)

23
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,799
(called Qianlong Bay.)

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,879
(It's the commercial street
we're standing in right now.)

25
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,239
Get lost.

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,480
Chen, you really are a sneaky one.

27
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,719
How dare you pull one on me?

28
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,200
Calm down.

29
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,159
Business is like war.

30
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,400
There's no such thing as friendships.

31
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:08,639
You don't seriously think
wearing a tailored suit

32
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
means you're one of us, do you?

33
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,759
A bumpkin will always be a bumpkin.

34
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,039
(But life is unpredictable.)

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
(First, Chen Hongxiong
persuaded Yang Qingdi)

36
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,960
(to kick your dad out of the project.)

37
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,319
(Not long afterward,)

38
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,360
Qingdi got into a car crash.

39
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,280
He died on the way to the hospital.

40
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,840
Something in my gut told me

41
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,570
Chen Hongxiong had
something to do with it.

42
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,400
Half the commercial street shares

43
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,919
are in his hands now.

44
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,960
I want to carry on what Yang started,

45
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,400
but it's impossible.

46
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,759
Three days from now,

47
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:48,280
I'll have one final bet
with Chen Hongxiong.

48
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,520
You have to be in on it.

49
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,120
I don't have money to play your games.

50
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,960
But he has something
you care about most.

51
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,240
Half the shares
of the commercial street.

52
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,319
Zhao Jiadi, have you
gambled your sanity away?

53
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,599
Have you lost your mind?

54
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,560
If you lose, accept it.

55
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,120
Don't make it worse.

56
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,240
You might get into worse trouble.

57
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,319
There will be no way out.

58
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,719
Sometimes, even if you avoid trouble,

59
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
it still finds you.

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,599
Ms. Cai.

61
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,439
Trouble's here.

62
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,800
Who is she?

63
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,960
(Pei Luoshen)
Green Leaf Tech's princess.

64
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,150
(Daughter of Green Leaf Tech chairman)
The chairman's favorite child.

65
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:22,340
(Pei Qian)
The chairman's favorite child.

66
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,719
The only heir to the company.

67
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,280
She pesters me when she's bored.

68
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,319
No wonder you weren't
answering my calls.

69
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,879
You've been playing house
with your puppy.

70
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,240
This is my business partner, Zhao Jiadi.

71
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,840
Partner?

72
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,719
Like living-together kind of partner?

73
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,520
Got grounded by your dad again?

74
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,199
You guessed it.

75
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,960
I snuck out.

76
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,639
I plan to crash at your place
for a few days.

77
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,759
You're not a kid anymore.

78
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,599
Stop pulling stunts like this.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,759
A few days ago, the paparazzi caught you

80
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,719
being in the same room with three guys.

81
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,039
Green Leaf Tech's stock

82
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,319
is about to crash.

83
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,400
You two go ahead.

84
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,039
I don't know much about stocks dropping.

85
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,520
But making men's hearts drop?

86
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,680
That's what I'm good at.

87
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
Besides,

88
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,279
we were just playing mahjong that night.

89
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,120
Three guys, one girl.

90
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,680
Is that a problem?

91
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,600
As for this man,

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,399
you'd better stay away from him.

93
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,000
He just lost six million.

94
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,879
He's full of bad luck.

95
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,120
Perfect.

96
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,600
Let me help him shake that off.

97
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:43,000
Hey, pretty boy.

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,240
I don't really know how to swim.

99
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,360
Can you teach me?

100
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,199
Don't walk away.

101
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,560
Chen Hongxiong

102
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,839
shouldn't be messed with.

103
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,959
You must join the bet

104
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,600
three days from now.

105
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,800
That's the only shot
you have at beating him.

106
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,680
(Xinjing News, Sept 1.)

107
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,600
(100-stock average price index)

108
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,959
(closed at 7464.54 today,)

109
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:20,000
(up 25.41 points
from the previous trading day,)

110
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,199
(a gain of 0.34%.)

111
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,000
(Top five gainers of the day)

112
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,800
(are as follows.)

113
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,879
(Green Leaf Tech stock up 9.85%.)

114
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,160
(Mass Petroleum up 2.73%.)

115
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,639
Let me introduce an old friend.

116
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,480
An old friend?

117
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,839
This place hasn't changed one bit.

118
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,800
Looks just like it did

119
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,079
when Yang Qingdi was alive.

120
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,079
Why are you here?

121
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,959
I heard there's a game happening here.

122
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,759
So, what's the bet this time?

123
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,600
Market's open.

124
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,890
Do you have a computer?

125
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,759
Pick any stock you want.
I'll guess it.

126
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,519
You know there's no way
you can win this.

127
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,360
Scared?

128
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,920
I'll bet a Tangchen Yipin apartment.

129
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,959
That wager doesn't interest me.

130
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,720
I'm not playing with you.

131
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,319
Wait a sec.

132
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:26,920
How about this?

133
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,560
Let's switch it up.

134
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,959
You pick a stock,

135
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:34,879
she guesses.

136
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,319
She is joining?

137
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
Interesting.

138
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,680
But that bet

139
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,759
still doesn't appeal to me.

140
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,439
She'll put up

141
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,160
all the shares she owns
in the commercial street.

142
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,399
Is that enough?

143
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,160
You know

144
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,720
how much it's worth.

145
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,759
Zhao Jiadi, are you out of your mind?

146
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,600
Has gambling made you insane?

147
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,319
How dare you risk my commercial street?

148
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,839
Play by yourselves.

149
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,500
I've already lost six million.

150
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,470
This is the final round.

151
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,560
Let's go big.

152
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,279
Win back everything we lost.

153
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,319
Think about it.

154
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,720
If we win this round,

155
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,759
you'll get back
all the commercial street shares.

156
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,480
Isn't that what you've been dreaming of?

157
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,279
And if we lose?

158
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:23,639
Trust me.

159
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,240
We'll win.

160
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,199
Trust me, Yanzhi.

161
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,319
We're going to win.

162
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,720
I'm in.

163
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,600
So? You in?

164
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,759
(This time, you have to join the game.)

165
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,319
(Call an ambulance! Hurry!)

166
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,959
(Qingdi, stay awake!)

167
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:44,879
Hang in there!

168
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,959
(Yanzhi.)

169
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,519
(In Operation)

170
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,959
(Chen Hongxiong is absolutely ruthless.)

171
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,000
(Listen to me.)

172
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,000
(Don't mess with him.)

173
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,800
Count me in.
