00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,210
The university council has decided

5
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,359
to issue you a serious warning.

6
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,320
Also,

7
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,990
you're not allowed to speak at the freshmen
assembly speech.

8
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,920
Anything else,
Ms. Jiang?

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,159
If not, I'll be leaving.

Zhao Jiadi.

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,799
You've received scholarships
for the past three years.

14
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:07,840
Why ruin your future?

15
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:10,000
My future is in my own hands.

(Haicheng University
Freshman Assembly 2007, Welcome)

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,959
What's going on?

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,799
(Jiang Shigen,)

19
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,980
(Chancellor)
It was a small incident.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,840
(of Haicheng University)
It's been taken care of.

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,120
Respected leaders, teachers,

22
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,799
and fellow students,

23
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:32,920
hello.

24
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:35,200
Isn't it always a junior

25
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,959
- who gives the speech?
- I'm Zheng Kun.

26
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,480
The student representative
was recently disciplined.

27
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,359
He's not allowed to give the speech.

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,799
Who is it?

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,439
Zhao Jiadi.

30
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,120
It's said that he had a conflict
with the student union

31
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,319
during a dorm inspection.

32
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,760
Is he the one who started

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,920
the popular milk tea
business on campus?

34
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,920
What exactly happened?

35
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,970
Have you looked into it?

36
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,400
I haven't verified the details.

37
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,200
The student union reported it.

38
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,560
So you just canceled
his speech based on that?

39
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,520
It was my mistake.

40
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,280
Students should have
the freedom to speak.

41
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,719
To foster a healthy campus environment.

42
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,520
I'll not fail the school's
expectations.

43
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,280
Ms. Jiang,

44
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,280
reinvestigate the matter
of Zhao Jiadi immediately.

45
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,199
And become the model school
for the city.

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,639
All right.

47
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,919
We'll strive to be
a youth with good character.

48
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,800
Thanks to Zheng Kun
for his brilliant speech.

49
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:39,840
Students,

50
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,080
we're adding

51
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,080
a last-minute segment.

52
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,159
A junior student
representative will speak.

53
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,410
Let's give a round of applause.

54
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,319
Why isn't he going up yet?

55
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,599
Who?

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Now, let's welcome

57
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,319
the junior student
representative, Zhao Jiadi,

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,439
to the stage.

59
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,479
Welcome.

60
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,960
- Good!
- Good!

61
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,479
- Good!
- Good!

62
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,439
Hello everyone, I'm Zhao Jiadi.

63
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,520
I was someone

64
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,759
who lost the opportunity to speak here,

65
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,039
but now I'm back on stage again.

66
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,879
Thank you to the leaders
for this second chance.

67
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,719
So I should be more thankful.

68
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,350
As the student representative,

69
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,120
I'd like to thank
the Discipline Director.

70
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,919
His name is Zheng Kun.

71
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,039
I appreciate his patience in sharing

72
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,719
his insights since joining the school.

73
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,000
I appreciate his guidance.

74
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,790
Also, I'd like to thank
Director Zheng Kun

75
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,560
for meticulously visiting the dorms

76
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,159
and consistently showing concern

77
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,000
for the new students.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,400
Now, I sincerely invite

79
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,759
Director Zheng Kun to come up here

80
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,639
and receive our appreciation.

81
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,959
He ran a fake milk tea shop

82
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,319
that gave people food poisoning.

83
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,319
It's Zheng Kun.

84
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,279
Let's all thank Director Zheng again.

85
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,439
No!

86
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,319
Stop this.

87
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,240
He's a bully.

88
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,920
He lets his underlings

89
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,900
collect protection money
from other students.

90
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,590
Everyone stays silent,
but we're all indignant.

91
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,550
No one dares to confront him.

92
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,639
His family is powerful.

93
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,439
He even harasses
female students, right?

94
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,120
How can the school turn a blind eye?

95
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,079
The student union should
serve students.

96
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,590
This needs to be investigated properly.

97
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,680
But some people abuse their power

98
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
and oppress others.

99
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,480
I believe

100
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,680
the school won't wrong a good person,

101
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,340
nor will it let
a bad one go unpunished.

102
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,800
He must be exposed.

103
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,879
He has had a terrible
influence on the school.

104
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,759
Hello, freshmen.

105
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:19,319
I'm Jiang Shigen, Chancellor
of Haicheng University.

106
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,480
I now announce

107
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,279
that the Academic Affairs
Division will immediately

108
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,839
launch an investigation,

109
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,120
including into the issues

110
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,040
raised by Zhao Jiadi

111
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,879
regarding Zheng Kun.

112
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,519
If we find any corrupt behavior

113
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,399
or misconduct toward new students,

114
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,040
we will handle it
with full seriousness.

115
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:40,480
Good!

116
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,079
Good!

117
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,120
- Finally!
- Finally!

118
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,320
That's how it should be done!

119
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,279
Zhao Jiadi,

120
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,040
please continue.

121
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,560
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

122
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,839
Investigate this thoroughly.

123
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,800
Don't worry, Mr. Jiang.

124
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,839
Now that I'm standing here,

125
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,800
I realize

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,199
this hall is small.

127
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,079
Too small to hold too many people.

128
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,879
But the world is big.

129
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,560
So big that we all might make mistakes.

130
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,800
Still, I believe

131
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
justice may be delayed,

132
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,399
but it will never be absent.

133
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,000
I want to tell those people

134
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,660
that the ugliness in your hearts

135
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,519
can't be hidden forever.

136
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,120
Thank you.

137
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,439
Excellent!

138
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:26,279
Excellent!

139
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,279
Well said!

140
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,000
Rightfully so!

141
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,439
He lives up to being
a student representative.

142
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:37,920
Zhao Jiadi.

143
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,120
There was once a fool

144
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,839
who confidently bet me

145
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,480
that I'd lose.

146
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,439
I mocked him.

147
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,360
But then, again and again,

148
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,759
you changed my view.

149
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,380
The troublemaker
I used to think you were

150
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,839
turned out to be a man of justice.

151
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,000
I admit it now

152
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,839
that I lost

153
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,120
that bet.

154
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,240
Zhao Jiadi,

155
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,000
thank you for everything
you did for the school.

156
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,879
You're still young,

157
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,439
but your approach is aggressive.

158
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,360
Don't lose sight of the bigger picture.

159
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,830
Good players strategize for momentum.

160
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,560
Bad players focus only on the stones.

161
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,040
Being stubborn means
underestimating your rival.

162
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,720
More haste, less speed.

163
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,360
Fan Jing passed
the imperial exam at 50.

164
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,120
Ambition keeps you young.

165
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,670
Without it, living to 100
is meaningless.

166
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,639
Gradual progress leads
you to a good end.

167
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,639
Too slow.

168
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,079
Arrogant youth

169
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,620
often aim to reach the sky in one leap.

170
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,140
Gan Luo became a grand chancellor at 12

171
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,319
and was killed at 13.

172
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,000
Zhong Yong became
a famous poet at five,

173
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,360
but his brilliance never lasted.

174
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,720
Why fear?

175
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,600
An ambitious man should
wield a long sword

176
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,530
and fight fearlessly for a great cause.

177
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,639
I've lost.

178
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,519
Zheng Kun has stirred up outrage

179
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,120
(Huixian Building)
across the campus.

180
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,079
The Education Bureau has been alerted.

181
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,279
(Expulsive Notice, Zheng Kun)
There's not much I can do.

182
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,000
Jiang,

183
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,560
can't you really do me this favor?

184
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,759
If that's the case, I might reconsider

185
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,970
the library donation...

186
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,439
As the chancellor,

187
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,519
I must set the right example

188
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,079
for the school.

189
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,120
The proud don't drink
from a stolen well.

190
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,580
The incorruptible don't
accept disgraceful charity.

191
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,000
You should discipline your son instead.

192
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:30,800
Please leave.

193
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,799
You got expelled.

194
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,470
All you ever do is cause me trouble.

195
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,399
I spent a fortune getting you in,

196
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,279
and yet you're making trouble here.

197
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,360
If you are,

198
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,000
clean up after yourself.

199
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,360
Stop dragging me

200
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,279
into your mess.

201
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,919
I'm cutting off your credit card.

202
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,120
Go find a job.

203
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,440
If you want to return to school,

204
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,470
that depends on what you do next.

205
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,919
Zheng Kun's dad gave up on him.

206
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,639
See? Serve his right.

207
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,919
What are you looking at?
Get lost!

208
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,639
Let's leave.

209
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,679
I ended up like this

210
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,320
all because of you.

211
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,000
Expelled,

212
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,919
jobless,

213
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,039
and my credit card cut off.

214
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,120
You came here to rub it in, huh?

215
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,120
Relax.

216
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,639
I'm here to offer you a job.

217
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,919
You didn't end up like this because of me.
It was Zhao Jiadi!

218
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,519
Zhao Jiadi.

219
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,240
Want this?

220
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,879
I'll give it to you.

221
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,519
Mess him up.

222
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,360
Prove to me you're serious.

223
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:48,720
Right.

224
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,080
Zhao Jiadi.

225
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,720
Zhao Jiadi!

226
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,759
Finish him.
