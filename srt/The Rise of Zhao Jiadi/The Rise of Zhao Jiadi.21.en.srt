=The Rise of Zhao Jiadi=

2
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,820
(Adapted from "Out of His League"
by Fenghuo Xizhuhou)

3
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,940
=Episode 21=

4
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,520
Can you tell me

5
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,520
if you have found
the meaning of your life?

6
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:51,039
I used to think

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,719
that my life had no meaning.

8
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,910
But after going through everything,

9
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:55,799
I realized

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,320
that meaning is created by us.

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,679
With great power
comes great responsibility.

12
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,599
Have you figured out

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,719
what you want to do next?

14
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,480
I can't do anything

15
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,560
all by myself.

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,439
I've learned that it takes teamwork.

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,760
Previously, I was arrogant,

18
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:21,920
so people around me

19
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,879
left me.

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,879
Do you regret it?

21
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:28,879
No.

22
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,400
I got expelled, got into fights,

23
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,680
fell out with my dad,

24
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,920
and let down someone I love.

25
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,359
I was too young and reckless

26
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,120
to make so many mistakes,

27
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,599
and I also affected others.

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,920
But only now

29
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,200
do I realize

30
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,599
that the one thing I did right.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,799
I will never

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,519
regret it.

33
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,760
That's to be myself.

34
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,200
Time is like a sieve.

35
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,719
It filters out the people around you,

36
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,079
and in the end, it leaves

37
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,599
the most precious ones.

38
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,359
(Baliang,)

39
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,159
(Mu Hongli has flown back
from Paris to Haicheng.)

40
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,360
Dear, your mom says they've arrived.

41
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,190
We'll meet them
after collecting our luggage.

42
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,159
I want to get some fresh air outside.

43
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,360
Okay. I'll head over first.

44
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,039
Sure.

45
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,960
Meet me at the exit later.

46
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,680
See you later.

47
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,879
(Haicheng,)

48
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,560
(I'm finally back.)

49
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,719
Hongli.

50
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,919
(Zhao Jiadi?)

51
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,879
Welcome back.

52
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,639
(How did he know I was back?)

53
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,479
(It's time to face reality.)

54
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:47,960
(Mu Hongli,)

55
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,439
(you should tell Zhao Jiadi everything.)

56
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,120
Dear,

57
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,280
you're here.

58
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,879
Why is your phone off?

59
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,919
I was looking for you.

60
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,319
Who are you?

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,680
Hello, Mom.

62
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,159
Hongli and I are waiting at Exit 3.

63
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,280
You once said

64
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,990
that I didn't give you flowers.

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,280
Looks like this will be the last time
I give you flowers.

66
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,039
Their marriage has been settled then.

67
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:42,680
Good.

68
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,639
Who is he?

69
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,520
Zhao Jiadi,

70
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,960
if you had any sense,

71
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,680
you wouldn't be here.

72
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,390
So when you said you were leaving,

73
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,290
it was a final goodbye.

74
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,000
I got the wrong idea.

75
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,680
Jiadi...

76
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,400
Hongli and Yu are engaged.

77
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,960
Stop pestering her.

78
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,759
You're like a toad,

79
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,680
you know?

80
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,919
Who are you calling a toad?

81
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,319
Who are these people?

82
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,000
Baliang.

83
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:28,680
Grandma.

84
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,120
My dear grandson,

85
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,940
I'm sorry you had to go through this.

86
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,120
Mrs. Mu, who is this old woman?

87
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,079
I'm fine, Grandma.

88
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,279
Who's in charge of the Mu family?

89
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,759
(He looks familiar.)

90
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,439
Come out. Let me see who you are.

91
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,200
Some people have their eyes

92
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,879
on their forehead.

93
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,600
(Isn't she Hongli's friend?)

94
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,890
- I won't say anything to this girl.
- (What is she doing here?)

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,160
After all, it's a young people's matter.

96
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:56,800
However,

97
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,959
whose eyes are blind?

98
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,160
Or who's right or wrong?

99
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,399
As parents,

100
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,399
no matter how it hurts,
we have to keep it to ourselves.

101
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,480
Grandma.

102
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,120
You all crossed the line.

103
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
So many of you

104
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,639
ganging up on one young man.

105
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,439
What a bully.

106
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,839
Mrs. Mu,

107
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,839
what's going on here?

108
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,560
This brat

109
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,079
has been pestering
my daughter-in-law, Hongli.

110
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,120
Now, he brought his whole family

111
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,000
to lecture us.

112
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,240
We're not scared of him.

113
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,560
Zhao Sanjin!

114
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,120
(Zhao Xin? The CEO of Jinhai Group.)

115
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,639
(This can't be.)

116
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,279
(Zhao Sanjin?)

117
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,639
(Zhao Xin?)

118
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,480
(Is he that famous Zhao Xin?)

119
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,079
How dare you bully my grandson?

120
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:51,600
Do you have no respect
for the Zhao family?

121
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,279
You're the boss of Jinhai Group,
but you're not helping.

122
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:56,040
Mom, calm down.

123
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,879
It's trivial.

124
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,360
Watch your blood pressure.

125
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,720
(Oh no, it's really that Zhao Xin.)

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,120
Oh, it's Mr. Zhao.

127
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,480
Mr. Zhao from Jinhai Group, right?

128
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,800
We're business partners.

129
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,560
My husband

130
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,120
is a contractor for your company.

131
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,959
Li Qin,

132
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,600
I've looked into
your corner-cutting issues

133
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,660
in the construction of our building.

134
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,480
Ms. Qin, I've also investigated you.

135
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,519
You avoided taxes

136
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,439
on financial projects in Haicheng.

137
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,800
If you hope

138
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,639
to work with me on Rongman Real Estate,

139
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,399
that's no deal.

140
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,639
To be honest,

141
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,759
I hate dishonest people.

142
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,759
Dongcao,

143
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,439
follow up on this.

144
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,879
If the Li family and Ms. Qin

145
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,839
don't pay their fines,

146
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,800
hand over all the evidence.

147
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,319
Zhao Sanjin,

148
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,879
stay out of my business.

149
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,560
Why are you acting tough on me?

150
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,040
Fight back if you can.

151
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,800
You're all tough when confronting me,

152
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,279
but now what?

153
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:10,990
I don't really care

154
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,600
about them.

155
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,319
Hongli,

156
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,639
we won't meet again.

157
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,959
Grandma, let's leave.

158
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,759
Zhao Jiadi.

159
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,079
Jiadi,

160
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll apologize to you.

161
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,839
Can you do me a favor

162
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,879
and not make things difficult for them?

163
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,040
Don't worry,

164
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,959
I don't take advantage of others.

165
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,079
It's not about me winning
and you losing.

166
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,279
This is all

167
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,639
your choice.

168
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,079
Ms. Qin.

169
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,190
Yes, Mrs. Li.

170
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,040
Didn't you say

171
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,600
Hongli was being harassed

172
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,040
by a social climber?

173
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,560
How could you lie to us?

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,480
Uh...

175
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,240
He's the son of Jinhai Group's CEO.

176
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,399
We can't afford to rub him
the wrong way.

177
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:14,079
Maybe we should cancel

178
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,519
the marriage.

179
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:16,560
Uh...

180
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,639
Dear, Li Yu,

181
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,959
let's go.

182
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,380
We have to find someone
to put in a good word for us.

183
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:21,759
Let's go.

184
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,930
If we really offend Zhao Xin,

185
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,199
we're done for.

186
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,120
Hongli,

187
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,039
it's my fault.

188
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,480
I apologize.
