00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,870
=The Rise of Zhao Jiadi=

2
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,820
(Adapted from "Out of His League"
by Fenghuo Xizhuhou)

3
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,940
=Episode 1=

4
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,900
(Jinhai Tower)

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,960
(You owe money,
you pay!)

6
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,570
(I worked for years at Jinhai Group
and got nothing out of it!)

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,520
(We gave them
everything we had.)

8
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,870
(We deserve something
in return!)

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,479
(You are just a kid.)

10
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,600
(How can you
keep us here?)

11
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:58,840
(Can you
even afford it?)

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,600
(We followed Zhao Xin for years)

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,119
(and ended up
with nothing.)

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,480
(So much cash...)

15
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,200
(Don't push!)

16
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,400
(I'm taking my cut!)

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,920
(A man without desire)

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,120
(is a beast tamed.)

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,000
(But I am a wolf.)

20
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,359
(My name is Zhao Jiadi.)

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,560
(This is my story.)

22
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,519
(A tale of a boy)

23
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,079
(growing into a man.)

24
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,940
(Jinhai Tower)

25
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:35,840
(Year 2005)
(Graduation!)

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,220
(Tanshan No. 4 High School)
(This is awesome!)

27
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,580
(Tanshan No. 4 High School)
(Big news!)

28
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,159
(Tanshan No. 4 High School)
(Thanks to our school's support,)

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,159
(Zhao Jiadi from Class 5E)

30
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,400
(won top prizes)

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,680
(in the National Math
and Physics Olympiad.)

32
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,959
(Double gold medals!)

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,280
(Direct admission
to Tsinghua and Peking.)

34
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,760
(Our school's efforts)

35
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,879
(were recognized by
the Education Bureau.)

36
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,840
(A huge milestone
for our school.)

37
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,680
Zhao Jiadi.

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,319
You already got into
the top universities!

39
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,879
Why would you give that up?

40
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,040
Your family will never agree to this.

41
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,120
My decisions

42
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,040
do not need anyone's approval.

43
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,319
What is the point of all this?

44
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,240
You are throwing your life away!

45
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,240
My life

46
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,759
is mine to define.

47
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,439
(Mr. Zhao is
a real big shot.)

48
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,560
(The whole business world)

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,360
(of Tanshan came for
his graduation party.)

50
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,240
(There is a saying.)

51
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,199
(In Tanshan,)

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,159
(if my brother-in-law
Zhao Xin wants it,)

53
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,840
(Graduation Party)
the universe grants it.

54
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,773
(Wang Houde, CEO of Jinhai)
Too bad for Zhao Jiadi.

55
00:02:28,912 --> 00:02:29,646
(Huang Ruiyang, Supervisor)
He is just a bookworm.

56
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:30,380
(Zhao Xin's brother-in-law)
He is just a bookworm.

57
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,479
He can't handle big things.

58
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,120
I think Jinhai's future

59
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,120
still depends on Pigeon.

60
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,639
Pigeon is still too young.

61
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,000
If you ask me,

62
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,400
Ruiyang has a better shot.

63
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,960
Mr. Zhao is
the province's richest.

64
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,159
He has billions in assets.

65
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:45,840
I'll need you to

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,120
put in a good word for me.

67
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,280
If I land a 100-million deal,
you will be rewarded.

68
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,360
(A graduation party?)

69
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,719
(More like a vanity project for Zhao Xin
to show off.)

70
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,356
(Granny Zhao,
Empress of the family.)

71
00:02:56,356 --> 00:02:58,040
(Qi Dongcao, Secretary,
Business Empress.)

72
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,319
Baliang.

73
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,120
Granny, Dongcao.

74
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,719
Baliang.

75
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,120
This was blessed by a master.

76
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,560
They say it makes
your wishes come true.

77
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,159
You and Dongcao

78
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,319
should set the date soon.

79
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,199
You two need to get moving.

80
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,520
Granny!

81
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,080
We are still young.

82
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,520
Dongcao and I

83
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,039
will talk about it.

84
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,439
Mr. Zhao is here!

85
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,599
- Mr. Zhao!
- Mr. Zhao!

86
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,479
Mr. Zhao!

87
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,080
(Chairman Zhao Xin,
richest in the province)

88
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,759
(Huang Fangfei, Jiadi's stepmother)
Long time no see.

89
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,430
(Chairman Zhao Xin)
Long time no see.

90
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:35,100
(Huang Fangfei, Jiadi's stepmother)
Long time no see.

91
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,680
- Congrats, Mr. Zhao!
- Wonderful, Mr. Zhao!

92
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,520
Mr. Zhao,
you are truly blessed.

93
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,759
Which top university
did your son get into?

94
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,639
Originally, Tsinghua or Peking.

95
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,479
But he turned them down.

96
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,960
My son

97
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,759
needs to study abroad.

98
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,159
Everything is arranged.

99
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,639
Mr. Zhao, you are
like Dorgon reborn!

100
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,719
Your son takes after your talents.

101
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,679
(Zhao Yangge, "Pigeon")
Jiadi, going abroad is great.

102
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,439
(Zhao Xin's youngest son)
Jiadi, going abroad is great.

103
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,210
I finished my college choices.

104
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,159
I'm not going.

105
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,800
I am going to Haicheng University.

106
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Haicheng University?

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,719
A no-name school?

108
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,319
Baliang, you are way out of line.

109
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,800
How could you pick
a third-rate university?

110
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,159
A third-rate school?

111
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,800
Zhao Jiadi.

112
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,120
Are you trying to humiliate me?

113
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,480
Without me,

114
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,360
you are worth nothing.

115
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,240
Just a penniless nobody.

116
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
So what if I am?

117
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,920
I will still rise through the ranks.

118
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,000
Seriously?

119
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,759
Come on, times have changed.

120
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,560
Ordinary folks do not stand a chance.

121
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,800
Then, I will prove it to you.

122
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,490
Without your help,

123
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,519
I will start from scratch,

124
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,560
and build my own life.

125
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,439
After I graduate,

126
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,610
I'll make ten million

127
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:42,920
to prove you wrong.

128
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:43,839
Care to bet?

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,920
Ten million?

130
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,040
And if you fail?

131
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,240
Deal with me however you want.

132
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:50,959
Very well.

133
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,319
A gentleman keeps his word.

134
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,759
If you lose,

135
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,160
you call her "Mom".

136
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,120
And if I win?

137
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,079
You bring my mom back from abroad.

138
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,519
You and that woman

139
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,279
have to apologize to her.

140
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,639
You brat!

141
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,480
How dare you?

142
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,759
You were unfaithful.

143
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,399
You lived off a woman.

144
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,319
You left my mother
alone for eight years.

145
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,120
You were heartless.

146
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,519
You abandoned your wife and son.

147
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,759
You even had an affair with my tutor.

148
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,279
You really are a great father.

149
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,600
Have you ever

150
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,519
had any decency?

151
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,399
You brat!

152
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,120
You ungrateful punk!

153
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,199
Baliang, I am tired.

154
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,720
Granny.

155
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,439
Mom, stop defending him.

156
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:44,920
Zhao Jiadi.

157
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,519
If you walk out of here today,

158
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,560
you are no longer my son.

159
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,959
You want to go to a lame school?

160
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:52,560
Fine.

161
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,680
Your tuition and your living expenses

162
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,240
are your responsibilities.

163
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,040
Granny, let's go.

164
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,480
Since you drove my mom away,

165
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,480
I haven't spent a penny of yours.

166
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,480
I really don't get it.

167
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,879
What is the deal with him?

168
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,639
He sees you as his nemesis.

169
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,279
Pigeon.

170
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,959
You must never act like your brother.

171
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:12,399
My sister will be
calling the shots soon.

172
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,560
I can do whatever
I want at the company.

173
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,199
He is not my son now!

174
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,900
(2005, Start of Semester
Haicheng University)

175
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,600
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

176
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,439
Shoot!

177
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,120
Come on!

178
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,680
Hit him!

179
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,959
What are you doing?
You did it on purpose!

180
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,240
Weakling. Your legs
were just too weak.

181
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,120
What do you want?

182
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,680
What?

183
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,800
Looking for a fight?

184
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,199
Die!

185
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,279
What are you doing? Huh?

186
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,279
Ever heard of the
Shajiaozi street fight?

187
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,000
That was all Sparrow's work.

188
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,279
Oh, I'm so scared.

189
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,720
Heard of the Tanshan King Kong?

190
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,879
That's our boss, Shang Bao.

191
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,959
Back at Wudaokou,

192
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,800
he put a dozen thugs
into the ICU by himself.

193
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,480
When he shows up, you'll be shaking.

194
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,079
Fine by me!

195
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,199
Bring it on!

196
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,399
Shang Bao?

197
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,639
I missed sparring with him.

198
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,279
Sparrow is here!

199
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,360
You're finished!

200
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,439
I've been itching
to stretch my muscles.

201
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,879
Sparrow, you sure kept me waiting.

202
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,000
See that?
Our boss is here.

203
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,520
- You're done for.
- You're dead meat.

204
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,780
(Shang Que, the Deadly Scholar)

205
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,060
(Shang Bao, the Immortal King Kong)

206
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,480
Boss, that's him!

207
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,319
Leopard.

208
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:37,120
Sparrow, we have rules.

209
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,560
Same as always. One-on-one.

210
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,319
Come on.

211
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,040
Where's the ball?

212
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:40,959
The ball!

213
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,759
Here it is.

214
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,360
That was insane!

215
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,000
- Yeah!
- Unreal!

216
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,630
- It's Mr. Baliang.
- That's Baliang!

217
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,000
You two grew up fighting.

218
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,399
Isn't it time to bury the hatchet?

219
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,040
Since you said so,

220
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,240
of course we'll listen.

221
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,040
Yeah, we will.

222
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,160
Who is this guy?

223
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,399
Even Leopard and Sparrow
treat him like royalty.

224
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,639
They are the wildest in all of Tanshan!

225
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,439
Yeah, seriously.

226
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,279
We've always called
him that. Just habit.

227
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,079
Mr. Baliang.

228
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,240
Why are you at Haicheng University too?

229
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,959
Don't tell me...

230
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,519
Don't tell me he is...

231
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,959
The one who made Tanshan tremble?

232
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,360
The top dog of Tanshan,

233
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,560
Zhao Jiadi?
