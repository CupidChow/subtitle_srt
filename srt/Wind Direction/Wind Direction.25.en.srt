00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,700
Here, this is for you.

5
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,670
No need.

6
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,750
Take it.

7
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,329
Thank you.

8
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,390
You're welcome.

9
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,870
Who are you looking for?

10
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,810
I'm looking for Yang Songbai.

11
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,020
Yang what?

12
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,829
Yang Songbai.

13
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,810
I'm Yang Songbai's wife.

14
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,730
Mr. Yang.

15
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,210
-Mr. Yang.
-The engineer Mr. Yang?

16
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:33,900
Yes.

17
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,050
Come up.

18
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,030
Did you get seasick

19
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,590
on the way here?

20
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,570
It was okay.

21
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,560
Here, have some water.

22
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,380
What is this?

23
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,980
Didn't you say last time

24
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,060
you wanted to eat dumplings with leeks?

25
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,860
I made some for you this morning.

26
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,820
It's still warm.

27
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,290
Let me try.

28
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,050
You put shrimp skin in it.

29
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,210
Is it good?

30
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,870
No wonder it smells so good.

31
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:17,930
Come on.

32
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:18,780
Try one.

33
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,440
No, I've eaten at home.

34
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,220
Try one.

35
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,200
You didn't wash your hands.

36
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,350
It's okay. It's not dirty.

37
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:28,730
It's good.

38
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,540
When I washed your clothes

39
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,980
I noticed the collars

40
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,329
were all worn out.

41
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,810
I bought some new ones.

42
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,090
Try them on later

43
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,090
to see if they fit.

44
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,110
Why spend

45
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:41,890
the money?

46
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,600
I have clothes here.

47
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,890
Use the money to

48
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
buy more things

49
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,780
for you and Min.

50
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,260
We don't need it.

51
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,660
Try them on later.

52
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:58,980
Here.

53
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,730
Here's my salary for the month,

54
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,860
75 yuan.

55
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,050
Why so much this month?

56
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,110
There's a bonus.

57
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,740
Don't give them all to me.

58
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,100
Keep some for yourself.

59
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,970
No, I don't need it.

60
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,240
There's a shuttle bus to take me back.

61
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,410
I can't drink wine here.

62
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,290
I don't spend money.

63
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,090
Why do I need money?

64
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:29,890
Keep them all.

65
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,170
I'll give them to you every month.

66

Hu Yue.

67
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,730
You're raising

68
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,770
two kids alone.

69
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,250
It must be hard.

70
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,090
Not at all.

71
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,020
Isn't that what a mother should do?

72
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,170
Collect your

73
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,450
dirty clothes later.

74
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,810
I'll take them back.

75
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,640
I've organized

76
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,330
your

77
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,530
clean ones too.

78
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,690
You should be back by the end of the month, right?

79
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,970
What do you want to eat?

80
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,010
Tell me in advance.

81
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,370
I'll prepare for you.

82
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,690
Wang is on leave.

83
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,290
I mean,

84
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,740
how about not going

85
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,450
back tonight?

86
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,530
No way.

87
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,330
The kids are still at home.

88
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,920
Didn't you just say?

89
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,050
Tao has grown up

90
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,980
and can take care of his sister now.

91
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,260
You should take care of me.

92
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,810
The helmet.

93
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,690
I have to wear it too?

94
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,130
Yes, of course.

95
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,210
Here.

96
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,210
Okay.

Hello, Mr. Yang.

98
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,650
She's my wife.

-Hello, Jianjun.
-I saw you this morning.

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,930
Really?

115
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,670
She brought me dumplings.

116
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,780
Is your wife delicious?

117
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,890
What are you talking about?

118
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,490
Let's go. Just ignore them.

119
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,750
They're just teasing.

120
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,330
Mr. Yang.

121
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,070
Look at the clouds.

122
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,250
Beautiful, huh?

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,530
It's beautiful over there.

124

[Rainstorm is Coming]

125
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,010
Is there a rope in the car?

126
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:11,890
What for?

127
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,450
I'll hold it in the front,

128
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,650
and then in the back seat,

129
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,400
tie it

130
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,770
to the trunk,

131
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,730
we can fit more stuff.

132
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,970
This is a Santana,

133
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,170
not the big truck you're talking about.

134
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,570
It can't fit.

135
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,060
You're here.

136
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,570
Songbai.

137
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,540
Where are you going?

138
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,550
To move things.

139
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,410
Songbai,

140
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,490
how about I get

141
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,450
a truck from the factory?

142
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,850
How long would that take?

143
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,770
Why get a truck?

144
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,500
I only have these two baggages.

145
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,700
No, then...

146
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,250
A bike will do.

147
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,000
Is one enough?

148
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,490
It's unnecessary to drive a car.

149
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,060
Let's go.

150
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,670
Where are we going?

151
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:04,810
The dorm.

152
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:15,890
He can go

153
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,890
wherever he wants.

154
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,170
We're divorced.

155
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,630
Why do I care where he goes?

156
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,590
He's in the No. 3 Factory..

157
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,890
Don't drink alone.

158
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,850
Come on.

159
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,720
So he only has a dorm

160
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,930
in the No. 3 Factory,

161
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,010
no house.

162
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,289
Even if he's promoted to Deputy Director,

163
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,549
I'm telling you, he...

164
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,130
He's not married.

165
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,740
They won't assign him a house.

166
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,890
If he gets married again,

167
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,350
that'll be his third time.

168
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,799
Ling, all the dishes are served.

169
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:45,580
Are we really closed today?

170
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,330
Yes.

171
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,480
Go back and rest.

172
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,410
Take the day off.

173
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,020
Okay. Enjoy your meal.

174
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:50,850
Okay.

175
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,810
Don't. Why close?

176
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,300
How much money will you lose?

177
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,070
I can't earn it all.

178
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,780
Daiyu,

179
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,340
ask for leave today.

180
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,240
Don't go.

181
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,400
The three of us

182
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,680
enjoy ourselves here.

183
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:03,490
Here.

184
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:04,730
Okay.

185
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,420
Let's

186
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,620
have fun today.

187
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,100
I told you,

188
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,210
an unpleasant marriage

189
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,610
is not a good marriage.

190
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,000
You've got a job

191
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,930
and a daughter.

192
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,290
You'll be fine without anyone.

193
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:14,960
That's right.

194
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,560
I'll be fine without anyone.

195
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,570
Cheers.

196
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,180
How will you be fine?

197
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,170
How?

198
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,090
You don't even know how to cook.

199
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,690
There's a canteen.

200
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,970
How old are you?

201
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,010
You still eat in the canteen?

202
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,540
It's not good for your body.

203
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:30,290
Besides,

204
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,690
even if the cafeteria gives you food,

205
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,570
who will wash your clothes?

206
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,700
Can the canteen do the laundry for you?

207
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,930
I've always thought

208
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,890
Songbai

209
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:37,970
is a tough guy.

210
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,690
The first time he got divorced, he left with nothing.

211
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,090
Now, the second divorce,

212
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,370
same as usual.

213
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,610
Well, I...

214
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,490
I still have there two big bags.

215
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,130
How much are those clothes worth?

216
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:49,650
It's nothing.

217
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,050
And what about the books?

218
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,250
-Your mindset...
-Fine.

219
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,120
With books,

220
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,180
you're not lonely.

221
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,640
Books are your spiritual home.

222
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,720
Pengfei, I think we should

223
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,250
secretly stash some jewelry

224
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,670
just in case.

225
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,330
If we

226
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,730
ever get kicked out some day,

227
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,840
we can rely on it.

228
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,290
No, I think

229
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,160
now

230
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,570
the point

231
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,680
is not to get

232
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,050
kicked out so easily.

233
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:17,640
Right?

234
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,810
Yang,

235
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,730
when you were young,

236
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,450
getting divorced

237
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,810
wasn't a big deal.

238
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,370
But you're in middle age now,

239
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,130
the cost

240
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,670
of divorce is too high, right?

241
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,290
You can't just go back

242
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,570
to square one like that.

243
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,450
Not just square one,

244
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,330
we have to let them go back to square zero.

245
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,000
Right?

246
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,210
Living in hardship.

247
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,070
Don't even think about a good day.

248
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,930
The kids, the house, and the savings.

249
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,410
He won't take any with him.

250
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,880
Times have changed, right?

251
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,970
If Cheng Pengfei wants to divorce me,

252
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,860
he'll leave with 200 yuan at most.

253
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,410
He can take one of the kids,

254
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,650
but they have to live in his office at the hospital.

255
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,180
Let’s see who'd go with him.

256
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,850
Li Si wouldn't go with his dad.

257
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,490
Think about it.

258
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,250
I run such a big restaurant.

259
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,490
Li Dahai's monthly salary

260
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,890
might just

261
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,100
cover my water and electricity bills.

262
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,850
If he dares to divorce me,

263
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,490
I'll make sure he's left with nothing,

264
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,650
not even underwear.

265
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,750
I feel great

266
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,850
now.

267
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,850
Go back and beg for mercy.

268
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,490
Yes.

269
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,240
Maybe there's still a chance.

270
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,890
Alright, that's it.

271
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,950
-Just drive.
-It’s over.

272
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,700
[Divorce Certificate]

273
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:01,810
Min,

274
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,100
How about

275
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,050
I ask for a leave for you at school?

276
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,710
Let's go to Beijing together.

277
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,590
Mom, you've changed a lot.

278
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,010
When I couldn't get up before,

279
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:17,730
you were afraid I'd be late,

280
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,830
yelling at me.

281
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,920
Now you're helping me skip class.

282
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,630
What are you talking about?

283
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,250
What do you mean by skipping class?

284
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,090
Isn't this a reasonable leave?

285
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,250
I mean it.

286
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,210
I'll buy you a ticket.

287
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,320
Let's go together.

288
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:32,890
What do you think?

289
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,050
No need.

290
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,210
Go by yourself.

291
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,660
I've got other things to do.

292
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,660
I'm not going.

293
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,010
Min,

294
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,240
why didn't you ask me why I divorced?

295
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,610
So, if we

296
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,810
had both told the truth back then,

297
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,730
do you think

298
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,260
we would still be together?

299
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,780
I don't know.

300
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,310
I don't know.

301
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,170
But if we hadn't been together,

302
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,930
would our lives

303
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,730
have been less awful afterward?

304
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,040
Maybe.

305
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,260
We used to say that

306
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,290
we divorced

307
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,970
for the kid.

308
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,970
But why are we together?

309
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:33,810
For the kid.

310
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,220
Also for the kid.

311
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,090
When will we ever

312
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,790
live for ourselves once?

313
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,210
You're divorced, not me.

314
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,570
You've divorced already.

315
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,330
Why do I have to ask why?

316
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:52,970
Right?

317
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:55,490
Mom,

318
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,810
even if you and Yang

319
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,770
are not a couple,

320
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,530
my brother and I

321
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,570
are family.

322
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:02,770
In the future,

323
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,970
I'll go to Shenzhen University

324
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,120
and find my brother.

325
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:09,770
Okay.

326
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,170
But don't tell your brother

327
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,370
about our divorce.

328
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,410
He's prepping for his grad exams.

329
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,210
He needs to focus on his studies.

330
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,010
Got it.

331
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,670
Do you blame me?

332
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,530
Of course.

333
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:41,850
I blame you for not

334
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,780
thinking about yourself earlier,

335
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,720
for the unhappy years

336
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,050
you've endured,

337
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,460
and for losing yourself

338
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,820
for my sake.

339
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,410
Cheer up.

340
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,410
Have fun.

341
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,750
Sit over there.

342
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,010
Where did you two go?

343
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,400
Let's go.

344
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,780
What?

345
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:02,990
Sit.

346
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,970
I can do it myself.

347
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,180
It's cute.

348
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,890
It's okay. I'm always like this.

349
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,570
Next time my dad

350
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,880
brings this up,

351
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,850
I'll say Qiang Xiaowa does the same.

352
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,890
Come on, put it on.

353
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:25,950
Take it off.

354
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:32,610
Try it.

355
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,290
What do you think?

356
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,050
Fits well.

357
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:36,810
Not bad.

358
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:40,960
Look.

359
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,540
No, why are you doing this?

360
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,180
-What do you mean?
-Put it on.

361
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,520
Stop dawdling.

362
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,770
Today is a special day.

363
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,560
We need to look sharp.

364
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,220
Yes, ready to go.

365
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,369
It's a good sign.

366
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:07,250
Si bought it for you.

367
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,579
I also added some money.

368
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,579
I must say,

369
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,230
you're more handsome like me.

370
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,599
Just relax,

371
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,890
we're here to have fun.

372
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,010
Thank you.

373
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,000
Everyone,

374
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,849
our essay competition topic today

375
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:24,970
is "Hometown."

376
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,640
You have 70 minutes to write.

377
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,130
Start now.

378
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,810
I think I look good

379
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,670
in this outfit.

380
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,850
It's all about

381
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,850
personal charm.

382
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,090
Indeed.

383
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,080
Then you can buy

384
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,320
what Qiang Xiaowa wears,

385
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,530
and he wears yours.

386
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,410
No way.

387
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,410

doesn't have a train station,

515
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,290
so the bus station

516
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,690
is the key transport hub.

517
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,410
I want to lease a long-distance bus

519
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:22,930
It's all cash,

520
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,060
guaranteed profit.

521
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,260
Sounds like a good idea.

522
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:26,990
Right?

523
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:27,970
But my sister

524
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:28,970
doesn't get it.

525
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,210
She won't support me,

526
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,080
just watching

527
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,210
this business opportunity slip away.

528
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,470

529
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,170
Ling, that's not what I mean.

00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,730
not that kind of

00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,260
I don't believe I can't make it.

540
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,050
Looks like you have a plan.

541
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,020
You want to use my place as a stepping stone?

-No, no, Ling.

Not the kitchen.

Okay.

-This way, please.
-Please come in.

563
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:31,170
Okay.

564
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,130

565
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,720
how did your exam go?

566
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,270
Doesn't matter.

567
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,660
Today, we're going to treat you

568
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,730
no matter what.

569
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,330
Right, what do you want to eat?

570
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:49,730
Tell me.

571
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,330
Eat...

572
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,570
Sorry, sorry about that.

573
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:55,320
It's okay.

574
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,050
Are you okay?

575
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,240
A bunch of bumpkins.

576
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,180
Aren't we eating?

577
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,810
What are we eating? Let's go.

578
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,890
What time is it now?

579
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:13,970
Go make dinner!

580
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,620
Waiting for me to cook?

581
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,740
I'm a different person now.

582
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,550
What do you mean different?

583
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,190
I have an announcement.

584
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,250
I'm now the lobby manager

585
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,210
at Xiaoshudu Restaurant,

586
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,270
starting work officially tomorrow.

587
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,410
What? Who let you take that job?

588
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,730
It's all because of

589
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,170
my impressive abilities.

590
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,090
Ling is completely impressed

591
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:33,770
by me now.

592
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,500
She sees me in a whole new light.

593
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,840
I'll call Lingling right now.

594
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,490
Don't.

595
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,370
Why call her?

596
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,330
Yu, can't you just support

597
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,390
my career for once?

598
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,730
Stop holding me back.

599
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,730
Supporting you going to Xiaoshudu Restaurant

600
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,130
would be holding Lingling back.

601
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,330
Yu, I promise,

602
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,370
this time I'll work hard

603
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,030
and make something of myself.

604
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:50,890
I'll change

605
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,090
that deeply rooted

606
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,210
image you have

607
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,290
of me completely.

608
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,400
You won't.

609
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,230
Where did you get the suit?

610
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,900
Is it Pengfei's?

611
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:03,770
Yu.

612
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,350
Look

613
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,010
how hard I'm trying.

614
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,690
What's the big deal with a suit?

615
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:08,210
Right?

616
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,490
You've been talking about starting a business

617
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,610
and working.

618
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:13,810
How did your ambition

619
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,130
suddenly blow up?

620
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,090
I want to prove

621
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:17,890
I'm a

622
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,960
reliable man.

623
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,690
Yu, I'm hungry.

624
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,500
Go make dinner.

625
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:27,420
Alright.

626
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,150
The lobby manager is cooking for you.

627
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,090
Mr. Yang.

628
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:36,570
Go ahead.

629
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,230
There's a girl here to see you.

630
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:41,450
Here.

631
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,450
Just connect this box and it's done.

632
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,220
[hydraulic power unit]

633
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,210
Min.

634
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,530
Come, Min, let's eat.

635
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,420
Does your mom know you're here?

636
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:18,530
No.

637
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,090
She went on a trip.

638
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,330
Trip?

639
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:23,810
Where to?

640
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:24,690
Beijing.

641
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:27,850
She went alone?

642
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,330
Yes.

643
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,260
Mr. Yang.

644
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,740
About the new equipment maintenance...

645
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,620
I know.

646
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,500
How about this?

647
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,650
Take someone to clean up first.

648
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,800
I'll be right there.

649
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,330
Go on with your work.

650
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,080
Don't worry about me.

651
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,660
It's fine.

652
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,120
I just came to check on you.

653
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,590
You'll live here from now on?

654
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,090
I don't live here.

655
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,660
My dorm is in the family area at the No. 3 Factory.

656
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,790
How did you get here?

657
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,750
I took the shuttle bus.

658
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,250
I told them

659
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,440
I was going to the No. 3 Factory to see my dad,

660
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,700
so they let me through.

661
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,460
Min,

662
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,690
about your mom and me...

663
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,540
I know.

664
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:16,690
You know?

665
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,850
What I want to say is,

666
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,490
this is an adult matter.

667
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,970
You're divorced already.

668
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,610
No more preaching.

669
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:32,970
You didn't

670
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,050
ask for our permission

671
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,310
when you got married,

672
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:36,800
so there's no need to inform us

673
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,260
when you divorce either.

674
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,720
It's your business.

675
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,010
True.

676
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,570
It's between your mom and me,

677
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,360
nothing to do with you.

678
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,650
I'll tell my brother

679
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,120
after his exams are over.

680
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,800
Okay.

681
00:27:59,130 --> 00:27:59,930
Min,

682
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,930
Yang Tao will always be your brother.

683
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:03,990
That won't change.

684
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,840
And you'll always be my stepfather.

685
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,300
That won't change either.

686
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,100
Coming.

687
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:26,770
Coming.

688
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:28,770
I…

689
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,750
Jia Baoshan, what do you want?

690
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,950
Just listen to me.

691
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,450
I have nothing to say to you.

692
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,410
Don't even think about using me.

693
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,680
Stop shooting at my

694
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,450
calm waters.

695
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,730
When did I ever shoot?

696
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,650
I'm just a small boat

697
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,240
that hasn't even launched yet,

698
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,490
and you've already stranded me.

699
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,170
Stop with

700
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:42,890
the sweet talk.

701
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,290
I'm not falling for it.

702
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,770
Can I just take my lunchbox?

703
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,730
Director Xiao, hurry up.

704
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,380
I'm waiting by the door.

705
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,420
Come in.

706
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,170
What did I do to you?

707
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,130
You can't just fleece the same sheep

708
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,490
every time, you know?

709
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,650
I'm not well-off either.

710
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,770
I know you're not.

711
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:06,810
That's why I'm bringing food

712
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,560
and warmth, right?

713
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,090
Cut the crap.

714
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,130
Just tell me

715
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:10,810
what you want.

716
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:11,740
Get to the point.

717
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,300
I'm here for the lunch box.

718
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:15,960
Take it away.

719
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,210
Don't send me

720
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,250
things here anymore.

721
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,290
Fang.

722
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,490
We are not that close.

723
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,150
Director Xiao, calm down.

724
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,650
Please let me explain.

725
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,130
I'm not using you

726
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,040
to do things.

727
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,810
I wanted to work at the No. 2 High School cafeteria.

728
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,130
In the public interest, I wanted to contribute

729
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:30,850
to the educational sector.

730
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:31,460
Privately,

731
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,070
I really admire you.

732
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:33,610
Think about it,

733
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,410
I could add a couple more meatballs

734
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,490
to your plate,

735
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,840
wouldn't that be nice?

736
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,530
Me, Director of Teaching and Discipline,

737
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,490
take advantage of those

738
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,080
meatballs from the public?

739
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,080
Absolutely not.

740
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:44,570
So,

741
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,970
after your critique,

742
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,450
I deeply reflected

743
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:48,810
and decided not to go to

744
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:49,800
the No. 2 High School cafeteria.

745
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,930
I'm heading to Xiaoshudu Restaurant instead.

746
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:51,210
After I

747
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,210
make a mark there,

748
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,470
I'll come back to you.

749
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,610
Until then,

750
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,070
I won't step in your dorm.

751
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,820
I'll prove it to you then.

752
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,890
Prove what?

753
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,760
That what I told you before

754
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,790
was sincere.

755
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,610
By the way,

756
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,740
keep this as a souvenir.

757
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,480
It's shockproof.

758
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,280
What is he talking about?

759
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,340
[Special for Fang]

760
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,000
Tell my daughter

761
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,970
to stay inside.

762
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,830
The wind's too strong.

763
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,170
Min,

764
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,620
your dad said it's windy,

765
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,740
and he has to work longer.

766
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,940
Go back to the office.

767
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,170
It's okay. Let him do his work.

768
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,070
Don't worry about me.

And 300 yuan.

774

Really?

775
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,240
Impressive.

776
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,050
What's the big deal?

00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,690
Nothing. What's your name?

784
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,610
I'm Qin Yuan.

785
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,570
Qin Yuan?

786
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,640
I saw your name just now.

787
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,350
You got an honorable mention.

788
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,670
We got third prize.

789
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,810
Only first prize gets a trophy.

790
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,890
The third prize is the same as me.

791
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,660
It's just a certificate.

How can you say that?

793
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,390
We still have 300 yuan.

794

It has nothing to do with money.

It's about honor.

796
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,350
An honorable mention

797
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,840

801
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,370
Because in the exam room,

everyone is treated equally.

Good for you.

818
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,490
Shouldn't have had so much ice cream.

819
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,650
And lamb skewers.

820
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,250
Like you've never seen food before.

Got yourself indigestion.

822
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,310
Aren't you embarrassed?

823
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,990
I don't have the energy to argue with you.

824
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,420
Why would you argue with me?

825
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,530
The tickets were so expensive,

826
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,240
and we only played a few projects.

827
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,330
I heard there was

828
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,650
a huge haunted house there.

829
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,490
Super fun.

830
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,969

There's no next time.

and we're going back tomorrow.

835
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,810
At this moment,
