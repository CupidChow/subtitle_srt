1
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,350
Why do we have to move?

2
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,840
Where are we even going?

3
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,790
We'll never come back.

4
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,400
Miaomiao, why are you all crying here?

5
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,710
Stop getting in the way.

6
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,680
We won't leave!

7
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,280
No one can separate us!

8
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,630
Yes, we're staying!

9
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,890
Who said anything about separating you?

10
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,800
We're all moving together.

11
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,030
To a new base.

12
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,430
Let's go.

13
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,630
Come on, Mom already said

14
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,290
that we'd never be separated.

15
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,870
Take Li Si for treatment as soon as possible.

16
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,200
Don't delay any longer.

17
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,030
You startled me.

18
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,710
Why are you here?

19
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,120
I just called you.

20
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,380
Why didn't you answer?

21
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,560
What's wrong?

22
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,840
People are watching.

23
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,190
It's okay. I'm here.

24
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,560
I'm telling you all.

25
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,920
From now on, when you talk to me,

26
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,590
you've got to be more careful.

27
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,710
Fang is going to be my uncle's wife.

28
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,590
Wait.

29
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,750
Why is Fang

30
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,230
dating your uncle now?

31
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:12,910
Didn't she

32
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,840
hit it off

33
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,430
with Cheng Miaomiao's uncle?

34
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,230
Zhu Chao!

35
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,040
Do you still

36
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,800
want to be the Class Monitor next semester?

37
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,000
If you do,

38
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,930
a word from me will do the trick!

39
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,270
Li Si!

40
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,380
You've got long legs, huh?

41
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,430
There isn't enough space to put them,

42
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,240
so you put them on the table, right?

43
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,000
Good.

44
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,270
Let's put your long legs to good use.

45
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,390
Go mop the floor.

46
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,270
Why are you mopping the floor?

47
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,070
What did you do this time?

48
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,530
Can't you behave for once?

49
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,070
How can you say that?

50
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,800
I'm doing this

51
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,870
purely out of love for the school.

52
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,480
Go on and mop.

53
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,080
Just think of it as exercise.

54
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,240
Pengfei.

55
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,080
T-T-This is Dr. Liu.

56
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,160
Are the results out?

57
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,920
Y-Y-You... well...

58
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,070
Have a seat first. Sit.

59
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,800
Take a seat.

60
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,110
I'll ask him.

61
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,750
-Dr. Liu.
-Dr. Liu

62
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,080
Dr. Liu, please tell me.

63
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,240
How is it?

64
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,560
Does he have colon cancer?

65
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,820
Yes, it's confirmed. It's colon cancer.

66
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,480
The medical resources at our oilfield hospital are limited.

67
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,270
I suggest

68
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,330
you take him to a hospital in a larger city immediately.

69
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,659
Beijing, then?

70
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,950
The cost of cancer treatment

71
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,040
is still quite high.

72
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,800
You need to be mentally prepared.

73
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,720
What are the chances of a cure...

74
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,430
after the surgery?

75
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,310
Colon cancer...

76
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,560
is quite special.

77
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,120
Before detection, there are typically no symptoms.

78
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,920
However, once it is discovered,

79
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,720
the outlook is often not very optimistic.

80
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,240
Based on my assessment,

81
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
the chance of surgery curing it is already very low.

82
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,000
It's already in an advanced stage.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,920
The only remaining option

84
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,520
is conservative treatment.

85
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,240
But even that

86
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,830
will only slightly

87
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,200
extend his life for a short period.

88
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,120
How long?

89
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,560
About... three to six months.

90
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,390
Mom?

91
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,630
Mom!

92
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,720
Mom!

93
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,800
Son, you're back.

94
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,730
What's going on?

95
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,070
Why did my dad

96
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,160
come back so early today?

97
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,420
And he's even cooking.

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,800
Your dad didn't have much to do at work today,

99
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,000
so he came back early.

100
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,070
You're back.

101
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,120
You...

102
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,390
You're back, son?

103
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,000
Wash your hands, and let's have dinner.

104
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,670
What's wrong?

105
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,920
Nothing.

106
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Did you two fight?

107
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,270
No, I...

108
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:54,920
No. No.

109
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,360
Something must have happened.

110
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,480
Something big must have happened.

111
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

112
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,680
What big thing could've happened?

113
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,600
Hurry up.

114
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,600
Wash your hands, and let's have dinner.

115
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,390
Be good. Try your dad's cooking.

116
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,120
Wait...

117
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,800
Go, son.

118
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,560
Mom!

119
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,720
Go. Go.

120
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,360
Hurry. Be good.

121
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,140
Don't tell the kids

122
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,360
about this.

123
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,770
I'm afraid they won't be able to handle it.

124
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,440
I'll go... go check on Ling.

125
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,750
No, no, don't go.

126
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,120
What will you say to her if you go?

127
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,200
Well...

128
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,780
Could this be a misdiagnosis?

129
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,390
The biopsy

130
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,630
is currently

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,870
the most accurate and direct method

132
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,840
for diagnosing colon cancer.

133
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,000
But what is Ling supposed to do?

134
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,320
How can she face it?

135
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,600
Mom, I'm back!

136
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,390
You're back so early.

137
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,760
Come on, son.

138
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,150
This fish is so fresh.

139
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,630
Someone caught it,

140
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,960
and I bought it halfway.

141
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,320
Try my cooking.

142
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,480
I haven't cooked in a long time.

143
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,340
I don't know if my cooking skills are still up to par.

144
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:31,720
Come on. Come on.

145
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,320
Let me pour you a drink. Here.

146
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,960
Did you make some mistakes?

147
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,150
What mistakes could I have made?

148
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,550
Bai Shuang is here again?

149
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,840
Son, your dad would never

150
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,440
make that kind of mistake.

151
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,670
There's nothing like that going on.

152
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,270
So you must have done something

153
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,670
to upset me then.

154
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,120
Mom,

155
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,850
you two are hiding something from me.

156
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,030
Are you two getting a divorce?

157
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,360
Then, who will I be with?

158
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,840
Silly boy.

159
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,150
Your dad and I will not be getting a divorce.

160
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,480
How could we divorce?

161
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,070
It's okay if she doesn't want to eat it.

162
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:16,910
Just leave it there.

163
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,270
You eat up.

164
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,750
I've noticed

165
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,750
that Director Xiao's dressing style has changed recently.

166
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,320
Have you seen her hair today?

167
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
Those little curls she has.

168
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,270
She's even starting to go for a softer look.

169
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,230
I-I-It's all just a facade.

170
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,750
This afternoon,

171
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,870
she scolded Li Si

172
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,600
and made him

173
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,960
mop the entire hallway.

174
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,870
But honestly, Li Si had it coming.

175
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,910
He kept bragging everywhere

176
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,960
that Fang was his aunt.

177
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,720
He deserved to be scolded.

178
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,670
Cheng Miaomiao!

179
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,030
Can you stop bullying Li Si?

180
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,550
Don't you know

181
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,120
how good Li Si has been to you

182
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,270
all these years?

183
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,910
He's such a good kid.

184
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,940
Can't you be a little nicer to him?

185
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,630
Wait, what did I say?

186
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,000
And you just

187
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,550
gave me a good scolding.

188
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,550
Your mom means...

189
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,840
Well...

190
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,240
Well, you're about to

191
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,630
start 12th grade, right?

192
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,750
After that, you'll have to take the college entrance exams.

193
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,680
Then you two will have to part ways.

194
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,720
You should

195
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,150
b-b-both

196
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,280
treat each other better while you can.

197
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,030
We won't be apart.

198
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,550
He'll go wherever I go.

199
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,150
We have a deal.

200
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,200
It's not like he's had this disease

201
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,840
for just a day or two.

202
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,440
But I didn't notice anything.

203
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,630
What kind of mother am I?

204
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,960
I've failed my son.

205
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,600
I'm a terrible father.

206
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,960
I deserve to die.

207
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,050
Stop saying things like that.

208
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,070
Mom, I'm going to school.

209
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,950
Why haven't you gone to work yet?

210
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,440
To take you to school.

211
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,720
Take me? Why?

212
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,360
Why what?

213
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,160
It's on my way.

214
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
I happen to have something to do near your school.

215
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,240
Son,

216
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,190
let us take you to school.

217
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,720
What?

218
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,360
I've long said that, given my temperament,

219
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,000
I deserve the lifestyle

220
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,790
of a young master traveling in a private car.

221
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,320
We can take Miaomiao with us

222
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
so that she can ride on my coattails.

223
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
Let's go.

224
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,240
Mom, what's for dinner tonight?

225
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,440
You're all here.

226
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,790
Go. Go.

227
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,480
You go to Xiaoshudu Restaurant for dinner.

228
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,010
We're discussing something important here.

229
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,870
Discussing a wedding, right?

230
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,360
Why didn't you include me?

231
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:07,870
Why isn't my grandma here?

232
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,960
Why are you so nosy?

233
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,080
Go already.

234
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,870
Yaya's already there.

235
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,760
Hurry up and go to eat,

236
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,020
then do your homework.

237
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,150
Well...

238
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,150
Why don't we take Li Si to see a traditional Chinese medicine doctor?

239
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,480
I heard that traditional Chinese medicine can cure cancer.

240
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
Hu,

241
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,550
stop crying.

242
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,050
No one's allowed to be sad anymore.

243
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,630
None of us...

244
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,550
should tell Li Si about it.

245
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,910
We have to make him

246
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,630
stay happy during this time.

247
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,320
We have to protect Li Si.

248
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,870
Honey, do you remember?

249
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,130
Don't you remember what the doctor said?

250
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,150
He said that a stable mood

251
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,480
is the key to fighting cancer cells.

252
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,870
We're like undercover agents now.

253
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,970
We can't let anything slip out.

254
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,410
This is a tough battle.

255
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,960
We have to win it,

256
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,080
okay?

257
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,840
Why is this happening to me?

258
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,510
What should we do?

259
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,870
If anyone messes this up,

260
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,120
I'll never speak to them again.

261
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,510
Ling,

262
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,120
are you sure

263
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,120
you want to sell the restaurant?

264
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,550
I'm not sure yet if it's enough.

265
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,870
I'll look for a buyer.

266
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,120
I'm sure we can get a good price.

267
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,670
Who did it?

268
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,550
Me!

269
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,200
Director Xiao, I'm sorry.

270
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,240
I'll be more careful next time.

271
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,200
Director.

272
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,160
What happened

273
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,640
to your uniform?

274
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,200
See? It's all wrinkled.

275
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,970
You're a sprightly young man.

276
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,300
Your hair is getting long too.

277
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,680
Go get it trimmed.

278
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,750
Got it?

279
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,510
Yes, Director.

280
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,830
Be careful

281
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,830
playing in the hallway. Don't fall.

282
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,640
Being in a relationship sure changes people.

283
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,500
She's become so much gentler now.

284
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,440
Come on, Xiaowa.

285
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,240
Let's continue to play.

286
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,110
I'll pick it up.

287
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,510
Hurry.

288
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,160
Let's play, Si.

289
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,160
Let me say it upfront.

290
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,240
It's not that I wanted to come here.

291
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,550
I wanted to come.

292
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,950
Weren't you not allowed me to come here?

293
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,920
I didn't want you to come by yourself,

294
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,250
but you can come here if you bring us along.

295
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,160
I've never played arcade games before.

296
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,200
Xiaowa, have you played those before?

297
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,000
No.

298
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,270
Then I'll...

299
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,350
give a simple demonstration today.

300
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,790
The King of Fighters.

301
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,240
The Arcade King.

302
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,070
Okay!

303
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,030
Hit him. hit him.

304
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,000
Si, go for it. Hit him!

305
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,730
Use your fists. Use your fists!

306
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,720
Beat him, Si!

307
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,240
Isn't it my turn for duty today?

308
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,160
Who did this?

309
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,920
I did.

310
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,340
Why did you clean it for me?

311
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,550
I got it wrong.

312
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,640
I thought it was my turn today.

313
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,690
Have you finished your homework?

314
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,680
Morning!

315
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,030
Si!

316
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,920
You're quite diligent.

317
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,960
Beef buns.

318
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
Aren't they good?

319
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,480
It's so cool!

320
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,280
Xiaowa, where did you get it?

321
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,320
I borrowed it from my neighbor.

322
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,720
We should have set sail long ago.

323
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,880
This is so much fun.

324
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,000
Later, you have to teach me how to sail.

325
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,680
Okay.

326
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,270
Why learn to sail?

327
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,540
It's always good to have more skills.

328
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,270
It would be great

329
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,800
if Yuan Shanqing were here.

330
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,030
When she comes back,

331
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,230
let's set sail again.

332
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,790
Okay.

333
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,160
Come on, let me take a photo of you, Si.

334
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,590
Three, two, one.

335
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,030
Good.

336
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,330
One more. Turn around.

337
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,550
A bit to the side. Yes, just like that.

338
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,350
Don't move.

339
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,750
Cool.

340
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,030
Look, the Windward.

341
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,750
Li Si,

342
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,110
didn't you say

343
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,570
you would go wherever I go?

344
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,640
Yes.

345
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,440
Then,

346
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,240
let's never be apart.

347
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,510
Of course!

348
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,570
This promise is valid for a lifetime.

349
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,190
What do you think is on the other side of the sea?

350
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,240
It's...

351
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,000
the outside world.

352
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,920
Then let's go see

353
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,520
the outside world together.

354
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,750
Okay.

355
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,720
The wind is too strong.

356
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,310
Son?

357
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,920
Can Mom come in?

358
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,880
Come in.

359
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,640
Are you doing your homework?

360
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,840
There is so much work.

361
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,240
What's wrong?

362
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,110
Nothing.

363
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,030
Son,

364
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,130
y-y-you take a leave from school next week, okay?

365
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,770
Let's go to Beijing.

366
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,750
Why go to Bejing?

367
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,770
Didn't you have a gastroenteroscopy before?

368
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,440
They found a small polyp.

369
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,270
I asked the doctor,

370
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,000
and he advised that it's best to have it removed

371
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,930
to prevent any potential issues in your intestines.

372
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,070
Do I need surgery for it?

373
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,070
Don't be nervous.

374
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,240
It's just a minor problem.

375
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,700
It's just a minor surgery.

376
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,920
Since it's a minor surgery,

377
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,960
just do it here.

378
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,350
Why go all the way to Beijing?

379
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,350
Well, I'm not

380
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,200
so sure

381
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,590
about the surgical standards here.

382
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,160
Doesn't your dad have connections

383
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,680
at a hospital in Beijing?

384
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,350
Besides,

385
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,240
haven't you always

386
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,750
wanted to visit Beijing and see the sights?

387
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,680
Mom,

388
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,240
the final exams are coming up.

389
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,160
At this crucial moment,

390
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,890
I'm working hard on my studies.

391
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,920
What Beijing?

392
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,830
Let's talk about it after the exams.

393
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,480
No, no,

394
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,790
listen to me, son.

395
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,070
Your dad finally has some time off.

396
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,640
Let him take us there.

397
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,680
I want to go too.

398
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,640
Right,

399
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,880
I've got some time off...

400
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,960
this time.

401
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,170
Let's not waste it.

402
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,950
What about your restaurant? Just leave it?

403
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,750
During this time,

404
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,750
I'm really a bit tired.

405
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,750
So, I plan to sell the restaurant.

406
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,400
Honey, you should have

407
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,460
sold your restaurant a long time ago.

408
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,440
Working from early morning to late at night every day.

409
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,480
You even have to serve customers

410
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
on New Year's Eve.

411
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,030
Then what will I eat in the future?

412
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,030
I'll cook for you.

413
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,270
Are my current cooking skills not good enough for you?

414
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,160
By the way, I...

415
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,640
I haven't reported a work update

416
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,000
to you.

417
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,350
I...

418
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,210
don't want to work in the drilling team anymore.

419
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,550
One, I'm getting older,

420
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,510
and two, I'm tired.

421
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,120
I... I want to work in an office instead.

422
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,480
Wait...

423
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,350
The changes in our family

424
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,070
are happening so quickly.

425
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,920
Why is no one discussing this with me?

426
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,400
What's there to discuss with you?

427
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,730
Just listen to your mom.

428
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,350
Why don't you go to bed early?

429
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,310
Go to sleep.

430
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,280
-Okay.
-Okay.

431
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,240
Sleep early, son.

432
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,350
We'll let you know when everything is arranged in Beijing.

433
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,000
Right.

434
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,480
Sleep tight, and sweet dreams.

435
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,720
Okay.

436
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
Four private rooms,

437
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,310
twelve tables,

438
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,960
and an upscale birthday room inside.

439
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,160
It's usually full every day.

440
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,310
The business is doing very well.

441
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,740
And the feng shui of this place...

442
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,680
Feng shui?

443
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,660
This place attracts wealth and prosperity.

444
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,880
But I heard...

445
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,920
Are you done?

446
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,720
Why are you being so mysterious?

447
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,600
It's done. It's done.

448
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,990
Why are you always rushing everything?

449
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,270
Give me your hand.

450
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,720
What is this?

451
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,030
Why are you practicing superstitions

452
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,440
like my mom?

453
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,720
It's not superstitious.

454
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,200
I braided them myself.

455
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
One for each of us.

456
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,240
What do you think? Little bells?

457
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,790
You can braid?

458
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,590
It's pretty.

459
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:06,590
I like this kind of

460
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,590
matching things,

461
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,790
radiating good luck.

462
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,600
Right?

463
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,500
What happened?

464
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,220
Our son is missing.

465
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,160
Our son is missing.

466
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,790
Dad.

467
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,480
Mom.

468
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,790
I don't know

469
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,450
how to say these things to you,

470
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,150
so I can only use this method.

471
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,480
From the moment

472
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,350
you all started being nice to me,

473
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,070
I knew

474
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
that something must have happened.

475
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,920
You didn't hide the test report well.

476
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,830
I've found it.

477
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,960
I know it's all too late.

478
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,070
I also know

479
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,350
that you all want me

480
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,010
to live my final days happily.

481
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,200
You've worked so hard,

482
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,000
and I certainly can't let you down.

483
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,750
Although I'm not capable of something big,

484
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,750
I've always been

485
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,360
the best at playing dumb.

486
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,790
Watching the game?

487
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,960
You must be tired today, right?

488
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,110
I'm fine.

489
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,590
What would you like for dinner?

490
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,510
I'll cook for you.

491
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,840
I’m fine with anything.

492
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,270
Morning!

493
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,550
Si.

494
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,480
Beef buns.

495
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,440
Aren't they good?

496
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,240
Who did it?

497
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,640
Me!

498
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,030
What happened

499
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:36,960
to your uniform?

500
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,510
It's all wrinkled.

501
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,040
Isn't it my turn for duty today?

502
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,240
I got it wrong.

503
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,160
I thought it was my turn today.

504
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,160
Mom!

505
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,720
You're back, son?

506
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,920
Come on. Come here.

507
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,640
I just went shopping with your dad

508
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,750
and saw this shirt.

509
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,310
I thought you would look so cool

510
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,550
wearing it.

511
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,510
Do you like it?

512
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,480
Yes. Yes.

513
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,350
Why did you buy so many?

514
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,680
Right, and this pair of sneakers

515
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,750
that you like.

516
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,480
Feiyue. Didn't you

517
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,160
always want them?

518
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,000
They happen to have your size.

519
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,240
Come on. Try them on.

520
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,100
Thank you, Mom!

521
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,240
You're welcome, son.

522
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,130
It's delicious.

523
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,840
I forgot about the game.

524
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
You're not as good as me in this show.

525
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,790
I think if I were to apply

526
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,680
to a film academy,

527
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,280
I'd definitely be accepted.

528
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,510
I could make everyone laugh

529
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,590
on the big screen.

530
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,070
I've always been

531
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,110
the carefree one.

532
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,720
Awesome! Awesome!

533
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,160
But maybe

534
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,540
I'm good at performing in front of the audience,

535
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,830
but facing you all,

536
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,510
I know I can't keep it up much longer.

537
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,510
Mom.

538
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,240
When I heard

539
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,750
that you were going to sell the Xiaoshudu Restaurant,

540
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,670
I knew

541
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,320
that I didn't have much longer to live.

542
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,110
I'm sorry.

543
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,070
I've always

544
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,550
made you worry since childhood.

545
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,920
I haven't accomplished much either.

546
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,760
And I've sold

547
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,690
a lot of valuable things from home.

548
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,480
So, I spread the news

549
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,670
that the feng shui of Xiaoshudu Restaurant is bad.

550
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,960
Slow down. Don't go.

551
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,070
Man, who told you that?

552
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,110
It's pure rumor.

553
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,230
If the feng shui here were bad,

554
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,320
could the business still be this good?

555
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,469
Would you sell it if the business is so good?

556
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,440
It's because the owner is

557
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,630
moving to another place.

558
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:34,960
No.

559
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,360
Sir,

560
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,510
if it's about the price,

561
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,320
we can discuss it.

562
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,920
No need to discuss it.

563
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,280
I...

564
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,710
Sir!

565
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,480
Anyway, I'm not that smart.

566
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,469
Mom,

567
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,030
my illness can't be cured.

568
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,000
Save the money

569
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,260
and live well with Dad.

570
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,230
You two have a long life ahead of you.

571
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,590
Dad,

572
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,880
over the years, you and I

573
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,880
have had a rather strained relationship.

574
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,350
I've hated you at times,

575
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,280
but I really do love you.

576
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,070
This is the first time I've seen you cry for me

577
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,670
because of my illness.

578
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,800
I secretly read

579
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,150
your work diary.

580
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,770
You even wrote about me.

581
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,280
Today, my son is 100 days old.

582
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,190
He's as chubby

583
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,590
as I was when I was little.

584
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,520
My son's birthday is coming.

585
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,750
He asked me to buy him a plane.

586
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,480
That little brat.

587
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,400
Today was my son's first time performing on the stage.

588
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,630
He wet his pants.

589
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,320
Useless kid.

590
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,030
My son is going to school.

591
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,960
His mom and I invited a Wenquxing for him.

592
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,800
I hope he can study hard.

593
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,210
My son's teacher

594
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,190
called me to the school again today.

595
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,320
I couldn't hold back

596
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,400
and beat him up when I came back.

597
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,190
I regretted it immediately.

598
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,280
Will he hate me

599
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,670
when he grows up?

600
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,800
My son wishes

601
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,690
to marry Miaomiao in the future on his birthday.

602
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,550
Good for him.

603
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,660
May his wish come true.

604
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,480
God,

605
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,280
can I exchange my life

606
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,030
for my son's?

607
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,600
I can't bear to leave you two.

608
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,510
I also can't bear to leave

609
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,840
my friends.

610
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:43,920
Hu.

611
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,880
You must visit Hong Kong once

612
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,150
and take a photo of

613
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,710
Central Crossroads for me.

614
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,110
Xiaowa,

615
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
do you remember?

616
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,480
The task I gave you

617
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,230
when I went to see you?

618
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,670
During the time I'm not here,

619
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,440
you must help me

620
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,550
take good care of them,

621
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,810
especially Miaomiao.

622
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,920
Discipline her.

623
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,480
I hope

624
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,670
that when I come back from Beijing,

625
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,880
she can appear in front of me

626
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,070
with a new look.

627
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,360
This is the task I'm giving you.

628
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,150
Yaya,

629
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,920
take good care of your sister for me.

630
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,000
Shanqing will be fine.

631
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,100
I'll bless her for you.

632
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,350
Miaomiao,

633
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,890
you're scared, aren't you?

634
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,410
You cried a lot, right?

635
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:37,440
You're finally afraid that I might leave you, right?

636
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,760
I've only ever had one wish

637
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,030
since childhood.

638
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,670
To marry you when I grow up.

639
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,360
I have to break my promise this time.

640
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,230
I can't accompany you

641
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,840
to the places you want to go.

642
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,110
I also can't marry you.

643
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,150
But remember,

644
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,920
in this lifetime,

645
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,180
you'll always have me.

646
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,030
When I'm alive, I can beat up

647
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,550
anyone who bullies you.

648
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,150
When I'm dead,

649
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,440
if anyone dares to bully you,

650
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,030
I'll haunt them as a ghost.

651
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,190
I'm taking this bell with me.

652
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,880
This is the first time I'm worshiping you.

653
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,190
If...

654
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,740
there really were gods in this world,

655
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,280
please

656
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,000
bless my parents.

657
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,440
Since God

658
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,880
has given me this fate,

659
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,710
it's no big deal.

660
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,670
It's just leaving a bit earlier.

661
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,480
My illness

662
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,480
can't be cured.

663
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,360
But I won't

664
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,630
accept this fate.

665
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,070
I want to decide

666
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,800
when I leave this world myself.

667
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,240
I don't want you to

668
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,150
see me tortured by illness,

669
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,550
and I don't want everyone

670
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,840
to cry for me.

671
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,880
That's not like me.

672
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,030
Dad, Mom, my friends,

673
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,510
uncles, aunties,

674
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,920
Baoshan, and Fang,

675
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,000
please remember me

676
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,880
as carefree and untroubled.

677
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,400
Don't be sad, everyone.

678
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,000
Let's just

679
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,880
say goodbye happily.

680
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,370
I love you all...

681
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,360
forever.

682
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,550
Go to my place to eat ribs.

683
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,030
My dad's already made them.

684
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,400
I don't want to eat!

685
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:58,840
Come on.

686
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,510
My mom's waiting for me to grill fish at home.

687
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,150
I'm off.

688
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,120
Cheng Miaomiao!

689
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,580
Next time, I'll come for ribs.

690
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,590
If...

691
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,280
time could be rewound,

692
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,280
I wish

693
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,010
none of this had ever happened.

694
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,550
If...

695
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,730
there really were gods in this world,

696
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:54,030
I'd hope that you'd bless Li Si

697
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,070
so that in another world,

698
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,880
he'd never get angry again.

699
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,320
If...

700
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:02,960
Couldn't we have just

701
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,030
stayed in the oilfield forever

702
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,590
and never been apart?

703
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,240
Yuan Shanqing's killing Yuan Yong

704
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,200
was ultimately ruled as self-defense.

705
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,110
The day she was released,

706
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,530
Yaya went early to wait for her.

707
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,240
In this bittersweet story,

708
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,830
no one treated our youth kindly.

709
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,920
We had

710
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,610
a farewell that was far from complete.

711
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:39,360
We all thought

712
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,760
that we'd become great people when we grew up.

713
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,290
But before we could grow up,

714
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,630
life's harshness

715
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,880
caught us off guard.

716
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,230
I remember

717
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,760
every event from that year.

718
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,670
Remember every face from my youth.

719
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,320
Li Si...

720
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,670
Li Si is gone.

721
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,670
And with him...

722
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:04,960
our youth ended.
