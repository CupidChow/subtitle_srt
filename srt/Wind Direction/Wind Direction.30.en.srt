1
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,400
Xiaowa.

2
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,920
You went to the sea.

3
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,120
What's the farthest place you've been?

4
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,280
There.

5
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,009
I can catch fishes over there.

6
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,479
That's not too far.

7
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,870
Can you dive to the bottom of the sea in one breath?

8
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,600
Who can

9
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,950
dive to the bottom of the sea in one breath?

10
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,120
I'm not a fish.

11
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,640
If you were a fish, that would be great.

12
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
You could swim anywhere you wanted.

13
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,340
Where do you want to go?

14
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,920
I want to find my brother.

15
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,060
Where do you want to go?

16
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,310
I don't know.

17
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,360
How about I go wherever you go?

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,870
Me too.

19
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,310
You want to go with Cheng Yaya?

20
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,190
Why should I go with Cheng Yaya?

21
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,310
We should go together.

22
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,310
Who said we should go together?

23
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,630
You can't even get into college.

24
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,430
Not getting into college

25
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,320
doesn't mean I can't go out.

26
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,710
The world out there is full of college graduates?

27
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,430
I don't believe it.

28
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,870
I must step out and see the world for myself.

29
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,560
I want to see

30
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,090
how big the world really is.

31
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,800
Will you come back?

32
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,310
Yes.

33
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,560
No matter how big the world outside is,

34
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,120
there will come a day

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,120
when we've seen it all and are tired.

36
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,670
Our home is here.

37
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,150
We'll never be separated!

38
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,230
I actually did get into college.

39
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,710
It's a women's vocational school.

40
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,470
It's cool.

41
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,630
After graduating, I went to Yinchuan

42
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,590
and watched a rock concert.

43
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,830
I took a crowded minibus,

44
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
and went to Tibet.

45
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,320
I worked for a women's magazine

46
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,570
as a journalist for six years.

47
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,310
I interviewed many people

48
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,800
and went to many places.

49
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,630
When I was thirty,

50
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
I went to Beijing.

51
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,120
My life in Beijing

52
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,950
was hard,

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,190
but I really saw the world outside.

54
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,430
I kept wondering

55
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:32,870
what kind of life

56
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,310
I wanted to live,

57
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,440
and what kind of person I would become.

58
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,120
On my 35th birthday,

59
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,920
I quit

60
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,270
a nine-to-five job

61
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,630
and officially became

62
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,360
a storyteller.

63
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,630
I used all my savings

64
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,240
to buy a second-hand RV.

65
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,390
I want to drive

66
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,159
to see

67
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,000
all the places by the sea.

68
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,070
Miss, could you give me a ride?

69
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,750
Not far.

70
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,510
Just drop me off

71
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,510
at the entrance of Dahua Town.

72
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,159
OK?

73
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,159
Thank you.

74
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,270
Miss, your car is really fancy.

75
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,320
It must be expensive.

76
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,600
Not really.

77
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,370
It's second-hand.

78
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,070
It's great.

79
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,070
Auntie,

80
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,870
what are you doing in such a remote place?

81
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,480
I wanted to walk there by myself.

82
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,830
But it's too far,

83
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,120
and I got tired.

84
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,240
I waved down

85
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,560
several cars before,

86
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,950
but none of them stopped.

87
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,600
Miss, you're so kind.

88
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,950
Thank you.

89
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,070
Are you going home?

90
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,510
No.

91
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,120
I'm going to catch my cheating husband.

92
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,070
Now I'm going to show you

93
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,120
the 21st work

94
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,510

95
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,750

Two hundred thousand.

99

Let the bidding begin.

00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,120
Three hundred thousand.

101
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,800
Three hundred thousand.

102
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,560
OK.

104
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,190
Four hundred thousand.

105
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,310
OK.

106
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,480
Online bid is now at five hundred thousand.

107
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,080
The online bid reached five hundred thousand.

108
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,360
We got six hundred thousand here in the venue.

109
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,750
Okay, sorry, sir.

110
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,750
Sir, is that

111
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,010
six hundred thousand?

112
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,160
OK. Six hundred thousand it is.

113
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,270
Six hundred...

114
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,430
Are you alright? What's the matter?

115
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,430
Are you alright?

116
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,510
Help!

117
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,720
What?

118
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,920
Do you know Mr. Ding?

119
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,920
Mr. Ding?

120
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,920
The one...

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,120
The one with glasses?

122
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,600
Yes.

123
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,240
It's him.

124
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,120
What's wrong with him?

125
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,800
He...

126
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,120
He's getting married, did you know?

127
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,520
-Getting married? -Yes.

128
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,070
Then he said...

129
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,390
Proposing in the bathroom?

130
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,050
What kind of proposal is that?

131
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,560
Hello.

132
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,820
Do you need something?

133
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,780
Is he talking to us?

134
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,600
Dad, Mom. Why are you here?

135
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,680
-We're just passing by. -We're buying groceries.

136
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,920
-We're buying groceries. -We're just passing by.

137
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,780
We are on our way to buy groceries.

138
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,970
You come here to buy groceries?

139
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
This is...

140
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,040
This is my classmate, Liang Yicheng.

141
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,510
Liang.

142
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,870
Hello, Uncle. Auntie.

143
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,950
Hello.

144
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,120
Liang Yicheng?

145
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,390
Yes.

146
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,870
That's a nice name.

147
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,930
Thank you. Auntie.

148
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,310
The bus is here...

149
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,750
I'm leaving.

150
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,080
I'll call you later.

151
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,750
Bye. Take care.

152
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,270
Stop waving to him.

153
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,960
I've just said a couple of words.

154
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,150
Why did you ask him to leave?

155
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,870
Right, we should

156
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,720
chat with him.

157
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,870
Is he your boyfriend?

158
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,750
No.

159
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,270
He is just a good friend.

160
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,600
We're in the same class.

161
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
He's handsome.

162
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,790
Where is he from?

163
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,120
Let's go home.

164
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,240
I'm hungry.

165
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:54,870
So

166
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,200
is he a local?

167
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,120
Yes.

168
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,360
I don't want you

169
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,440
to marry someone from another place.

170
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,080
If you're too far away,

171
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,030
I can't stand it.

172
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,440
If this boy bullies you,

173
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,480
I have to make sure

174
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,550
I can slap

175
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,960
him in the face

176
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,360
in five minutes.

177
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,270
Your mother is partial toward you.

178
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,200
She can't

179
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,750
treat your brother and sister equally.

180
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,510
Of course.

181
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,440
I'm happy just with my little girl.

182
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,600
Little girl,

183
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,200
is this for your mother?

184
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,000
It's for my grandma.

185
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,870
I don't have a mom.

186
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,240
How old are you?

187
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,960
I'm five.

188
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,690
Then I'll give you this flower.

189
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,480
OK?

190
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Really?

191
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,320
Thank you, Auntie.

192
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,320
Qing.

193
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,390
We're having dinner tonight.

194
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,850
Bring your husband along.

195
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,510
He went to the scene.

196
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,110
I'm not sure

197
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,170
when he'll be done.

198
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,550
Hello?

199
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,720
I've been in charge of this auction from the start.

200
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,120
These are the products I sourced,

201
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,440
and these are my clients.

202
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,320
I've already apologized

203
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
to each one of them

204
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,120
and offered compensation.

205
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,360
Why did the company directly replace me

206
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,550
with Vivi?

207
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,080
This is your problem.

208
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,370
No negotiation.

209
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,000
Hello?

210
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,480
Nurse, could you please take this out for me?

211
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,200
I have something important to deal with.

212
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,510
Miss Hu, you are very weak now.

213
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,000
The doctor hasn't agreed...

214
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,550
I want to go back.

215
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,910
I have something important to deal with.

216
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,370
-Min. -Help me take it out.

217
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,590
What's wrong?

218
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,150
Are you sick?

219
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,150
What are you doing here?

220
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,440
I heard you fainted.

221
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,080
I'm fine. Go back now.

222
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,550
Please help me take it out.

223
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,120
I really have something important to do.

224
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,270
Miss Hu, you need to rest.

225
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:32,790
I really have

226
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,790
something important to handle.

227
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,650
Nurse. Miss Hu.

228
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,550
Please take care of yourself.

229
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,720
What's wrong with my body?

230
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,870
You're pregnant.

231
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,770
What did you say?

232
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
You're pregnant.

233
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,790
You're pregnant?

234
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,840
I have

235
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,480
a record of each of

236
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,080
your disciplinary actions.

237
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,670
In this class,

238
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,670
all of you have made some mistakes,

239
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,000
more or less.

240
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,840
Today, I'm giving you two choices.

241
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,790
You can either keep making mistakes

242
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,450
and I'll keep recording them.

243
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,440
Or

244
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,760
leave your mistakes in the past

245
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,930
and start studying hard

246
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,260
from today onward.

247
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,930
My name is Qiang Xiaowa.

248
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,440
From now on,

249
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,030
I'm your homeroom teacher.

250
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,640
Class begins!

251
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,510
Stand up.

252
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,390
Good morning, teacher.

253
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,970
When a man has second thoughts,

254
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,240
you can sense it right away

255
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,670
when you lie next to him.

256
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,200
Miss,

257
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,410
are you married?

258
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,440
No.

259
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,630
So,

260
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,910
I can't let him win this time.

261
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,080
Miss.

262
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,410
Didn't you just tell me

263
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,910
you are a writer?

264
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,150
Do me a favor.

265
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,360
Can you write down everything

266
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,470
about them?

267
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:33,750
Put the photos

268
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,150
of him, his biased mother

269
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,120
and that mistress

270
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,840
in the newspaper.

271
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,030
Just expose them.

272
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,080
Let's see who's shameless.

273
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,790
Auntie, calm down.

274
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,200
Newspapers don't just expose people

275
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,440
whenever they want.

276
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,750
Aren't newspapers supposed to

277
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,270
stand up for victims?

278
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,120
Miss,

279
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,870
tell me.

280
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,630
How long could they get sentenced

281
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,890
for what they've done?

282
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,630
You ask me?

283
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,790
I think...

284
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,320
What I say doesn't count.

285
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,270
It turns out that educated people like you

286
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,080
can't take care of this.

287
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,960
Fine.

288
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,480
I'll do it my way.

289
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,600
Auntie.

290
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,510
What?

291
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,000
Let me help you.

292
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,510
What is it?

293
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,500
I'll find you a lawyer.

294
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,680
Trust me.

295
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,450
Why is she reaching out to you?

296
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,720
She wants to see Zi.

297
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,670
Did you agree?

298
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,670
Of course not.

299
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,960
That's good.

300
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,480
Don't see her again.

301
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,200
I'll get you

302
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,800
a new phone number tomorrow.

303
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,320
We'll

304
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,200
end it.

305
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,870
How?

306
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,270
Yaya, have you thought about

307
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:18,910
what will happen

308
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,770
if one day Zi finds out about this?

309
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,200
Lin Xiu has already shown up.

310
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,150
Do you

311
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,710
want her to

312
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,510
hear it

313
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,360
from Lin Xiu?

314
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,240
So are you planning to

315
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,300
tell her yourself?

316
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,240
She was young back then.

317
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,120
In her memory,

318
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,360
it's just Mom, Dad,

319
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,320
you, me, and her sister.

320
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,270
We've worked so hard

321
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,360
to keep this hidden all these years

322
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:48,870
just to

323
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,640
give her

324
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,170
a complete family and life.

325
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,470
Wasn't that your choice too?

326
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,670
But now Lin Xiu

327
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,030
is in Qingdao.

328
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,840
She knows where Zi is!

329
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,550
All right!

330
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,880
I'll take leave tomorrow

331
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,619
and go back to handle it, okay?

332
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,200
What's wrong?

333
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,160
Sis, what are you doing?

334
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,240
Why didn't you pick up?

335
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,160
Me?

336
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,310
I just stopped an auntie

337
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,830
from catching her cheating husband

338
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,490
and got a basket of free-range eggs in exchange.

339
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,270
What auntie?

340
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,160
Did you meet a bad person?

341
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,160
No.

342
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
Nothing.

343
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,790
What happened?

344
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,750
My brother is coming back.

345
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,680
Dad asked me to ask you

346
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,800
where you are.

347
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,110
When are you coming back?

348
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,350
I'm in Qinghai.

349
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,950
I'll go back after this trip.

350
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,420
Sister,

351
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,440
did you see

352
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,480
the photo I just sent you?

353
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,070
Yes.

354
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,840
This is the boy

355
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,110
you mentioned before?

356
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,550
Okay, tell me what happened.

357
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,160
Uncle Hai, Auntie Ling.

358
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,830
Miaomiao.

359
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,720
Why doesn't it move?

360
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:56,960
The network is slow.

361
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,750
The signal is bad, Miaomiao.

362
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,920
The signal is good.

363
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,880
I can hear you.

364
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,680
How was it in Australia?

365
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,750
Good.

366
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,750
Good.

367
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,000
Why is it so dark

368
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,750
over there?

369
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,030
Where are you?

370
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,270
I'm in Qinghai.

371
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,240
Let me show you.

372
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,440
Look.

373
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,000
Your big RV.

374
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,960
It's great.

375
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,480
You have to be careful

376
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,030
being out there on your own.

377
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,960
Okay. Don't worry.

378
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,110
I promise I'll visit you

379
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,160
at the end of this year.

380
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,400
Okay.

381
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,440
We

382
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,960
are waiting for you here.

383
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,440
Every year,

384
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,160
Miaomiao makes video calls to us

385
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,000
today.

386
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,610
Don't say that, she will be sad.

387
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,640
OK.

388
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,750
Miaomiao must come this year.

389
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,240
It's a promise.

390
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,880
Take care of yourselves.

391
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,440
That's it.

392
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,480
Bye.

393
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:20,920
Okay.

394
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,160
Bye.

395
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,030
Li Si.

396
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,390
This is the night sky of Qinghai.

397
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,070
Today, you turn 37.

398
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,640
Happy birthday.

399
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,490
Put it here.

400
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,830
Thank you!

401
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,250
You're Zi's mother, right?

402
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,560
You...

403
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,070
Zi!

404
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,060
-Zi.
-Brother.

405
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,330
Sister-in-law!

406
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,300
Let me help you carry the lighter one.

407
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,750
Dad, Mom, I'm back.

408
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,200
You have a guest.

409
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,790
He has grown taller.

410
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,590
Shanqing.

411
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:42,960
Shanqing.

412
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,760
Long time no see.

413
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,440
You've grown up.

414
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,400
This is mom's former colleague,

415
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,750
Aunt Lin.

416
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,960
I'm here to see my old friend.

417
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,550
I've met her already,

418
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,960
so I am going.

419
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:39,920
Zi!

420
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,480
Bye.

421
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,280
Goodbye, Aunt Lin.

422
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,640
Come often.

423
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:52,640
Bye.

424
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,990
Excuse me.

425
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,350
Take care.

426
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,200
Dad.

427
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,550
Is she...?

428
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,960
It wasn't until Yuan Yong died,

429
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,200
my heart also

430
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,350
skipped a beat.

431
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,160
Really?

432
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,720
I stabbed Yuan Yong with a knife too.

433
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,160
He tricked me to the message shop.

434
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,600
I ran away several times.

435
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,480
I was caught and beaten every time.

436
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,370
So I stopped running away.

437
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,270
I lied to him that I made money.

438
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,600
I wanted him to come back

439
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,720
and die with him.

440
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,030
But I

441
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,070
still missed.

442
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,200
He took the money.

443
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,160
I was also caught.

444
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,440
He ruined

445
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,920
my life.

446
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,400
I was pregnant with Zi.

447
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,270
I really wanted to get married,

448
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:26,880
and spend my whole life with him

449
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,280
steadily and sincerely.

450
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,000
Really.

451
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,720
I know.

452
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,640
As you said,

453
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,350
no matter what,

454
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,200
you can't neglect

455
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,660
your own children, right?

456
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,160
After something happened to Shanqing,

457
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,290
we decided to keep Zi

458
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,400
with us and take care of her.

459
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,840
Our whole family

460
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,310
doesn't want the child to know about these things,

461
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,000
so

462
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,640
we left the Oilfield.

463
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,350
We just want our child

464
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,000
to grow up in a healthy

465
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,310
and complete family.

466
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,720
These things...

467
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,160
has greatly affected

468
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,350
Shanqing.

469
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,000
She was traumatized.

470
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,160
She couldn't see blood

471
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,790
for a long time.

472
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,400
She

473
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,600
also couldn't sleep.

474
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,590
Besides, she has never been to college.

475
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,230
She can't find a good job.

476
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,160
She's quite wronged.

477
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,720
What have she done?

478
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,960
Shanqing had an unfortunate fate because of us.

479
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,070
Now because of you,

480
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,590
she has a new life.

481
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,000
So don't blame Shanqing for

482
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,310
not wanting to see you

483
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:42,160
or let you see Zi, right?

484
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,050
All these years and events

485
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,960
can't be smoothed over

486
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,690
with just a simple 'i'm sorry.'

487
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,000
I know.

488
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,800
After all, you're Zi's biological mother.

489
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,200
You've paid a price over the years.

490
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,160
In this fate,

491
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,200
you all have suffered.

492
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,920
Mom.

493
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,830
Didn't you say you'd wait for me at the supermarket?

494
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,160
Why are you here?

495
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,110
I met my former colleague

496
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,110
in front of the supermarket.

497
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,920
Aunt Lin.

498
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,200
Say hello to Aunt Lin.

499
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,240
Hello, Aunt Lin.

500
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,480
Hello, Zi.

501
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,010
I bought you some ground meat,

502
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,750
let's have fried stuffed eggplant for lunch.

503
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,590
Okay.

504
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
That's too heavy.

505
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,450
Let me carry it.

506
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,270
Let's go.

507
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,120
Say goodbye to the aunt.

508
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,310
Goodbye, Aunt Lin.

509
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,590
Lin Xiu said

510
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,880
she won't

511
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,000
come again.

512
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,960
Meeting today

513
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,200
and saying a few words

514
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,640
is enough for her to have some closure.

515
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,830
From now on,

516
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,640
the past is

517
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,590
the past.

518
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,030
Don't worry.

519
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,680
What happened in the past,

520
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,680
we will continue to keep it a secret

521
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,680
from Zi.

522
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,070
Dad.

523
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,400
Your mother and I

524
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,110
are happy

525
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,640
because of Zi.

526
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,680
We'll make sure Zi

527
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,350
continues to be happy.

528
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,550
Don't worry.

529
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,550
You two go home.

530
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,150
I'm going grocery shopping.

531
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,600
Let's go.

532
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,550
Let's go home.

533
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,400
The heartbeat is very lively;

534
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,640
the baby is so healthy.

535
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,100
Congratulations, Miss Hu

536
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,500
Doctor, thank you.

537
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,170
It's time to eat.

538
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,350
Here.

539
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,680
Have you washed your hands?

540
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,960
Yes.

541
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,960
I haven't eaten dad's cooking for a long time.

542
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,590
I'll cook for you often.

543
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,350
Mom,

544
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,000
I'll drink with you.

545
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,350
Here.

546
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,510
Dad, join us.

547
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:31,960
You guys drink.

548
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,070
Goodness, this kid...

549
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,400
Okay. Come on.

550
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,030
Good luck at work.

551
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,230
Wish you good health.

552
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,960
Not bad, Hu.

553
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,960
Do big things in silence.

554
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,980
Sister-in-law, thank you. Be careful of the fishbone.

555
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,350
I miss you.

556
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,380
I am going back to Linqi first.

557
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,160
Dad.

558
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:40,750
Min.

559
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,270
You...

560
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,160
Why are you back so early?

561
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,920
Aren't you taking the night flight?

562
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,110
I missed you,

563
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,920
and came back early.

564
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,640
Where's mom?

565
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,040
You...

566
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,650
Your mom is dancing over there.

567
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,160
Mom.

568
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,920
Mom.

569
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,310
Here.

570
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,550
Mom.

571
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,160
Min?

572
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,750
Why are you back?

573
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,750
Aren't you taking the night flight?

574
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,159
You daughter is back.

575
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,360
She missed us.

576
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,000
We miss you too.

577
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,230
Why are you alone? Where is Xiao?

578
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,630
Yeah. Where is Ming Xiao?

579
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:20,830
He's filming.

580
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,630
He asked me to pick you up.

581
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,360
Hong Kong?

582
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,760
Yes.

583
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,960
You two are not going to my wedding?

584
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,840
Go, go, go.

585
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,150
Of course we are going.

586
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,030
We must go.

587
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,400
W-W-What about...

588
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,800
What about your brother? What about him?

589
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
My brother and his family

590
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,030
came from Singapore.

591
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,440
He also said that we should

592
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,000
all go over during the honeymoon.

593
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,150
Okay.

594
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,440
Let's go together.

595
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,920
You must be hungry.

596
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,630
Here, I'll make you something delicious.

597
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,150
I have some...

598
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,920
I have sacima here.

599
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,230
You two, you have one gasping here.

600
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,150
You...

601
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,400
Isn't this electric?

602
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,150
Just keep up.

603
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,550
The battery is dead.

604
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,000
Hurry up.

605
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,360
Dat, let me push you.

606
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,760
This is for you, sacima.

607
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,190
Qi.

608
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,760
We'll go back first

609
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,960
The girl is back.

610
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:15,920
Okay. Okay. Okay.

611
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,960
Take your time.

612
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,510
Bye.

613
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,320
Pay attention to the rhythm.

614
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,630
Take your time.

615
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,320
My daughter is back.

616
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,670
You have no idea

617
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,360
how annoying your dad is now.

618
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,000
What's wrong?

619
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Guess what?

620
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,320
Every time I go out to dance,

621
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,550
he has to follow me.

622
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,760
Don't you think it's annoying?

623
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,550
Min.

624
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,550
Let me tell you.

625
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,630
That man, Qi, next to your mom...

626
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,630
The total is 108.

627
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,440
How are you going to pay?

628
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,190
WeChat Pay.

629
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,230
Scan here.

630
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,590
Okay.

631
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,000
All right.

632
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,360
It it's good, come back next time.

633
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,070
Okay.

634
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,800
Hello.

635
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,710
Oh my!

636
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,760
You’re back.

637
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,360
Jia Baoshan, she is back.

638
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,960
She is back.

639
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,800
Miaomiao.

640
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,800
Kids,

641
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,130
how long has it been since last time we met?

642
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,110
I've bought Xiaoshudu Restaurant.

643
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,360
I haven't changed a bit

644
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,620
because I'm waiting for you to come back.

645
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,760
Good.

646
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,760
Li Si.

647
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,760
Li Si.

648
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,110
We're back.

649
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,070
We’re back.

650
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,230
Miaomiao, don’t cry. It's okay.

651
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,800
Miaomiao, don’t cry.

652
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,840
It’s okay.

653
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,190
Don't cry.

654
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,760
Don't cry. It's okay.

655
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,920
Don't cry. It's okay.

656
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,440
What happened?

657
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,760
Who bullied you?

658
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,360
Them.

659
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,880
They even took my candy.

660
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,480
Go.

661
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,280
Liu Xinghan.

662
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,800
What?

663
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,760
Let me tell you.

664
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,000
This is my wife.

665
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,960
If you dare to bully her,

666
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,280
I’ll beat you up!

667
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,000
Hey, Li Si.

668
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,400
20 years after we parted,

669
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,810
I finally reached adulthood.

670
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,280
At 37,

671
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,990
I can't be young yet not old.

672
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,800
You know what?

673
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,760
Time flies.

674
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,000
Those clear faces

675
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,550
and vibrant youth

676
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,550
flow like water through the years.

677
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,440
The number of people in my contacts

678
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,480
is dwindling.

679
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,840
The WeChat groups are filled with 'Do Not Disturb.'

680
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,480
Many have witnessed funerals

681
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,680
before even attending weddings.

682
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,340
Many things have been forgotten.

683
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,640
There are many people

684
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,520
I'll never see again.

685
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,550
Those regrets of youth

686
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,490
will eventually become the past.

687
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,220
We are starting to age gradually.

688
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,920
But the spring's glow

689
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,890
continues to shine bright.

690
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,240
And the youthful spirit in my heart has never left.

691
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,450
May we remain young.

692
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,440
May we be brave.

693
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,190
May we

694
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,970
be sincere to love forever.

695
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,590
May we always miss each other.

696
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,490
In honor of my hometown

697
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,670
and youth,

698
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,970
with the wind at my back.

699
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,670
What are you writing?

700
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,590
I'm writing a story.

701
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,190
Can you tell me

702
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,760
the story?

703
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,800
Sure.

704
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,760
Once upon a time,

705
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,350
there was a mountain.

706
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,800
In the mountain, there was a temple.

707
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,690
In the temple, there was a jar.

708
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,040
In the jar, there was a basin.

709
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,020
In the basin, there was a bowl.

710
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,310
In the bowl, there was a bean.

711
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,480
And then?

712
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,630
And then?

713
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,000
Then...

714
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,280
I ate it.

715
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,400
You are tempted.

716
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,320
I've finished my story.
