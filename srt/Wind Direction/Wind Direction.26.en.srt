[Episode 26]

3
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,630
I was born in a fishing village.

4
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,390
My home was a boat

5
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,009
anchored at the shore.

6
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,030
For 17 years, every step of my life

7
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,590
was like weeds bending to the wind,

8
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,310
wild dogs roaming the wilderness.

9
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,910
I don't know

10
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,229
how many days after I was born

11
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,320
I was abandoned.

12
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,789
Grandpa found me

13
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:58,870
on an old boat by the sea.

14
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,070
He said I was wrapped in a quilt

15
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,630
with embroidered flowers.

16
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,710
He believed my mother must have been afraid I'd freeze.

17
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,440
She wasn't a heartless person.

18
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,470
Grandpa, my older brother, and I

19
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,910
struggled to survive,

20
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,990
never daring to hope for more from life.

21
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,990
Grandpa, I'm off to school.

22
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,870
Grandpa was illiterate,

23
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,270
but he firmly believed that

24
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,130
education could change our fate.

25
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,300
He worked more than ten hours a day,

26
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,710
and every penny he earned

27
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:22,360
went towards schooling for my brother and me.

28
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,829
But even so,

29
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,990
his money

30
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,950
couldn't cover the cost

31
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,610
of sending two kids to school.

32
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,520
My brother gave up his chance

33
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,650
at education for me.

34
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,990
He carried a quilt on his back

35
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,270
and headed south.

36
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,560
He said,

37
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,630
"One of us has to go to school."

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,920
Then one day,

39
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,150
a group of people unlike us

40
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,160
moved into the western side of the bridge.

41
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,820
They were children of oilfield workers.

42
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,730
Their side was always brightly lit,

43
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,930
filled with laughter and joy.

44
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,710
A single bridge

45
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,110
separated two fates.

46
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,020
I often sat on the bridge,

47
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,360
looking toward the other side of the bridge.

48
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,510
I studied harder, hoping to escape

49
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,570
the misery of this side of the bridge.

50
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,950
But poverty still strangled

51
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,350
this one and only chance.

52
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,350
They could choose

53
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,470
a better life,

54
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,990
but generation after generation,

55
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,430
they followed the oil pumps,

56
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,760
dedicating their youth and entire lives.

57
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,920
I got the chance to go to school,

58
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,310
and I found a group of wonderful friends.

59
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,310

She needs a tetanus shot.

203
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,980
A shot in the butt, right?

204
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,890
Alright, go ahead and give it.

Take it easy, slowly now.

00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,809
Why on a rainy day like this,

211
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,090
instead of staying safe in your dorm,

212
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,179
did you run out?

213
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,940
The school was flooded.

I'm telling you,

219
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,010
it's lucky it was just a nail in there.

220
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:47,660
If it had been a knife,

You know, I used to really dislike him.

He was always arguing with my mom,

268

How did Hu Yue find out?

384
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,340
No one told her.

385
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,760
She found it out herself.

386
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,740
With something this big,

387
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,430
no one can keep it a secret.

388
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,640
What about Yang Tao?

389
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,190
Does Yang Tao know?

390
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,800
Min said that

391
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,150
he's got exams coming up,

392
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,550
so we thought

393
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,640
we'd talk it over with you.

394
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,940
Don't tell him.

395
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,990
Don't affect his exams.

396
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,660
Also, don't tell my mom

397
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,790
or brother either.

398
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,710
I'll be fine lying here

399
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,450
in the hospital by myself.

400
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,930
I don't need anyone to take care of me.

401
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,270
How can you say that?

402
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,270
In your condition, you definitely

403
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,000
need someone to look after you.

404
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,250
Pengfei, could you help me

405
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,070
ask something?

406
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,260
How long do I have to stay in bed?

407
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,870
Also,

408
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,650
why can't I feel my legs now?

409
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,310
You fell from

410
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,140
such a height;

411
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,230
it's going to take time.

412
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,160
You'll recover slowly, bit by bit.

413
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,010
Exactly, there's no need to rush.

414
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,380
Now that Yang has woken up,

415
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,510
you really need to think this through.

416
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:49,780
Yue.

417
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,520
This isn't something you'll

418
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,860
just deal with for a few days.

419
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,420
The doctor

420
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,030
already explained his condition.

421
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,990
You're not thinking of

422
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,990
taking care of him forever, are you?

423
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,980
What else can I do?

424
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,890
For now,

425
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,950
we'll just go on like this.

426
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,890
The company will send someone to take care of him.

427
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,860
The factory won't leave him unattended.

428
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,900
Yeah, the company will definitely help.

429
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,760
But the people the company sends,

430
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,730
they'll just handle

431
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,190
his meals and basic needs.

432
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,460
I know Yang's temper

433
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,500
too well.

434
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,580
If he realizes

435
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,060
he'll never stand again,

436
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,180
I can't even imagine what will happen.

437
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,130
We'll see.

438
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,160
For now, I'll stay with him

439
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,200
for a while.

440
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,320
What else can I do?

441
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,700
What are you doing?

442
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,220
That's gotta hurt!

443
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,390
It doesn't hurt.

444
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,750
It's been over a month,

445
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,500
and I still can't feel anything.

446
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,340
Why?

447
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,070
-What happened?
-It doesn't hurt.

448
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,400
-It's been over a month.
-It doesn't hurt.

449
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,730
I don't feel anything.

450
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,520
-What do you mean?
-Hu Yue.

451
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,940
You need to give it time.

452
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,200
Take it slow, and it'll heal eventually.

453
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,840
What are you doing?

454
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,770
Tell me the truth.

455
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,790
What's wrong with my leg?

456
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,310
Is it going to stay like this?

457
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,830
I'm asking you!

458
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,850
Yang,

459
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,490
the factory leaders are here to see you.

460
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,420
Alright.

461
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:20,980
Yang.

462
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,180
-Don't move.
-Mr. Liu.

463
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,100
Yang.

464
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,340
-You are?
-Lie down. Lie down.

465
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:26,700
Okay.

466
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,050
You must be Yang's wife?

467
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,110
Yes, I am.

468
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,800
You've been through a lot.

469
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,460
You can rest assured

470
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,300
about Yang's treatment, care,

471
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,510
and rehabilitation.

472
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,480
We will take full responsibility.

473
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,700
No. 3 Factory

474
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,050
will always be your firm support.

475
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,100
Thank you.

476
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,500
How are you feeling lately?

477
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,480
I'm doing alright now.

478
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:53,870
Good to hear.

479
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,760
Our leadership team

480
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,340
heard about your heroic actions,

481
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,070
and everyone was deeply moved.

482
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,940
The entire staff at No. 3 Factory

483
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,230
is concerned about your health.

484
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,970
We're all hoping for your speedy recovery.

485
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,910
Thank you, thank you for your concern.

486
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:08,790
Yang,

487
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,620
if you hadn't manually

488
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,020
reduced the pressure in time,

489
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,280
the consequences would have been unimaginable.

490
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,390
In recognition of your bravery,

491
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,950
we, on behalf of Linqi Oilfield Headquarters,

492
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,840
would like to present you with a medal and a bonus.

493
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,770
Here you go.

494
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,100
While it can't replace

495
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,980
the pain you're enduring,

496
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,430
this is Linqi Oilfield

497
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,320
and Factory No. 3 Factory's way

498
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,640
of honoring a hero.

499
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,920
The oilfield will never forget a hero.

500
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,220
Oh,

501
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,900
and let me announce some news.

502
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,410
Once your health recovers,

503
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,480
your promotion to deputy manager will immediately take effect.

504
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,720
By the way, Liu,

505
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,600
from today onward,

506
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,190
report Yang's treatment and recovery progress

507
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,190
to me regularly.

508
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:00,840
Yes, sir.

509
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,920
If you encounter any difficulties, reach out to us anytime.

510
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,650
Yes, sir.

511
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,320
Okay.

512
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,410
Let's take a group photo

513
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,450
together.

514
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,660
Okay.

515
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,430
Here.

516
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:09,900
Okay.

517
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,940
Come closer together.

518
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,310
Yes. One, two, three.

519
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,260
Xiaowa,

520
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,590
the boat is really sturdy.

521
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,660
It survived this heavy rain without a problem.

522
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,010
It's over 40 years old.

523
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,610
If it wasn't sturdy, it would've sunk long ago.

524
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,640
Can you row a boat?

525
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:30,750
Yeah.

526
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,080
Then can you get a small boat?

527
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,110
Let's go out to sea for fun now.

528
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,110
Fun? What fun?

529
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,870
Hu's mom went to the hospital

530
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,400
to take care of Yang Songbai.

531
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,800
Hu is coming to my house for dinner tonight.

532
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,700
I gotta go.

533
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,000
Did they remarry?

534
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,440
No.

535
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,320
But they still care about each other.

536
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,580
Care about each other?

537
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,780
What kind of care?

538
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,060
If I were bedridden,

539
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,090
unable to move,

540
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,080
I wouldn't burden my whole family.

541
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,790
What, you wouldn't want to live anymore?

542
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,820
If something

543
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,580
really happened to me,

544
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,660
I'd just take myself out to sea

545
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,340
and feed the fish.

546
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,410
Wherever I drift, that's where I'll stay.

547
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,420
Fine, go drift

548
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,130
wherever you want.

549
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,630
I'm going home to eat ribs.

550
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,700
Goodbye, Li Si.

551
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,600
Ribs?

552
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,900
How much

553
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,810
did you make?

554
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,370
Don't listen, move aside, everyone.

555
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,930
Go back.

556
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,140
Hu Yue, did you

557
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,010
already know?

558
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,910
Know what?

559
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,690
That my legs—

560
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,530
I'll never be able to stand again.

561
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,500
For the rest of my life,

562
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,830
I'll be in a wheelchair.

563
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,450
So what if you're in a wheelchair?

564
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,400
There are plenty of people in wheelchairs.

565
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,180
Does that mean they stop living?

566
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,860
Don't they still have to go on with their lives?

567
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,380
There's no need to panic.

568
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,440
I'm here, aren't I?

569
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,700
You?

570
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,750
Who are you,

571
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,230
Hu Yue?

572
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,540
Did you forget?

573
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,610
We're divorced.

574
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
I didn't forget.

575
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,400
Then who are you to me?

576
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,630
I don't need you.

577
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,370
Why are you yelling?

578
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,330
You need someone to take care of you right now.

579
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,630
I'm just here to help temporarily.

580
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,560
I don't need you.

581
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,270
I don't need your pity.

582
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,950
Who's pitying you?

583
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:11,870
Get out!

584
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,170
Get out!

585
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:14,940
This is a hospital!

586
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,270
You don't own it!

587
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:17,650
You think just because you want me to leave,

588
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:18,450
-I'll go?
-I don't need

589
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,420
your pity!

590
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,540
I'm not leaving!

591
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,010
I don't need anyone's pity!

592
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,180
Damn hospital.

593
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,620
I don't need it!

594
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,680
I don't need it!

595
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:00,940
Throw a tantrum,

596
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,220
keep going.

597
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,280
Didn't you say you wanted me to leave?

598
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:07,920
Then go.

599
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,680
The door's right there—leave!

600
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,050
Had enough?

601
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,570
Now do you understand your situation?

602
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,300
Do you have a clear picture now?

603
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,410
Let me tell you, Yang Songbai,

604
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,800
from now on, you're going to listen to me.

605
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,710
No more tantrums.

606
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:40,950
You all—you all lied to me.

607
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,100
You all lied to me.

608
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,940
Take your hands away.

609
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,950
You eat what you need to heal.

610
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,120
I picked out the biggest

611
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,750
pig's trotters at the market.

612
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,610
Come on, try it.

613
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,570
I've been eating this for a week straight.

614
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,260
At this rate,

615
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,530
how fat am I going to get?

616
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,530
We're just getting started.

617
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,590
Besides, what's wrong with gaining a little weight?

618
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,500
Round and plump—it's a sign of good fortune!

619
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,500
Attracts wealth.

620
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,410
You finally got yourself a job,

621
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,030
so stop coming over here all the time.

622
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,290
It doesn't interfere.

623
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,220
I'll leave right after you finish eating.

624
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,890
Yeah, you know, that restaurant really needs me.

625
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,450
They wouldn't manage without me.

626
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,240
Then you'd better work hard for them.

627
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,390
I am working hard!

628
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,850
Do you know what a lobby manager is?

629
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,700
That's the face of the restaurant!

630
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,730
Xiaoshudu Restaurant

631
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:57,550
is one of the biggest restaurants

632
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,660
in the oilfield area.

633
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,280
All the important people come to eat here.

634
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,480
They're all leaders.

635
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,740
I'm not worried about

636
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,950
networking at all.

637
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,900
Sounds like

638
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:07,910
you've got it all figured out.

639
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,970
Of course! You gotta plan carefully.

640
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,720
How's the taste—too salty?

641
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,200
The taste is fine,

642
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,080
but I can't just drink the soup!

643
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,080
Give me a piece of the pig's trotter!

644
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,380
My bad!

645
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,790
Customers' requests come first.

646
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,670
Alright, make some space.

647
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,310
Here.

648
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,310
Since you were little, you've always loved fish.

649
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,760
Your uncle said

650
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,410
he made a yellow croaker just for you today.

651
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,250
Here, switch it up.

652
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,710
Yes. Here.

653
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,310
Switch it.

654
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,540
Closer.

655
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,390
Now, your most important task

656
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,580
is to eat well

657
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,540
and sleep well,

658
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,560
right?

659
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,200
Your mom is in the hospital

660
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,380
taking care of Yang.

661
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:58,850
You can't make them

662
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,510
worry about you on top of that.

663
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,310
If you do,

664
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,870
none of you will be at peace.

665
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,070
Right.

666
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,770
People get sick,

667
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,760
When you're sick,

668
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,360
you find the doctor.

669
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,900
But

670
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:12,770
it's up to the doctors to treat it.

671
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,150
No one else can help with that,

672
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:14,790
right?

673
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,940
So, for the sake of your mom and Yang,

674
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,550
don't make them worry.

675
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,080
Take care of yourself.

676
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,420
I know it's hard,

677
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,470
but we have to try our best.

678
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,570
Come on, eat.

679
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,280
Wait for your mom and Yang to come back.

680
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,030
Now, eat!

681
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,060
Eat, eat!

682
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,810
Eat, eat!

683
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:44,260
Eat.

684
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:51,590
Yaya.

685
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,300
I made some ribs.

686
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,820
Take them to Shanqing later, will you?

687
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,360
Sure!

688
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,510
Li Si, I guess you can't reach it.

689
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,160
Mom.

690
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,070
This amount is not bad at all.

691
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:09,400
This family just wants a girl.

692
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,780
She'll have a good life for sure.

693
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:13,940
Can we ask for a little more?

694
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:15,429
Brother,

695
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,500
be content with what I've helped you with.

696
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,530
You know how you broke

697
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,510
that leg of yours.

698
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,150
Shouldn't you be more careful?

699
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,880
If you don't want it, forget it.

700
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,750
When will they pay?

701
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,650
When will you get the girl?

702
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:32,110
In the next couple of days.

703
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,830
When I see the person, I'll give you the money.

704
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,210
I went early today.

705
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,720
The food's too hot.

706
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,820
Let's wait a bit before eating.

707
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,820
Let's do your rehabilitation exercises first, okay?

708
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,420
Okay.

709
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,080
What are you staring at?

710
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,240
What's on your mind?

711
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,140
Use your hands. Put some strength into it.

712
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,720
I'm telling you, Yang,

713
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,460
once you're discharged and back home,

714
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,990
you can't stop your rehab.

715
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,340
No tantrums.

716
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,140
You need to stick with it, got it?

717
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,970
I forgot to tell you—

718
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,210
I had Min

719
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,380
move all your stuff

720
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,220
from the dormitory

721
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,020
back home.

722
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,080
What?

723
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,180
Don't want to go back there?

724
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,510
Where do you want to go then?

725
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,640
To your mom's place?

726
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,500
Or your ex-wife's place?

727
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,100
Wait—

728
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,440
I'm also your ex-wife.

729
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,890
Two ex-wives, huh?

730
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,080
Maybe you should pick one.

731
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,810
Whichever one you choose, I'll send you there.

732
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:14,900
Hu Yue.

733
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,070
You...

734
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,340
What?

735
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,620
Are you feeling touched

736
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,750
by the way I've been taking care of you?

737
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,500
Please, don't be.

738
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,810
I have motives.

739
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,260
I'm practical now.

740
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,050
I'm after your salary,

741
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,540
and your bonus.

742
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,770
You got promoted too.

743
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:40,940
When

744
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,700
we were together,

745
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,460
you had nothing.

746
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,210
You didn't even buy me jewelry.

747
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,550
Now, I'm here to claim

748
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,640
what's mine—

749
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,740
to make up for

750
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,440
all the hardships I went through.

751
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,370
Got it?

752
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,720
What are you doing? Hands.

753
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:23,750
I'm not taking care of you

754
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,120
for free.

755
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,650
You need to pay me wages,

756
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,000
double.

757
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,010
Are you hungry?

758
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,500
Hungry.

759
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,470
Let's eat first then.

760
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,080
Coming.

761
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,330
Cook me some food.

762
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,350
All we have is noodles.

763
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,830
Anything's fine.

764
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,340
Good girl.

765
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,820
What happened to your leg?

766
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,360
Got bitten by a dog.

767
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,660
The police came looking for me.

768
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,400
They said

769
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,280
Lin Xiu has been arrested.

770
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,160
They even asked about you.

771
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,660
I didn't tell them you came back.

772
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,890
The police said

773
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,880
if you turn yourself in,

774
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,110
you might get a lighter sentence.

775
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,570
A lighter sentence?

776
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,020
Lin Xiu must have

777
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,910
pinned everything on me.

778
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,090
If I turn myself in,

779
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,630
it's a death sentence.

780
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,700
No, they said

781
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,010
this is just fraud.

782
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,240
-If you turn yourself in...
-Shut up.

783
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,020
I'll leave once I finish eating.

784
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,360
Pack a couple of

785
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,660
Zi's clothes.

786
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,160
I'm taking her with me.

787
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,400
Where are you taking her?

788
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,690
I'll find her a rich family.

789
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,480
Zi'll have a good life.

790
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,280
You're selling Zi?

791
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,320
That family will treat her well.

792
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:08,490
And she won't be a burden to you anymore.

793
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,310
It's perfect.

794
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,220
She's not a burden to me.

795
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,270
I can take care of her.

796
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,620
Dad, I'm begging you,

797
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,230
don't sell her.

798
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,010
She's your own daughter.

799
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,310
What good is being related

800
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,400
if I can't even survive?

801
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:47,920
Help!

802
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,470
What are you screaming for?

803
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,220
What are you shouting about?

804
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,900
Are you trying to call the police?

805
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,200
Yuan Shanqing, call the police, quickly!

806
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,220
[In Operation]

807
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,160
That early summer,

808
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,390
every day was filled with danger.

809
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,630
We were all on edge,

810
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,780
not knowing when the storm would stop,

811
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:46,620
not knowing

812
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,150
if the floods would return,

813
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,540
not knowing if our parents were safe,

814
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,590
not knowing that disaster had already struck.

815
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,620
Our home was protected,

816
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:57,650
but our youth

817
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,970
met its disaster.

818
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,180
We all remember that summer.

819
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,550
It changed our lives forever.
