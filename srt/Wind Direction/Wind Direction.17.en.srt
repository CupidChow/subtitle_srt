[Summer, 1980]

4
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,320
Yu!

5
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,990
Where have you been? What took you so long?

6
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,789
Weren't you afraid I'd be kidnapped by some bad guys?

7
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,120
Oh, come on.

8
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,430
Who in their right mind

9
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,310
would want to kidnap someone as heavily pregnant as you are?

10
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,630
They'd even have to take care of you during your postpartum recovery.

11
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,670
Yu, get on.

12
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,120
It's so bumpy. Can it work?

13
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,160
In rural areas, women often give birth

14
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,540
after riding on bumpy tractors.

15
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,080
Since this is your first baby,

16
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,100
it'll definitely be a bit challenging.

17
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,590
Okay.

18
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,530
Oh, right,

19
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,650
I've got something good for you.

20
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,360
What is it?

21
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,710
Chocolate.

22
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,070
W-W-What kind of chocolate is this?

23
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,270
The color seems off.

24
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,750
You country bumpkin.

25
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,630
That's white chocolate.

26
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,890
Let me tell you something.

27
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,320
The son of the deputy factory manager at the food factory

28
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,670
is my classmate.

29
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,710
He brought this back

30
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,790
specifically for me,

31
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,030
and it's imported.

32
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,829
You can't even buy it with money.

33
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,800
Go on, try it.

34
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,430
It's sweeter than dark chocolate.

35
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,560
You have a piece too.

36
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,220
I don't like sweet things.

37
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,990
You eat it all by yourself

38
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,040
and don't share it with anyone else,

39
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,350
not even with Mom and Dad.

40
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,150
Okay.

41
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,750
[Thank You]

42
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,190
What can you do?

43
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,750
I asked you to go to school to meet my teacher,

44
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,880
but you gave me away.

45
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,020
You've even offended

46
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,430
our Director of Teaching and Discipline.

47
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,150
I wouldn't call that "offending."

48
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,870
I just

49
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,070
criticized her a bit.

50
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,070
The Director of Teaching and Discipline

51
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,110
is not someone you can criticize just like that.

52
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,970
You don't know how difficult she is.

53
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,190
What's so difficult about her?

54
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,910
She's so short.

55
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,790
Who are you calling short?

56
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,630
You shouldn't talk about Fang like that.

57
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,670
Fang?

58
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,710
Wait.

59
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,030
She doesn't even have braids

60
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,360
and yet dares to be called Fang in the song?

61
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,030
Her name is Xiao Fang,

62
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,590
with “Fang” meaning “square.”

63
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,050
Fang is just a... nickname

64
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,000
we gave her

65
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,360
to sound more friendly.

66
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,250
That's right.

67
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,630
"Square" is more appropriate.

68
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,430
She's quite square,

69
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,470
like a TV set.

70
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,340
I really admire her parents

71
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,829
for giving her a name that means "square."

72
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,750
With a name like that,

73
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,750
she won't get married.

74
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,890
She's not married yet.

75
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,110
What does her name have to do with it?

76
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,030
Aren't you in your thirties

77
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,290
and still not married?

78
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,970
We are not the same.

79
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,710
I have standards for love.

80
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,670
According to my view of marriage,

81
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,390
it must be built

82
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,390
-on an excellent...
-Enough.

83
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,190
Who cares about your views on marriage?

84
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,220
You've never been excellent since you were young, anyway.

85
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,420
Just go back already.

86
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,310
You're causing too much trouble.

87
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:08,950
I must be crazy too.

88
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,470
How could I have asked you to go to school?

89
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,110
Wrong.

90
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,510
You letting me go was the right decision.

91
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,470
At school today,

92
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,110
judging from your attitude,

93
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,769
I didn't have time to tell you.

94
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,839
Everything I did was intentional.

95
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,709
Intentional for what?

96
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,440
That was all part of a strategy.

97
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,470
I wanted you

98
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,550
to leave a good impression on the teachers

99
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,280
so they wouldn't give up on you.

100
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,910
You need to think long-term,

101
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:29,660
you know?

102
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,990
Come on.

103
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,790
You just wanted to

104
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,970
leave a good impression of yourself.

105
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,300
Chingmy Yau is pretty,

106
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,050
so you're infatuated with her.

107
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,230
She is indeed pretty,

108
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,390
but not as pretty as the real Chingmy.

109
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,470
If she were the real Chingmy,

110
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,110
you could kill me

111
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,350
and feed me to her.

112
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,560
I couldn't do that.

113
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,550
What if I stewed you

114
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,710
and she didn't even like your taste?

115
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,830
-Jia Baoshan.
-Alright. Okay.

116
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,150
Let's get serious.

117
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,430
I am

118
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,180
working on a big plan here.

119
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,270
Look,

120
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,310
Ms. Han

121
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,390
is your English teacher

122
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,320
and also Yaya's homeroom teacher.

123
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,110
What if one day

124
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,630
she becomes your aunt?

125
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,260
I'm doing this for you and your brother.

126
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,590
Have you finished your errands?

127
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,990
When will you be leaving?

128
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,380
Comrade Jia Daiyu,

129
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,990
I'm formally informing you

130
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,720
that I won't be able to leave

131
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,780
for the time being.

132
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,050
What are you doing?

133
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,510
This way. This way.

134
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,270
Easy, easy.

135
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,710
He's here.

136
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:16,910
Didn't you

137
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,240
always envy others for having computers?

138
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,310
Now,

139
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,410
you can envy yourself.

140
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,150
Computer!

141
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,470
Son, happy birthday!

142
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,150
Happy birthday!

143
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,410
Thank you, Mom and Dad.

144
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,650
I want a hug too.

145
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,340
Your sister chipped in too.

146
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,780
Thank you, Miaomiao.

147
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,520
Yaya, although I didn't chip in,

148
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,020
I brought the computer

149
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,940
along the way.

150
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,870
Thank you, Uncle.

151
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,230
Happy birthday.

152
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,960
Come and take a look.

153
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,120
I've never seen it before.

154
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,670
This is even newer than the ones at our school.

155
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,710
Well, I propose...

156
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,270
Yaya,

157
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,070
you take

158
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,670
your friends

159
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,430
out to dinner tonight.

160
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,510
Alright, I'll go and start preparing the food.

161
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,150
Pengfei,

162
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,950
kids don't want to

163
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,860
hang out with you adults.

164
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,360
Leave it to me. I'll handle it.

165
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,710
Well,

166
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,510
invite your homeroom teacher too.

167
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,270
Uncle,

168
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,000
who would invite their homeroom teacher to their birthday party?

169
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,710
You kid,

170
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,440
you don't know how to respect your teachers.

171
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,390
It's hard for your teacher

172
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,120
to teach you.

173
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,790
Now, you won't invite her

174
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,590
when there is a treat.

175
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,920
Do you even know his homeroom teacher?

176
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,430
He does. He's chasing her.

177
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,500
What?

178
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,390
Yu, don't listen to her nonsense.

179
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,560
I'm not chasing her.

180
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,680
I just... you know,

181
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,810
had a chance to meet her,

182
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,730
and I feel that we hit it off.

183
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,950
I think

184
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,100
next, we can

185
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,780
get to know each other better.

186
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,250
That's what you think.

187
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,050
What does she think?

188
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,120
I think what she thinks

189
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,110
is what I think.

190
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,350
I could sense it

191
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,750
from the look in her eyes.

192
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,800
Is she even single?

193
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,550
Yes.

194
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,120
But we all think

195
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,830
that our English teacher

196
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,710
should be with

197
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,430
our homeroom teacher.

198
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,950
They were a senior and a junior at the same school,

199
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,030
a perfect match.

200
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,350
I... what?

201
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,030
Seniors and juniors are a perfect match?

202
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:47,909
I think she is pretty, and I am handsome;

203
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:48,900
together we'd make an ideal match.

204
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,570
Jia Baoshan,

205
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,970
stop daydreaming.

206
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,909
You just finished coming on to a nurse,

207
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:54,150
and now you're after the teacher?

208
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,030
You're really good at messing with people.

209
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:56,670
Yu, why do you

210
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,470
have to make it sound so unpleasant?

211
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,670
What do you mean by "messing with people"?

212
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,350
Ying and I

213
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,280
have no relationship whatsoever.

214
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,710
Besides, it's your son's birthday.

215
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,120
Right?

216
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,670
Why not take this opportunity to invite the teacher

217
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,910
so that we can

218
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,180
become closer to her?

219
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,710
Right?

220
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,830
Thanks, Uncle.

221
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,950
But I've already made plans

222
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,790
to go roller skating with my classmates.

223
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,990
Why go roller skating on your birthday?

224
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,870
We've already made plans.

225
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,330
We'll be heading out soon.

226
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,890
If you want to pursue Ms. Han,

227
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,220
go ask her out yourself.

228
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,150
I won't.

229
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,510
You can't force a deal.

230
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,070
You need to build a proper relationship and let
communication happen naturally,

231
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,570
right?

232
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,110
Now I get it.

233
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,870
This is the real reason

234
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,190
you're staying.

235
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,990
You want to chase their teacher.

236
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,270
Jia Baoshan,

237
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,150
you sure know how to stir things up.

238
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:35,549
Let me tell you.

239
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,309
If you can win over their teacher,

240
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,840
I'll give you my one month's salary.

241
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,230
I'll add thirty yuan.

242
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,010
I'll go with fifty.

243
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,380
Pengfei, it's your turn.

244
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,430
What's your wager?

245
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,800
I'll bet a hundred yuan.

246
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,950
I don't believe it.

247
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,600
You all can just wait to lose me your money!

248
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,670
I've still got the charm for it.

249
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,030
Cheng Miaomiao, are you ready yet?

250
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,030
I'll leave without you if you don't come out.

251
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,670
All right. I'm ready!

252
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,550
You two be careful

253
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,270
while skating

254
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,400
and come back early.

255
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,150
Okay, Mom.

256
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,390
Uncle.

257
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,510
I'll celebrate your birthday tonight.

258
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,750
You guys go roller skating.

259
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,060
After skating,

260
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,670
invite all of your classmates and teachers.

261
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,510
I'll cook

262
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,910
lamb leg for everyone myself.

263
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,830
It's not your birthday.

264
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,170
Why... why are you planning everything?

265
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,350
I'm just making up

266
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,070
for the fact that we never celebrated our birthdays as kids.

267
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,430
Our parents really didn't

268
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,840
care much about our growth.

269
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,750
Let me tell you.

270
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,550
Neither your mom nor I

271
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,030
have ever celebrated our birthdays, you know?

272
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,260
It's a missing piece of our childhood, you know?

273
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,910
Go ahead.

274
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,050
We'll start dinner when you get back.

275
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,930
Okay, Uncle.

276
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,830
Mom, we're leaving.

277
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,830
You take care of Zi.

278
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,590
Okay!

279
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,080
Come on, Yu, wash it.

280
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,020
Put it on the cutting board.

281
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,670
Cheng, hurry up.

282
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,350
We're going in first.

283
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,910
Okay.

284
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,670
Qiang Xiaowa.

285
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,740
Yuan Shanqing.

286
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,350
Qiang Xiaowa.

287
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,230
Well,

288
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,080
your sister didn't tell me ahead of time

289
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,280
about your birthday,

290
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,210
so I didn't have something fancy for you.

291
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,340
Here's a pen holder that I made myself.

292
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,580
I hope you don't mind.

293
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,510
Why would I mind?

294
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,560
This pen holder is really nice.

295
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,500
Thanks, Qiang Xiaowa.

296
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,680
I'm glad you like it.

297
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,680
I'll go put away my shoes.

298
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,110
Let me help you wear them.

299
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,030
No need.

300
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,990
I think I should just sit here.

301
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,150
I can't skate at all.

302
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,280
You guys go ahead.

303
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,540
I'll wait for you here.

304
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,360
That's why you should learn.

305
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,290
It's okay. I'll teach you. Come on.

306
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,250
I've never been to a place like this before.

307
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,510
I'm afraid I'll embarrass myself later.

308
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,050
That's why you should come here and have fun.

309
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,150
Zi is at my home.

310
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,050
Don't worry.

311
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,800
Just relax and have fun today.

312
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,190
-Give me your foot.
-I'll do it myself.

313
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,520
Let me loosen it for you.

314
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,230
Yaya,

315
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,470
you're really doing the full service here.

316
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,470
Could you help me

317
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,860
with my skates too?

318
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,090
Don't you have hands?

319
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,720
She doesn't have hands?

320
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,610
She's never been here before.

321
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,440
I just help her with her laces.

322
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,350
Snacks are here.

323
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,840
-Wait.
-Miaomiao.

324
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,030
Are you here for a picnic?

325
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,190
Come on, Shanqing.

326
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,290
Eat something so you have the energy to skate.

327
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:41,680
Let me tell you.

328
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,480
It's not hard at all.

329
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,550
Just don't fall down.

330
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,390
Of course, you don't mind falling.

331
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,630
You always fall on me.

332
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,210
When will you learn how to skate by yourself?

333
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:47,990
Listen.

334
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,150
Neither of you should cling to me later.

335
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,070
Li Si, especially you.

336
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,270
You'd better just sit here.

337
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:52,990
Don't skate.

338
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,510
Even if I skate on one foot, I'm still better than you.

339
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,440
Look at him brag.

340
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:56,990
Fine, I'm not good.

341
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,710
-I'm not good.
-Teach her well.

342
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,510
Come on, Miaomiao.

343
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,570
Let's give it a try.

344
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,070
Easy.

345
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,630
Lower your center of gravity.

346
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,190
Right.

347
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,500
Feet in a V-shape.

348
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,570
Yes, slow down.

349
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,590
Yes, use your legs to push. Lower your center of gravity.

350
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,150
Good.

351
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,470
-Be careful.
-Why am I...

352
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,870
falling backward when I try to skate forward?

353
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,910
I've got you from behind.

354
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,310
Don't worry. You won't fall.

355
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,150
Yes, we're all holding you,

356
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,190
so just skate ahead.

357
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,590
Slow and steady. V-shape with your feet.

358
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,200
Right.

359
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,630
Skate.

360
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,070
Slow down.

361
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,310
Zheng, we are all waiting for you to teach us.

362
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,510
Who's going to teach you guys? Dream on.

363
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,750
It's already a turning point that he is here.

364
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,930
Yuan Shanqing, don't be afraid.

365
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,050
We're all here for you.

366
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:35,570
Yes.

367
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,590
Come on. Left foot. Right foot. Right.

368
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,180
Slow down. Make your center of gravity lower.

369
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,280
Come on. Go. One...

370
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,430
It's hard for me to take care of you three.

371
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,230
But don't worry.

372
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,190
Here's a railing over there.

373
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,270
You can hold onto it

374
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,670
and skate along the edge.

375
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,420
I'm fine skating on my own.

376
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,460
So you have to pay attention

377
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,090
and make sure to protect me later.

378
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,620
Let Miaomiao and Xiaowa skate along the edge.

379
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,790
Let's go.

380
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,980
Isn't he just playing dumb to win big?

381
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,640
How come he knows everything?

382
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,910
Yeah.

383
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,550
Relax your body. Don't tense up.

384
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,410
Just like that.

385
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,150
Okay.

386
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,100
Don't be afraid of falling.

387
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,470
Once you've fallen a couple of times, you'll know how to skate.

388
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,080
It's okay. I'm not afraid of falling.

389
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,230
Let's go.

390
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,210
Left foot.

391
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,960
Be careful.

392
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,310
It's okay.

393
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,110
Go on. Come on.

394
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,920
Why didn't I notice

395
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,750
that Yuan Shanqing

396
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,950
is actually pretty?

397
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,850
Did you ever give her a proper look?

398
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,990
Easy, slow down.

399
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,270
Si,

400
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,510
maybe you should just sit there.

401
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,790
I can't even skate with you moving like this.

402
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,670
I have to keep an eye on you

403
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,470
in case you fall down.

404
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,390
I'm just warming up.

405
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,790
I'll be more flexible in a bit.

406
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,850
Are you warming up?

407
00:13:58,990 --> 00:13:59,660
I think

408
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,230
you've been getting injured too frequently lately.

409
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,110
Later, if you

410
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,660
fall again accidentally

411
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,510
and hurt your leg for good, you'll be done for.

412
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,840
Can you wish me well?

413
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,330
Okay.

414
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,540
Slow down. Come on.

415
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,990
Cheng Yaya, really...

416
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:24,870
Before, we used to

417
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,550
skate on the frozen river

418
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,270
and we made our own skates.

419
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:28,910
I've just

420
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,630
never been to places like this before.

421
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,810
It's expensive. We never had to pay for skating back home.

422
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,890
You know how to make ice skates?

423
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,320
You can't learn how to skate like this.

424
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,980
Let me pull you along; come on.

425
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,550
Well... M-M-Miaomiao.

426
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,510
Miaomiao, well…

427
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,870
Can you help me?

428
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,590
Yes, why don't you help him?

429
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,550
I can't take it anymore.

430
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,310
Then, you two go ahead and skate.

431
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,440
I will skate with Si.

432
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,480
Take your time.

433
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,820
Come on.

434
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,240
Let me pull you.

435
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,180
There's no railing ahead.

436
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,980
No railing... we don't need one.

437
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,470
You two, be careful.

438
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,520
I'm with her!

439
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,590
Let's u-u-unify our steps.

440
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,630
Okay, unify.

441
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,650
-Let's move your left foot first.
-Come on.

442
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,820
Left foot, go.

443
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,390
All done.

444
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,030
Here comes the lamb leg.

445
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,870
Sure.

446
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,670
It smells so good.

447
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,670
Today,

448
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,190
all of you, welcome

449
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,030
to Yaya's birthday party.

450
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,550
Come on,

451
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,270
try me cooking.

452
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,160
You can all get a feel for

453
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,870
what a fancy restaurant's roast lamb leg tastes like.

454
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,630
My uncle was a top chef.

455
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,100
He used to work

456
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,360
at a fancy restaurant.

457
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,630
Uncle,

458
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,630
weren't you a race car driver before?

459
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,710
How were you a chef this time?

460
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,190
Those were all side gigs.

461
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,260
I've got a wide range of skills.

462
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,690
Too many talents.

463
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,630
Well, with great power

464
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,190
comes great responsibility, right?

465
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,870
Here, first piece

466
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,510
for our birthday boy, Yaya.

467
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,510
Thank you, Uncle.

468
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,550
Try it.

469
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,070
Is it good?

470
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,220
Is it good?

471
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,950
Give me a bite.

472
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,270
It's crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Come on. You try it.

473
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,310
There's plenty for everyone.

474
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,150
Don't worry.

475
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,430
Come on.

476
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:47,950
It's really good.

477
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,550
Si.

478
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,550
Thank you, Uncle.

479
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,360
I want a piece too.

480
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,910
Here.

481
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,380
Thank you, Uncle.

482
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,200
And here's a piece for Shanqing.

483
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Thank you, Uncle.

484
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,350
This piece is for Min.

485
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,310
Dip it in some cumin.

486
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,590
-It’s roasted just right.
-Here.

487
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,030
Thank you, Uncle.

488
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,830
I didn't sprinkle any condiments for you.

489
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,750
Because I wasn't sure

490
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,750
if everyone could take papper.

491
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,150
Okay.

492
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,450
Dip the condiment yourself.

493
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,420
Here, Xiaowa.

494
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,180
Thank you, Uncle.

495
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,380
Okay, that's enough.

496
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,670
I'm Luo Zheng.

497
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,700
Yes, Luo Zheng.

498
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,900
I really haven't seen you in a while.

499
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,099
You still look sharp.

500
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,790
Everyone, dig in.

501
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,599
How's the lamb leg?

502
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,869
So good!

503
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:21,829
Okay.

504
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:22,510
Listen.

505
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,380
I'll be happy

506
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,790
as long as you're enjoying the food.

507
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,670
Let's eat.

508
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,349
All of you are here today.

509
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,100
I'm very happy.

510
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,950
Now, the only regret is

511
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,550
that your teacher didn't come.

512
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,590
Which teacher?

513
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,240
Yaya's homeroom teacher, Ms. Han.

514
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,840
Well...

515
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,670
Ms. Han.

516
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,790
When a student has a birthday,

517
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,590
shouldn't the teachers

518
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,870
do something, right?

519
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,830
Come on, let's eat.

520
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,350
Let's eat while we chat.

521
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,380
So, who at the school

522
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,630
is close with Ms. Han?

523
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,150
Isn't it our Mr. Gao

524
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,750
who's pretty close with her?

525
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,280
I don't know.

526
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,750
How close?

527
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,020
Like, are they dating?

528
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,230
-I…
-Pretty much like it.

529
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,760
Seems like a matter of time.

530
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,710
I think it's possible that Ms. Han

531
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,430
and our PE teacher

532
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,380
could be a thing too.

533
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,310
Last time, I saw him

534
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,630
giving her a lift on his bike.

535
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,490
How did the PE teacher get involved now?

536
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,210
Uncle,

537
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,700
by that logic,

538
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,430
I think even our history teacher

539
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,890
has a thing for Ms. Han too.

540
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,910
Who's the history teacher now?

541
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:15,710
Uncle.

542
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,270
The closer you are, the better your chances.

543
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,470
You can't even see her every day.

544
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,070
It's hard.

545
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,780
They are all your strong competitors.

546
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,350
Wait...

547
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:25,800
Uncle,

548
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,470
what's going on?

549
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,330
Are you...

550
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:30,770
interested in Ms. Han?

551
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,530
No. No.

552
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,050
We just met,

553
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,630
and I thought it wouldn't hurt to get to know her better.

554
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,430
Listen up.

555
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,950
This isn't serious yet,

556
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,810
so don't spread rumors at school.

557
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,510
Everyone here,

558
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,470
if any of you

559
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,230
can help me

560
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,190
gather some intel

561
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,390
on Ms. Han,

562
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,790
I'll cook up another lamb leg for you

563
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,550
as a reward.

564
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,200
Deal!

565
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,630
Okay?

566
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,670
Okay!

567
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,350
My aunt

568
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,430
knows a teacher

569
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,590
who lives next door to Ms. Han.

570
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,650
He seems to... teach music.

571
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,320
That's great info.

572
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,880
Let's do this, Luo Zheng.

573
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,810
You help me

574
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,230
gather more intel on Ms. Han.

575
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,290
I'm counting on you.

576
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:04,850
Sure.

577
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,760
Why are there so many men involved?

578
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,270
Uncle was tipsy earlier.

579
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,990
He was hilarious.

580
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,390
I've just got him settled down.

581
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,470
They all go home?

582
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,750
Where's Zi?

583
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,270
She's asleep with my mom.

584
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,490
Don't worry.

585
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,560
Just let her sleep. It's fine.

586
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,950
Don't clean up anymore.

587
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,710
Go to sleep.

588
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,310
I'll handle this.

589
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,230
Wait.

590
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,860
A birthday gift for you.

591
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,230
365.

592
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,200
Did you fold all of these?

593
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,630
There is more.

594
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,830
I also made a cake for you.

595
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,750
I wanted to bring it out earlier,

596
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,010
but I was worried that they might laugh at it.

597
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,860
It's not a fancy cream cake,

598
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,580
just a simple steamed egg cake that I made.

599
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,240
The egg cake is my favorite.

600
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,110
It smells amazing.

601
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,030
Let me light a candle for you.

602
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,910
Make a wish.

603
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,200
When is your birthday?

604
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,870
November 7.

605
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,860
Wait, that was yesterday.

606
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,430
Why didn't you tell me

607
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,490
that it was your birthday yesterday?

608
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,250
Since my mom passed away,

609
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,510
I haven't celebrated my birthday again.

610
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,690
I don't even remember it myself.

611
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,950
Cut the cake first.

612
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,270
Now, we're celebrating your birthday.

613
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,200
Happy birthday.

614
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,190
Let's be happy together.

615
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,150
From now on, let's celebrate our birthdays

616
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,130
on the same day.

617
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:52,830
Okay.

618
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,590
Make a wish. Come on.

619
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,990
♫Happy birthday to you♫

620
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,150
♫Happy birthday to you♫

621
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,830
♫Happy birthday to you♫

622
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,430
♫Happy birthday to you♫

623
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,650
Here, birthday girl.

624
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,270
Pick up the phone.

625
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,470
Hello?

626
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,750
Uncle.

627
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,150
My mom...

628
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,650
Say, I'm not at home.

629
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,750
My mom is not at home.

630
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,240
I don't know where she went.

631
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,070
She hasn't come back yet.

632
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,830
I've eaten.

633
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,310
Okay.

634
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,390
Bye.

635
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:12,950
Mom.

636
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,390
It's okay. Keep watching your show.

637
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,550
The ideal of life

638
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,650
is to live an ideal life.

639
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,950
You're like a light that illuminates my world.

640
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,230
Always keep your face toward the sun,

641
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,990
so you won't see the shadows.

642
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,240
Our scars

643
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,400
will become

644
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,800
the source of our strength.

645
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,150
Since we've chosen this path,

646
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,950
just focus on forging ahead through wind and rain.

647
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,530
Thank you.

648
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,240
You're welcome.

649
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,870
Off you go.

650
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,880
What are you doing?

651
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,750
You startled me.

652
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,800
I'm making soup.

653
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,310
What's gotten into you?

654
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,240
You're even making soup for us now?

655
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,440
Let me see what kind of soup it is.

656
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,970
No, no, no, this soup is for someone else.

657
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,570
I'll make you some tomorrow.

658
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,550
What now this time?

659
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,790
Guess.

660
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,790
Okay, class is over.

661
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,430
Stand up.

662
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,840
See you, sir.

663
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,100
Goodbye, students.

664
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,640
Why didn't Qiang Xiaowa come to school today?

665
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,390
How would I know?

666
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,920
He doesn't live in my house.

667
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,670
What kind of attitude is that?

668
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,180
What attitude should I have?

669
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,050
He's a teenager.

670
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:52,830
Nothing will happen to him.

671
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,630
Why do you care so much about him?

672
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,150
What's wrong with me caring about a friend?

673
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,910
Ms. Han. Ms. Han?

674
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,870
Someone is looking for you.

675
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,270
He's at the gate with the guard.

676
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:13,960
Who is it?

677
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:14,920
I don't know.

678
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,730
How about you come with me and see?

679
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:30,590
♫Thinking about my childhood sweetheart...♫

680
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,980
He's been looking for you for a while.

681
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,640
That's him.

682
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,470
Look.

683
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,320
I think I've seen him before.

684
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:42,410
[Linqi Oilfield No. 2 High School]

685
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,220
Ms. Han!

686
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,480
-That's him.
-Ms. Han.

687
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,850
You're Miaomiao's relative, right?

688
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,570
Yes, Ms. Han.

689
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,100
What brings you here?

690
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,340
Nothing much.

691
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,020
I was in the area

692
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,430
and thought I'd discuss

693
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,910
Miaomiao's studies with you some more.

694
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,630
But the security guy

695
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,390
wouldn't let me in,

696
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,550
thinking I was up to no good.

697
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,230
No, Director Xiao just instructed

698
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,870
that unauthorized visitors aren't allowed in.

699
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,630
How am I an unauthorized visitor?

700
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,120
Once a teacher, always a parent figure.

701
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,510
She's practically my niece's mother.

702
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,670
We're family.

703
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:05,590
If you have something,

704
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,480
can't you talk here?

705
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,370
Do you really need to interrupt Ms. Han's class?

706
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,510
Ms. Han, I didn't interrupt you, right?

707
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,630
Besides, you see.

708
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,760
I'm already here.

709
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,910
It's okay, Zhang.

710
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,820
Let him in.

711
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,080
Well, Director Xiao...

712
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,880
Alright. The leader has spoken.

713
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,550
Remember my face.

714
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,360
Don't stop me next time, got it?

715
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,400
We're family.

716
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,660
-You...
-Ms. Han.

717
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:36,950
Ms. Han.

718
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,590
Miaomiao

719
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,380
really didn't take after me.

720
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,760
She's, indeed, not very bright.

721
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,780
Ms. Han, I know you've worked hard.

722
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,910
I made this soup

723
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,390
this morning.

724
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,670
A real old hen.

725
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,460
I simmered it on low heat

726
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,520
for several hours.

727
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,260
Try it.

728
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,030
But I have a class soon.

729
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,590
If the other teachers see this,

730
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,190
it may not reflect well on me.

731
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,040
What if

732
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,910
the director sees it...

733
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,390
What's the big deal if she sees it?

734
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:10,950
I...

735
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,070
I've seen her sneaking dumplings before.

736
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,670
You know?

737
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,770
So, she can eat dumplings,

738
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,200
but you can't drink soup?

739
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,430
I heard from the guard

740
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,150
that someone unauthorized entered the school.

741
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:20,670
Let's see who it is

742
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,390
that has such little respect for campus rules.

743
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,150
Director.

744
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,320
Director, you're here.

745
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,310
I came today

746
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,470
as a representative of the parents

747
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,580
to offer my support to you.

748
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,150
I want to express

749
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,390
my deep respect and admiration

750
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,190
for you, the people's teachers.

751
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,190
You are the gardeners of the nation.

752
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,070
If the youth are strong, the nation will be strong.

753
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,190
And how do we ensure the youth are strong?

754
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,460
It all depends on

755
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,320
outstanding educators like you.

756
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,870
What I'm doing here

757
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,250
is really nothing.

758
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,630
Please,

759
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:52,730
have some of this chicken soup with my respect in it.

760
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,070
Thank you.

761
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,270
Thank you

762
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,060
for your support and understanding

763
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,140
of us educators.

764
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,880
I'll drink it in your honor.

765
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,350
This soup is pretty good.

766
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:11,950
Right?

767
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,370
Have some more.

768
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,870
You drink too. There's plenty.

769
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,070
No, thanks.

770
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,770
My stomach's been a bit off.

771
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,630
Our director loves soup.

772
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,040
-Ms. Han
-What's wrong with your stomach?

773
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,270
The director is here too?

774
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,400
What are you eating?

775
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,500
The parent brought some chicken soup.

776
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,430
Have some too.

777
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,130
No, thanks.

778
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,270
Who is this?

779
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,790
He is Cheng Miaomiao's homeroom teacher,

780
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,630
Mr. Gao.

781
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:36,790
Mr. Gao!

782
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,990
I've heard a lot about you!

783
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,270
Miaomiao keeps talking about you

784
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,230
in front of me, really.

785
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,280
I finally get to meet you today.

786
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,160
As they say,

787
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,190
"Life is full of surprises."

788
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,590
This is my office.

789
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,830
You can see me as long as you can come.

790
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,030
Then I'll have to drop by more often.

791
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,660
I love visiting your office

792
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,750
and soaking in the atmosphere of cultured folks.

793
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,870
After that long chat

794
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:55,870
with Ms. Han last time,

795
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,670
my mind

796
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,150
has greatly improved.

797
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,360
My improvement

798
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,950
has a lot to do with you.

799
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,710
Right?

800
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,750
After all, I know.

801
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,310
I heard that you two are seeing each other.

802
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,670
Seeing what?

803
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,200
Are you two an item?

804
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,630
We're not like that.

805
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,590
Then, this must be a rumor, right?

806
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,550
Why do I

807
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,950
have no judgment at all to these rumors?

808
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,550
Besides,

809
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,950
it's not really appropriate

810
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,590
for teachers from the same school

811
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,500
to date,

812
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
right, Director?

813
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,750
Alright, don't worry about

814
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,510
our teachers' personal matters.

815
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,470
Okay, it's time.

816
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,630
Teachers get back to class,

817
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,090
and the parent heads home.

818
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:38,750
Well...

819
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,550
Ms. Han, your stomach...

820
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,430
You come back.

821
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,110
Well, you...

822
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,550
You done eating, Director?

823
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,190
Yes.

824
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,350
How was the taste?

825
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,820
The soup was really good,

826
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,050
but the meat was a bit too salty.

827
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,310
I prefer things light.

828
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,110
Light?

829
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,200
Mom, I'm back.

830
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,100
You're back?

831
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:18,100
Mom, Yang didn't come home?

832
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,610
No.

833
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,170
He left right after the meeting.

834
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,170
He didn't go home.

835
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,130
Did you ask him

836
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,400
about the Walkman?

837
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,480
Did he buy it or not?

838
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,520
Ask him yourself when you see him.

839
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,870
Why should I ask about it for you?

840
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,710
I didn't see him.

841
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,370
The food is in the pot.

842
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,710
How about I heat it up for you now?

843
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,480
Mom.

844
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,330
The color of the lipstick is good.

845
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,630
Isn't it too red?

846
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,390
It's the lipstick

847
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,190
you gave me.

848
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:49,950
I'll go wipe it off.

849
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,080
No, don't wipe it off. It looks nice.

850
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,130
What, are you going dancing?

851
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,850
Your aunties insisted that I go.

852
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:58,950
And since

853
00:33:58,950 --> 00:33:59,990
Yang isn't home,

854
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,380
I thought I'd go get some exercise.

855
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,600
You should still go if he were home.

856
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,800
Where's that fierce attitude of yours?

857
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,540
Sobering up now and chickening out, huh?

858
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,040
How could  you say that to your mom?

859
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,610
Go.

860
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,460
I'm backing you up. Go.

861
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:13,310
How about I...

862
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,150
-reheat the dinner for you?
-No need.

863
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,580
Go. Go.

864
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,650
Come on.

865
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,400
I'm really going then.

866
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,880
Let me grab my purse.

867
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,420
Enjoy dancing.

868
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,949
Dancing is hard.

869
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,429
It's really not too red?

870
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:28,389
Not at all; it looks great.

871
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:29,860
-Go.
-I'm off then.

872
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,110
-Mom...
-Don't forget to eat when you're hungry.

873
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,870
I know.

874
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,060
Go. Hurry.

875
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,660
Hello.

876
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,380
May I have this dance?

877
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:01,950
Sorry.

878
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,630
I don't... I don't know how to dance.

879
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,350
I'm waiting for my friend.

880
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:05,930
She...

881
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,220
My friend is here.

882
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,620
I'm sorry.

883
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,380
What took you so long?

884
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,060
What's going on? Who was that?

885
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,470
How would I know?

886
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,880
He approached me and asked me to dance.

887
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,060
I'm so scared.

888
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,080
Then, dance with him.

889
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,760
Why are you scared?

890
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,690
Could he eat you?

891
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,720
I don't even know him.

892
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,600
How could I dance with him?

893
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,190
Who says you have to know someone to dance with them?

894
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,480
Go dancing.

895
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,090
How?

896
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:28,920
It's all hand-holding

897
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,910
and waist-grabbing.

898
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,900
How can I dance with a stranger?

899
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:32,930
How old are you?

900
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,270
Why are you still so shy?

901
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,370
Age has nothing to do with it.

902
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,500
No matter how old we are, we have to mind our reputation.

903
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,380
Let me tell you.

904
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,230
I'm here to dance

905
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,270
with you guys

906
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,030
for exercise,

907
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:42,910
not to dance

908
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,320
with strange men.

909
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,480
That means you still got it.

910
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,940
Oh, come on, Yu.

911
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,950
You're just teasing me again.

912
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,000
Fine, then I'll ask you for a dance.

913
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,360
Well, you'll have to stand up and ask me properly.

914
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,010
Okay.

915
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,850
Come on.

916
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,290
I can never get that turn right.

917
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,490
Miaomiao, go to my home later.

918
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,490
I have something.

919
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,550
What is it?

920
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
Something.

921
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,290
Where are you going?

922
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,980
Do I have to report to you where I'm going?

923
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,760
Who else would you report to if not me?

924
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,480
We have to

925
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,830
keep each other updated in real-time, always.

926
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:41,870
We don't need to do that.

927
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,270
Let's enjoy our freedom.

928
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,970
Freedom requires self-discipline!

929
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,720
You've been using a lot of new words lately, haven't you?

930
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,110
I've read a couple of philosophy books.

931
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,970
Philosophy books?

932
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:03,190
[Heping Town]

933
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,870
Jia Baoshan!

934
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:14,840
Jia Baoshan!

935
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,150
Coming! Coming!

936
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,270
Are you done?

937
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,310
Yes. Yes.

938
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,230
Yu, here, take this.

939
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,550
It's hot.

940
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,190
Let me... let me do it!

941
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,720
What are you doing?

942
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,610
It's burning hot.

943
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,560
Let me do it.

944
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,170
Yu, you...

945
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,810
you really look like

946
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,080
a mother-in-law now,

947
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,030
liking to take care of your granddaughter.

948
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,960
I never realized it before,

949
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,960
but now that I'm older,

950
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,310
holding a baby...

951
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,150
I suddenly understand

952
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,140
why grandparents are always so fond of

953
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,400
their grandchildren.

954
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,500
It seems

955
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,960
that you can only depend on me

956
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,160
having a little baby for you to care for.

957
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,560
What?

958
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,390
Did the chicken soup delivery go well today?

959
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,850
Oh, it went very smoothly.

960
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,910
She has a great impression of me now

961
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,100
in every way.

962
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,750
I'm telling you, you have to be proactive and sincere

963
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,030
when it comes to something like this.

964
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,190
Whether a girl will date you or not

965
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,470
depends on how much effort

966
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,330
the guy puts in.

967
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,070
Listen, be careful.

968
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,350
Don't let it affect

969
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,950
the kids' studies at school.

970
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,310
What are you talking about?

971
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,150
I'm doing this

972
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,390
for them to get better care.

973
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,120
Understand?

974
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:12,390
You should

975
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,720
take care of yourself first.

976
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,920
-Wait.
-Give it to me.

977
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,230
Yu, have they caught Yuan Yong yet?

978
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:19,830
Not yet.

979
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:23,470
Evil deeds will eventually meet their punishment.

980
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,750
Zi, time to drink your milk!

981
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:28,960
Yu!

982
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,480
When I have kids with Ms. Han,

983
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,590
I'll leave them to you!

984
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,510
In your dreams!

985
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:39,910
This computer starts up

986
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,710
way faster than those at school.

987
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,910
Click on this, and you can get online.

988
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,600
You try it.

989
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,710
Click this?

990
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,270
Yes.

991
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,590
I won't break it, will I?

992
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:03,790
No.

993
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,430
It's better

994
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:05,990
than the school computers

995
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,190
and connects directly to the internet.

996
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,650
Your birthday gift is really expensive.

997
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,340
Your gift to me is just as precious.

998
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
It's freezing.

999
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,270
Uncle Chen.

1000
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,730
Xiaowa, you're back?

1001
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,710
Alright, you carry on.

1002
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,350
Okay.

1003
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,280
You missed me too, didn't you?

1004
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,910
Auntie.

1005
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:39,910
Cheng Miaomiao?

1006
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,590
Why are you here?

1007
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,000
I saw that you weren't at school today.

1008
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,630
I was afraid that something might happen to you,

1009
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,960
so I came to check on you.

1010
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,090
Let's talk on the boat.

1011
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,750
Today, our old principal is sick,

1012
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:02,910
so I went to visit him

1013
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,330
and couldn't make it to school.

1014
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,990
Come on, to warm up your hands.

1015
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,460
Did your village not have a school?

1016
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,190
There used to be one, but...

1017
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,180
not anymore.

1018
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,990
It's getting cold today.

1019
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,390
Why are you here?

1020
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,170
Why is your face so red?

1021
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,260
You have a fever?

1022
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,430
No, I'm fine.

1023
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:37,070
The wind was just too strong outside.

1024
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,710
Was it really that windy today?

1025
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,130
They're really not dating?

1026
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,890
No.

1027
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,060
They were just senior and junior schoolmates.

1028
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,550
She's not even interested in such a handsome guy.

1029
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,280
She has pretty high standards.

1030
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,060
She's from Shanghai.

1031
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,640
Right.

1032
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:07,950
Looks like...

1033
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,830
I'll need to rethink my strategy.

1034
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,590
I need to be more like people from Shanghai.

1035
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,500
It's not easy.

1036
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:17,170
Uncle.

1037
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,660
How do you tell

1038
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:22,270
if a girl

1039
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,370
likes a boy?

1040
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,180
If a girl

1041
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,810
is constantly all over him

1042
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,240
with no boundaries,

1043
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,190
then it's clear that she doesn't like him.

1044
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,350
But if she

1045
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,540
deliberately avoids contact,

1046
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,150
keeps her distance,

1047
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,010
yet

1048
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:40,950
still shows little acts of care

1049
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,150
from time to time,

1050
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,310
and gets a bit flustered

1051
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:44,000
when people

1052
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,910
bring them up,

1053
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,990
then she definitely likes him.

1054
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,360
Are you sure about that?

1055
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,780
This is wisdom gained through my experience.

1056
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,290
It's a proven truth.

1057
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,000
I am sure.

1058
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,470
But in my case, Ms. Han

1059
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,750
treats me so politely.

1060
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,320
That doesn't look too good for me.

1061
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:06,830
That's it.

1062
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,030
It's all over.

1063
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,150
Where are you going?

1064
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,290
Aren't we going to the arcade?

1065
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:18,090
No, I don't want to play anymore!

1066
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,010
It's hard.

1067
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,070
A person can be strong

1068
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,640
with a firm heart

1069
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,130
and unwavering strength,

1070
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,520
yet no one

1071
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,180
can remain strong forever.

1072
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,070
So, God has blessed us

1073
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,220
with family, loved ones, and friends.

1074
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,140
When we are happy,

1075
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,370
they share in our joy.

1076
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,440
When we're down,

1077
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,050
they help us heal.

1078
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:49,540
Don't worry.

1079
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:52,110
Even if we fall, stumble,

1080
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,320
or feel overwhelmed

1081
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,630
by worry and hardship,

1082
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,790
they will still stand before us

1083
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:57,830
time and time again

1084
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,290
and say, "Don't be afraid.

1085
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,430
I'm here."

1086
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:02,430
I'm grateful for every person

1087
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:03,920
who has ever stood before me.
