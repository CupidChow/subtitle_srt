4
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,140
We could just sleep together gently.

5
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,590
We're here?

6
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,289
We've arrived at my place.

7
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:10,910
Xiu.

8
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,520
I really love you.

9
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,750
You know that, right?

10
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,470
Who is it?

11
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,090
My daughter.

12
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,020
She's older than I expected.

13
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,200
So what?

14
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,760
She's useless, just a burden.

15
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,010
Why are the lights off?

16
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,740
Turn them on!

17
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,390
Please.

18
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,310
Thank you.

19
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:40,700
You're welcome.

20
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,350
What?

21
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,240
The sofa's sagging!

22
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,630
You broke our sofa.

23
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,390
You have to pay for it.

24
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,079
How?

25
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,110
How should I pay?

26
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,470
You tell me.

27
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,710
You tell me.

28
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,680
I'm thirsty.

29
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:58,890
Get us some water.

30
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,470
My sofa is expensive.

31
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,430
I want a drink.

32
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:10,790
Do you have any?

33
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,390
Call her "Aunt."

34
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,829
Are you mute?

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,010
No need!

36
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,070
No need!

37
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,030
No need!

38
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,450
Are you drunk and acting crazy?

39
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,829
You're scaring me!

40
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:31,420
I'm leaving!

41
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,870
Don't go, please.

42
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,150
Don't be afraid.

43
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,210
Get back to your homework.

44
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,860
You're nuts.

00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,079
What's this?

46
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,780
Chicken soup.

47
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,650
Why does it smell so bad?

48
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,660
Your dad still isn't back?

49
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,730
It's been three days since the baby was born.

00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,640
Where did he go?

51
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:20,990
Check the drawer—

52
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,720
see if the money is still there.

53
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,300

58
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,150
Yes.

Is that all you know how to do?

64
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,570
Enough! Stop crying.

65
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,150
Don't cry.

66
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,570
It's okay.

67
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,710
I wouldn't be in this situation

68

if it weren't for you.

69
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,000
Don't cry.

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,640
Don't cry.

71
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,400
I'm so tired.

72
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,600
I'm sorry.

73

Don't cry.

[The Seabird]

77
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,550
Zi had a fever

78
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,560
for three whole days,

79
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,840
almost didn't make it.

80
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,860
Lin Xiu went to look for Yuan Yong,

81
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,270
and they didn't come back

82
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,200
for half a month.

83
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,670
Yuan Yong somehow

84
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,650
got a car,

85
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,030
and they started scamming people

86
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,150
for money.

87
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,550
They never

88
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,410
cared about Zi.

89
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,670
In fact, because she was a girl,

90
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,270
they even wanted to sell her.

91
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,000
Back then, I was too afraid to go to school.

92
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,310
I just held onto Zi and hid.

93
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,530
Later, when Yuan Yong got into trouble,

94
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,620
we lost our house.

95
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,870
I sat with Zi

96
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,790
outside the office building

97
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,640
for three days

98
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,680
until a manager came out

99
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,390
and gave us

100
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,850
our current place to stay.

101
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,890
That's how we survived.

102
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,090
Sometimes I think,

103
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,240
it's a good thing Yuan Yong and Lin Xiu

104
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,240
ran into trouble and left.

105
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,830
Otherwise, Zi and I

106
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,330
wouldn't have made it.

00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,910
Zi seems a bit tired.

109
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,580
I'll take her inside to sleep for a bit.

110
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,640
Go ahead, go ahead.

111
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,260
So, do you know

112
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,940
where your dad kept the money?

113
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,390
Don't...

114
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,610
Why bring that up?

115
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,590
I just want to get a sense of things.

116
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,390
That way, I can tell the police when the time comes.

117
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,310
Yuan Yong

118
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,560
hid a metal box at home

119
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,780
with some money in it.

120
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,080
He didn't have time to take it when he left.

121
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,270
But I already told the police,

122
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,510
and I handed over the money—

123
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,510
over 10,000 yuan.

124
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,820
He scammed tens of thousands, though.

125
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,600
I don't know where the rest of the money is.

126
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,750
He hasn't come back to look for me since.

127
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,590
He wouldn't dare.

128
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,720
He'd be arrested as soon as he showed up.

129
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,430
People like that

130
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,680
are infuriating.

131
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,570
They don't just

132
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,260
both of them are bad.

133
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,450
They even

134
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,910
ruin their own children.

135
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:07,570
They should

136
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,150
be shot.

137
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,070
Why are you saying this

138
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,070
in front of the kids?

139
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,030
She's old enough

140
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,500
to know exactly

141
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,300
what kind of person Yuan Yong is.

142
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:22,850
Mom,

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,270
she really loves that...

144
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,270
Keep an eye on her.

145
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,710
She's asleep.

146
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,050
She's asleep?

147
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,789
Well...

148
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,750
Since Zi's fever last time,

149
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,049
has anything changed?

150
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,309
She seems to sleep more now

151
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,720
and doesn't cry as much.

152
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,130
I even think she's grown more mature.

153
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,730
Uncle Cheng,

154
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,030
is it because of

155
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,830
that fever

156
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,420
that her hearing got damaged?

157
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,480
She used to respond when I called her.

158
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,090
It's possible.

159
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,430
It's all my fault.

160
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,750
If only I had come back

161
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,350
earlier that day.

162
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:04,950
No, no.

163
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,790
Maybe if she hadn't been caught in the rain,

164
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,650
things would've been different.

165
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,070
Shanqing, calm down.

166
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,200
How about this?

167
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,350
I'll arrange

168
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,210
a more thorough check-up for her.

169
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:16,900
Dad.

170
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,230
Can she be cured?

171
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,600
Treatment takes time;

172
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,290
it's not something that happens overnight.

173
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,770
We need to be patient,

174
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,770
with gradual tests

175
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,900
and treatment.

176
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,320
Yes.

177
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,000
Shanqing, don't worry.

178
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,990
My dad is the best

179
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,690
ENT specialist here.

180
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,710
He even cured

181
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,630
the factory manager's hearing.

182
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,030
Zi will be fine for sure.

183
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,360
Yeah, he even helped

184
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,660
an 80-year-old lady

185
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,560
hear again.

186
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,350
Zi will definitely be fine,

187
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:43,850
right?

188
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,390
Don't worry about it.

189
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,090
People say it's karma,

190
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,230
but it's clearly their fault.

191
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,010
Why does Zi have to suffer?

192
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,740
She didn't do anything wrong.

193
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,190
Why is life

194
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,380
so unfair?

195
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,220
Shanqing, life is like this.

196
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,290
Sometimes it's smooth,

197
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,790
and sometimes we hit rough patches.

198
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,830
But when we're in the tough times,

199
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,610
we can't give up.

200
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,650
Once this difficult time passes,

201
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,990
things will get better.

202
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,450
They'll definitely

203
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,450
be caught by the police.

204
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,530
Zi will recover.

205
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,510
Everything will turn out fine for you both.

206
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,520
Everything will be fine.

207
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,230
Back then, when Yuan Yong

208
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,320
got drunk,

209
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,780
he would come home and hit my mom.

210
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,060
My mom always said,

211
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,620
"Family shame shouldn't be exposed."

212
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,550
She was afraid of the humiliation,

213
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,510
afraid that others would look down on us,

214
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,510
so she endured it.

215
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,800
I was too young at the time,

216
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,980
and there wasn't anything I could do.

217
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,710
The saddest part is that my mom

218
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,990
never had a single good day.

219
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,500
It's all in the past now.

220
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,470
Do you know

221
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,930
what my biggest regret is?

222
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:31,670
What?

223
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,950
I don't even know

224
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,020
where my mom is buried.

225
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,230
Every time I mentioned her, Yuan Yong would beat me.

226
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,910
This is the first time I've ever talked about it.

227
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,030
Did I scare you?

228
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,230
No,

229
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,150
I just don't know

230
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,340
how to comfort you.

231
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,560
What's there to comfort?

232
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,370
It's all in the past.

233
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,120
What's most important

234
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,660
to me now is Zi.

235
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,230
No matter what the cost,

236
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,760
I'm going to make sure she gets better.

237
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,820
Zi,

238
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,510
let's go home.

239
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,840
Let's go.

240
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,360
I'm really fine.

241
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,070
Take it slow, Mom.

242
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,950
Slow down, slow down.

243
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:35,750
Why didn't you

244
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,230
turn off the lights?

245
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,230
They've been on for so long—

246
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,310
-what a waste of electricity.
-I forgot.

247
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,640
-Why didn't you...
-I forgot.

248
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,280
Min, change your shoes.

249
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,570
-Change shoes.
-Okay.

250
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,840
The lights

251
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,870
have been on for days.

252
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,500
Think about how much that costs.

253
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,710
While I'm not home,

254
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,750
you've turned the house

255
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,150
into a mess.

256
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,910
How long has this food been left out?

257
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,350
And why isn't anything

258
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,550
cleaned up after meals?

259
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,480
Let me handle it.

260
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,580
Why didn't you clean it up?

261
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,470
Give it to me.

262
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,430
Can you take a rest?

263
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,550
You just got discharged.

264
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,150
Look at the house!

265
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,190
Dirty socks

266
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,430
thrown everywhere.

267
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,220
-Mom. Mom.
-Can you just

268
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,270
-put away...
-Mom.

269
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,070
Let me do it.

270
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:13,830
-Let me.
-Can't you…

271
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,720
-These things...
-Give them to me.

272
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,430
Help your mom

273
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,670
sit down.

274
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,270
-Give them to me.
-Just put the socks

275
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,150
and dirty clothes

276
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,190
in the washing machine.

277
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,040
Mom, sit down.

278
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:20,830
There's more.

279
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,870
There's another one.

280
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,830
Socks over there too!

281
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,430
-Let me handle it.
-Hurry up.

282
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,530
What happened to your foot, Li Si?

283
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,630
Nothing.

284
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,320
Be careful.

285
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,130
You too.

286
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,960
Are crutches necessary?

287
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,110
I thought if I made it look worse,

288
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,790
my mom would let me take the day off.

289
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,130
But even that didn't work out.

290
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,060
What should I do?

291
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,250
I guess I'm going to

292
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,590
school on crutches—

293
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,280
strong will despite the injury!

294
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,030
Didn't you try something

295
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,630
like this last time

296
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,010
and get nothing out of it?

297
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,170
Last time?

298
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,600
Which time?

299
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,960
Don't mention it.
Oh my!

300
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,430
Okay, okay.

301
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,590
You've always been resilient.

302
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,430
Impressive.

303
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,270
I have to say,

304
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,350
you're the best.

305
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,690
You even came to pick me up.

306
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,300
Of course.

307
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,990
Can you carry my backpack for me?

308
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,390
Are your arms broken too?

309
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,450
No.

310
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,470
You can carry it yourself.

311
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:11,910
Just letting you know,

312
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,550
I'm leaving

313
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,350
as soon as class begins.

314
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,750
No one's waiting for you.

315
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
Alright, Si,

316
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,030
let's see if you can run.

317
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,010
Take big steps, come on!

318
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,970
Take bigger steps.

319
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,150
Come on.

320
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,320
Okay.

321
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,340
Come on, run!

322
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,660
Great job!

323
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,830
This was written by Yuan Shanqing?

324
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,520
Yes.

325
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,070
Her writing skills are impressive!

326
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,310
I never thought

327
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,590
she had such talent.

328
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,750
I was always worried

329
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,630
that this kid would be affected emotionally.

330
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,510
But lately,

331
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,310
I've noticed a change in her.

332
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,950
She's more confident now

333
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:04,910
and even took the initiative

334
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,030
to participate in the poetry contest.

335
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,430
And her classmates

336
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,080
aren't targeting her as much anymore.

337
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,340
There's finally some peace in our class.

338
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,760
I think we've done a pretty good job this time.

339
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,870
Yuan Shanqing.

340
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,950
We're not the ones

341
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,990
who helped her.

342
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,620
I don't have a problem with him.

343
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,410
I was just worried it would affect the class.

344
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,820
Can't we at least give him a chance?

345
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,860
We're all in the same class, after all.

346
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,580
Right.

347
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,590
We're teaching him Mandarin.

348
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,570
But you two

349
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,130
have been arguing with me

350
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:34,910
about him

351
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,990
for so long,

352
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,240
and he hasn't even spoken up yet.

353
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,040
Qiang Xiaowa,

354
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,470
come on, tell the class monitor what you think.

355
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,530
Do you have the confidence

356
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,660
for this poetry reading competition?

357
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,830
It's just a poetry reading competition.

358
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,090
Why are we making such a big deal out of it?

359
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,060
Come on, say it.

360
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,260
Qiang Xiaowa, think carefully.

361
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,640
This is a group competition,

362
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,750
and if you participate,

363
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,680
you better not drag the class down.

364
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,100
I won't drag anyone down.

365
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,080
Did you hear that?

366
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,350
Look at his Mandarin—

367
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,400
there's an improvement, right?

368
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,350
Everyone says a line,

369
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,580
no problem at all.

370
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,440
Are you the one to decide?

371
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,750
I'm telling you,

372
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,250
if he messes this up,

373
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,070
it's not just

374
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,670
your reputation on the line.

375
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,620
Wa.

376
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,610
People can live here?

377
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,030
It's already much better now.

378
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,540
When I was a kid, we didn't even have electricity.

379
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,710
This is my first time

380
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,940
on this side of the bridge.

381
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,610
It's completely different from where we're from.

382
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,470
I think this place

383
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,950
is better than ours.

384
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,550
Look at the air,

385
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,160
the sea breeze—

386
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,470
it's refreshing!

387
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,490
Hu, quick, take a picture for me.

388
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,320
Okay.

389
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:02,990
Move a little this way

390
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,390
so I can get the sunset

391
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,920
-right in the photo.
-Here?

392
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,220
Move a bit more.

393
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,790
Here?

394
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,160
A little bit more this way.

395
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,690
Perfect with the sunlight.

396
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,089
Be careful.

397
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
The water's deep.

398
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,160
This picture's going to look amazing

399
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,360
once it's developed—

400
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,380
hero saving the beauty at sunset!

401
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,460
-What are you doing?
-Let's take another photo.

402
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,170
Are we here for photos?

403
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,550
Aren't we here to practice Mandarin?

404
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,260
Repeat after me.

405
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,840
The Song of Youth!

406
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,130
The sung of youth.

407
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,180
The sung of youth.

408
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,960
The sung of youth?

409
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,670
Sung?

410
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,830
The sung of youth.

411
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,210
The sung of youth?

412
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,650
You were once a seed.

413
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,000
You were once a seed.

414
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,780
Buried in the soil.

415
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,600
Buried in the soil.

416
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,890
Waiting quietly to sprout.

417
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,560
-Whiting...
-Waiting.

418
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,910
-Whiting...
-Waiting!

419
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,310
Waiting!

420
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,920
Waiting!

421
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,590
We're actually quite lucky.

422
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,490
First,

423
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,140
we've ruled out

424
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,700
any intellectual disabilities for Zi.

425
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,150
Now, we've also ruled out

426
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,540
congenital deafness.

427
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,880
We've confirmed that

428
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,970
she has sensorineural hearing loss.

429
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,930
Does that mean

430
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,470
Zi will be

431
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,550
deaf and mute from now on?

432
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,830
No, that won't happen.

433
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,360
We can install a small device

434
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,630
in Zi's ear,

435
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,150
and she'll be able to hear

436
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,570
like a normal person.

437
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,200
What kind of device?

438
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,440
It's called a cochlear implant.

439
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,960
This cochlear implant

440
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,810
works by

441
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,710
implanting Zi

442
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,540
an electrode system

443
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,130
that stimulates her auditory nerve,

444
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,530
thereby restoring her hearing.

445
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,880
There have already been

446
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,180
successful cases of this

447
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,270
in our country.

448
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,160
Dinner's ready.

449
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:25,660
Thank you.

450
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,130
Everything's fresh,

451
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,050
just caught today.

452
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,350
What about Grandpa? Should we wait for him?

453
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,070
Grandpa's busy.

454
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,630
No need to wait.

455
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,370
You can start eating.

456
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,010
Alright,

457
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,230
let's see how fresh it is.

458
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,620
Delicious.

459
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,790
Delicious.

460
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,850
Tastes better than my mom's cooking!

461
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,800
Xiaowa,

462
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,160
can I ask you something?

463
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,590
When I leave,

464
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,520
could you pack me

465
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,710
some dried fish to take home?

466
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,040
I want my mom to try some.

467
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,210
Sure!

468
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,160
I'll pack some for each of you

469
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,350
to take back later.

470
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,740
Thank you.

471
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,570
Xiaowa,

472
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,760
do people here

473
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,030
only eat this stuff?

474
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,550
What are you saying?

475
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,350
It's not like we don't have rice.

476
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:06,990
We have rice,

477
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,310
but it's not as abundant as it is for you.

478
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,310
After all, we live in a fishing village,

479
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,310
and most people here

480
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,110
don't have a stable income.

481
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,420
So how do you all

482
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,910
survive?

483
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,700
We live off the sea—

484
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,900
selling seafood.

485
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,740
But if there's a storm

486
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,230
and we can't fish,

487
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,830
we don't make a single penny.

488
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,920
Oh my god, that's so unpredictable.

489
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,590
Where do kids here

490
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,950
go to school?

491
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,230
School? We haven't had

492
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,440
a school here in ages.

493
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,510
I had to go to the town

494
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,310
to study.

495
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,750
I'm the only one left from here

496
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,550
still in school.

497
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,940
What about the other kids?

498
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,030
The boys

499
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,610
go out to sea to fish.

500
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,680
Some have gone off to find work elsewhere.

501
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,790
That's so unfortunate.

502
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,470
I used to

503
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,160
be envious of people

504
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,830
born in big cities.

505
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,820
I thought our oilfield base

506
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,110
didn't even have a decent shopping mall.

507
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,830
But seeing how they live,

508
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,680
I realize just

509
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,670
how lucky we are.

510
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:19,900
I still want to

511
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,630
see the world outside, though.

512
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,760
Then study hard.

513
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,980
With the grades you're getting now,

514
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,780
where do you think you'll end up?

515
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,630
Do you think

516
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,310
we've inherited

517
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,570
different kinds of genes?

518
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,120
How come your grades are so good,

519
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,560
and mine are always failing?

520
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,910
One word: lazy.

521
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,200
If you're lazy, don't blame it on genetics!

522
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,200
Start by not being lazy

523
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,070
when you're dumping out the foot-washing water!

524
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,230
I'm talking about studying,

525
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,820
and you're talking about foot-washing water?

526
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,180
Cheng Yaya, dump it yourself.

527
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,330
I'm not doing it.

528
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,690
The outside world is wonderful.

529
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,310
I'll stay here

530
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,220
and sincerely wish you the best.

531
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,310
Zi,

532
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,350
we'll be able to

533
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,230
hear soon.

534
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,540
Let's work hard together, okay?

535
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,530
Courage is a precious asset.

536
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,440
[Class 2, Grade 11]

537
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,180
Courage is a pricious...

538
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,060
Precious.

539
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:49,710
Precious asset.

540
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:55,190
Let us sail forward with courage.

541
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:01,310
Let us sail forward with courage.

542
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,310
To never fail our dreams.

543
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,690
To never fail our dreams.

544
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,050
This is the best form of youth.

545
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:18,500
This is the best form of youth.

546
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:19,870
Applause.

547
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,990
I'll wipe the top later;

548
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,880
this windowsill is a bit high. I'm afraid you might—

549
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,670
Luo Zheng,

550
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,990
can I use your water?

551
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,880
Are they talking now?

552
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,340
Thank you.

553
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,750
What's going on with you two?

554
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,810
Have you made peace?

555
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,010
We didn't make peace.

556
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,160
She just washed a cloth.

557
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,990
Go back to work.

558
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,620
Alright.

559
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,620
Don't peek.

560
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,870
No, I...

561
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,150
I can't figure out

562
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,210
this problem. It's so hard.

563
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,150
Can you help me?

564
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:55,730
Which one?

565
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:56,680
This one.

566
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,630
Wait.

567
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,550
I think your previous solution

568
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,300
was wrong.

569
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,540
Here, I redid it.

570
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,510
Doesn't this make more sense?

571
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,510
Aren't you explaining it?

572
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,160
You've been working for a while—

573
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,960
take a break, kids.

574
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,020
Take a break, kids.

575
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,470
-Thank you, Grandpa.
-Have some dried fish.

576
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,670
Have some dried fish.

577
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,250
Girl, why don't you eat?

578
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,190
Grandpa, I'll eat later.

579
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:22,830
Grandpa.

580
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,940
Don't worry about her.

581
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,280
She's too focused on her studies to eat.

582
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,860
I'll eat enough for everyone.

583
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,780
Okay.

584
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,470
Eat more then.

585
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,440
I'm happy you're here.

586
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,000
We don't have much,

587
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,620
but if you like the dried fish,

588
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,820
there's plenty more.

589
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,710
Plenty.

590
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,030
Oh right,

591
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,490
I'm making fish porridge.

592
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:42,900
Kids,

593
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,820
we'll have pancakes today!

594
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,790
-Okay.
-Grandpa, you don't need to fuss.

595
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,410
We'll need to go back after we finish these problems,

596
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,230
or we'll get scolded if we're too late.

597
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:50,980
No, no,

598
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:51,950
stay and eat

599
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,800
before you go.

600
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,030
Eat before you leave.

601
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,150
Have some.

602
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,170
It's really good.

603
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,290
Babao. I'll teach you.

604
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,830
One for you and one for me.

605
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,830
Do your homework.

606
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,130
Yours is more detailed than mine.

607
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,550
You...

608
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,070
Why do you keep bringing

609
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,890
these things home all the time?

610
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,410
Qiang Xiaowa's place.

611
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,730
We often go there.

612
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,910
His grandpa always

613
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,790
gives us these delicious things.

614
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,750
Don't just take their stuff.

615
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,450
Next time, if they need anything,

616
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,680
give them something from our place in return.

617
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,080
What do we have to give?

618
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,090
Dad,

619
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,930
can we give them some medicinal patches

620
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,930
for his grandpa's leg and back pain?

621
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,870
Sure,

622
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,480
some medicine as well.

623
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,720
It's hard for them to get medicine over there.

624
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,360
Dad.

625
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,510
What about...

626
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,230
Try this.

627
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,020
What's this?

628
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,710
Dried fish.

629
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,990
It's sweet. Is it good?

630
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,830
Yes.

631
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,960
Dad, how's the information

632
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,570
about the cochlear implant coming along?

633
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,900
My comrades and I have sent out letters.

634
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,830
We're just waiting for a response.

635
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:00,840
Great.

636
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:02,750
My comrade

637
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,230
mentioned a girl

638
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,550
with a similar condition

639
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,670
to Zi,

640
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,230
and her surgery was very successful.

641
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:09,830
So,

642
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,030
Zi's surgery

643
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,190
should go smoothly too.

644
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,300
That's amazing!

645
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,540
-Great!
-This silly kid.

646
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,110
Uncle Cheng.

647
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,640
Where is this hospital?

648
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,530
In Beijing.

649
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,310
My comrade

650
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,640
is reaching out to them.

651
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,800
How much

652
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,300
will the surgery cost?

653
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,470
Dad, just tell us directly.

654
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,800
It'll probably cost around 100,000 yuan.

655
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,230
100,000?

656
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:34,950
Yes,

657
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,760
but given Zi's situation,

658
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,900
we can apply for special financial aid

659
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,850
from the Children's Foundation.

660
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:41,590
If that's approved,

661
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,310
we would only need to

662
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,540
cover about 50,000 yuan ourselves.

663
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,110
50,000...

664
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,040
Honestly, I've never really resigned myself to fate.

665
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,070
I always believed that

666
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,560
as long as I didn't give up,

667
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,220
I could push through anything.

668
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,930
But tell me—

669
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:09,930
does heaven

670
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,630
have it out for me or something?

671
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,720
No matter how hard I try,

672
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,570
it seems like bad things keep happening.

673
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,350
My grandma used to pray to Guanyin a lot.

674
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,560
She'd chant prayers every day,

675
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,020
asking heaven to bless us.

676
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,700
So, when I was little,

677
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,530
I thought she was so superstitious,

678
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,260
always messing around with deities and spirits.

679
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,230
I wanted her

680
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,480
to give it up

681
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,720
and believe in science instead.

682
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,900
But later,

683
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,900
when I grew up,

684
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,730
I asked her one day,

685
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,980
"Grandma,

686
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,870
where is heaven anyway?

687
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,230
What can it really protect us from?"

688
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,730
You know what she said?

689
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,260
She said, "Silly child,

690
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,470
you've been going to school so long it's made you dumb.

691
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,800
There is no heaven.

692
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,960
I just give myself something to hold onto.

693
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,070
I believe that

694
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,700
as long as I think someone up there is protecting us,

695
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,160
it keeps my spirit strong.

696
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:13,790
You see,

697
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,390
everyone faces tough times.

698
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,070
Sometimes even drinking water

699
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,400
feels like a struggle.

700
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:19,930
But

701
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,360
you can't let that struggle

702
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,240
defeat you.

703
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,120
Having something to believe in

704
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,000
gives you the strength to think

705
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,970
that this trouble can be solved,

706
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,650
and things will get better."

707
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,550
Wow, so many mistakes!

708
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,460
-Who?
-Zhong Ruitao.

709
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:37,970
Director.

710
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:38,830
Are you eating?

711
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,720
Director Xiao.

712
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,130
Hello, Director Xiao.

713
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,040
Director.

714
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,020
This is mine.

715
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,570
Ms. Han, thank you.

716
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,800
Okay.

717
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,320
Director Xiao,

718
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,140
your current image

719
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,340
[Donation Box]

720
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,670
has reached new heights in my eyes.

721
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,670
I'm not that great.

722
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,780
It's more about having the right mindset.

723
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,880
Absolutely! Absolutely!

724
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,570
Director Xiao.

725
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,330
Mine.

726
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,330
Okay.

727
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,000
Thank you.

728
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,990
Zheng Weiwei, five yuan.

729
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,310
Thank you.

730
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,680
Wu Ziyi, 2.3 yuan.

731
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:06,870
Thanks.

732
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,870
Wang Fuqiang, 15.

733
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,390
Cheng.

734
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,070
This is all I've got left for the month.

735
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,670
It's okay.

736
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,200
Thank you.

737
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,550
Zhong Ruitao, 20.

738
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:19,780
Thank you.

739
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,020
Li Jun, ten yuan.

740
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,080
Five yuan.

741
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:24,710
Thank you.

742
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,970
Guo Xiao, five yuan.

743
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,790
What are you looking at?

744
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,110
Do you think it's too little?

745
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,120
No.

746
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:38,910
Thank you.

747
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:44,990
Will the surgery

748
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,520
make her able to hear again?

749
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,350
Yes.

750
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:48,880
That's good.

751
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,830
This donation

752
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,430
is not only for one person,

753
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,080
not just for Yuan Shanqing,

754
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,180
but for the cohesion

755
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,420
of our entire group.

756
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,910
Here,

757
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,110
as the Director of Teaching,

758
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,350
I, Xiao Fang,

759
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,790
make a promise to everyone:

760
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,390
As long as you are

761
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,190
a part of Linqi No. 2 High School,

762
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,030
no matter who faces difficulties,

763
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,580
our school will

764
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,110
always lend a helping hand,

765

without hesitation.

766
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,580
Can everyone commit to this?

767
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,090
-Yes!
-Yes!

768
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,860
There is true kindness in the world.

769
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,590
There is true love in the world.

770
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,350
Thousands of small families

771
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,240
unite to form

772
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,100
the big family of Linqi Oilfield.

773
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,640
When one person faces hardship, help comes from all directions.

774
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,080
This is the promise Linqi Oilfield makes

775
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,030
to all its people.

776
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,000
We call on everyone

777

and do what you can

779
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,900
to support Yuan Shanqing.

780
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,130
Dear teachers

[Letter of thanks]

782
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,280
and fellow students,

783
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
Hello, everyone.

784
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,020
I am Yuan Shanqing from Class 1, Grade 10.

785
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,920
In the past few days,

786
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,910
I've received donations and encouragement

787
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,110
from the teachers, students, and people of the oilfield.

788
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,680
I am incredibly touched by your kindness.

789
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,210
Thank you for every penny

790
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,720
you've donated

791
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,150
and every word of comfort

792
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,600
you've shared for my sister, Yuan Shanzi.

793
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,220
Both Shanzi and I

794
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,690
will always remember

795
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,280
your kindness

796
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,410
and the love you've shown us.

797
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,490
I promise to work twice as hard,

798
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,000
and one day,

799
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,620
I will repay Linqi Oilfield

800
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,480
and our school.

801
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,820
Once again, I express my deepest gratitude

802
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,440
to each and every one of you.

803
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,500
Thank you for your kindness,

804
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,330
and I wish you all good health

805
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,540
and happiness.

806
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,699
Yuan Shanqing.

807
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,800
Now, I have an announcement to make.

808
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,750
For this poetry reading contest,

809
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,810
one student's poem

810
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,710
stood out to me

811
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,100
as exceptionally well-written.

812
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,139
So I've decided

813
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,880
to use this student's poem

814
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:32,080
as our class's entry,

815
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,770
and this student will lead the recitation.

816
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,040
Let's quiet down for a moment.

817
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,510
I'm sure you're all curious

818
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,750
about who it is, right?

819
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,670
Yes.

820
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:46,600
Yuan Shanqing.

821
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,300
Congratulations.

00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,740
[Linqi No. 2 High School Red October Poetry Reading Contest]

823
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:12,680
Adjust the angle.

824
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,500
Hey, students over there.

825
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,750
Move forward, move forward.

826
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,540
The one in the middle.

827
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,140
Move forward. Move forward.

828
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,680
That sign needs to be aligned as well.

829
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,210
Smooth out the tablecloth.

830
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,740
Adjust the lighting over there.

831
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,630
Don't flinch. Don't be nervous.

832
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,070
You look so great like this!

833
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,250
Teacher, give him a bit more makeup.

834
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:30,970
Okay.

835
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,240
This color is better.

836
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,900
Enough. Enough.

837
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,430
Alright.

838
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,590
Next one.

839

Here.

840
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,710
Great.

841
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,780
Next.

842
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,770
Lipstick.

843
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,350
Don't be nervous.

844
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:47,870
Here.

845
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,080
My face was stung...

846
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,290
This color is so beautiful.

847
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,720
This is good.

848
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,300
Teacher, easy, easy.

849
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,370
Here.

850

-Line up in the back.
-Next one.

T-teacher,

852
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,960
I-I want to try something.

853
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,840
The Eye of Soul.

854
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,060
What is the Eye of Soul?

855
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,870
Give it to me.

856
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,050
Good.

857
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,740
-Your turn.
-Do I look good?

858
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,600
What about you?

859
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,670
Well...

860
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,620
Don't hide.

861
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,290
Qiang Xiaowa,

862
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,310
everyone has to wear makeup.

863
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,630
Why are you trying to hide?

864
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,150
Come on,

865
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,610
come on, don't be shy.

866
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,910
-Well.
-Come on.

867
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,350
When we were kids,

868
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,470
I understood why we painted red cheeks for Children's Day.

869
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,940
But why are we still doing it now?

870
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,650
Done.

871
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,000
I look the best.

873
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,360

The Song of Youth.

880
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,250
You were once a seed

881
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,190
buried in the soil,

882
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,150
1uietly waiting to sprout.

Hello, Ms. Han.

887

Don't be nervous.

888
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,380
Just look it over a few more times.

889
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,550
Lead the reading well, good luck!

890
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,840
Youth is like a song,

891
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,680
resonating in our hearts.

892
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,770
Youth is like a poem,

893
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,140
full of passion,

894
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,450
and words overflowing with energy.

895
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,930
The flowing notes

896
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,950
etch the light of life

897
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:04,030
on the walls of time

898
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:08,320
with an unfeeling brushstroke.

899
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,660
Dreams stir within us.

900
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,520
Courage is a precious asset.

901
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,200
Let us sail forward with courage,

902
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,820
for only by staying true to our ideals

903
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,490
can we truly embody the best of youth.

904
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:28,200
Let us spread the wings of our youth,

905
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,760
and rise with the wind.

906
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,020
Good.

907
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,750
Guys, hurry up.

908
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,310
Did I do alright just now?

909
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:49,940
Yes!

910
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,510
Thank you.

911
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:03,870
Why hasn't your brother's class

912
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:04,630
gone on yet?

913
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,420
They are here.

914
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,520
-Now, please enjoy
-Get ready to applaud.

915
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,560
the poetry reading

916
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,870
by Class 1, Grade 10:

917
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:10,770
The Seabird,

918
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,370
led by Yuan Shanqing.

919
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,680
Wait,

920
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,390
why don't they have red cheeks?

921
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,190
Shh, don't talk, it's starting.

922
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,800
So what if they don't?

923
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:39,730
The Seabird.

924
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,280
Migration

925
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,510
is the destiny of the Arctic Tern.

926
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,100
When winter arrives,

927
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,340
they begin their long journey,

928
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,360
skimming over waves,

929
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,970
crossing the equator,

930
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,890
and flying southward,

931
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,970
from the northern hemisphere

932
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:59,300
to the warmth of the southern hemisphere.

933
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,890
Every migration

934
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,470
is an 18,000-kilometer journey.

935
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,910
Every journey

936
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,710
is the fiery passage from winter to summer.

937
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,730
Every fiery passage

938
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:15,040
is the greatness of a small life that never stops.

939
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,830
Our lives

940
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,980
have never been calm waters.
Passing through thorns.

941
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,720
The young cross mountains and seas,

942
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,400
passing through thorns.

943
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,950
Along the way, they plant flowers.

944
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,380
They clear stones on the mountainsides.

945
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,990
They raise sails in rushing rivers.

946
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,660
They no longer look back in the mud.

947
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,450
Do you remember

948
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:43,560
those youngsters who clenched their fists and said,

949
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,930
"When I grow up,

950
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,920
I will forge ahead,

951
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,060
like the first seabird,

952
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,230
spreading my trembling wings."

953
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,850
The seabirds gather in the south.

954
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,760
We will finally reunite

955
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:58,340
in a sea of flowers in the high mountains.

956
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,060
The spring breeze, oblivious to its own charm,

957
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,720
stirs the hearts of the young.

958
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,590
Summer generously extends the day,

959
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,640
warming the love of the seabird.

960
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,330
A seabird is still a seabird,

961
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,150
unafraid of thunder and rain,

962
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,550
undeterred by distance.

963
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,120
A youth is still a youth,

964
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:19,140
like wild grass in the wasteland,

965
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,870
the midsummer in their hearts cannot be cut down.

966
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,120
Oh, wind and rain,

967
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,390
please be kind to every

968
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,860
flying seabird.

969
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,550
Oh, youth,

970
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,790
please be kind to those young and bold days.

971
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,250
May you soar freely,

972
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,760
brave and free like the seabird.

973
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,210
You shout.

974
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:49,380
Sit down.

975
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:52,770
Okay.

976
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:56,120
Bravo! Bravo!

977
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,880
I will now announce the results of the competition.

978
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,160
First prize in the Linqi Second High School's

979
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,360
Red October Poetry Reading Competition goes to…

980
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,270
Class 1, Grade 10,

981
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,360
for "The Seabird."

982
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,070
Back then, when we were young,

983
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,870
we always shouted slogans,

984
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,690
filled with ideals,

985
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,120
yearning to fly free.

986
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,840
We wanted to break through

987
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,280
all the obstacles

988
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,750
and dreamed of the world beyond.

989
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,200
But I forgot

990
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,110
that this small base was home.

991
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,470
At 17, we thought

992
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:43,220
we were already grown up,

993
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,140
mature,

994
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:45,890
that we understood love,

995
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,920
understood the future,

996
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,250
understood the migration of the seabird.

997
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,540
Later,

998
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,620
I really did see many,

999
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,840
many seabirds flying across the ocean.

1000
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,980
But at that moment,

1001
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,880
what I missed most was

1002
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,710
that day,

1003
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,480
when everyone had their faces painted red,

1004
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,440
like actors in a play.
