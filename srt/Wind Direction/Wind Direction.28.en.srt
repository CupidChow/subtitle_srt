1
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,970
My mom's name is Gao Xiaojuan.

2
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,039
This is the only photo

3
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,200
she took

4
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,150
and the only thing

5
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,200
she left to me.

6
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,479
You smile like your mother.

7
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,980
I was clingy to my mom when I was young.

8
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,000
When she was around,

9
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,080
it was

10
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,680
the happiest time of my life.

11
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,710
Our family was poor when I was young,

12
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,280
but no matter how poor we were,

13
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,280
she would save money to buy me candy.

14
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,910
In the winter, when there was no heating at home,

15
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,280
she would use her body

16
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,710
to warm up the bed

17
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,240
and place my hands and feet

18
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,430
on her belly.

19
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,630
When she was around,

20
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,840
I never suffered a beating

21
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,910
from Yuan Yong.

22
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,910
She would always shield me

23
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,870
with her body,

24
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,820
then, covered in bruises, she'd tell me,

25
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,579
"It doesn't hurt."

26
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,870
She was truly the kindest person

27
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,870
I've ever known.

28
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,430
I wish she were still here.

29
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,120
Shanqing.

30
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,800
It's all in the past.

31
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,630
Your mom surely wants us

32
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,030
to live well.

33
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm certain that's what she would have wanted.

34
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,390
I believe things will get better

35
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,710
from here.

36
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,680
I have seen on TV,

37
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,120
that you can visit her

38
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,910
and talk through the glass on the phone.

39
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,750
Do you even have any common sense?

40
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,470
Right now, she's in a detention center.

41
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,030
You can't visit anyone in a detention center.

42
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,840
You have to wait until they're sentenced

43
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,370
and sent to prison before visits are allowed.

44
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,840
Yaya, that's not what I meant.

45
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,240
I just want to explain to Li Si.

46
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,840
Shanqing was just fighting against bad people.

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,970
She won't go to jail.

48
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,520
Yes, the law is strict now.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,080
The police will find out the truth.

50
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,140
They won't wrong an innocent person.

51
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,080
When my brother was working before,

52
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,010
one of his bosses was also taken in.

53
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,190
But after everything was cleared up,

54
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,250
they released him.

55
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,560
Don't worry.

56
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,640
It'll be fine.

57
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,420
Right now, only the lawyer can visit.

58
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,040
My dad has gone to find a lawyer,

59
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,270
but we still don't know

60
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,680
what's going on.

61
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,830
So don't think about

62
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,720
things that haven't happened yet.

63
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
Shanqing

64
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,000
will come back safely.

65
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,850
I'm glad Zi is still young.

66
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,600
She doesn't know anything.

67
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,120
When she grows up

68
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,720
and learns about all of this,

69
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,820
she'll be so heartbroken.

70
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,850
How will she face it?

71
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,240
Shanqing said

72
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,159
not to let Zi know.

73
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,960
But that would mean leaving the Oilfield.

74
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,780
No matter what,

75
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,920
I hope Zi

76
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,780
never finds out about any of this.

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,600
We found this knife at the scene.

78
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,560
After forensic examination,

79
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,070
the fingerprints of three people were found on it.

80
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,000
They are Yuan Yong,

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,660
Yuan Shanqing and Cheng Yaya.

82
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,750
As for the bloodstains on the ground,

83
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,390
after DNA comparison

84
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,390
by the Provincial Criminal Investigation Department,

85
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,270
they belong to Yuan Yong and Cheng Yaya.

86
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,600
Yuan Yong was stabbed five times in total,

87
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,720
once in the back of the left shoulder,

88
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,950
once in the left upper abdomen, and three times in the chest.

89
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,830
According to Yuan Shanqing's testimony,

90
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,080
she first stabbed Yuan Yong

91
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,360
from behind,

92
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,630
but forensic examination

93
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,270
showed that this stab did not damage any organs.

94
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,390
The stab to the left upper abdomen

95
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,750
was the fatal wound,

96
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,680
as it caused the spleen to rupture.

97
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,240
However, at the time,

98
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,430
Yuan Yong had his hands around her neck,

99
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,390
and her actions were purely a reflexive response.

100
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,510
I believe

101
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,070
this falls under the category of self-defense.

102
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,680
However, those three additional stabs

103
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,600
came after Yuan Yong

104
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,000
had already been restrained by Cheng Yaya,

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,360
losing his ability to resist.

106
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,950
Yuan Shanqing then came over and stabbed three more times.

107
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,950
This was due to

108
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,950
the provocation of Yuan Yong's threats,

109
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,750
which caused Yuan Shanqing to lose emotional control.

110
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,830
Alright, let's set aside

111
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,430
the emotional factors for now.

112
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,040
Based on the current information,

113
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,000
Yuan Shanqing had the motive to kill

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,510
and carried out actions

115
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,390
that directly resulted in

116
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,360
Yuan Yong's death.

117
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,240
This can be determined

118
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,770
as a suspected case of intentional homicide.

119
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,260
Chief Wang.

120
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,560
Look.

121
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,120
According to the autopsy report,

122
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,000
the cause of death

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,240
was a ruptured spleen

124
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,240
caused by a stab.

125
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,310
This was the result of

126
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,560
Yuan Shanqing's second stab

127
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,000
during her act of self-defense.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,510
As for the three additional stabs

129
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,120
she delivered in her emotional outburst,

130
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,430
all of them struck the sternum.

131
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
This means that

132
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,630
even if Yuan Shanqing

133
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,240
had not delivered those three stabs,

134
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,150
Yuan Yong's death

135
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,190
would not have

136
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,720
been significantly affected.

137
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
What do you think?

138
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,190
So it can still be considered

139
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,450
self-defense, right?

140
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,430
Well, the final determination

141
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,510
will depend on the review results

142
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,909
from the Procuratorate.

143
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,720
Let's not form any biases.

144
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,630
I believe

145
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,560
the law will give Yuan Shanqing

146
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,270
a fair and objective outcome.

147
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,790
Okay, let's end the meeting.

148
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,510
Coming.

149
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,240
Coming.

150
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,950
Coming.

151
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,120
Pengfei, why would you

152
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,390
hide such a big thing from me?

153
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,600
Well, I thought

154
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,430
if I told you,

155
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,510
it would only make you upset,

156
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,390
and there's nothing you could do about it.

157
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,240
What's wrong with you?

158
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,800
Don't look at me. I'm fine.

159
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Here is the situation.

160
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,680
Yaya,

161
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,190
although injured,

162
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,630
doesn't have any serious issues.

163
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,680
He just needs to rest and recover.

164
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,920
But as for Yuan Shanqing,

165
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,320
the police took her away.

166
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,870
Why?

167
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,270
She was suspected of intentional homicide.

168
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,430
Are you kidding me?

169
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,920
She's such a good kid.

170
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,270
How could she be accused of intentional murder?

171
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,270
Besides, she only killed Yuan Yong.

172
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,040
Isn't that a form of justice?

173
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,600
Well,

174
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,310
how the law defines it

175
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,800
isn't up to us.

176
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,480
Right.

177
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,120
Most importantly,

178
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,720
the kid is still in custody

179
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,450
and no one is allowed to see her.

180
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,420
The detention center?

181
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,830
I have a friend

182
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,350
who's a very good lawyer.

183
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,830
I'll get in touch with him for help.

184
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,960
I'm calling him now.

185
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,430
I'll get you some water.

186
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,280
Put on some tea, it tastes bland.

187
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,120
Mr. Jin.

188
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,750
Hello, this is

189
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,240
Dahai from the Oilfield.

190
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
What malva nut?

191
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,270
Li Dahai from the No. 2 Factory.

192
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,350
Is she asleep?

193
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,480
Let's buy a small bed for her

194
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,960
in the next couple of days.

195
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,440
I'm always worried about

196
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,270
accidentally pressing on her while sleeping at night.

197
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay.

198
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,000
It seems like

199
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,730
we're back to when Miaomiao and Yaya were little.

200
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,000
Mom.

201
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,790
Does Zi need to sleep with me?

202
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,390
I'll set up the bed

203
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,240
below.

204
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,320
Once you touch the pillow, you sleep so soundly

205
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,790
that I can't wake you up at all.

206
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,030
What if this kid

207
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,240
needs to pee

208
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,080
or something?

209
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,960
Do you think taking care of a child is that easy?

210
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,840
You just go to sleep.

211
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,840
You still have classes during the day.

212
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,100
That's right. You can't take care of her.

213
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,320
Dad.

214
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,550
Will Yuan Shanqing

215
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,000
really go to jail?

216
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,870
We're neither police

217
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,480
nor judges.

218
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,080
What will happen to Yuan Shanqing

219
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,560
is uncertain,

220
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,420
and we can't control the outcome.

221
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,550
So that means

222
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,390
she's very likely to go to jail,

223
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,120
right?

224
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,240
Stop talking about this here.

225
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,270
What if Yaya hears it?

226
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,360
I know.

227
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,390
I just came over to ask quietly.

228
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,550
If Yuan Shanqing really goes to jail,

229
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,390
will you

230
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,360
let Zi stay here?

231
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,870
Tell her.

232
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,510
This...

233
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,080
This can't change.

234
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,630
Before Shanqing left,

235
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,200
I promised her.

236
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,800
As an adult,

237
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,200
I can't go back on my word

238
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,440
like a child,

239
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,270
right?

240
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,670
Anyway, if anything happens to Shanqing,

241
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,280
Zi will stay with us.

242
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,910
Mom,

243
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,320
you are really a good person.

244
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,840
What good person?

245
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,270
I'm just an ordinary person.

246
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,550
If this situation doesn't happen, then it's fine,

247
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,910
but if it does, I can't just push it away.

248
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,040
The child hasn't done anything wrong.

249
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,910
I know you and Yaya

250
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,630
are really concerned about this.

251
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,750
Your mom and I

252
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,370
have already discussed it.

253
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,120
What your mom just said is right.

254
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,670
No matter how many mistakes there are,

255
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,910
Zi isn't at fault.

256
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,550
She shouldn't have to bear these burdens.

257
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,960
But we agreed that

258
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,670
all these complicated matters

259
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,840
should not be known to Zi.

260
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,240
We want Zi to grow up well

261
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,030
in our home.

262
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,550
Yaya and I are so blissful.

263
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,670
How could we have

264
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,530
such wonderful parents like you?

265
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,360
Mom.

266
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,360
Mom, from now on,

267
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,600
I won't say anything bad about you anymore.

268
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,000
You're an angel, a great angel.

269
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,320
When I scold you,

270
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,960
I become a demon again.

271
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,480
Alright.

272
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,940
Let's not talk about this.

273
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,030
Let's take good care of Zi

274
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,690
so that Yaya will feel better.

275
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,030
By this time next year,

276
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,720
this banner

277
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,200
will be hung for us.

278
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,510
So if we think about it,

279
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,790
aren't we just counting down

280
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,030
for about 300 days?

281
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,480
What's the point of hanging this thing?

282
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,360
It's a jinx.

283
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,630
Excuse me.

284
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,760
May I use this stool?

285
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,720
Thank you.

286
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,790
This is hung for the 12th grade.

287
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,080
What are you pulling this down for?

288
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,960
I don't believe any 12th-grade

289
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,360
would be happy to see this.

290
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,270
The pressure is already so high.

291
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,910
Hanging this thing is really annoying.

292
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,550
Li Si.

293
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,750
This is not a small matter,

294
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,280
nor is it accidental.

295
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,510
This is the result of your class

296
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,270
being consistently so lax

297
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,790
and unmotivated.

298
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,510
You guys

299
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,510
are truly the worst ones...

300
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,720
You've ever taught.

301
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:36,960
No,

302
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,420
you're the most disappointing ones.

303
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,960
In other classes, it's just one bad apple,

304
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,720
but in your class,

305
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,650
it's like a whole pot of bad apples.

306
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,510
Li Si, tell me.

307
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,310
Why did you pull down the banner?

308
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,630
I think it's a jinx.

309
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,080
What? A jinx?

310
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,030
Why is it a jinx?

311
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,560
Stand up and tell everyone.

312
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,520
I feel like that thing

313
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,270
isn't counting down

314
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,440
to the exam

315
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,030
but counting down to

316
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,630
when we'll have to part ways.

317
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,960
Wait, who can stay with you

318
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,870
forever?

319
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,910
Even if your parents get married,

320
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,480
they can't take you with them forever.

321
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,200
Why can't they take me with them forever?

322
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,630
Don't you grow up?

323
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,720
You're already 18

324
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,030
and still thinking about living off others

325
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,080
and having fun.

326
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,150
Do you all think the No. 2 High School

327
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,440
will always protect you,

328
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,630
and that your parents will always support you?

329
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,430
Is that right?

330
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,010
What about your ideals? Your ambitions?

331
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,690
Youths should aim for great heights.

332
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,270
You are going to take the college entrance exam.

333
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,120
In another year,

334
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,320
you'll be facing

335
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,120
your first battlefield in life.

336
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,000
What is the college entrance exam?

337
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,800
It's a watershed moment in life.

338
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,000
Time is tight, and the tasks are heavy.

339
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,840
If you don't have a plan now,

340
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,120
you'll face defeat.

341
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,510
I have a plan.

342
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,270
Your plan is not important.

343
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:48,870
Sit down.

344
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,390
I can see that Zhu Chao

345
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,670
has already understood.

346
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,080
Come on, class monitor, stand up

347
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,000
and loudly tell everyone

348
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
what university you want to attend.

349
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,910
My mom said,

350
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,110
as long as it's a university, it's fine.

351
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,370
Sit down.

352
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,240
Wei Xue, stand up.

353
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,870
Tell us

354
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,120
what your goal is.

355
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,120
My dad says accounting is good.

356
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,440
Once you have the certification, it's a stable job.

357
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,240
Yes.

358
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,910
Do you hear that?

359
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,440
Sit.

360
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,720
Hu Qiumin, what about you?

361
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,720
What's your goal?

362
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,560
I want to go find my brother.

363
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,840
Does your brother own a university?

364
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,120
My brother is in university, and he's in Shenzhen.

365
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,630
I'll apply

366
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,230
to my brother's university.

367
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,750
If my scores aren't enough,

368
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,120
I'll just find any university

369
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,080
in Shenzhen.

370
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,470
My goal is very clear.

371
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,790
Then you need to make your goal

372
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,750
even clearer,

373
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,360
understand?

374
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,200
You can't leave yourself an escape route.

375
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,840
Don't settle for second best.

376
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,080
Since you already have a goal,

377
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,720
you should put all your effort into achieving it.

378
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,510
Understand?

379
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,360
Sit.

380
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,390
Miaomiao.

381
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:00,960
You have

382
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,390
a hundred ideals.

383
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,750
Tell me

384
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,550
what your current thoughts are.

385
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,480
I want to be an actress.

386
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,080
I want to apply to a film academy.

387
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,910
Me too.

388
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,200
Do you know what people

389
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
in a film academy do?

390
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,860
They act in movies in Beijing.

391
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,130
You didn't bring your keys again.

392
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You really don't take my leg

393
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,110
seriously.

394
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,080
I knew it.

395
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,360
Can you remember to bring your keys in the future?

396
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,670
Wait a minute.

397
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,470
Come on.

398
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,270
Dad.

399
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,000
Why didn't you tell me

400
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,630
you'd come back?

401
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,960
So much has happened at home.

402
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,970
You didn't tell me either.

403
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,240
This isn't exactly a big deal for me.

404
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,750
Besides,

405
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,360
you are preparing for the postgraduate entrance exam.

406
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,670
I didn't want to make things complicated

407
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,510
and cost you money.

408
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,310
You're already in a wheelchair,

409
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,660
and you still call this not a big deal?

410
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,240
Dad,

411
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,910
do you think that

412
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,040
if you don't tell me,

413
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,720
I'll know nothing?

414
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,670
Recently, when I called home,

415
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,870
I found it strange,

416
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,720
so I

417
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,050
called your workplace.

418
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,120
Sure enough.

419
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,390
Do you still treat me as a child?

420
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,480
Or in your eyes,

421
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,150
am I already an outsider?

422
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,030
How can you say that?

423
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,170
Who treats you as an outsider?

424
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,310
Does it help if I tell you?

425
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,480
Are you a doctor?

426
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,310
I'm not a doctor.

427
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,550
But I'm your son.

428
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,550
You and Aunt Yue

429
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,750
always say we're a family,

430
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,720
but when something happens in this family,

431
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,550
I'm the first one kept in the dark.

432
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,150
Does this feel like a family?

433
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,829
Also,

434
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:28,920
did Aunt Yue forget the things

435
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,520
she said to me

436
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,400
during the Chinese New Year?

437
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,680
I asked so many times

438
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
if something happened at home.

439
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,270
Did something happen?

440
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,590
Why didn't she tell me?

441
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,690
You can't blame Aunt Yue for this.

442
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,530
I was the one who didn't let her say anything.

443
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,160
By the way,

444
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,400
there's something else

445
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,590
I need to tell you.

446
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,060
I've already divorced your Aunt Yue,

447
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,310
and we separated before the injury.

448
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,070
Brother.

449
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,480
You're back.

450
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,000
Can you act in movies at this school?

451
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,440
Yes, you can not only act in movies,

452
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,350
but you can also perform skits.

453
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,480
I'm mainly aiming

454
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,750
to perform skits.

455
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,070
If you're doing skits,

456
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,590
that should fall under the category of drama.

457
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,400
You should join a theater troupe.

458
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,000
She won't succeed no matter where she goes.

459
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,790
Do you think it is a performance

460
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,960
in our factory?

461
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,590
I think at most you'll end up

462
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,750
as a kneeler in a performance.

463
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,830
What do you mean?

464
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,960
Are you looking down on me?

465
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,030
What's wrong with performing skits?

466
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,890
Isn't performing skits a career?

467
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,000
Look.

468
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,920
Everything can become a career

469
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,200
if you do it well.

470
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,920
The key is whether you

471
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,920
truly love it.

472
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,650
Understand?

473
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,110
However,

474
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,030
performing skits

475
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,550
sounds a bit unreliable.

476
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,350
Why not?

477
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,510
I think

478
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,350
the people performing skits on TV

479
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,920
all look pretty average.

480
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,380
It's not a beauty pageant.

481
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,480
Mom, we're not talking about the same thing.

482
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,550
Besides,

483
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,680
do I look average?

484
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,830
I don't think so.

485
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,400
No, you don't.

486
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,110
It has nothing to do with looks.

487
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,880
If you want to perform a skit

488
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,550
in our factory,

489
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,280
that's fine.

490
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,110
But now you want to go to a film academy.

491
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,880
Do you even know

492
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,480
where the film academy is?

493
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,750
I know, it's in Beijing.

494
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,110
Last time I went with Qiang Xiaowa

495
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,960
to a writing competition,

496
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,350
I found out about it.

497
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,880
I want to apply to

498
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,230
Beijing Film Academy.

499
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,070
With just one shot,

500
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,600
you're aiming for Beijing.

501
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,240
That's ambitious!

502
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,240
Miaomiao,

503
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,200
If you had this ambition earlier,

504
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,440
I would have felt more at ease,

505
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,270
right?

506
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,000
Young people should have

507
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,720
such ambition and determination, shouldn't they?

508
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,880
Mom supports you going to Beijing

509
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,080
and the film academy.

510
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,240
If you go to Beijing,

511
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,310
then our whole family

512
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,370
should go with you.

513
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,990
-That sounds great.
-Ah?

514
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,590
What are you questioning about?

515
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,350
Haven't you always wanted to go to Beijing?

516
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,590
Didn't you always feel that

517
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,510
I was holding you back

518
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,110
from heading north?

519
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,550
Yes, I didn't fulfill your dream,

520
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,640
but now my daughter

521
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,160
is taking on this responsibility.

522
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,920
Right?

523
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
Yes, I'll take the responsibility.

524
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,240
Yaya.

525
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,960
You should also apply to a school in Beijing next year,

526
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,750
so Zi can go to school in Beijing too.

527
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,000
Right? She'll be able to get a good education.

528
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,310
Then she'll be closer to

529
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,440
-Peking University and Tsinghua University.
-Mom.

530
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,100
Please calm down for a moment.

531
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,440
Are the tuition fees for schools in Beijing

532
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,920
quite expensive?

533
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,590
It's okay even if it's expensive.

534
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,200
It's okay even if it's expensive.

535
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,110
Your dad and I

536
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,640
will do whatever it takes

537
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,500
to support you.

538
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,440
Just go confidently.

539
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,960
Mom.

540
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,030
I didn't expect

541
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,750
you to be the first one to support me.

542
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,920
No, the second.

543
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,790
Li Si is the first.

544
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,920
I've made a deal with him.

545
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,880
If we go together,

546
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,720
you'll have a companion.

547
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,680
With him by your side,

548
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,510
I'll feel more at ease.

549
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,160
Okay.

550
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,110
It's settled then.

551
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,680
-Cheers.
-It's settled.

552
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,240
Come on.

553
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,200
Can you two really decide on this matter?

554
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,510
Do you own the academy?

555
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,030
What do you mean?

556
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,360
What do you mean by that?

557
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,270
Why are you two making sarcastic comments here?

558
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,400
It's rare for Miaomiao

559
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,680
to have such ambition.

560
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,160
Right?

561
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,020
If we don't support her, who will?

562
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,830
Let's stick to this goal.

563
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,680
It's all up to us.

564
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,270
If others can do it,

565
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,960
why can't we?

566
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,400
Whether we can do it or not, we have to make it happen.

567
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,070
Yes!

568
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,440
Miaomiao, eat more meat.

569
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:05,790
Okay.

570
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,550
Right? It's nutritious.

571
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,960
Then you can study better.

572
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,750
Okay, Mom.

573
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,590
Come on.

574
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,310
Mom.

575
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,750
Have you understood what I've been saying for so long?

576
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,110
Ms. Niu, please take it seriously.

577
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,550
I've been talking for a while.

578
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,160
Son, can we talk about it later?

579
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,550
Mom's calculations are all wrong.

580
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,110
Let's discuss it later.

581
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,830
Mom,

582
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,640
Is your lousy restaurant more important,

583
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,720
or is my future more important?

584
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,510
How can you not

585
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,440
distinguish between priorities?

586
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,750
You're the king now?

587
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,080
Should I kneel down and talk to you?

588
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,750
No need for that.

589
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,750
Just listen carefully.

590
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,750
After you listen,

591
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,070
just support me.

592
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,920
Well,

593
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,270
why do I want to go to the film academy?

594
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,200
Your dad is back.

595
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,370
How about this?

596
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,200
You talk to your dad about it.

597
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,880
Mom, we can just talk about it ourselves.

598
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,510
Dahai,

599
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,790
your son wants to apply to a film academy.

600
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,320
What kind of construction?

601
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,680
To apply to a film academy.

602
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,200
It's like making movies

603
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,330
and becoming a star.

604
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,240
Li Si.

605
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,550
Li Si.

606
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,400
Li Si!

607
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,290
Li Si, open the door.

608
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:07,440
Open the door.

609
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:07,880
Let's talk

610
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,720
about the film academy.

611
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,880
We can talk through the door.

612
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,440
I advise you

613
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,510
not to apply to the film academy

614
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,110
because you're not tall enough.

615
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,350
I'm tall enough.

616
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,160
If you apply to it, you won't be.

617
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,720
Why not?

618
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,940
Because I'll break your legs.

619
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,590
Why are you two fighting again?

620
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,030
Li Fan, have you forgotten

621
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,680
what you were like?

622
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,270
You were still wearing open-crotch pants at six.

623
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,680
And you were still wetting the bed at eight.

624
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,400
Have you ever done anything serious

625
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,880
from childhood to now?

626
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,510
You still can't even tell the front

627
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,960
from the back of your socks.

628
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,070
And you want to apply to the film academy?

629
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,510
Why don't you launch rockets instead?

630
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:37,920
Enough.

631
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,440
Why don't you

632
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,400
be the UN Secretary-General?

633
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,960
I don't mind

634
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,400
if you insist.

635
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,240
Enough, Dahai.

636
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,510
Dahai.

637
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,550
Don't. Get me a spare key.

638
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,400
Every time I...

639
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,350
What key?

640
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,200
We're talking about

641
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,440
his college application.

642
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,200
This is serious.

643
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,110
With him like this,

644
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:54,840
he still wants to apply to college.

645
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,790
He's always been the last in his class.

646
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,390
Yet he wants to go to college.

647
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,240
Listen, Li Si.

648
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,900
I'm telling you one last time.

649
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,110
Forget about the film academy

650
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:02,960
or whatever else.

651
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,920
Don't think about it.

652
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,790
Do you hear me?

653
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,590
After graduation,

654
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,240
just go up the mountain and extract oil.

655
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,110
That's the only path for you.

656
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,370
No one can change that.

657
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,750
I'm not going to extract oil.

658
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,150
Why should I extract oil?

659
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,550
Because I'm your dad,

660
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,350
because I raised you.

661
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,750
When did you ever raise me?

662
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,000
You were almost living in the well.

663
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,400
Have you ever taken care of me?

664
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,270
Where were you

665
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,200
when I was sick with a fever?

666
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,160
All you did was hit me

667
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,880
and beat me up

668
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,160
for no reason.

669
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,510
What's that about? Exercising?

670
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,440
Say it again.

671
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,440
Li Dahai, l'm telling you.

672
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,920
You're passionate about oil production but I don't.

673
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,680
I'm almost 18.

674
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,440
Everyone has their own aspirations.

675
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,070
I have the right

676
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,310
to choose my own life.

677
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,640
Fine. Hit me, huh?

678
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,480
Go ahead, kill me.

679
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,240
Let's see if I can

680
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,000
kill you.

681
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,550
What are you doing, Son?

682
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,240
Your dad has been unwell lately.

683
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,750
He has a stomachache, don't you know that?

684
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,880
His stomachache is from drinking.

685
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,410
It has nothing to do with me.

686
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
Don't go in there.

687
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,090
This family doesn't want you anymore.

688
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,400
Get lost!

689
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,670
If you dare come back, I'll break your legs!

690
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,350
You...

691
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,140
Since both of you are here,

692
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,590
I have to give you an explanation

693
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,750
for my divorce from Yang.

694
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,110
Tao,

695
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,440
what you said to me

696
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,770
on the way back during the Chinese New Year

697
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,830
really pierced my heart.

698
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,680
I kept thinking,

699
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,350
every day I'm nitpicking,

700
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,880
counting this and that,

701
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,400
feeling like the whole world owes me,

702
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,000
like I'm the most miserable.

703
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,480
But in reality,

704
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,170
you two are the most miserable.

705
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,350
Of course.

706
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,640
As a couple,

707
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,920
we are both failures.

708
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,920
Later, the two of us had a drink,

709
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,790
talked about the past,

710
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,070
and expressed many things

711
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,200
we hadn't said before.

712
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,890
In the end, we mutually decided

713
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,930
to get a divorce.

714
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,840
Divorce and marriage

715
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,000
are matters between the two of you,

716
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,980
and I understand that.

717
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,110
Me too.

718
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,310
But Aunt Yue,

719
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,670
you and my dad have divorced,

720
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,880
so you're no longer obligated

721
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,080
to take care of my dad.

722
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,270
My dad still has me.

723
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,840
-In the future...
-Tao.

724
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,550
Does getting a divorce

725
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,350
mean we're strangers now?

726
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,550
We've lived together

727
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,920
for more than ten years.

728
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,080
Can feelings just disappear like that?

729
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,880
How did your dad get this injury?

730
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,550
That was from a rescue operation at work.

731
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,070
Even if that weren't the case,

732
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,200
even if Yang went out

733
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,000
and got into a fight with someone

734
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,640
and hurt his leg,

735
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,240
I would still have to take care of him.

736
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,350
But Aunt Yue,

737
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,680
-I...
-Tao.

738
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,710
You've always been outside.

739
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,270
You definitely won't be coming back

740
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,550
to Oilfield.

741
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,310
Right?

742
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,920
And Min

743
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,680
is going to college next year.

744
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,480
With her mind set on leaving,

745
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,020
she definitely won't be coming back.

746
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
As for the life between your dad and me,

747
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,510
let us handle it ourselves.

748
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,160
We will always be a family

749
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,510
and loved ones.

750
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:17,960
This place

751
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,670
will always be our home,

752
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,880
and that will never change.

753
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,510
So when do you plan...

754
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,510
To remarry?

755
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,510
We don't plan to remarry.

756
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,160
Yes.

757
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,720
Well...

758
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,050
We're not suitable to be husband and wife.

759
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,880
We are family.

760
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,920
Alright.

761
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,960
Don't worry.

762
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,310
Rest assured.

763
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,170
I won't be a burden to this family.

764
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,230
How are you so sure that

765
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,590
I won't be able to stand up again?

766
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,070
Even if I can't stand,

767
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,400
I still have my hands.

768
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,350
Don't forget

769
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,710
what your dad does.

770
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,720
I'm an engineer.

771
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,320
I have a lot of intelligence.

772
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,380
I can support this family.

773
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,510
Do you hear me?

774
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,350
Look at how proud your dad is.

775
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,750
Don't worry.

776
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,680
Things will get better and better.

777
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,480
This will always be our home.

778
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,340
Remember that.

779
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,270
Alright.

780
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,640
We've said everything we need to say.

781
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,310
Let's eat.

782
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,830
Let's eat. Hurry.

783
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,590
Okay.

784
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,480
Why are you drinking here alone?

785
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,510
Life is short,

786
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,630
and full of joys and sorrows.

787
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,600
What's got you so worked up?

788
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,110
It's not really about being worked up,

789
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,370
it's about suffering.

790
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,510
The greatest suffering in life

791
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,350
happens between the ages of 20 and 40.

792
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,440
Right now, your uncle

793
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,590
is at the peak of that suffering.

794
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,920
Isn't your biggest suffering

795
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,110
the fact that you don't have a wife?

796
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,550
Look, Fang and I

797
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,310
have been together for so long,

798
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,950
and I've treated her so well,

799
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,350
yet she hasn't picked up on anything.

800
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,380
What should she pick up on?

801
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,400
Well,

802
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,830
she never thought

803
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,130
about being in a relationship with me.

804
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,750
Have you told her

805
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,880
that you want to have a relationship with her?

806
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,720
Well, I haven't said it outright.

807
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,000
As a grown man,

808
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,400
if you want to be with someone,

809
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,510
are you just waiting for the girl to speak up?

810
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,160
No.

811
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,030
Do I have to speak up directly?

812
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,480
Of course, you need to say it,

813
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,720
and you have to say it formally,

814
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,880
boldly.

815
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,850
And you think you're a pro in romance?

816
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,560
You're not anything at all.

817
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,890
Drink some warm water.

818
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:02,830
Here.

819
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,720
Be careful. It's hot.

820
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,590
My heart hurts.

821
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,880
The little brat dared to lay hands on me.

822
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,070
Don't pull it out.

823
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,000
This is a memorable lesson.

824
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,920
What lesson?

825
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,760
Leaving it here brings bad luck.

826
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,750
Your stomach pain is from drinking.

827
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,310
Yet you're blaming him for fighting with you.

828
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,590
Your son barely said a few words,

829
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,880
and you hit him first.

830
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,000
Why is it that

831
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,070
the older you get, the less reasonable you are?

832
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,000
A father reasons with his son?

833
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,200
What kind of reasoning is that?

834
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,800
Did your dad reason with you?

835
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,510
I'm telling you, the son takes after you.

836
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,000
Look at what he said.

837
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,260
He refused to work in oil production.

838
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,110
Without the oil wells, where would he be?

839
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,110
Without the oil wells, we, oil field workers,

840
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,840
would all be left with nothing.

841
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,640
You can't educate a child like this.

842
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,160
He can't forget where he comes from.

843
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,620
Is refusing to extract oil the same as forgetting our origins?

844
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,160
Did you send him to school

845
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,960
just to extract oil?

846
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,720
Well, he can also take on another role

847
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,400
in the Oilfield.

848
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,720
Times have changed,

849
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,960
haven't you noticed?

850
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,030
Now the Oilfield is open

851
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,510
to recruit college students.

852
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,030
What's the purpose?

853
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,590
It's to bring in talent.

854
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,160
You,

855
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,160
as a leader,

856
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,360
need to keep up with the times, you know?

857
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,110
Did you read it in the newspaper?

858
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,110
Cut it out. My stomach hurts.

859
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,960
You have to treat your stomach disease.

860
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,720
I feel so unwell.

861
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,200
I've scheduled a gastroscopy for you,

862
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,550
you must go for the check-up.

863
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,400
When?

864
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,050
The day after tomorrow.

865
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,250
The day after tomorrow?

866
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,070
No.

867
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,480
The day after tomorrow is our unit's major inspection,

868
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,030
and all the leaders are coming.

869
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,070
I have to attend.

870
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:45,830
Is the leader more important,

871
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,560
or is your life more important?

872
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,440
Next week?

873
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,680
It has to be this week.

874
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,590
The expert from Beijing is coming.

875
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,050
I've already paid for you.

876
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
Expert?

877
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,550
I can apply for leave then.

878
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,110
Well.

879
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,270
Can you talk to that expert

880
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,720
and see

881
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,240
if they can check my heart too?

882
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,070
I'm feeling really uncomfortable.

883
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,070
This child is being so stubborn.

884
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,030
He's been holding it in for a long time.

885
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,560
Bring me some quick relief.

886
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,310
What are you two arguing about every day?

887
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,590
He's your son.

888
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,510
Can't you go easy on him?

889
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,160
Come on.

890
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,000
Coming.

891
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,720
If I love you,

892
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,960
I won't wind upon you like a trumpet creeper,

893
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,880
upvaluing myself by your height.

894
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,790
If I love you,

895
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,030
I will never follow a spoony bird.

896
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:50,960
What are you doing?

897
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,310
-There are...
-Shush.

898
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,790
Repeating the monotone song for the green shade.

899
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,750
Not only like a springhead

900
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,270
brings you clean coolness the whole year long;

901
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,110
Not only like a steep peak

902
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,510
enhances your height

903
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,200
and sets off your straightness.

904
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,350
Even sunshine

905
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,680
and spring rain.

906
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,480
No,

907
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,510
all these are not enough!

908
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,070
Enough. These are enough.

909
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,230
No.

910
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,310
I must...

911
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Why didn't you tell me

912
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,880
there are so many people?

913
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,920
You didn't let me speak.

914
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,510
I...

915
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,200
Well,

916
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,310
you're in a meeting, huh?

917
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,640
It's so late, and you're still busy.

918
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,030
We're not busy.

919
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,270
Anyway, I finished my confession.

920
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,680
No, I mean I'm done, take it.

921
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,760
You all carry on.

922
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,960
No need to see me off.

923
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,350
What a mess.

924
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,350
Jia Baoshan.

925
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,310
Go on with your meeting.

926
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,750
I have nothing else to do.

927
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,350
We can have the meeting anytime.

928
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,810
What do you want to tell me?

929
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,240
What?

930
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,340
Aren't you going to confess to me?

931
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,600
Yes.

932
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,960
Are you done?

933
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,880
Not yet.

934
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,030
Then hurry up and do it again.

935
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,350
Not here, though.

936
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,350
The environment is...

937
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,510
Too hasty.

938
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,030
Are you going to do it or not?

939
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,000
They're waiting for me to start the meeting upstairs.

940
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,720
I'll leave if you don't do it.

941
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,680
Don't. I'll do it.

942
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,880
If I love you,

943
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,110
-I won't...
-"If?"

944
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,790
No.

945
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,720
No?

946
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,880
It's not that I don't love you.

947
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,510
You don't love me.

948
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,550
No.

949
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,920
It's also not an "if" situation.

950
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,510
It's

951
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,210
"I love you."

952
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,440
What? I didn't hear you clearly.

953
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,240
I love you.

954
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,160
Louder.

955
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,510
I love you.

956
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,590
I love...

957
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,160
Kiss!

958
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,270
Kiss!

959
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,440
-Kiss!
-You...

960
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,590
Take it.

961
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,590
You...

962
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,720
This...

963
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,480
Son.

964
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,840
Dad!

965
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,960
Alright.

966
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,110
Son.

967
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,590
Today,

968
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,670
about the conflict between us,

969
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,760
I think we both have our faults,

970
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,429
so let's just let it go and not hold a grudge.

971
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,110
What...

972
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,360
What do you want?

973
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,889
I'm not going to do something.

974
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,630
It's that Dad wants you

975
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,820
to help me with something.

976
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,280
What?

977
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,840
Haven't you been

978
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,230
having stomach issues lately,

979
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,800
always having diarrhea,

980
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,530
sometimes even with pain,

981
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,000
and sometimes

982
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
unable to hold it?

983
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,440
Son, you're still young,

984
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,320
but there's a saying,

985
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,310
"Nine out of ten men have hemorrhoids."

986
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,670
It's not about ambition,

987
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:28,320
but hemorrhoids.

988
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,030
Why are you eating so much this early?

989
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,280
Haven't you had breakfast?

990
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,000
I did.

991
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,030
Your intestines are all messed up,

992
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,430
always having diarrhea.

993
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,070
I'll have a check-up tomorrow,

994
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,960
so I can't eat at night.

995
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,440
That's why I need to eat more during the day.

996
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,390
What happened to you this time?

997
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,920
You're always having check-ups.

998
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,920
Gastroscopy.

999
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,440
Even if I told you, you wouldn't understand.

1000
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,400
How could I not understand?

1001
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,510
It's just checking the intestines.

1002
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,960
He seems fine,

1003
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
why bother checking the intestines?

1004
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,360
He's always having diarrhea.

1005
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,360
It delays so many things.

1006
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,760
It should have been checked long ago.

1007
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,920
You should eat less of those things

1008
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,520
that irritate your stomach.

1009
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,510
I'm fine.

1010
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,670
It was my mom who scheduled a gastroscopy

1011
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,670
for my dad.

1012
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,590
My dad can't make it, so I have to go instead.

1013
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,650
Isn't this just looking for trouble?

1014
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,710
With all that eating,

1015
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,190
you're bound to have diarrhea.

1016
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,400
I'm hungry.

1017
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,630
Doctor,

1018
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,920
isn't the procedure already underway?

1019
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,380
Why do I still need to sign?

1020
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,320
This is not the signature for the gastroscopy.

1021
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,230
Don't be nervous.

1022
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,400
Let me explain.

1023
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,070
Mom!

1024
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:55,960
Son!

1025
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,480
-Mom.
-Son.

1026
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,110
I'm outside.

1027
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,280
Mom.

1028
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,320
Does it hurt?

1029
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,880
Hang in there. You'll be fine soon.

1030
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,070
Mom is at the door.

1031
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,630
Mom.

1032
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,800
Mom.

1033
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,800
Son.

1034
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,630
Are you unwell?

1035
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,400
I...

1036
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,320
I think

1037
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,920
I still feel a bit uncomfortable in my stomach.

1038
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,230
It's been two days,

1039
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,590
and you still feel so uncomfortable.

1040
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,840
If it doesn't get better,

1041
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,880
we really need to go to the hospital.

1042
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,140
That's not necessary.

1043
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,590
Mom,

1044
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,130
help me request some time off,

1045
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,920
at least two more days.

1046
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,320
I need some rest.

1047
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,760
Okay,

1048
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,110
I'll help you with that.

1049
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,240
I'll call right now.

1050
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,150
What's wrong with you?

1051
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,000
I'm not sick. I'm just pretending to be.

1052
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:02,840
I just want my mom

1053
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,310
to get me a few more days off.

1054
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,510
How can you ask for so many days off?

1055
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,230
I'll go for a check-up too.

1056
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,440
It's such a good deal.

1057
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,230
Listen, don't do it.

1058
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,510
It's too painful.

1059
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,950
No one can know that I'm pretending to be sick,

1060
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,510
not even Xiaowa and Hu.

1061
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,230
I really need to solidify my position

1062
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,440
in the family.

1063
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
My parents

1064
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,500
must pay more attention to me.

1065
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,480
I've got to go.

1066
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,910
Don't worry about me.

1067
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,590
Bye.

1068
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,150
Okay.

1069
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,230
Judging from the current situation,

1070
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,880
the prosecuting authorities have not approved

1071
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,480
the arrest of Yuan Shanqing,

1072
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,670
which indicates that

1073
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,030
there are still certain doubts

1074
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,920
about their classification of Yuan Shanqing's behavior

1075
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,150
as intentional homicide.

1076
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,670
In the past few days,

1077
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,070
I've had thorough communication

1078
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,920
with them,

1079
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,440
and I believe Yuan Shanqing's actions

1080
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,640
are more aligned with

1081
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,880
the requirements of justifiable self-defense.

1082
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,740
It's in the bag.

1083
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,760
Look.

1084
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,510
Different trades, worlds apart.

1085
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,230
Really.

1086
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:02,840
Professional matters

1087
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,070
require professionals to handle them.

1088
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,320
He's a good lawyer.

1089
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,230
-He's won
-Impressive.

1090
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,360
so many cases.

1091
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,030
No.

1092
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,690
It's not me who's impressive,

1093
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,920
but the prosecuting authorities.

1094
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,150
They are meticulous.

1095
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,000
No.

1096
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,840
It's all thanks to you.

1097
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,840
Mr. Jin, to be honest with you,

1098
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,150
this is the only good news

1099
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,070
we've heard

1100
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,360
in recent days.

1101
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,150
Really.

1102
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,360
I'm so happy that

1103
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,840
I can feel my legs

1104
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,840
again.

1105
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,800
Get up and walk.

1106
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,550
Pengfei, you should express your gratitude.

1107
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,440
Yes, well...

1108
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,630
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

1109
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,520
This child has hope now.

1110
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,960
Don't mention it.

1111
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,760
We're all on the same side.

1112
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,790
It's my duty.

1113
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:38,710
If there's nothing else,

1114
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,000
I'll get going then.

1115
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,480
Eat something before you go.

1116
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,030
No.

1117
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,030
No, thanks.

1118
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,320
I'll take care of it.

1119
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:43,880
If there's any news later,

1120
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,510
well,

1121
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,880
I'll contact you.

1122
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:46,920
Okay, I'll see you off.

1123
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,400
-Let me walk you out.
-Sure.

1124
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,070
Mr. Jin,

1125
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,150
I won't see you off since I'm still in a wheelchair.

1126
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:51,710
No need.

1127
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,670
Just stay there.

1128
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,590
Take care.

1129
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,510
Take care, man.

1130
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,640
I'll thank you personally after this.

1131
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,600
What's wrong?

1132
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,630
It's good news

1133
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,320
for the child.

1134
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,510
Why aren't you happy?

1135
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,190
No, I'm happy.

1136
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,360
Pengfei, are you hiding something

1137
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,280
from me?

1138
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,550
Is there something wrong

1139
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,840
with my lumbar spine and legs?

1140
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,900
It's not about you.

1141
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,960
Everything is settled.

1142
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,960
It's all settled.

1143
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:20,800
Why would I come back?

1144
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
I've got to go too.

1145
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,910
Dahai.

1146
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:24,880
Well...

1147
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,480
Well,

1148
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,840
sit here first.

1149
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,400
Sit here.

1150
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,230
What?

1151
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,320
I'm busy.

1152
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,360
I just noticed something off about your expression.

1153
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,160
What's wrong?

1154
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,960
Pengfei.

1155
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,040
We're all friends.

1156
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,360
Just say what you want to say.

1157
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,440
I'm begging you.

1158
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,670
How about this?

1159
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,760
Pengfei, tell me.

1160
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:48,880
Isn't the issue about Shanqing

1161
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,000
already resolved?

1162
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,110
What now?

1163
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,630
It's not about Shanqing.

1164
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,400
It's your son.

1165
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:00,920
Li Si?

1166
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,960
What happened to him?

1167
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,040
Dahai.

1168
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,670
Li Si's report is out.

1169
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:10,630
Report?

1170
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,280
The report about gastroscopy?

1171
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,880
What was the result?

1172
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,840
Li Si

1173
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,190
previously went for

1174
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,670
a gastroscopy.

1175
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,000
Then they found some issues

1176
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,760
in his intestines,

1177
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,710
so they did a biopsy.

1178
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,840
Lingling was there

1179
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,560
and signed the papers.

1180
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,130
Why didn't anyone tell me?

1181
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,760
Then

1182
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,280
what's the final result?

1183
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,710
Now,

1184
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,640
the doctor preliminarily suspects...

1185
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,510
What?

1186
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,760
Of course,

1187
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,710
this still needs to be confirmed

1188
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,510
by several doctors...

1189
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,370
Cheng Pengfei.

1190
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,570
What are you hesitating about?

1191
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,660
What's the worst-case scenario?

1192
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,970
Intestinal cancer.

1193
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,670
This summer,

1194
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,810
I feel like we've been cursed.

1195
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,110
We finally waited for the good news

1196
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,110
that Shanqing would be coming back,

1197
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,760
but a check-up brought about

1198
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,320
a new disaster.

1199
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,190
The poem recited

1200
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,190
by Uncle and Fang,

1201
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,880
Li Si and I

1202
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,820
had also read it together.

1203
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,440
At that time,

1204
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,550
he seriously held Shu Ting's poetry collection and said to me,

1205
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,360
"I must be a ceiba

1206
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,110
by your side,

1207
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,030
standing together with you

1208
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,280
as a tree."

1209
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,150
Then he asked me,

1210
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,480
"Isn't it 'To The Oak Tree,'

1211
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,880
why is it a ceiba now?

1212
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,250
What is a ceiba?"

1213
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,320
Many years later,

1214
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,440
I met the ceiba for the first time

1215
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,970
at a traditional Chinese medicine hospital.

1216
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,670
A kind old doctor said that

1217
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:58,110
the ceiba could treat enteritis.

1218
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,960
I stood in that hospital

1219
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,190
and cried very loudly.
