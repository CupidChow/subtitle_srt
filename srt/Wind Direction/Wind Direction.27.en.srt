[Episode 27]

3
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,590
Hurry!

4
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,310
Keep up! Hurry!

5
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,710
Don't look around!

6
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,390
Hurry! Hurry!

7
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:45,940
Hurry!

8
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:46,810
Hurry!

9
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,030
Behave!

10
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,720
A woman is running to the back alley!

11
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,060
Stop!

12
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,510
Stop!

13
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,310
Stop!

14
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,220
Stop!

15
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,000
Stop!

16
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,710
Stop!

17
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,250
Behave!

18
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,780
Why were you running if you hadn't done anything illegal?

19
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,850
I was looking for someone!

20
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,250
Why are you arresting me?

21
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,670
Lin Xiu,

22
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,870
we know your situation very well.

23
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,020
You'd better tell us yourself.

24
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,470
Or you won't end well

25
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:28,980
if you

26
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,230
refuse to cooperate.

27
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,590
I've told you

28
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,030
what I know.

29
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,310
I really don't know where Yuan Yong is.

30
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,940
When was the last time

31
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,950
you saw him?

32
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,470
Two months ago.

33
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,070
He came to me in the massage shop.

34
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,360
Why did he come to you?

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,790
What did he say?

36
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,050
What else could he do?

37
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,380
He wanted money from me.

38
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,150
But I didn't have any.

39
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,790
So he took my gold necklace away.

40
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,470
Sir,

41
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,350
I'm not on Yuan Yong's side.

42
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,950
He's very cunning.

43
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,110
He wouldn't tell me

44
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,850
what he did and where he hid something.

45
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,690
Lin Xiu.

46
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,270
Do you think

47
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,470
you'll have nothing to do with it

48
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,530
if you wash your hands of what you did?

49
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,110
Yuan Yong committed the crime of fraudulent fund-raising

50
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,150
when he was in the Oilfield.

51
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,110
You think you have nothing to do with it?

52
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,110
Tell us the truth!

53
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,020
If I tell you everything about him,

54
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,360
can I atone for what I did?

55
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,470
Tell us.

56
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,829
Yuan Yong...

57
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,050
He killed someone.

58
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,120
[Truth]

59
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,630
Hello?

60
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,880
This is Wancheng Road Police Station.

61
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,710
Who?

62
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,710
Yuan Yong?

63
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,550
Yuan Shanqing.

64
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:52,690
Yuan Shanqing.

65
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,230
Yuan Shanqing!

66
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,630
Wake up,

67
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,490
Yuan Shanqing!

68
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,540
Yuan Shanqing!

69
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:58,470
Yuan Shanqing!

70
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,030
Wake up,

71
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,020
Yuan Shanqing!

72
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:01,990
Yuan Shanqing,

73
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,830
wake up!

74
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,590
I heard Yuan Yong is back?

75
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,550
Yes, he's back.

76
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,110
Yeah.

77
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:16,470
Yeah.

78
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:16,950
The wife of Zhao who's from our yard

79
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,310
called the police.

80
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,470
Did they catch him?

81
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,510
I don't know.

82
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,269
I don't know.

83
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,430
It's Yuan Yong.

84
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,470
When we arrived,

85
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,909
he had had no vital signs.

86
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,110
When will the Criminal Investigation Team arrive?

87
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,310
They'll be here soon.

88
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,670
Where is the person who called the police?

89
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,530
She's outside.

90
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,280
Let's go.

91
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,250
You called the police?

92
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,550
What happened back then?

93
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,710
I just got off work at that time.

94
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,630
I was riding my bike home.

95
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,630
When I got to this gate,

96
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,690
I heard a woman

97
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,430
crying for help in the yard.

98
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,180
Help!

99
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,590
Call the police.

100
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,350
Yuan Yong is back.

101
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,210
Well, something bad might have happened, right?

102
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,030
Make way! Make way!

103
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,909
What are you doing?

104
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:54,590
My son is...

105
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,270
My son is inside!

106
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,950
This is the crime scene!

107
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,750
Let me in!

108
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,390
My son is inside, sir!

109
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,710
What on earth happened?

110
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,110
I heard Yuan Yong is back!

111
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,510
It's said Yuan Yong is back.

112
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,380
Yuan Yong is back?

113
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,270
You can't go in!

114
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,830
Let me in!

115
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,960
Yuan Yong is inside!

116
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,760
Let us in!

117
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,030
Dr. Cheng! Dr. Cheng!

118
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:10,750
Calm down!

119
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,390
Please don't disrupt our work!

120
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,150
Mr. Jiang, my son is inside!

121
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,090
Yaya is inside!

122
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,510
Can you let us in?

123
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,710
He and Yuan Shanqing are both injured.

124
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,710
They've been sent to the staff hospital.

125
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,510
Where did they get hurt?

126
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:18,950
Are they injured?

127
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,510
I don't know.

128
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,190
When I came here,

129
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,190
they had been sent to the hospital.

130
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,830
Let's go to the hospital.

131
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,110
-Go to the hospital.
-No!

132
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,370
Go to the hospital. Go.

133
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,860
Hey, don't come any closer!

134
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,700
Yaya.

135
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,830
My son, Yaya, is there.

136
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,950
Is Cheng Yaya there?

137
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,909
Who are you?

138
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,230
We are his parents.

139
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,830
How is he?

140
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,070
He was stabbed in the stomach.

141
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,270
The doctor is taking care of him inside.

142
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,950
He just went there to send some ribs.

143
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,630
How could he be stabbed?

144
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,600
Zhang, how is my kid?

145
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,950
The wound has been taken care of.

146
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,150
Fortunately, his internal organs didn't get hurt.

147
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,940
What?

148
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,430
Zhang, can we go in

149
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,670
to visit him?

150
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,910
No.

151
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,430
Cheng Yaya

152
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,950
is the party involved in this case.

153
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,110
No one can visit him

154
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,110
before we figure out what happened.

155
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,070
These

156
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,310
are from the Criminal Investigation Team of the municipal public security bureau.

157
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,210
These are the family of Cheng Yaya.

158
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,490
My son is a victim.

159
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,310
Why can't we

160
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,430
go in and see him?

161
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,750
Yuan Yong is dead.

162
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,390
What does it have to do

163
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,390
with my son?

164
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,760
When Yuan Yong died,

165
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,670
only Cheng Yaya

166
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,870
and Yuan Shanqing were there.

167
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,550
And the caller

168
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,430
saw Yaya holding a knife

169
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,230
to Yuan Yong.

170
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,870
Do you think Cheng Yaya

171
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,120
killed Yuan Yong?

172
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,950
-Are you out of your mind?
-Miaomiao!

173
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,730
Miaomiao! Miaomiao!

174
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,530
-Come on.
-Calm down, all right?

175
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,230
We didn't say that.

176
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,270
But before the police

177
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,110
make a final determination,

178
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,750
he's on suspicion of committing a crime.

179
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,790
My son didn't commit a crime.

180
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,450
Why would he become a suspect?

181
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,230
Sir.

182
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,990
Sir. Please.

183
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,190
My brother wouldn't kill anyone!

184
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,230
Sir.

185
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,160
Enough. Enough.

186
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,400
We also hope he's innocent.

187
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,550
Yaya.

188
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,550
Yaya.

189
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,090
Cheng Yaya.

190
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,120
Yaya.

191
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:15,810
Dad.

192
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,060
Mom.

193
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,670
Sister.

194
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,670
I'm sorry.

195
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,670
Yaya.

196
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,590
Yaya.

197
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,730
Don't be afraid. We're here.

198
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,080
All right, we need

199
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,440
to question him alone.

200
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,429
Please wait.

201
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:33,830
Dad.

202
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,659
Cheng Yaya.

203
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,590
I'm Wang Dayong, Chief of the Criminal Investigation Corps III

204
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,309
of the Criminal Investigation Department

205
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,549
of the municipal public security bureau.

206
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:43,990
We're responsible

207
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,390
for investigating this case now.

208
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,320
Please cooperate with us during the investigation.

209
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,340
Cheng Yaya.

210
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,620
Yuan Yong is dead.

211
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,800
What on earth happened?

212
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,320
Where is Yuan Shanqing?

213
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,430
Yu.

214
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,750
Take a seat.

215
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,550
Daiyu.

216
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,090
Yang.

217
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,910
-I... I... Well.
-You…

218
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,590
I'm fine. I'm fine.

219
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,710
Yue.

220
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,870
What happened?

221
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,530
Yaya is injured.

222
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,100
He's got a big cut on his belly.

223
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,550
How is he?

224
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,980
The wound has been taken care of.

225
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,510
Yu.

226
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,620
Luckily, his internal organs didn't get hurt.

227
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,820
The police are questioning him inside.

228
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,430
We just heard about it. We're so worried.

229
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,760
What on earth happened?

230
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,820
Yuan Yong is dead.

231
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,010
The police said Cheng Yaya was a suspect.

232
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,150
What?

233
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,390
Ya... Yaya killed him?

234
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,430
My son didn't kill anyone.

235
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,470
I stabbed Yuan Yong.

236
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,750
Tell me the details.

237
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,540
I was bringing ribs to Yuan Shanqing.

238
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,990
After I got in, I saw

239
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,110
Yuan Yong choking Yuan Shanqing.

240
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,120
Yuan Shanqing, call the police, quickly!

241
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,760
Don't come any closer!

242
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,510
I'll kill you if you come any closer!

243
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,270
Go back!

244
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,470
Kid.

245
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,160
You're kind of awesome.

246
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,170
Don't you always want to catch me?

247
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,320
Come on and catch me!

248
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,680
I...

249
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,830
Aren't you awesome?

250
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,890
Do you really want to catch me?

251
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,540
You saw me today.

252
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,510
Come on and catch me.

253
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,800
I'll strangle you to death.

254
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,440
You like my daughter, don't you?

255
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,130
What do you want to do?

256
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,270
I'm going to stab you to death!

257
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,870
You want to help an outsider, don't you?

258
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,860
Let go of Yuan Shanqing!

259
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,230
Let her go!

260
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,320
No one will be alive.

261
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,540
No one will be alive.

262
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,550
Call the police.

263
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,400
Yuan Yong is back.

264
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,550
After that,

265
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,860
the police came.

266
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,960
I told him not to get involved in Yuan Yong's family,

267
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,470
but he didn't listen.

268
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,460
If he hadn't sent the ribs to her,

269
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,060
this wouldn't have happened to him.

270
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,990
Well, you're bringing it up again.

271
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,310
Those are two different issues.

272
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,670
How can they be different?

273
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,590
Would Yaya have met Yuan Yong if he hadn't gone there?

274
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,430
All right.

275
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,510
Stop talking, both of you.

276
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,960
Pengfei,

277
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,270
you're a doctor in this hospital.

278
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:13,790
Can't you

279
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,320
go in and see the kid as well?

280
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,320
The police need to question him in private.

281
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,450
No one is allowed in.

282
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,870
How about I call Dahai

283
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,820
and ask him to leverage some resources?

284
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,530
Mr. Wei who always goes to the restaurant for meals

285
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,860
knows a police officer.

286
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,910
I won't tell anyone

287
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,040
or ask for anything.

288
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,300
My son didn't kill anyone.

289
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,530
Lingling, don't tell Dahai.

290
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,840
Luckily, Yaya is fine now.

291
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,990
If you call him,

292
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,590
Dahai will be worried too.

293
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,570
Don't call him.

294
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,700
Then what should we do now?

295
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,030
Just wait.

296
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,770
Sir.

297
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,670
Could it..

298
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,390
Could it be self-defense?

299
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,070
If I...

300
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,630
If I hadn't done that,

301
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,740
he would have killed us.

302
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,850
Yuan Yong

303
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,480
would kill his own daughter.

304
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,040
He was crazy.

305
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,190
We've recorded what you said.

306
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,880
Self-defense

307
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,750
is strictly defined in the law.

308
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,430
You have to believe

309
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,320
the legal system

310
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,850
will deliver a just result.

311
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,460
Thank you, sir.

312
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,300
Yu.

313
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,740
Chief Wang, Yuan Shanqing is awake.

314
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,170
Okay, got it.

315
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:15,990
Okay.

316
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,630
We've done here.

317
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,670
You can go in now.

318
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,349
Sir.

319
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,830
Sir.

320
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,830
My son

321
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,350
is young.

322
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,910
Will he be fine?

323
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,280
It could be self-defense.

324
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,030
We need

325
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,230
to investigate and verify the details.

326
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,430
This kind of experience

327
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,460
is a great harm to kids.

328
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,000
Take good care of him.

329
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,270
Thank you.

330
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,520
I'm leaving.

331
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,350
Yaya.

332
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,990
You scared me.

333
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,320
Does it still hurt?

334
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,060
Ya.

335
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,840
What on earth happened between you and Yuan Yong?

336
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,150
Yeah, Yaya.

337
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,030
Tell us what happened.

338
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,180
No, no, no. Well.

339
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,990
Let's not ask him anymore.

340
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,330
Yaya, stop thinking about this.

341
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,190
It's all in the past.

342
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,640
Well...

343
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,230
Mom and Dad are here.

344
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,070
No one can hurt you, Yaya.

345
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,990
Stop thinking about it.

346
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,230
Stop thinking about it.

347
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,890
Yaya, stop thinking about it.

348
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,390
It's nothing.

349
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,590
I'm sorry.

350
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,870
No, no.

351
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,070
No, no, no, kid.

352
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,230
Stop thinking about it. Stop thinking about it.

353
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,560
Stop thinking about it.

354
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:57,970
Chief Wang.

355
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,100
Chief Wang.

356
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,380
Is she fine?

357
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,110
Yuan Shanqing, don't be afraid.

358
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:16,960
Is

359
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,980
Yuan Yong really dead?

360
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,550
We're relieved.

361
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,140
Zi.

362
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,780
We're relieved.

363
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,830
Zi.

364
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,950
We're relieved.

365
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,750
Where is Yaya?

366
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,390
How's Yaya?

367
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,870
His wound has been taken care of.

368
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,830
Don't worry.

369
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,640
How did Yuan Yong die?

370
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,900
I killed him.

371
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,900
Help!

372
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,680
Yuan Shanqing, call the police, quickly!

373
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,210
Don't come any closer!

374
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,630
I'll kill you if you come any closer!

375
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,760
Go back to your room!

376
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,310
Go back!

377
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,650
Zi, stay inside.

378
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,410
Zi, be good. Don't be afraid.

379
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,320
Stay here.

380
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,300
Be good.

381
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,910
I'll strangle you to death!

382
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,110
What do you want to do?

383
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,630
You've grown bolder now.

384
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,100
Are you gonna stab your own father?

385
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,290
Do you really want to kill me?

386
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,660
You're just like your dead mother,

387
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,030
who was despicable!

388
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,420
What I regret the most in my life

389
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:49,950
is to bring you and Zi

390
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,190
to this world.

391
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,750
Go to hell, all of you!

392
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,950
Go to hell!

393
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,630
Go to hell!

394
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,540
You should go to hell.

395
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,820
You should go to hell!

396
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,310
I killed him.

397
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,430
It has nothing to do with Yaya.

398
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,320
Where are you going?

399
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,120
I'm going to see Shanqing.

400
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,030
You're weak now! Stay here!

401
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,800
Lie down!

402
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,090
You can see her after you've fully recovered.

403
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:51,620
Be good.

404
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,610
Sister, I beg you.

405
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,390
I just want to take a look at her.

406
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,830
I have something to say to her.

407
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,550
If you have anything to say,

408
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,510
I'll tell her for you.

409
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,710
Stay here and lie down.

410
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,310
Hurry.

411
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,680
According to Yuan Shanqing,

412
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,140
it's self-defense first.

413
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,150
But the next three stabs

414
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,810
could be intentional murder.

415
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,940
Yuan Yong is really a beast.

416
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,870
He even wanted

417
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,270
to sell his own daughter!

418
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:17,820
I also want to...

419
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,830
Yuan Yong deserved to die.

420
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,470
But both of them said

421
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,660
they killed Yuan Yong.

422
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,060
One of them must be lying.

423
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,760
Who do you think is lying?

424
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,500
Well, Ma,

425
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,030
go to the forensic doctor

426
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,290
to expedite the autopsy report.

427
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:35,970
Bin,

428
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,590
go to Chief Jiang

429
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,840
and ask him to send another team

430
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,150
to take turns

431
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:40,910
before Yuan Shanqing's ward.

432
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,990
No one is allowed to visit her except us.

433
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,310
Go.

434
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:43,910
Got it.

435
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,490
What are you doing?

436
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,240
Sir,

437
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,890
I'm here to see Yuan Shanqing.

438
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:10,640
No.

439
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,450
Yuan Shanqing is my brother's classmate.

440
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,710
She has no family.

441
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,870
So I came to see her.

442
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,850
No.

443
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,550
Yuan Shanqing's sister

444
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,310
is Zi.

445
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,240
She was taken care of by our family.

446
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,960
Let me talk to them.

447
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,570
Open the door if I can't go in.

448
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,390
I'll feel relieved

449
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,870
after I see them. Is that okay?

450
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:29,890
You're not allowed to do so.

451
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,280
Don't make it difficult for me. Go back.

452
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,750
Okay.

453
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,820
Shanqing, Yaya asked me to tell you

454
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,400
you should take care of yourself and be cautious when you talk!

455
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,150
Zi

456
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,130
only has you now!

457
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,970
Young lady, let me tell you!

458
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,200
She's a key suspect now.

459
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,950
What you were doing is illegal.

460
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,210
Illegal?

461
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,210
Yes.

462
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,260
Yaya, don't move. Don't move.

463
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,820
Don't press it.

464
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,630
Yaya,

465
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,750
does it still hurt?

466
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,670
I trust you.

467
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,350
I believe you're a good boy.

468
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,710
Yuan Yong

469
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,890
was so hateful.

470
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,680
If I had met him,

471
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,110
I would have subdued him

472
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,020
within seconds!

473
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,830
Then I...

474
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,010
Chief... Chief Wang.

475
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:34,750
It's okay.

476
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,150
I just came to see Yaya.

477
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,370
Have a seat.

478
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,570
How are you feeling? Are you feeling better?

479
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,710
Don't feel pressured.

480
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,270
Get well soon, okay?

481
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,900
Mr. Wang.

482
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,880
Could it be self-defense?

483
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,580
More than that, Pengfei.

484
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,430
This is definitely a courageous act!

485
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,020
He helped eliminate the evil for the people!

486
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,510
Well,

487
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,550
should the public security organ

488
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,750
consider giving Yaya

489
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,630
a silk banner to sing his praises?

490
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,910
The specific determination

491
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:00,970
shall be made

492
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:01,980
based on the facts.

493
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,330
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

494
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,170
Chief Wang.

495
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,070
Is Yuan Shanqing okay?

496
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,230
I chatted with her for a while just now.

497
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,630
She's fine. Don't worry.

498
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,010
Just now,

499
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,030
I also talked a lot with your sister.

500
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,410
I understand

501
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,490
your friendship with Yuan Shanqing.

502
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,840
Don't worry too much.

503
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:23,920
Well,

504
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,310
take good care of him.

505
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,770
I'll get going, all right?

506
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,000
Get well soon. It'll be fine.

507
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,420
-Thank you.
-Forget it. Forget it.

508
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,420
Let me see you off.

509
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,080
Miaomiao,

510
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,760
what did you say to the police?

511
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,300
I know you love your brother.

512
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,860
But if you help him with something,

513
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,990
it'll only harm him.

514
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,830
There's a liar

515
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,560
between him and Yuan Shanqing.

516
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,120
Who do you think the liar is?

517
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:56,710
It's nothing.

518
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,510
I think Mr. Wang

519
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,540
is a nice person.

520
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,430
Yaya, he will never

521
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,760
wrong you and Shanqing.

522
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,640
Don't worry.

523
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,670
Chief Wang.

524
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,240
Chief Jiang.

525
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,070
Bin.

526
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,630
Have some stuffed buns.

527
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,000
Chief Jiang.

528
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,160
Chief Wang.

529
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,070
Here.

530
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,720
Chief Jiang.

531
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,910
Who do you think is lying?

532
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,780
Yuan Shanqing or Cheng Yaya?

533
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,930
Me? I don't think it's appropriate for me to make comments.

534
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,110
It's appropriate.

535
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,170
Help me analyze it.

536
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,480
I met them before.

537
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,470
It was also because of Yuan Yong.

538
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,230
Yuan Shanqing

539
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,510
was being excluded by others in the school.

540
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,900
Cheng Yaya came to me

541
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,450
and asked me to clarify it for her.

542
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,070
I think

543
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,250
both of them are kind

544
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,110
and responsible.

545
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,240
What worries me the most

546
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,070
is that they would act on impulse

547
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,550
at their age.

548
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,500
Chief Wang, here's the autopsy report.

549
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:27,490
Miaomiao!

550
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,120
Miaomiao!

551
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,540
How's Yaya?

552
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,690
It's okay. We're here.

553
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,580
Don't be afraid. It'll be fine.

554
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,210
The rumors have gone crazy in the school.

555
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,650
It's full of nonsense.

556
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,690
What on earth happened, Yaya?

557
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,710
Does it hurt, Yaya?

558
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,000
It surely does.

559
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:00,070
Whoever gets stabbed in the stomach will feel hurt.

560
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,660
Yaya,

561
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,220
tell me what you want to eat.

562
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,280
I'll buy it for you.

563
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,790
He can't eat anything now.

564
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,870
He can only get an intravenous infusion.

565
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,190
That won't work if he doesn't eat anything.

566
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,850
He needs to eat something now.

567
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:09,970
Tell me.

568
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,000
Stop causing trouble for us.

569
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,330
We have to listen to what the doctor said.

570
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,330
Yes, listen to what the doctor said.

571
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,280
Where are your parents?

572
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,150
My mom went home to pick up something.

573
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:23,210
My dad went to ask for leave from the hospital director.

574
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,260
Where's Yuan Shanqing? How is she?

575
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,960
Shanqing.

576
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,080
She's... She's fine.

577
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,190
She's just a girl.

578
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,830
She must've been scared.

579
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,800
Yeah, Zi must've been scared too.

580
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,660
What the heck is this?

581
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,070
Don't worry.

582
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,880
Hurry and go back to your class.

583
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,170
Where are your parents?

584
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,780
My parents went back to get something.

585
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,270
Well, we need to talk

586
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,150
to Cheng Yaya for some details.

587
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,590
Please leave us.

588
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,080
Be careful.

589
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,840
Come on. Let's go outside.

590
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,640
Hurry. Hurry.

591
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,480
Let's go. Let's go.

592
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,250
Let's go. Let's go.

593
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,610
Close the door.

594
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,890
Get some rest!

595
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,270
Don't be nervous.

596
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,870
I just want to check some information with you.

597
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,430
What was Yuan Yong doing

598
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,910
when Cheng Yaya showed up?

599
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,550
He was choking me.

600
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,500
And what happened?

601
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,470
Then I hit Yuan Yong's head

602
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,670
with a flowerpot.

603
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,950
Where did you hit him?

604
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,460
Probably here.

605
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,690
And then?

606
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,270
Then he came up and hit me,

607
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,200
and held me down on the flower bed.

608
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,310
Sir,

609
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,590
didn't I tell you these

610
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,390
before?

611
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:04,990
Many people

612
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,590
would have their memory distorted

613
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,710
after experiencing a strong stimulation.

614
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,830
Are you sure

615
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,690
what you said is true?

616
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:12,740
Yes.

617
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,270
He took out the knife with his left hand.

618
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,190
Then,

619
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,090
Yuan Yong stabbed Cheng Yaya,

620
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,300
right?

621
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,110
I think so.

622
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,380
When I saw Yaya,

623
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,600
he had been injured.

624
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,260
The knife was on the ground.

625
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,070
You think so?

626
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,820
I'm not sure now.

627
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,270
I was busy hiding Zi

628
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,670
in my room.

629
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,550
Then...

630
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,580
Where did he drop the knife?

631
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,340
On my right.

632
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,320
Not far from me.

633
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,440
What was Yuan Yong doing?

634
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,010
He was choking Yaya.

635
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,070
I didn't know what to do.

636
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,440
So I picked up the knife

637
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,400
and stabbed him.

638
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,890
Where did you stab him?

639
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,790
His belly.

640
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,110
Are you sure?

641
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,270
Yes.

642
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,430
Then I want to know

643
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,010
why there's a knife injury

644
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,140
on Yuan Yong's back.

645
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,520
You can't answer it, right?

646
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,560
Maybe...

647
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,970
Maybe... I made a mistake in my memory.

648
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,230
You didn't make a mistake in your memory.

649
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,730
You didn't do it at all.

650
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,190
Yuan Shanqing stabbed him.

651
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,470
At that time, Yuan Yong

652
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,670
was holding you down.

653
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,290
You didn't see her at all.

654
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,920
I've been a policeman for over 20 years.

655
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,810
And I've handled many cases.

656
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,260
All truths

657
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,750
can be traced.

658
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,510
All lies

659
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,510
have loopholes.

660
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,950
Just now,

661
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,330
I went to see Yuan Shanqing first.

662
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,590
What she said

663
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,620
is consistent

664
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,420
with all the traces of the truth.

665
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,800
But in your story,

666
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,420
she never touched the knife.

667
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,420
But,

668
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,890
Yuan Shanqing's fingerprints

669
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,150
are on the knife.

670
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,550
What Yuan Shanqing said is the truth.

671
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,100
And you

672
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,350
lied to us.

Cheng Yaya.

674
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,450
Yuan Shanqing asked me to tell you

675
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,570
not to do anything stupid.

676
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,870
I know you want to protect Yuan Shanqing.

677
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:40,850
But,

678
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,950
the law is not a joke.

679
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,150

You're here.

00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,520
What's going on now?

684
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,270
Yaya is fine.

685
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,380
But we still can't see Shanqing.

686
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,850
Ms. Han is here too. She just went upstairs.

687
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,810
You must be having a hard time these days.

688
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:17,639
Forget it.

689

Well.

They are both good kids.

691
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,719
Why would this happen to them?

692
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,199
God is so unfair.

693
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,960
I don't know

694
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,800
whether God is fair or not.

695
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,199
But I know the law is fair.

696
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,710
It'll surely give them an explanation.

697
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,900
We can't give up.

698
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:33,550
If we give up,

699
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,610
who will uphold justice for the kids?

700
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,590
Given what happened,

701
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,429
can they still go to school?

702
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,340
What will the teachers

703
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,190
and students in the school think?

704
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,070
If they do break the law,

705
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,909
they'll be brought to trial by the judge.

706
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:46,830
If they don't,

707
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:47,760
I'll see who dares

709
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,550
I won't let them off easy.

711
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,949

as nice as you,

713
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,800
I wouldn't have thought going to school was so annoying.

714
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,430
Kids also think I'm annoying.

715
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,500
What should I do then?

716
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,310
Someone has to be strict with them.

717
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,870
As long as they don't go astray,

718
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,020
so be it.

00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,850
It's just a matter of having an extra pair of chopsticks.

765
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,840
Besides, you'll be back

766
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,000
in a few days, right?

767
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,480
It's not your turn to take care of her. Come on.

768
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:41,920
That's right.

769
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,360
Zi, come here.

770
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,390
Just like before,

771
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,360
Zi will live with us.

772
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,660
I'll take care of her.

773
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:52,690
Aunt.

774
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,080
It's different this time.

775
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,590
It's not.

776
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,460
It is

777
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,240
the same situation.

778
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,030
Thank you,

779
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,150
Aunt.

780
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,870
Thank you.

781
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:29,770
I'm sorry.

782
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,530
Don't say that.

783
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,470
Yuan Shanqing, let's go.

784
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,620
We'll wait for you.

785
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:40,820
Go.

786
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,150
I remember the lyrics

787
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,380
of the song we used to sing when we were little.

788
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,770
Little ones are seldom worried.

789
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,380
They're surrounded by sunshine.

790
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,030
Little ones are seldom worried.

791
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,750
Let's hope we can always be like this.

792
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,630
Many years later, I asked Cheng Yaya

793
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,190
why he was so impulsive

794
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,970
to take the blame for Yuan Shanqing.

795
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:41,850
He told me

796
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:44,100
he wasn't being impulsive.

797
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,350
We can't imagine

798
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,320
[Qingya]

799
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,510
how Shanqing

800
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:48,830
faced the unknown fate

801
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,560
in the detention center alone.

802
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:53,530
If

803
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,620
I have superpowers,

804
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,190
I want to lock us

805
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:59,390
in the kindergarten.

806
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:01,470
No one is allowed to grow up.
