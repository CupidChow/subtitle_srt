00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,460
"The Same Old Song".

193
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,820
Congratulations, everyone.

194
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,320
An amazing job!

195
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,520
Come on.

196
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,830
The second one is

197
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,670
The folk dance piece "Young Lady".

198
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,400
It's okay.

199
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,080
There's one more spot left.

200
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,440
And lastly,

201
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,720
the third one is

202
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,190
the musical

203
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,170
"I am the next

204
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,520
proud roughneck".

205
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,070
Director.

206
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,270
Practice hard, okay?

207
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,360
Director.

208
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,040
Why didn't our show get chosen?

209
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,390
What do you think?

210
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,750
Is it because Li Si didn't dance well?

211
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,280
He got injured two days ago.

212
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,900
I just got discharged.

213
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,960
I usually dance better than this.

214
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,000
The three of you

215
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,950
are given grace to be allowed

216
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,750
in the preliminary round today.

217
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
You guys cheated in your final exam.

218
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,410
Day after day,

219
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,030
you're just up to shady business.

220
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,740
Now you even dare to sing and dance?

221
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,540
Why don't you work on your studies and discipline?

222
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,380
Your qualification for the preliminary round is cancel.

223
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,830
Wait for the punishment to be announced.

224
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,310
I...

225
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,640
Congratulations.

226
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,370
Congratulations to our choir.

227
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,130
You must continue to practice hard

228
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,310
and bring glory to the school.

229
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,150
Do you hear me?

230
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,380
Yes.

231
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,310
I'm in huge trouble because of you two.

232
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:19,950
I've never ever scored zero

233
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,430
in my whole life.

234
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,410
I did,

235
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,190
and it was in third grade.

236
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,290
I even ran away from home that time.

237
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,080
How can I bring this home to sign?

238
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,550
How about we sign for each other?

239
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,430
We'll be screwed if we bring this home.

240
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,760
What do you think, Miao?

241
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,130
Alright, Miao.

242
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,490
Stop worrying about it.

243
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,350
The three of us

244
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,500
can't even participate in

245
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,370
the performance in the oilfield.

246
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,620
We rehearsed for nothing.

247
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,830
Bought the clothes for nothing too.

248
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,530
Xiaofang

249
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,070
has already given us zero marks.

250
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,990
Now she doesn't even let us perform?

251
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,550
I know right?

252
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,870
It's fine if she doesn't let us perform.

253
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,590
But why does she need say it in front of everyone?

254
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,750
She did it on purpose.

255
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,860
What's the big deal?

256
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,250
Isn't it just performing a show in Qingdao?

257
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,180
We're not going!

258
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,910
It's Hong Kong's handover.

259
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,280
What's the point of performing in Qingdao

260
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,330
as if it's the actual event?

261
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,530
If you're capable, go to Hong Kong then.

262
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,450
You want to go Hong Kong?

263
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,600
Yes.

264
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,830
I haven't been able

265
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,750
to swallow my anger these past couple of days.

266
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,030
I kept thinking

267
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,860
what can I do

268
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,800
to turn this around?

269
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,630
All Xiaofang wanted

270
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,210
was to embarrass us in public.

271
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,810
So I have to create some drama

272
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,110
to fight against her.

273
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,580
Yes.

274
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,870
Create what drama?

275
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,890
I don't know yet.

276
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,750
But Yaya came up with it.

277
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,550
Hitting the vital part directly.

278
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,350
Come on, Cheng Yaya.

279
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:43,860
Tell me.

280
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,590
How did you come up with this idea to go to Hong Kong,

281
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,940
which is such a grand decision?

282
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,420
Wait.

283
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,380
What do you mean?

284
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,620
Weren't you the one who said it?

285
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,750
Well said.

286
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,340
Waking up the dreamer with one sentence.

287
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,120
On July 1st, 1997,

288
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,810
they will be singing the song of Linqi in Qingdao

289
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,510
and dancing to
Clouds of the South,

290
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,630
while we are at

291
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,880
the crossroads in Hong Kong Central,

292
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,380
becoming the ones

293
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,660
to witness the very moment of history

294
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,950
with our bare eyes.

295
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,230
And then, get to meet the Four Heavenly Kings

296
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,690
and take photos with them!

297
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,720
I want to shake Zhou Huimin's hand.

298
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,550
All these are possible.

299
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,830
When we come back,

300
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,320
let alone Linqi No.2 High School,

301
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,450
the entire Linqi Oilfield

302
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,710
has to look up to us.

303
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,440
I think you all are sick,

304
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,160
severely sick.

305
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,160
Cheng Yaya.

306
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,710
Cheng Yaya, where are you going?

307
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,880
[Shudu Restaurant]

308
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,700
Come on, Yaya.

309
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,230
Come in.

310
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,150
Hurry up.

311
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,960
Si.

312
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,020
Have a seat.

313
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
I talked too much.

314
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,990
I'll make up for it.

315
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,790
I understand.

316
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,550
No, you don't.

317
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,300
As long as you're here,

318
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,500
there's nothing being misunderstood.

319
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,940
I hereby announce,

320
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,240
in celebration of it's handover,

321
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,950
we are heading Hong Kong,

322
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,460
Linqi's four-man group is officially established.

323
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,860
Team Leader, Cheng Yaya.

324
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,610
Let's think of a way.

325
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,840
There's none at all/

326
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:21,970
Yaya.

327
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,110
Since young,

328
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,170
how did I treat you?

329
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:26,790
Fine.

330
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,260
Enough.

331
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,950
Stop being sentimental.

332
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,900
Sit down, Yaya.

333
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,130
You know

334
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,150
what's up with the three of us.

335
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,690
And, you know your sister's personality well.

336
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,280
If she doesn't win this round,

337
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,880
she'll become mentally ill.

338
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,720
Yaya.

339
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,600
You always travel for competitions

340
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,510
and have gone on long trips before.

341
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,440
You have experience.

342
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,900
You're the only one who can help us this time.

343
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,430
And do you know

344
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,430
how much this table of dishes costs?

345
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,510
Miaomiao.

346
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,510
Don’t raise the topic of money.

347
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,840
It's cheap and damages our relationship.

348
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,310
Amongst the entire oilfield,

349
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,710
Yaya is one of the most intelligent person.

350
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,600
So this time,

351
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,870
whether the special operation to Hong Kong

352
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,710
can succeed

353
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,470
depends on whether Yaya

354
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,630
is willing to help.

355
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,620
Yaya.

356
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,430
I guarantee you.

357
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,550
If you are willing to take part

358
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,550
in this operation,

359
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,880
I promise

360
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,720
to sponsor you

361
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,940
a year worth of tokens

362
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,230
in the arcades.

363
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,090
I refuse.

364
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,730
If Yaya is not helping,

365
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,210
I don't think we can possibly go to Hong Kong.

366
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,960
I think we still have to go.

367
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,490
Xiaofang is still furious.

368
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,030
Whether we go or not,

369
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,230
she won't forgive us.

370
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,390
If we make a self-criticism in front of the whole school,

371
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,490
we'll be doomed.

372
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,630
You don't have to worry about that.

373
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,740
I'm here.

374
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,910
I'll take care of your reflections.

375
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,710
When it comes to writing reflections, if I, Li Si, claim to be the best,

376
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,400
no one dares to be the second.

377
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,310
Forget it.

378
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,680
Don't involve us in embarrassing things.

379
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,540
Why are you embarrassed of me?

380
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,599
Are you really on a hunger strike?

381
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,250
Have some noodles.

382
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,109
I beg you.

383
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,270
Can you stop thinking about Hong Kong?

384
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,400
I have no interest in going at all.

385
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,730
That shabby place, what's there to visit?

386
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,100
It doesn't matter.

387
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,330
Fine.

388
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,390
As long as you can get over it.

389
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,310
Cheng Yaya,

390
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,230
what do you mean?

391
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,660
Nothing.

392
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,290
If you're not eating, can't I eat?

393
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:03,680
Are you trying to piss me off?

394
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,400
Get out!

395
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,670
You just said you weren't angry.

396
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,720
Why are you so angry now?

397
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,790
Cheng Yaya,

398
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,070
you deliberately set me up,

399
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,770
and now you're not helping me either.

400
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,430
I'm telling you,

401
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,990
I'll be your sworn enemy.

402
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,670
Miaomiao.

403
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,130
I admit that I hurt you in the exam incident.

404
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:18,910
But I really can't help you

405
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,980
to go to Hong Kong.

406
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,230
Do you know how big this thing is?

407
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,390
Do you understand?

408
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,270
I want to prove that

409
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,150
no matter

410
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:25,800
how difficult this is,

411
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,750
I, Cheng Miaomiao,

412
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,750
am able to do it well

413
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,710
and make everyone

414
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,630
surprised.

415
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,870
Didn't you say you don't want to eat?

416
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,410
It's none of your business.

417
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,770
Slow down.

418
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,090
Did you purposely buy it for me?

419
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,270
Who else cares about you if I don't?

420
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:54,830
You can count on me

421
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,090
for this Hong Kong trip.

422
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:56,710
Otherwise,

423
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,060
I can't imagine how much trouble you'll make.

424
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,050
Really?

425
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,800
If you go back on your word,

426
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,930
I won't forgive you.

427
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,910
Linchuan Train Station

428
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,630
is the nearest train station to us.

429
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,270
So we need to first take the bus

430
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,600
to Linchuan Train Station,

431
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,430
and then,

432
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,910
take the train coded 235

433
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,670
departing at 11:15 a.m. to Qingdao.

434
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,590
We'll reach Qingdao

435
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,990
at 2:27 in the afternoon.

436
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,270
From Qingdao,

437
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,950
we need to take the train coded 3726

438
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,160
at 8:17 p.m.

439
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,890
to Shenzhen.

440
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,500
We'll arrive at Shenzhen

441
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,190
at 10:41 a.m. on the third day.

442
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,830
The trip totals to 38 hours

443
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,960
and 15 minutes.

444
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,800
At last, we have to cross the borders from Shenzhen to Hong Kong.

445
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,920
That's so complicated.

446
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,880
This is just a route.

447
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,630
The process of crossing the borders from Shenzhen to Hong Kong

448
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,100
is the most troublesome part.

449
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,080
I've consulted them.

450
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,550
As of now, we can only follow tour groups

451
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,300
to Hong Kong.

452
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,640
So the first thing we need to do

453
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,310
upon reaching Shenzhen

454
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,570
is to find a travel agency

455
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,550
and submit information to them to sign up.

456
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,170
Only then we stand a chance

457
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,740
to go to Hong Kong.

458
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,890
We even need to find a travel agency?

459
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,790
The most important thing about

460
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,350
applying to a travel agency is

461
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,820
to provide our ID.

462
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,660
So we must bring along our household register.

463
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,000
So we even have to steal our household register?

464
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:03,720
Yes.

465
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,210
After solving these problems,

466
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,230
we have to solve

467
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,020
the most pressing issue,

468
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,360
fundings.

469
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,720
Train tickets, accommodations,

470
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,780
and travel agency,

471
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,120
are not a small amount.

472
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,520
How much will these cost?

473
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,790
[Total cost: 2421 dollars]

474
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,870
This much.

475
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,750
You won't even earn this much

476
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,020
by selling me away.

477
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,680
It's so hard to go on a trip.

478
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,960
These are just conservative estimates.

479
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,540
In reality, it should be much more difficult.

480
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,180
We...

481
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,830
If this doesn't work,

482
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,590
why don't we go somewhere else?

483
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,670
We don't have to go to Hong Kong

484
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,910
to win a round.

485
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,060
How about

486
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,910
going to Qingdao?

487
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,730
You're useless.

488
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,860
You retreat once you face minor difficulties.

489
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,610
Who can we rely on for this difficult task?

490
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,540
Me.

491
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,500
How fun it is to challenge the difficult?

492
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,180
The key problem now

493
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,650
is that we don't know

494
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,910
where our household register is hidden.

495
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,850
It's in the bedroom cabinet.

496
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,740
How do you know?

497
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,560
I've seen it.

498
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,750
I know where it is.

499
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,190
That's easy.

500
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,200
There's a lock though.

501
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,210
The cabinet is locked?

502
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,670
Hey, it is your own house after all.

503
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,070
If you had observed more,

504
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,550
you wouldn't be so dumb.

505
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,670
Why would I observe

506
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,070
my parents' cabinet for no reason?

507
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,190
Do you think everyone is like you?

508
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,110
Always so cunning,

509
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,840
scheming something every day.

510
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,850
You're honest. You do it yourself.

511
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,150
That's not what I meant.

512
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,420
I'm praising you, aren't I?

513
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,390
I'm praising you for being smart.

514
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,140
I'm too stupid.

515
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,710
In the future,

516
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,310
I would need to observe more.

517
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,950
You can't handle the problem yourself

518
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,950
but you won't even back down verbally.

519
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,410
Yes, you are right. I'll correct myself.

520
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,200
I'll listen to you for this one

521
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,510
as long as you don't betray me.

522
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,240
You won't...

523
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,610
My bad.

524
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,050
I worry too much again.

525
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,230
Our blood runs thicker than water.

526
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,990
We are on the same boat now,

527
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,630
right?

528
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,680
We should trust each other.

529
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,350
Locking up things in your own house.

530
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,540
Who are you protecting against?

531
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,670
With our financial level,

532
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,070
even thieves don't care to steal from us.

533
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,870
Thieves don't but you do.

534
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,500
Let me try other keys.

535
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,250
Miaomiao, I'm back.

536
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,560
Mom.

537
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,520
Mom.

538
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,560
You're back.

539
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,720
What mistake did you make this time?

540
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,440
Why are you interrogating me as soon as you came back?

541
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,890
What mistake can I make?

542
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,870
You're acting different and started revising.

543
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,240
It makes me nervous.

544
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,200
Mom, don't be nervous.

545
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,330
I asked her to study.

546
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,160
You should have guided your sister

547
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,120
to the right path long ago.

548
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,480
Blood is thicker than water.

549
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,310
You can't keep watching her

550
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,790
fail in the shadows.

551
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,950
Mom, don't get overboard.

552
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:29,870
Studying doesn't work,

553
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,700
not studying doesn't work either.

554
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,090
Alright, I'll stop here.

555
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:32,940
Continue studying.

556
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,790
Keep it up.

557
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,910
Why didn't you two change your shoes?

558
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,670
Mom, why are you back so early?

559
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,580
Aren't you rehearsing?

560
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,380
Did it..

561
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,120
Don't mention it.

562
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,870
I didn't make it to the program.

563
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,910
I even bought

564
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,310
such an expensive dress.

565
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,180
Forget it.

566
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,860
I don't want to rehearse anyway.

567
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,860
It's more tiring than going to work.

568
00:23:59,010 --> 00:23:59,650
Mom.

569
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,720
Why don't you fight harder for it?

570
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,490
You learnt Cantonese for nothing then?

571
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,870
Why should I learn that?

572
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:05,870
Not like I'm going to Hong Kong.

573
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,710
I think your singing

574
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,680
is really good.

575
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,180
But in terms of speaking Cantonese,

576
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,190
you indeed are not as good as

577
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,510
the Cantonese daughter-in-law next door.

578
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,190
How about dancing?

579
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,240
A sing-and-dance performance.

580
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,760
What do you think?

581
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,360
Together with Aunty Hu and Aunty Niu,

582
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
how great will the visual impact be?

583
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,570
Daiyu,

584
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,300
that's better than singing.

585
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,020
Turn around now. Turn.

586
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:47,850
That's right.

587
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,510
Three.

588
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,420
Four.

589
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,160
Five, six, seven.

590
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,970
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

591
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,810
♫Never mind♫

592
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,270
I quit.

593
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:57,970
What is this?

594
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,600
Don't stop, mom.

595
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,490
♫Who's unhappy♫

596
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,430

601
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,300

602
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,900

604
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,550

Snap towards the bottom.

606
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,720
♫I don't need your company in my space♫

607
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,280
One on each side.

608
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,640
Yes. Once to the bottom. That's right.

609
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,630
Once to the top.

610
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,660
♫I'm rebellious in my heart♫

611
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,550

Another one to the bottom.

613
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,550
After this, swipe over your head.

614
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,830
Swipe over your head.

Amazing, mom.

622
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,630
Next.

623
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,470
The next move.

624
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,570
♫Stay out of it♫

625
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,660

Let's do it again.

629
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,190
Okay. One more time from the top.

630
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,150
Come on.

631
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,150
Where is the household register?

632
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,590
By the way, Yang,

633
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,380
I received a phone call

634
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,990
in the afternoon when I was back from work.

635
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,590
Right after I answered the phone, they hung up.

636
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,440
I was afraid they had something urgent to tell you

637
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,870
so I called them back.

638
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,190
But they didn't pick up.

639
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,960
I'm not sure why was that.

640
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,390
Did they call the wrong number?

641
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:16,380
Really?

642
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,980
What do you mean?

643
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,480
Nothing.

644
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,760
Wrong number it is.

645
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,150
Why are you feeling guilty?

646
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:25,710
Wait.

647
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,130
What do you mean I'm feeling guilty?

648
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:28,510
I...

649
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,840
How many times have I told you,

650
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,530
don't leave the socks everywhere.

651
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,530
And these shoes.

652
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,290
I've told you

653
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,560
to throw them away, haven't I?

654
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,670
You always wear shabby shoes.

655
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,410
Aren't you afraid of being laughed at?

656
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,350
Hu Yue,

657
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,870
what are you trying to say?

658
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,470
What's wrong with me?

659
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,200
What did I do?

660
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,840
I've been working

661
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,250
day and night for 20 days straight.

662
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,060
I finally get to come back and rest for a few days

663
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,120
and you're insulting me here and there.

664
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,910
What do you want?

665
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,440
Sure, sure, sure. You're exhausted.

666
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,010
You're exhausted.

667
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:50,920
Don't be angry, can you?

668
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,120
How can I not be angry?

669
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,570
Then don't take your anger out on me.

670
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,210
So what if I'm mad at you?

671
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,930
If I'm not mad at you, I...

672
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,370
Came back from school?

673
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,360
Mom.

674
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,930
Can I look at our household register?

675
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,680
What for?

676
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,230
Nothing.

677
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,870
Grandma told me last time

678
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,040
that the four of us

679
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,560
are on two separate household registers.

680
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,520
One for the Yang family

681
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,720
and one for you and me.

682
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,090
Yang.

683
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,320
What does your mother mean for saying this?

684
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,590
Your grandma must have mistaken.

685
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,310
Look.

686
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,540
Yang Tao.

687
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,970
His household register has moved to his college.

688
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,380
He has his own one.

689
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,520
The three of us share one.

690
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,850
That's why we have two.

691
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,840
It's okay. Two is fine.

692
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,760
We don't share the same surname anyway.

693
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,820
It doesn't matter.

694
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,500
Don't say it doesn't matter.

695
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,900
Wait a minute.

696
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,760
Wait a minute.

697
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:02,970
Here.

698
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,540
See for yourself.

699
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,330
Look.

700
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,370
Aren't the names together?

701
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,960
Grandma got it wrong.

702
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,980
It's a misunderstanding.

703
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,550
Here.

704
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,270
How could that be possible?

705
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,700
I'll put it here.

706
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,840
Good.

707
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,720
The first step is completed.

708
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,380
Let's move on to the second step.

709
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,180
What's that?

710
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,420
Money.

711
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,910
This is...

712
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,260
The money I got from selling my dad's cigarettes and alcohol.

713
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,650
You stole your dad's cigarettes and alcohol again?

714
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,990
Haven't you been beaten enough?

715
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,910
You forgot you were crippled for half a month last time?

716
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,230
I worked smart this time.

717
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,770
I've observed for a long time.

718
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,600
He left these cigarettes and alcohol

719
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,830
in the cabinet for two months.

720
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,340
He won't even notice

721
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,500
if I take it away.

722
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,510
Besides,

723
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,520
the main reason I sell off the cigarettes and alcohol

724
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,250
is to make him

725
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,450
smoke and drink less.

726
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,580
It's for his health.

727
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,510
You're making excuses for your bad deeds.

728
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,960
You deserve to be beaten up.

729
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
I did it for the three of us, didn't I?

730
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,070
I did it

731
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,200
so that we have extra money

732
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,610
for this long trip, didn't I?

733
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,680
Like what my grandma said,

734
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,140
bring more money when you're away from home.

735
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,640
Alright.

736
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,470
Now, what we need to do is

737
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,330
save money while do our homework.

738
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,960
What homework?

739
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,000
We're going to Shenzhen and Hong Kong.

740
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,530
People there are used to speaking Cantonese.

741
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,000
Do you speak Cantonese?

742
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,950
Can you understand Cantonese?

743
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,730
How much do you know

744
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,850
about Hong Kong?

745
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,530
If you don't do your homework well,

746
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,520
even if you're there, you can't do much.

747
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,440
That's wise.

748
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,720
You hit the bull's eye.

749
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:46,950
Well,

750
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,510

You just need to practice a few more times.

00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,610
I think you two should go ahead.

00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,540
I don't want to hold you up.

I can't dance well.

No, you're good.

769
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,390
I'll apply some for you

770
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,430
and you'll gain some confidence.

771
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:39,850
Yes.

772
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,120
You'll be confident with lipstick on.

773
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,280
Just put it on.

774
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,380
Yang is not here anyway.

775
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,400
Yang doesn't care whether I wear makeup or not.

776
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,550
I am the one who don't like wearing lipstick.

777
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,640
Alright, stop being stubborn.

He's actually quite nice to me.

782
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,290
In what way is he nice to you?

783
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,560
He can't even talk to you properly.

784
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,080

we'll have to divorce 800 times.

788
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,940

The ones heading to Linchuan Train Station,

943
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:40,590
if you haven't gotten on the bus,

944
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,300
hurry up and get on.

945
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:43,710
You got the ticket?

946
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,450
Is it at the back?

947
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:50,840
Ticket.

948
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,250
Slow down.

949
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,640
We can't escape

950
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,270
the beating this time round.

951
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,120
Go ahead.

952
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,750
Have I not gotten it enough?

953
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,350
We're not running away from home.

954
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,570
We're simply on a

955
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,850
vacation internship.

956
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,240
We're already seventeen

957
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,660
and we have not left this place once.

958
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,460
Why can't we go outside and see the mountains

959
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,080
and the sea?

960
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,160
The world is so big.

961
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,530
Let's go and have a look.

962
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:42,240
♫Never mind♫

963
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,290
♫Who's unhappy♫

964
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,270
♫Get used to doing my own thing♫

965
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,260
♫If you leave♫

966
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,260
♫I don't care♫

967
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:56,460
♫I don't need your company in my space♫

968
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,670
♫I'm rebellious in my heart♫

969
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,080
Si.

970
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:02,910
What's wrong?

971
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,840
I want to use the toilet.

972
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,430
Hang in there.

973
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,730
We're almost at the train station.

974
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,210
I can't hold it in anymore.

975
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,880
Sir.

976
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,360
Please stop over at the tree.

977
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,120
Our first time running away from home

978
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,280
is to go to Hong Kong.

979
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,050
We were ignorant and crazy.

980
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,280
We did all the preparation we needed

981
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,770
to go to the big city.

982
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:36,350
Cheng Yaya made a full plan.

983
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,510
The plan was 19 pages long.

984
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,170
His smart brain

985
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,050
thought about all possibilities

986
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,620
except

987
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,810
Li Si attacking

988
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,700
the hornet's nest with his urine.

989
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:47,890
People nowadays

990
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,010
can see the world

991
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,450
through your phones.

992
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:52,310
But, back in the days,

993
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,410
broadening our horizon

994
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:55,710
is a luxury

995
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,250
to a kid from the rurals.

996
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,130
I've been to many places after growing up.

997
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,390
But no one have since accompanied me

998
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,590
carrying my backpack

999
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,950
and sing the song "Alone to Have Fun".
