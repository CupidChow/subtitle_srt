He even scratched others.

9
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,640
Look at the wound.

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,289
You only know how to tell on him.

11
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:55,150
Fight back if you dare.

12

I'm a reserve of the young pioneers.

13
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,910
I have to be civilized and not fight with others.

14
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,750
You're right.

15
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,350
Miaomiao,

16
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,520
what did I tell you?

17
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,050
Be reasonable when conflicts arise.

18
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,030
Even if you win a fight,

19
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,750
does that mean you're in the right?

20
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,880
Does crying all the time make it right?

21
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,510
Son,

22
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,190
listen to me.

23
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,470
If anyone dares to bully you in the future,

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,360
fight back.

25
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,350
If you beat them a few more times,

26
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,090
no one will dare to bully you anymore.

27
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,220
Why are you heightening the conflict?

28
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,670
Also, the kids may be out of line

They can solve it themselves.

34
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,760
Parents shouldn't get involved.

48
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:57,610
It was too sudden.

00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,550
Why didn't he kick me?

If he dares to kick you,

Fight.

194
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,230
Goodbye, teachers.

195
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,340
Yaya.

196
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,980
Why are you here?

197
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,970
Where is the guy who hit you?

198
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,260
We were fighting each other.

199
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,470
Look at you, were you two fighting each other?

200
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,110
Obviously he hit you.

201
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,430
His face is swollen.

202
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,909
I don't care if his face is swollen.

203
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:52,790
Where is he?

204
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,210
He's writing an apology letter in the office.

205
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,620
What are you going to do?

206
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,159
What am I going to do?

207
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,750
I want him to pay for

208
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,780
bullying my brother.

209
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,370
I have to teach him a lesson.

210
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,150
Let me tell you once again.

211
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,510
We were fighting each other.

212
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,910
Mind your own business.

213
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,510
Qiang Xiaowa,

214
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,830
you helped us before

215
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,159
and we also thanked you.

216
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:36,710
Forget it if you don't appreciate it.

217
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,950
But you hit me.

218
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,630
Do you think you can poop on my neck

219
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,159
because you helped me once?

220
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,290
I'll give you two choices now.

221
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,510
First,

222
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,720
apologize.

223
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,030
Second,

224
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,910
we fight one-on-one.

225
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,030
Babao.

226
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,230
Here.

227
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,240
Come here.

228
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,830
What are you doing?

229
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,710
We fight one-on-one,

230
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,470
what does it have to do with

231
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,330
other people? I mean, other dogs.

232
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,200
Ask the dog to leave first.

233
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,920
Do you not dare?

234
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,380
Apologize if you don't dare.

235
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:25,800
One-on-one.

236
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,430
Why are you here?

237
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,100
You left right away after school.

238
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,260
I know you well.

239
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,050
Go ahead.

240
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,040
I'll take you to the hospital if you're hurt.

241
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,310
Okay.

242
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,590
Today, for the sake

243
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,790
of the girl pleading for you,

244
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,990
I'll spare your life.

245
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,300
Keep a low profile in No. 2 High School in the future.

246
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,230
You won't be so lucky in the future.

247
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,760
Babao, come on.

248
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,470
No more fighting?

249
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,230
Mr. Gao said

250
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,530
fighting won't solve the problem.

251
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,980
But it won't be over.

252
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,900
He bullied you,

253
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,180
that means he's provoking me.

254
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,840
No one is gonna lay a finger on you while I'm here.

255
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,760
It's not fair to take a dog along with him.

256
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,220
He brought a helper today.

257
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,310
Your disadvantage is you don't have a dog.

258
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,800
Fine.

259
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,630
Next time, I'll bring you the two large dogs

260
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,390
in the yard.

261
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,310
Two. We'll win for sure, okay?

262
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,190
Don't mention those two dogs.

263
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,620
Those two dogs have become fat like pigs.

264
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,670
Let's go home and eat Big Plate Chicken.

265
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,000
What Big Plate Chicken?

266
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,720
I have to keep an eye on Cheng Yaya.

267
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,270
None of you

268
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,630
can put me at ease.

269
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,950
No one won in a fight.

270
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:40,750
Why do you say that?

271
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,350
Did you win?

272
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,350
He ambushed me.

273
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,940
[Video Arcade]

274
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,910
Boss, I want a bottle of soda.

275
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:58,950
One more.

276
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,150
Daguo.

277
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,120
Good for you.

278
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,070
You didn't go home after school

279
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,040
but played video games here.

280
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,510
Does your dad know about it?

281
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,350
I'll go back in a while.

282
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,350
Don't tell my dad.

283
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,690
I won't.

284
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,030
I'm on night duty tonight,

285
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,030
but I haven't gone yet.

286
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,230
If your dad finds out,

287
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,310
I'll be scolded.

288
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,030
Let's play together.

289
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,000
Have fun.

290
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,660
I'll play inside.

291
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
Do you have money?

292
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,630
How much?

293
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,330
Just lend me 100 yuan.

294
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,960
I'll pay you back later.

295
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,640
I don't have 100 yuan.

296
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,760
I only have 80 yuan.

297
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,390
Okay.

298
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,550
I'll return it to you later.

299
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,910
You...

300
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,380
Look at him,

301
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,510
he always had a nosebleed when he was young.

302
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,950
It's hard for him to get well.

303
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:51,990
Now he fell.

304
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,590
Will he relapse?

305
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,710
It's no big deal, Mom.

306
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,720
What do you mean?

307
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,600
It's no big deal. His nose is fine.

308
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,310
It's just a minor injury.

309
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,030
I told you that he's not good

310
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,910
at sports.

311
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,310
He could even fall when he walked.

312
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,590
Something is wrong with your cerebellar development.

313
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,590
I think your cerebrum has a problem.

314
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,330
I won't play with you anymore.

315
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,130
For goodness' sake.

316
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,030
Do you...

317
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,470
Do you want to go to a big hospital?

318
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,480
-No need.
-He's fine.

319
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,500
I told you.

320
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,670
Go to the fridge

321
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,590
and get me some ice cubes.

322
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,390
I'll put them on his wound.

323
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,060
Okay.

324
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,310
Tell me the truth.

325
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,710
Did you fight?

326
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,530
No.

327
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,820
I fell while walking.

328
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,310
Where are the ice cubes?

329
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,270
I can't find them.

330
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,510
Look carefully.

331
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,030
I'm a doctor.

332
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,790
Do you think I can't tell

333
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,430
whether you fell

334
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,290
or were beaten up by someone else?

335
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,380
Why did you fight?

336
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,050
For justice.

337
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,350
Come on.

338
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,590
Come on.

339
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,870
Are you still playing?

340
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:07,720
Daguo.

341
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,190
I borrowed 80 yuan from you.

342
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,850
Now I'll pay you back 100 yuan.

343
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,670
Steady, huh?

344
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,150
One hundred?

345
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,550
What game did you play?

346
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,950
Why are you making money?

347
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,790
Inside there...

348
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,910
Inside there?

349
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm leaving.

350
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,150
Go home early.

351
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,530
Senior, give me an idea.

352
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,360
What should I do?

353
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,260
What should you do?

354
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,210
Didn't they threaten each other

355
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,670
not to leave after school?

356
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,550
From today onwards,

357
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,430
nobody can leave

358
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,620
after school.

00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,710
Hand in your homework.

[Students on duty this week: Cheng Yaya, Luo Zheng]

361
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,310
Why are you more injured

362
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,110
than them?

363
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,840
I want to know the answer too.

364
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,350
I went to play the peacemaker,

365
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,080
but Luo Zheng beat me up.

366
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,030
What did I do wrong?

367
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,510
All the misfortunes have happened to me.

00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,840

Good afternoon, teacher.

372
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,440
Hello, everyone. Please sit down.

373

-Let's continue with...

Why do you always come at the exact time of the class?

-I'm sorry.
-Come in.

Don't ever do that next time.

about the sun and the solar system.

382
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,630
Okay.

383
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,710
Before we start our class,

384
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,990
I want to ask you,

385
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,340
do you know

386
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,630
what the sun's role is

387
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,110
in our daily lives?

388
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,770
Where are your shoe covers?

389
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,490
I don't know that we have to put the shoe covers on.

390
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,280
You must put the shoe covers on in the computer lab.

391
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,420
Everyone wears them.

392
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,880
Why are you the exception?

393
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,230
I don't have shoe covers.

394
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:04,970
I quit.

395
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,490
Hey, you.

396
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,970
How can you quit like that?

397
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,050
What's your name?

398
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,620
[Are you okay?]

399
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,030
[I'm fine. Don't worry.]

400
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:46,530
Come here.

401
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,680
Why did you come to our class?

402
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,240
And what is this?

403
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,120
A dumbbell.

404
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,940
What are you doing with the dumbbell?

405
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,850
Beat him up.

406
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,630
He hit you before,

407
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,740
it can't be over like that.

408
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,670
His parents didn't teach him well.

409
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,710
Don't embarrass yourself.

410
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,620
Go back to your class.

411
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,550
Am I embarrassing myself?

412
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,079
I'm taking revenge for you.

413
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,470
I'm 16.

414
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,390
I don't need my sister to help me

415
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,069
when I fight with others.

416
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,589
I'm gonna help you even if you're 60.

417
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,470
Let's go.

418
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,990
Stop looking.

419
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,300
-Let's go.
-Is that Yuan Shanqing?

420
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,630
You're so nosy. Go away.

421
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,790
You're useless.

422
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,859
How many times have I told you?

423
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,230
Look at you.

424
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,569
Not only don't you cut your hair,

425
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,990
but you also don't wear your school uniform.

426
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,230
Now you don't even have shoe covers.

427
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,360
And you just skipped the class at will.

428
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,100
Now I understand.

429
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,540
You're the person with the most freedom

430
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,760
in Linqi No. 2 High School.

431
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,090
You are more carefree than the principal.

432
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,270
Say something.

433
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,910
You don't even speak Mandarin well, right?

434
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,070
Kid,

435
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,800
please give me some feedback.

436
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,510
Only two-way communication can show that

437
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,000
we respect each other.

438
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,700
Right?

439
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,200
Director.

440
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,170
Mr. Gao, you're just in time.

441
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:05,970
Come here.

442
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,720
The three of us

443
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,120
should solve this today.

444
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,630
What is it?

445
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,630
What is it?

446
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,670
It's a matter from head to toe.

447
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,910
Not only was he rude,

448
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,030
but he also skipped Ms. Huang's class.

449
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,270
We invited Ms. Huang

450
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,200
from the bureau.

451
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,470
It's only one computer class a week.

452
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,430
We invited her specially

453
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,610
for the science and technology academic development.

454
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,310
Director,

455
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,150
you have a point.

456
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,720
He has skipped

457
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,720
Ms. Huang's class.

458
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,970
Then let's not stop him from attending

459
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,210
Ms. Han's class.

460
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,750
Let's solve it after class.

461
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,760
The most important thing now

462
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,920
is to go back to class.

463
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,610
The most important thing now

464
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,690
-is to solve his...
-Qiang Xiaowa.

465
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,620
Go back to class.

466
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,630
-Qiang Xiaowa, you…
-Director.

467
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,750
We can talk alone.

468
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,120
Thank you, teachers.

469
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,540
Look.

470
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,310
He's so polite.

471
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,110
He treats me differently.

472
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,520
Have you watched King of Gamblers?

473
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,650
Don't underestimate

474
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,920
the poker cards.

475
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,030
There's a big secret inside.

476
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,640
What is it?

477
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,110
When I throw it up in the air,

478
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,550
I can grab two Aces

479
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,990
at the drop of a hat.

480
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,990
Why are you practicing this?

481
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,510
I found a shortcut

482
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,990
to achieve financial freedom.

483
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,990
How did you drive?

484
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,110
The road is so wide. How could you hit the car?

485
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,030
Your car?

486
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,330
Whose else could it be if not mine?

487
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,780
How did you drive?

488
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,190
The road is so wide, yet you hit the car.

489
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,530
But you parked on the bridge.

490
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,470
You hit my car.

491
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,030
Yet you think you're right.

492
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,630
-I…
-Do you know how to drive?

493
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,350
You hit us,

494
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,290
-yet you think you're right!
-Yeah.

495
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,350
You have big eyes.

496
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,590
Are you blind?

497
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,510
I honked you a few times.

498
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,350
Don't you know how to dodge?

499
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,230
Who are you calling blind?

500
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,270
I haven't seen villains

501
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,950
like you for a long time.

502
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,790
Do you know?

503
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,230
Who are you pointing at?

504
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,750
Who are you pointing at?

505
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,390
What do you mean?

506
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:21,880
What do you mean?

507
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,510
What do you mean?

508
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,030
What do you mean?

509
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,110
Don't you dare lay a finger on me.

510
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,470
Don't you dare lay a finger on him.

511
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,030
Well...

512
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,550
Get lost!

513
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,420
You hit him!

514
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,410
You hit him!

515
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,750
Auntie,

516
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,190
did you

517
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,460
pick your ears again?

518
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,140
You see, I'm treating you,

519
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,370
but you pick your ears every day.

520
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,770
How can you recover?

521
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,470
If you want to talk to me,

522
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,230
just come.

523
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,960
Can you stop picking your ears?

524
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,390
Dr. Cheng,

525
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,030
your brother-in-law called me

526
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,490
and said he was hit by a car.

527
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,650
Listen.

528
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,420
I've been practicing martial arts since young.

529
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,820
I'll lock you here today.

530
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,680
Don't you dare lay a finger on me.

531
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,760
Don't bluff.

532
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,540
As if you can move.

533
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,280
Move it.

534
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,230
I'll kill you.

535
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:09,700
Go to hell!

536
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,630
Don't grab my hair if you dare.

537
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,090
Don't hold around my neck.

538
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,350
You're grabbing hair

539
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,310
like a woman.

540
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,440
Aren't you ashamed?

541
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,270
-Baoshan?
-Who taught you that?

542
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,550
Why are you fighting?

543
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,470
Let go, you two.

544
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:21,870
Pengfei.

545
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:22,730
Stop fighting.

546
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,370
Ying didn't come with you?

547
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,590
She's so annoyed with you.

548
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,510
Let go, both of you.

549
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,110
Stop pulling.

550
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,370
He's under my control.

551
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,960
Why are you two

552
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,390
so childish?

553
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,070
How about this? I'll count to three.

554
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,430
You two let go together, okay?

555
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,870
Whoever cheats is a dog.

556
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,990
Deal.

557
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,150
One, two, three. Let go.

558
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,780
Give me back my shoe.

559
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,710
Give it back to me.

560
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,870
I'll count to three.

561
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,710
Let's throw them at the same time.

562
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,710
Whoever doesn't throw is a bastard.

563
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,440
Okay.

564
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,550
One, two, three.

565
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,870
Listen.

566
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,670
You should thank my brother-in-law.

567
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,480
If not,

568
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,150
I'll at least cripple your leg today.

569
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:02,870
-Enough.
-Do you know that?

570
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,950
God knows who will be crippled in the end.

571
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,550
Are you still not convinced?

572
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,240
You're like a child.

573
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,790
Pengfei, let me tell you.

574
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:10,720
He hit us with his car.

575
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,460
He should take full responsibility,

576
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,750
but he's still being unreasonable.

577
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,120
How can I spare him?

578
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,190
I... I was trying to avoid someone.

579
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,110
Who are you avoiding?

580
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,110
We were in our cars too.

581
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:18,470
Stop it.

582
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,990
Am I not a human?

583
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,080
I'm a living person here.

584
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,210
If we have a problem,

585
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,790
let's fix it, okay?

586
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,790
If we can't fix it,

587
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,640
call the police, right?

588
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,590
Let them handle it.

589
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,960
Both of you are fine, aren't you?

590
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,790
What's all the fuss about?

591
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,950
You're even blocking the road.

592
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,990
Dismiss, guys.

593
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,190
Everything is okay.

594
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,550
-He's fine.
-Pengfei.

595
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,550
I'm not fine.

596
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,720
What's wrong?

597
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,750
My head hit the glass.

598
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,630
I feel dizzy.

599
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,510
My limbs are weak.

600
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,310
Really.

601
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,070
I feel dizzy.

602
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,630
Are you okay?

603
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,190
I want a full body check-up.

604
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:42,880
Listen.

605
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,510
My brother-in-law

606
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,660
is the director of the staff hospital.

607
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,870
You're in big trouble today.

608
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,270
No, no.

609
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,510
I'm not the director.

610
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,670
You're a director, though you're an alternate.

611
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,510
Anyway, you knocked down

612
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,390
a director's family member today.

613
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,950
Just wait and see.

614
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,070
Zhang, go to the hospital. Hurry up.

615
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,000
Just wait.

616
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,060
What do you want?

617
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,520
I'll dump the garbage. You mop the floor.

618
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,390
What are you doing?

619
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,910
You always leave without a word.

620
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,310
Do you think you're cool?

621
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,550
Who doesn't know how to play it cool?

622
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:09,930
Fight with me?

623
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,090
You've got the wrong person.

624
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:15,830
Hit me?

625
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,790
Baoshan.

626
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,860
You hit your head?

627
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Is it serious?

628
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,820
Are there any other parts you got hurt?

629
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,950
Just a little dizzy.

630
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,190
Have you taken a CT scan?

631
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,850
Where is your brother-in-law?

632
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:28,580
Here.

633
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,720
I went to buy noodles for him.

634
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,430
Look at him, he's severely injured.

635
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,470
Did you take a CT scan for him?

636
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,070
Look.

637
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,910
Look at how hurt he is.

638
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:34,710
What's so serious?

639
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,030
He even asked for two bowls of noodles.

640
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,670
I haven't had the second bowl yet.

641
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,390
Pengfei, the noodles are a bit salty.

642
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,060
There's not much meat.

643
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,870
Uncle Tian's cooking

644
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:41,800
is not as good as before.

645
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,480
Fine.

646
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,230
I'll go to Uncle Tian later

647
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,620
and tell him what you said.

648
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,890
-Don't.
-See if he cooks noodles for you

649
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,220
when he comes next time.

650
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,060
It affects our relationship.

651
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:50,890
Wait, your head

652
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,010
wasn't injured.

653
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,650
Who wrapped this for you?

654
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,890
I'm doing this to be seen by the driver.

655
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,710
You...

656
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:58,670
Yu.

657
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,550
You scared me.

658
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,160
I thought it was a very serious car accident.

659
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,450
For goodness' sake.

660
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,390
When I got the call,

661
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,110
I was so scared that my legs were weak.

662
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,660
My hands were sweaty.

663
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,510
Yu, I'm blessed.

664
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,630
What could happen to me?

665
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,340
Did you forget that it rained for a week

666
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,320
before our mom gave birth to me?

667
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,430
After I was born,

668
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,230
the sky turned clear,

669
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,290
and a big rainbow

670
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,260
appeared in the sky

671
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,420
to welcome me.

672
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,050
Pengfei, what kind of life do you think I've got?

673
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,290
You're a bandit.

674
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,050
You've been troublesome since young.

675
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,660
So unreliable.

676
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,160
Don't come here anymore.

677
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,880
Yu, you have no conscience.

678
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,670
If it weren't for you,

679
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,180
I wouldn't have suffered like this.

680
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,550
Mom thinks about you all the time.

681
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,270
Every time she has something nice,

682
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,440
she asks me to deliver it to you.

683
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,050
As if you have a conscience.

684
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,860
You're over 30, but you're still not married.

685
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,870
You just stay at home

686
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,210
and live off your parents.

687
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,010
You have spent

688
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,410
all your parents' money.

689
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:47,880
A true man

690
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,470
should be ambitious

691
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,920
and not always be immersed in love.

692
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,420
Right?

693
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,970
If I get married early,

694
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,320
how can I build my career?

695
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,480
What kind of career do you have?

696
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,220
You...

697
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,830
At your age,

698
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,690
you'd better have some romances.

699
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,550
Don't end up in a situation where Mom and Dad

700
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,590
can't even see your children.

701
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,430
Don't say that. How depressing.

702
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,440
I'm waiting for my true love.

703
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,380
By the way, Yu,

704
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,430
don't tell Mom

705
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,480
about the accident.

706
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,880
I don't want her to worry.

707
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,540
Am I that crazy

708
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,890
to tell her that?

709
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,670
You look fine to me after all.

710
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,770
Why are you hospitalized?

711
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:17,990
Do you have a lot of money?

712
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,450
Did you arrange it for him?

713
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,460
No.

714
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,520
He asked to be hospitalized for a check-up.

715
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,870
Isn't he your brother?

716
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,270
I did it to

717
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,590
punish the driver.

718
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,850
Right? So he won't be that careless next time.

719
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,850
Wait, he has to pay the hospital fee.

720
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:32,990
The flowers are obviously...

721
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:33,550
Pengfei, where is Zhang?

722
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,510
...short of potassium.

723
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,580
He is in discussions with the driver's workplace

724
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,630
about compensation for the repairs.

725
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,240
Good.

726
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,870
At first, I was going to leave tomorrow.

727
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,840
But it'll take a few days

728
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,030
to fix the car.

729
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,150
I plan to have a thorough check-up

730
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,150
in the hospital.

731
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,340
By the way, Yu,

732
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,620
my heart

733
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,320
has been beating fast lately.

734
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,520
Did I inherit

735
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,830
Dad's heart disease?

736
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,870
Dad's heart disease

737
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,870
is because of you.

738
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,860
You should pack up and leave the hospital quickly.

739
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,720
Not only does he not work hard,

740
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,590
but he also has something wrong with his brain.

741
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,380
Is he dumb or deaf?

742
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,370
He doesn't answer me when I talk to him.

743
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,350
It's like someone owes him.

744
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,680
I'm so annoyed with him.

745
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,870
He's annoyed with you too.

746
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,760
Annoyed with me?

747
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,040
He's jealous of me.

748
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,430
No way.

749
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,260
I get angry when I talk about him.

750
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,720
It's so late.

751
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,830
Why aren't your parents back yet?

752
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,550
What happened?

753
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,230
Yaya's not back too.

754
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,360
What's wrong with your family?

755
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,090
I don't know.

756
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,140
Auntie.

757
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,470
Li Si.

758
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,580
You went too far.

759
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,630
Do you still care about this family

760
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,610
and your children?

761
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,140
Here.

762
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,840
No.

763
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,360
Drinking soda again?

764
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,600
It was me.

765
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,440
I opened it.

766
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,170
Miaomiao.

767
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,670
-Uncle.
-Uncle.

768
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,810
How long have you been back?

769
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:50,740
Where did you go?

770
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,700
I was handling something with your parents.

771
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,560
Mr. Si, you're still so handsome.

772
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,390
Stop calling me Mr. Si.

773
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,390
You're my elder.

774
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,350
How energetic.

775
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:57,750
Uncle.

776
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,330
You two haven't eaten yet?

777
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,630
What can we eat? Where can we eat?

778
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,930
You don't even come back to cook after work.

779
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,830
You're so lazy.

780
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,760
There's everything in the fridge.

781
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,670
You won't starve to death

782
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,590
even if you only eat the biscuits.

783
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,190
No.

784
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,670
Let's go out and eat.

785
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,350
-Pengfei.
-Okay.

786
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,460
Is it your treat?

787
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,080
We'll eat out if you treat us.

788
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,330
Well,

789
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,670
the restaurants outside

790
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,650
are not very hygienic.

791
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,650
Let's eat at home.

792
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,620
My mom's restaurant is hygienic.

793
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,350
Where is Yaya?

794
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,220
Yaya?

795
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,190
I think Yaya went to rob a grave.

796
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,200
To rob a grave.

797
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,850
Uncle, look.

798
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:30,990
He doesn't care about you.

799
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,310
He doesn't love you.

800
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,230
I can see that.

801
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,880
But it doesn't stop me from loving him.

802
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,520
No.

803
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,440
I love you the most, Miaomiao.

804
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,910
What about me?

805
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,610
Second, you're the second.

806
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,140
By the way, Yu,

807
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,630
the stuff Mom gave you

808
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,550
is in the car.

809
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,380
Li Si.

810
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,240
Let's go.

811
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:47,810
Go.

812
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,490
You guys cook.

813
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,160
I'll be back soon.

814
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,090
Uncle,

815
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,230
why do you bring

816
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:55,750
so many things

817
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,210
and tire me out every time?

818
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,620
Aren't you young?

819
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,220
It's all about a mother's love for her daughter.

820
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,350
How long are you going to stay this time?

821
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,540
I was going to leave tomorrow.

822
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,480
But the car broke down.

823
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,850
So I'll wait until the car is fixed.

824
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,780
We can spend the weekend together.

825
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,210
What's fun recently?

826
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,270
The arcade near

827
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,830
the farmers' market has been renovated.

828
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,110
A few game machines are added.

829
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:16,760
It's really fun.

830
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,960
There's also a barbecue shop. Amazing.

831
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,210
Then let's have some fun as brothers this weekend.

832
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,820
No, as uncle and nephew.

833
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,800
Uncle.

834
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:28,680
And there's another interesting one.

835
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,760
Don't tell others.

836
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,290
What?

837
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,290
I'm good at this.

838
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,190
Really?

839
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,860
As for the movie played by Chow Yun-fat

840
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,660
in Hong Kong,

841
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,980
where he has a slicked-back hairstyle,

842
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,390
I'm the original model.

843
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,110
Are you so talented?

844
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,590
Of course, I'm your uncle.

845
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,650
Let's do it tomorrow.

846
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,520
Let's do it.

847
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:50,980
Move forward.

848
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,510
Come on.

849
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,500
You scared me.

850
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,390
Drink some honey water

851
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,050
to sober up.

852
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,980
I don't want to drink that.

853
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,710
It's just a matter of drinking honey water.

854
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,910
What's with the bang?

855
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,000
There are no outsiders here.

856
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:32,580
How is it?

857
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,520
How is it?

858
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,390
Is there a place available

859
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,590
at the agency?

860
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,550
Yes.

861
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,710
I told you

862
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,310
I had the right information.

863
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,320
Can you fight for it?

864
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,800
Not really.

865
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,830
There is only one place left.

866
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,830
But so many executives are waiting.

867
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,960
Isn't that bullshit?

868
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,050
Everyone knows that further study at Petroleum Bridge

869
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,910
is a prerequisite for promotion.

870
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,920
If we don't fight for it,

871
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,900
it might

872
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,180
be occupied by others.

873
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,230
That's right.

874
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,800
How about this?

875
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,060
We give something to Wang Liben.

876
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,450
Are you stupid?

877
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,310
Why was Yuan demoted last year?

878
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,440
Don't you know that?

879
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,490
If we get caught for bribery,

880
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,970
we're screwed.

881
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,140
I suggested you call Dad

882
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,360
and ask him to pull a few strings,

883
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,290
but you refused.

884
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,550
You refused.

885
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,290
Niu Lingling, you...

886
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,510
The only reason

887
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,240
I've been criticized in my life

888
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,790
is because I got promoted

889
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,450
relying on my father-in-law.

890
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,150
If I ask my father-in-law to pull a few strings

891
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,550
at this critical moment,

892
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,090
not to mention being criticized,

893
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,270
I will even

894
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,100
ruin my life.

895
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,910
No.

896
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,920
Zhao.

897
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
Two more bottles?

898
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,370
Let's go.

899
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,000
Sit down. None of your business.

900
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,190
How did Wang Liben get promoted?

901
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,350
Doesn't he know about it?

902
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:03,010
Without my dad, he wouldn't be where he is today.

903
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:04,890
Drink it.

904
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,320
I'll go.

905
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,980
What are you doing? You're a woman.

906
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,350
Cut the crap. I'll go.

907
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,010
Commissioner Wang.

908
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:18,950
I'll go.

909
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,390
Commissioner Wang, how was the dinner?

910
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,530
Come on.

911
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,740
I'll drink one shot first as self-punishment.

912
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,800
Commissioner Guo.

913
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,240
Pour more.

914
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,190
Drink more.

915
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,690
Fill it up.

916
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,400
Let's have a cold perm.

917
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,790
Cold perm?

918
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,420
Yes.

919
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,920
Do you think I'm suitable?

920
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,740
Give it a shot.

921
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:39,690
Okay.

922
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:40,310
Okay.

923
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,260
Hang on a moment.

924
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,010
Cold perm.

925
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,480
Is Yang coming back?

926
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,720
No.

927
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,070
Yang gave me a task

928
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,870
to send his suit

929
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,750
to his friend tomorrow.

930
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,570
Since I'm going to meet someone,

931
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,160
I want to make myself look more energetic.

932
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,990
Are you afraid Yang's colleagues

933
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,650
will think you're spiritless when they see you?

934
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,110
You're thinking too much.

935
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,900
Look at what Yang looks like.

936
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,400
Yet you're still afraid that you're not good enough for him?

937
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,960
No matter what he's become,

938
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,110
others will think

939
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,660
I'm not good enough for him.

940
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,070
How could they think so?

941
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,270
Yang's sister

942
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,310
has two children.

943
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,310
But she's still living in her maiden home.

944
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,320
Marrying a husband

945
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,620
can't even get a house.

946
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,310
When Yang married you,

947
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,770
he lived at your place too.

948
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,470
My goodness.

949
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,270
His family really

950
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,500
doesn't know their place.

951
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,230
My goodness.

952
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,300
Sister, keep your voice down.

953
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,300
There are outsiders here.

954
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,110
I know.

955
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:38,550
Listen.

956
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,190
If they think you're not good enough,

957
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,270
just ignore them.

958
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,950
Let's see who's the social climber.

959
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,150
I know his family

960
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,220
is not that good.

961
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,890
But Yang is nice to me.

962
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:47,830
Not at all.

963
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,480
What's nice?

964
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,220
Not bad.

965
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,310
Jun, get me a glass of water.

966
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,070
What took you so long?

967
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,580
Yeah. Why are you so late?

968
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,970
I didn't go to bed until three last night.

969
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,720
I drank seven bottles of liquor.

970
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,720
I'm so exhausted.

971
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,990
Do you have to drink along with them?

972
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,430
What else can I do?

973
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,390
Our Dahai...

974
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,470
Here's your water.

975
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,790
...wants to go further study at the Petroleum Bridge.

976
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:09,389
Last night,

977
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,630
we had a meal

978
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,580
with the leaders of the Petroleum Bridge.

979
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,670
He could only drink eight taels of liquor.

980
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,239
I drank so much

981
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,670
that they were all drunk.

982
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,710
Dahai is so lucky

983
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,280
to have you as his wife.

984
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:20,940
Yes.

985
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,840
Otherwise, he's still on the front line.

986
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,290
How can he sit in the office?

987
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,420
For goodness' sake.

988
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,100
Follow the man you marry, be he fowl or cur.

989
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,500
I'm not as lucky as you

990
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,850
to marry Cheng Pengfei.

991
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,350
If I were you,

992
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,710
I would have lived a happy life at home.

993
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,670
You don't have to make money

994
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,030
or drink with people like I do.

995
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,190
Cheng Pengfei

996
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,590
is good at everything

997
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,480
but lacks ambition.

998
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,139
He's already satisfied

999
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,820
being a doctor.

1000
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:45,590
I told him

1001
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,830
to strive for promotion.

1002
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,710
Their hospital director told him

1003
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,500
several times about competing for the position.

1004
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,940
He even invited him to dinner at home

1005
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,380
and brought him to the meetings.

1006
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,239
Everyone loves to get along well with the hospital director.

1007
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:56,909
But he

1008
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:57,550
always avoids meeting the director.

1009
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,470
He said he wanted to avert suspicion.

1010
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,190
Isn't he doing silly things?

1011
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,150
You're just discontent.

1012
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,320
You even said he's doing silly things.

1013
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,310
It's not the first time

1014
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,790
she has been discontent.

1015
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,400
Where is Jun?

1016
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,090
Jun.

1017
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,960
Jun.

1018
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,160
Come here.

1019
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,110
Coming.

1020
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,030
You've got a heavy task today.

1021
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,670
You have to make a stylish hairstyle

1022
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,910
for the three of us.

1023
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,370
Especially Yue.

1024
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,680
Don't drop the ball.

1025
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:20,470
-Okay.
-I'll leave it to you.

1026
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,550
Jun said he'd do a cold perm

1027
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,610
for me this time.

1028
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,270
That's good.

1029
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,310
Miaomiao,

1030
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,870
my brother just sent these to me.

1031
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,400
Pick a few

1032
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,490
and take them away.

1033
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,320
I want a brother in a big city too.

1034
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,970
Don't you have a younger brother?

1035
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,100
What's the use?

1036
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,100
Now I realize

1037
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,890
if there are two children in a household,

1038
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,690
their age gap can't be too small.

1039
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,500
You and your brother

1040
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,440
have a 5-year age gap.

1041
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,370
That's perfect.

1042
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,670
No need to fight for anything.

1043
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,930
He always lets you win.

1044
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,970
Cheng Yaya and I are only 1-year different in age.

1045
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:54,880
We've been fighting since young.

1046
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,680
People are always comparing us.

1047
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,480
Cheng Yaya's teacher

1048
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,390
asked him to be the class monitor this semester.

1049
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,250
But he refused.

1050
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:01,910
Listen.

1051
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,740
How arrogant!

1052
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,310
I strived hard to compete for the position.

1053
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,540
But he doesn't want it at all.

1054
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,470
How irritating!

1055
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:08,690
Indeed.

1056
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,470
Then you should work harder.

1057
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,920
I'm doing my best.

1058
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,480
So,

1059
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,560
you must vote for me.

1060
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,570
Even if I vote for you,

1061
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,230
you may not be assigned the role.

1062
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:21,870
Right?

1063
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,970
The more votes, the more chance to win.

1064
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,880
Plus, regarding Qiang Xiaowa,

1065
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,200
I helped the teacher a lot.

1066
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,500
Who else can be the class monitor?

1067
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,150
Look at this.

1068
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,320
I'll look at it later.

1069
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,050
Pinky swear.

1070
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,590
[Video Arcade]

1071
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,950
Are you wearing your dad's clothes?

1072
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,510
It's what they wear in the movies.

1073
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,510
We have to be imposing.

1074
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,190
You're not going in.

1075
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,700
Why do you need the imposing manner?

1076
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,750
Why aren't I going in?

1077
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,880
Why are you going in? You're a kid.

1078
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,680
Wait here.

1079
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:01,830
No.

1080
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,220
I won't play even if I go in.

1081
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,060
I'll just be watching.

1082
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,540
No way, things are complicated in there.

1083
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,260
Do you think you can understand

1084
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,450
after watching a few movies?

1085
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,980
Listen, it's a Pandora box.

1086
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,240
Your uncle has seen the world.

1087
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,560
Macau, Las Vegas.

1088
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,190
Have you been to both of them?

1089
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,220
I know a little bit about them.

1090
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,370
Give me the money.

1091
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,880
Either win or lose, we split it equally.

1092
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,980
Can I just take a look?

1093
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,380
No, stop dawdling.

1094
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,330
What if I miss the auspicious hour?

1095
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,510
Wait for my triumphant return.

1096
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,850
Let's have a barbecue tonight.

1097
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,380
So I dressed up for nothing.

1098
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,240
Aaron Kwok is so handsome.

1099
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,670
But I like Alex Man.

1100
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,910
I think he's chubby

1101
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,070
and has two dimples.

1102
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,440
He seems to be very nice to people.

1103
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,120
Alex Man is too fat.

1104
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,300
-Not good at all.
-Not only is he fat,

1105
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,340
but he also looks

1106
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,250
a little bad.

1107
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,070
Right?

1108
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,630
I think he is good.

1109
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,760
Gallen Lo is handsome.

1110
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,710
Yes, he is also decent, right?

1111
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,540
Very masculine.

1112
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,330
Because I have two dimples too.

1113
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,920
Don't worry.

1114
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,190
This voice...

1115
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,440
That's right.

1116
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,210
It's him.

1117
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,240
Stop there!

1118
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,720
I got you!

1119
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,350
It's him.

1120
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,690
I'm not Alex Man.

1121
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,090
Then you're a big liar.

1122
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,300
What do you mean?

1123
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,310
Do you think we don't know you

1124
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,110
after you cut your hair?

1125
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,070
Yes, my son

1126
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:50,550
has almost become a fool

1127
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,510
after taking the fake medicine you sold.

1128
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:51,950
It's him.

1129
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,070
Send him to the police station.

1130
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,590
Police! Police!

1131
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,120
Stop yelling!

1132
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:56,930
Stop yelling!

1133
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:57,730
Stop yelling!

1134
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,610
A clean hand wants no washing.

1135
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:00,780
I'll go with you.

1136
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,040
Let's go now.

1137
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,080
Go like this?

1138
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:04,620
Go like this?

1139
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,520
How can we go like this?

1140
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:09,880
Come back!

1141
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,640
Stop!

1142
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,650
Stop!

1143
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:12,910
Stop there!

1144
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:13,750
Stop!

1145
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,710
Stop!

1146
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,630
Stop! Stop him!

1147
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,390
You liar!

1148
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,310
Don't let him escape!

1149
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,710
Stop! Stop him!

1150
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:20,750
Liar!

1151
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,670
Stop him!

1152
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,440
Stop!

1153
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,770
-Slow down!
-Don't run!

1154
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,980
I'll kill you! Catch him!

1155
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,510
Stop! You liar!

1156
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,510
Stop!

1157
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,520
Stop him!

1158
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,950
Stop him!

1159
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,540
He's a big liar!

1160
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:41,350
Hurry!

1161
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:49,910
Where is he?

1162
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,480
How much?

1163
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:55,440
Five yuan.

1164
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,810
You're here, Si.

1165
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:02,410
Si.

1166
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,620
Finished betting? It's gonna open.

1167
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,550
One, two, open.

1168
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,520
He'll take it.

1169
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,710
Sorry, everyone.

1170
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,650
Sorry, everyone.

1171
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,890
I'm sorry.

1172
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,180
I didn't expect to find his lair.

1173
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,090
I'm sorry.

1174
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,780
I'm sorry.

1175
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,150
Does anyone want to bet anymore?

1176
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:09,940
Is there any?

1177
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:10,980
Hurry up.

1178
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:11,720
Place the bet.

1179
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,180
Place the bet.

1180
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,560
I'm waiting for the next round.

1181
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,210
You have to place the bet next round.

1182
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:16,140
I'll open it now.

1183
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,430
One, two, three, go.

1184
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,310
Triple six.

1185
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,410
The leopard comes out of the mountain.

1186
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,170
So big.

1187
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,200
Sorry, everyone.

1188
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,350
Sorry.

1189
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,670
I'll take this one.

1190
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,940
You will win the next round.

1191
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,890
The next one.

1192
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,890
Place your bets.

1193
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,720
Do you have it?

1194
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,810
Why are you here?

1195
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,370
What are you doing here?

1196
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,310
Do you know

1197
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,350
what's in there?

1198
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,660
You want to play too?

1199
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,920
Let's go. I have money.

1200
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,360
What's the use of money?

1201
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,150
Even if you have money,

1202
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,680
you'll lose it all in there.

1203
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,180
Give me the money.

1204
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,960
Give me the money!

1205
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,800
I have no time to waste with you.

1206
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,860
My uncle is inside.

1207
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:51,950
I have to send him money.

1208
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,070
Sending money is also gambling.

1209
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:53,910
Don't do it. Let's go.

1210
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:54,790
What are you doing?

1211
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,030
I'm not leaving. Give it to me.

1212
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,230
Let go. I want to go in.

1213
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,780
Anyone wants to place a bet?

1214
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,390
Why do you come in?

1215
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,020
Get out.

1216
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,110
Get out.

1217
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,150
Let's play.

1218
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,460
Police! Don't move!

1219
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:09,850
Freeze!

1220
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:10,970
Freeze!

1221
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,260
Freeze!

1222
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:12,920
Freeze!

1223
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:15,010
Squat down.

1224
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,010
There's always a saying in boys' youth,

1225
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,520
"Don't leave after school."

1226
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,230
Gao Feiyang

1227
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,570
really realized that.

1228
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,270
After school,

1229
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,730
they're partners on duty.

1230
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,310
They have to face each other

1231
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,240
in spite of their mutual loathing.

1232
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:30,150
This is the first time

1233
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,590
Cheng Yaya fought with others.

1234
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,710
He said

1235
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,100
he did it for justice.

1236
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,820
But what I saw

1237
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,650
is he did it for a girl.

1238
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,830
He's no longer

1239
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:40,590
the little brat

1240
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,350
who needs my protection.

1241
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,070
Although he kept saying

1242
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,510
fighting is stupid.

1243
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,270
Of course it's stupid to fight.

1244
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,080
Adults

1245
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,590
won't easily use their fists

1246
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,710
to solve problems.

1247
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,390
But at 17 years old,

1248
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:53,510
we never knew that

1249
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,750
beyond a life without any worries about food and clothes,

1250
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,300
there are many dangers,

1251
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:58,640
villains,

1252
00:42:58,910 --> 00:42:59,950
scams,

1253
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:00,950
gamblers,

1254
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,550
temptations and traps.
