00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,830
Please excuse my mood

196
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,210
of studying hard.

197
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,430
No.

198
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,680
Xu Wenwu,

199
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,270
why are you so cold-hearted?

200
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,670
I treated you so kindly.

201
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,490
Li Si,

202
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,150
what are you doing?

203
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,630
Everyone is sitting

204
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,530
but you.

205
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,210
Director,

206
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,210
I just want to change to a seat

207
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,930
where I can study hard.

208
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,720
If you had studied hard,

209
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,520
you wouldn't have been the last.

210
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,520
Director, I have poor eyesight.

211
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,980
I can't see clearly in the back row.

212
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,250
Ask your dad to get you a pair of glasses.

213
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,050
Go to the back.

214
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,420
It's all your fault.

215
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,240
All right, everyone.

216
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,010
You heard that

217
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,540
your former head teacher,

218
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,890
Mr. Zhang Shaowen has retired.

219
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,740
So, since the start of this semester,

220
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,050
you will have

221
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,130
a new head teacher,

222
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Mr. Gao.

223
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,730
He

224
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,730
is a top student in a Normal University.

225
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,260
He used to teach in Shanghai

226
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,010
with both virtue and talent.

227
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,600
I hope,

228
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,870
under the leadership of Mr. Gao,

229
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,840
you can get higher scores.

230
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,930
Director,

231
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,760
is Ms. Gao pretty?

232
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,090
You're so talkative,

233
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:49,690
Li Si.

234
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,330
Mr. Gao, come in, please.

235
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:58,800
So handsome.

236
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,000
Miao,

237
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,310
he's as handsome as Xie Xiaodong.

238
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,130
I told you Li Si has poor eyesight.

239
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,990
He can't even tell men from women.

240
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,740
[Gao Feiyang]

241
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,860
I'm Gao Feiyang, a teacher of Chinese.

242
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,810
Let's begin.

243
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,750
Okay.

244
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,990
Have your class, then.

245
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,390
Don't trouble Mr. Gao.

246
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,780
Especially those naughty ones,

247
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,500
be careful.

248
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,530
Okay.

249
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:30,730
Let me introduce

250
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,990
a new classmate to you.

251
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,400
Come on.

252
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:42,980
This is

253
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,210
a transfer student.

254
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,160
Please

255
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,370
introduce yourself.

256
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,320
Why does he keep silent?

257
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,170
Why is his hair so long?

258
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,280
His hair is longer than mine.

259
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,250
He must be from outside.

260
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,410
Why did he enter our school?

261
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,290
I don't know.

262
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,220
He's the one who rode the tricycle.

263
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,650
He's Qiang Xiaowa.

264
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,290
You'll get to know each other.

265
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,040
Xiaowa, sit there.

266
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,470
Sir.

267
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Director asked me to sit here alone.

268
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,310
Looks like you're pretty capable.

269
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,280
Director

270
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,540
treats you specially.

271
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,960
What's your name?

272
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,900
My name is Li Si.

273
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,770
Okay, Li Si.

274
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,130
Here's a reward for you.

275
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,260
You have a deskmate.

276
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,970
Go ahead.

277
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,450
Hello.

278
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,480
We have two new students.

279
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,590
I'll give you time to get familiar with each other.

280
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,300
Mr. Zhang Shaowen specifically asked me

281
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,630
to focus on the summer vacation homework.

282
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,250
Who's the class monitor?

283
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,710
What's your name?

284
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:55,490
Sir,

285
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,530
my name is Zhu Chao.

286
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,440
Please collect

287
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,330
the summer vacation homework.

288
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,960
Give me your compositions

289
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,610
and a muster roll

290
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,970
according to the seats.

291
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,790
Okay.

292
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,290
She's so pretty.

293
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:19,160
[Han Shu]

294
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,560
My name is Han Shu.

295
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,090
I'm your head teacher,

296
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,970
and your English teacher.

297
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,970
It's my first time to be a head teacher.

298
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,250
I hope I can improve

299
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,310
together with you.

300
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,160
Thank you.

301
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,440
Why don't you sit down?

302
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,750
Ms. Han, I want to change my seat.

303
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,820
I don't want to sit with her.

304
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,360
Why?

305
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,630
Because her father is wanted.

306
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,310
Ms. Han, she'll defame

307
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,860
our class.

308
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,550
Why are we in the same class with

309
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,250
the daughter of a wanted criminal?

310
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:53,930
Yes.

311
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,640
She shouldn't have come to school.

312
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,760
That's right.

313
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,420
Everyone, be quiet.

314
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,650
Get out!

315
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,920
Please be quiet.

316
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,190
Be quiet!

317
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,720
Director.

318
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,590
What are you doing?

319
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,830
On the first day of school,

320
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,280
you make

321
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,570
chaos.

322
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,760
Your class is the most noisy one.

323
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,550
Are you going to rebel?

324
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:41,810
Ning Jiahe,

325
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,260
why are you standing here?

326
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,530
Are there nails on your butt?

327
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,200
Sit down.

328
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:46,910
Director Xiao,

329
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,750
I can sit down, but you should let her out.

330
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,580
Why? Let her out?

331
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,060
Do you take the school as your home?

332
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,000
Do you think you can do whatever you want?

333
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,840
I don't want to

334
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,010
sit with her.

335
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,220
At worst, I'll quit school.

336
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,080
Quit school?

337
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,490
Listen,

338
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,530
compulsory education

339
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,300
is over.

340
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,760
Don't threaten me in this way.

341
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,600
Get out if you don't want to continue your class.

342
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Fine.

343
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,220
Ms. Han,

344
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,370
I'm willing to sit with her.

345
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,360
Okay, class is over.

346
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,160
Stand up.

347
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,810
See you, Sir.

348
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,510
[Class 1, Grade 2]

349
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,750
See you.

350
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,370
Miao.

351
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,530
Isn't he from a village?

352
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:56,970
We have never accepted

353
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,430
any student from outside.

354
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:00,840
Maybe his family

355
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,450
work in the oilfield.

356
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,650
No way.

357
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,380
He's obviously a fisherman.

358
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,760
So what?

359
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,680
It's too hard.

360
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,750
Which question?

361
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,140
Good news.

362
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,010
I'm busy.

363
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,970
Qiu Shuzhen is

364
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,100
the head teacher of Yaya's class.

365
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,100
I've asked around.

366
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,460
Then, you can only repeat your grade.

367
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,300
No need.

368
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,630
She also teaches us English.

369
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,170
Look.

370
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,140
My English score

371
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,770
will go up.

372
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:26,770
Didn't you like Zhao Yazhi

373
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,090
a few days ago?

374
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:28,870
No conflict.

375
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:29,730
If we can have

376
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,890
a math teacher like Zhao Yazhi,

377
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,530
my math score

378
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,360
can also rise.

379
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,560
Have you finished your summer homework?

380
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,080
You've been crazy

381
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,210
for Qiu Shuzhen a whole morning.

382
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:39,850
No.

383
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,290
That's why I went out to borrow homework.

384
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,040
The tricycle boy is mute.

385
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,120
I talked to him

386
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,450
but he didn't answer me.

387
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,050
He just didn't want to talk to you.

388
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,250
He doesn't know

389
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,840
my status in No. 2 High School.

390
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,240
What do you think you are?

391
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,920
Last summer,

392
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,760
we were nearly

393
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,570
the most useless in the oilfield.

394
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,680
Keep your low profile.

395
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,470
Being active won't do you any good.

396
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,590
Be careful.

397
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,770
Director Xiao is always like this.

398
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,650
Don't take it personally.

399
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:12,829
Come on.

400
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,359
Senior.

401
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,720
I'm not upset

402
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,530
for Director Xiao's criticism.

403
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,730
I'm upset because I don't know

404
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,650
whether they

405
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,930
targeted that girl

406
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,210
or me.

407
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,119
They did this on the first day of school.

408
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,839
You're so fragile.

409
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,540
You need more practice.

410
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,220
I didn't expect that

411
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,840
I would have a daughter of a wanted criminal

412
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,890
in my class.

413
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,130
This is school.

414
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,840
There are only students and teachers.

415
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,500
Where is the wanted criminal?

416
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,450
Her father

417
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,760
is wanted.

418
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,960
I just got this news.

419
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,450
Is her father also your student?

420
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,850
That's all.

421
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,330
Her father is another thing.

422
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,520
If he breaks the law, the police will arrest him.

423
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,250
What does it have to do with you?

424
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,460
Then what should I do to Yuan Shanqing?

425
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,440
How can she continue to study here in this situation?

426
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,090
Whether she can go to school

427
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,920
depends on

428
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,140
your action.

429
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,530
Thank you.

430
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,170
Hello.

431
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,520
Good job.

432
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,220
You know what?

433
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,400
Apart from a new stranger

434
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,640
in our class,

435
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:22,890
there is a more surprising one

436
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,250
in Yaya's class.

437
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,400
Who?

438
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,250
Yuan Yong's daughter went to her class.

439
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,250
What the hell?

440
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,840
No. 2 High School won't be peaceful.

441
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,930
Don't act on hearsay.

442
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,770
Nonsense.

443
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:38,930
It's not Yuan Yong who came to our school.

444
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,130
How dare he come here?

445
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,510
What?

446
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,000
Go with her.

447
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,010
Do you remember me?

448
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,760
The tricycle.

449
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,960
We wanted to thank you,

450
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,760
but you left without telling us.

451
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,890
We are destined to meet.

452
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,370
You transfer to our class.

453
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,550
I am Cheng Miaomiao.

454
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,090
You can ask for my help

455
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,010
if you need.

456
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,680
Hello.

457
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,820
Come on.

458
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,530
Is he really deaf-mute?

459
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,600
Why did our school

460
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,840
accept anyone?

461
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,160
Can't deaf-mute go to school?

462
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,730
Yes.

463
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,920
The daughter of a wanted criminal also goes to school.

464
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,220
How can we stay in this school?

465
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,490
Cheng,

466
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,320
why do you make trouble

467
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,540
for yourself?

468
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,220
Why do you have to sit with her?

469
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,430
What trouble?

470
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,410
Study in class and go home after class.

471
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,210
It doesn't matter

472
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,270
who is my deskmate.

473
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,690
It isn't the same.

474
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,090
Do you know why Zheng

475
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,370
didn't come to school?

476
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,640
His grandma jumped into the river.

477
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,920
When did it happen?

478
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,930
Last night.

479
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,530
How about her?

480
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,490
She passed away.

481
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,040
How can she be fine?

482
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,250
She's 80 years old.

483
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,250
She jumped into the river

484
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,510
and died immediately.

485
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,490
My aunt's home is in chaos.

486
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,260
Luo Zheng

487
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,290
cried so hard that he even choked.

488
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,490
He was brought up

489
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,620
by his grandmother.

490
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,180
How can he stand this?

491
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,450
Just for fraud?

492
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,290
Yes.

493
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,690
If Luo Zheng meets Yuan Yong's daughter,

494
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,350
he'll definitely beat her up.

495
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,210
Don't tell him

496
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,860
you took the initiative to sit with her.

497
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,390
We can't interfere with it.

498
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:35,680
How can he

499
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,820
beat a girl?

500
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,720
His grandma is dead.

501
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,330
What does this have to do with Yuan Shanqing?

502
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,170
Cheng,

503
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,410
no one dares to tell Yuan Yong's scam

504
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,850
has nothing to do

505
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,220
with Yuan Shanqing.

506
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,760
Besides, Yuan Shanqing

507
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,130
must have spent money given by her father

508
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,650
on food and clothing.

509
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,350
Since she was benefited,

510
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,720
she should bear the curse.

511
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,520
Yes.

512
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,840
Look at you.

513
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,150
Why did you stand up for her for no reason?

514
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,960
If you two really bully her,

515
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,010
I'm going to stand up for her.

516
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,040
Oh, no. Things will be awful.

517
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,490
Go back to have a class.

518
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,640
Attention,

519
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,360
the formula is

520
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,380
the absolute value of P1 and P2

521
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,010
is equivalent to the square root of

522
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,890
the perfect square of S2 minus S1

523
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,410
and plus the perfect square

524
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,340
of Y2 minus Y1.

525
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:40,810
Guys,

526
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,610
class is over.

527
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,550
After class,

528
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,280
you should review what you've learned.

529
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,890
See you.

530
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:47,610
Stand up.

531
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,450
See you, Sir.

532
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,380
See you, class is over.

533
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:58,840
Where are you going?

534
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,770
Play basketball

535
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,550
or go home.

536
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,220
Let's go.

537
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,610
Qiang Xiaowa,

538
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,550
I have something to tell you.

539
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,200
I won't

540
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,980
take advantage of you for nothing.

541
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,130
You sent us back last time.

542
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,170
You did us a favor.

543
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,240
Take the ten yuan.

544
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,210
If something

545
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,510
happened to you in the school,

546
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,840
ask me for help any time.

547
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,650
You didn't take the money.

548
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,430
What do you mean?

549
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,590
You didn't take the money.

550
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,670
I gave you money.

551
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,550
Money is not the point.

552
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,830
Look at your arrogant gesture

553
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,210
just now.

554
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,090
It's like ten yuan from the donator.

555
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,530
Donate?

556
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,100
I tried to thank him.

557
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,780
Shouldn't I give him money?

558
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,360
He's so arrogant.

559
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,130
He should thank me for not beating him.

560
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:47,850
Li Si,

561
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:48,610
have a conscience.

562
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,810
He saved the three of us

563
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,770
on the way.

564
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,850
If there weren't Qiang Xiaowa,

565
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,610
you would have

566
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,650
been sick.

567
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,580
What do you mean?

568
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,800
I wouldn't be sick.

569
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,130
Stop annoying words.

570
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,770
Indeed.

571
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,650
Li Si has befriended him

572
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,360
and paid him.

573
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,440
What a rude man.

574
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,550
Yes.

575
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,570
He didn't know

576
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,620
where I got hurt, right?

577
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,990
Don't tell anyone about this.

578
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,220
Don't talk nonsense.

579
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,630
Didn't you tell him

580
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,130
at that time?

581
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,720
I did.

582
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,030
You did?

583
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,700
Who are you trying to fight against?

584
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,340
Myself.

585
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,660
What are you doing?

586
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,340
Si,

587
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,980
calm down, Si.

588
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,160
Miao.

589
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,170
Mom, I'm back.

590
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,550
Did you become the deskmate of Yuan Yong's kid?

591
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,660
Why do you know everything?

592
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,650
Xue's little sister is in your class. She told me.

593
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,510
What happened?

594
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:15,960
I...

595
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,760
Is Yuan Yong's kid in your class?

596
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,170
Is her dad caught?

597
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,560
Isn't he wanted?

598
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,500
Why did his daughter go to school?

599
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,410
Mom, her dad is wanted.

600
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,480
She's not.

601
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,250
Can you

602
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,500
figure it out first?

603
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,640
The Public Security Bureau

604
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,570
has already figured it out.

605
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,790
Her father is a fraud.

606
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,560
Her father defrauded

607
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,000
many members of our factory.

608
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,650
He's so evil.

609
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,240
I have to go to the teacher.

610
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,690
Why?

611
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,050
I have to do so.

612
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,360
For what?

613
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,420
Yaya is in the same class

614
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,650
with Yuan Yong's kid.

615
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,930
So what?

616
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:48,920
No way.

617
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,930
How can the teacher arrange this?

618
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,560
Our kid is a good boy.

619
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,020
What about the girl?

620
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,490
Who is she?

621
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,700
She is a student.

622
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,250
Students should

623
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,770
listen to the school, right?

624
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,720
As parents,

625
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,440
we shouldn't interfere with the school affairs.

626
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,300
Cheng Pengfei,

627
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,090
she's Yuan Yong's daughter.

628
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,850
Look at you.

629
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,640
You keep calling her Yuan Yong's daughter.

630
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,370
Doesn't she

631
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,110
have a name?

632
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,080
You are

633
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,860
educated.

634
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,970
Don't act like

635
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,650
gossipers outside.

636
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,290
An adult's fault

637
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,910
has nothing to do with his child.

638
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,310
As time goes by,

639
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,130
the implication is old-fashioned.

640
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,760
Yes, my dad is right.

641
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,380
Fault?

642
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,130
This is equivalent to

643
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,330
murder for money.

644
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,210
It has something to do with his kid.

645
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:36,800
There must be.

646
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,840
Right.

647
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,240
Didn't you hear what people said?

648
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,640
The police are arresting him.

649
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,530
Yuan Yong is wanted.

650
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,490
You'd better know it.

651
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,330
I heard it, too.

652
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,640
Yes, your dad...

653
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,040
There's something wrong with your dad's position.

654
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,730
Something wrong.

655
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,400
Exactly.

656
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,810
How can you do this?

657
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,890
How can you do this?

658
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,570
What are you doing here?

659
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,040
Say it.

660
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,520
What does

661
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,090
she look like?

662
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,980
Are you done?

663
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,250
Everyone

664
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,610
has to nag about it.

665
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,520
What does it have to do with you?

666
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,540
It has something to do with you.

667
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,300
Can't I ask you some questions?

668
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,430
What does it have to do with me?

669
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,520
We are in the same class.

670
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,570
Do all classmates

671
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,930
have anything to do with me?

672
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:36,570
Do I have to

673
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,430
know everyone?

674
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,050
Why are you so nosy?

675
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,440
Don't bother me with my homework.

676
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,720
Why are you shouting?

677
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,590
Why are you unhappy?

678
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,660
She came to school normally.

679
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,490
When she first came here,

680
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,490
the whole classmates

681
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,650
scolded her

682
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,130
and everyone refused to be her deskmate

683
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,440
and didn't want to be her classmates.

684
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,170
They asked the teacher

685
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,030
to kick her out.

686
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,640
I just wanted to be fair.

687
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,830
Zhong Ruitao and Wang Fuqiang

688
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,030
stopped me.

689
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,550
They were afraid that I would make trouble.

690
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:06,960
When I came back,

691
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,410
our mother kept calling her a wanted criminal.

692
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,970
She even wanted to meet our teacher.

693
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,560
I'm speechless. It's all your fault.

694
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,600
You're always a busybody.

695
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,390
Get out.

696
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,860
Are you crazy?

697
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,200
Am I gossiping about Yuan Yong's daughter?

698
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,440
I'm worried about you.

699
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,050
Why didn't you know my kindness?

700
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,600
What?

701
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,010
If Yuan Yong

702
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:22,870
really stands in front of you,

703
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,270
no one dares to scold him.

704
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,570
You're a bunch of thugs,

705
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,710
and only hit her when she is down.

706
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,710
Get out now.

707
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,000
Is the oral liquid sold by Jiang Dacheng

708
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,400
a substandard product?

709
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,690
Even worse.

710
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,310
There are tranquilizers inside.

711
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,170
I...

712
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,910
I just called Ling.

713
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:53,890
She said

714
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,780
Li Si had drunk a lot.

715
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,290
She is worried now.

716
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,000
Will it damage

717
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,730
children's health?

718
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,800
Stop loss in time.

719
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,820
Don't let others

720
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,450
trick you anymore.

721
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,290
I...

722
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,640
I...

723
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,290
I am

724
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,040
worried.

725
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,300
There are many things bothering you.

726
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,890
-Yeah.
-Wash your feet.

727
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,280
Okay?

728
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,960
The water will get cold.

729
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,770
I know.

730
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,500
Things come one after another.

731
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,670
How can I relax?

732
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:28,880
I was defrauded much money

733
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,220
by Yuan Yong.

734
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,490
And then, I was tricked by

735
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,130
a fake medicine seller.

736
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,550
Grandma Luo

737
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,740
jumped into the river because of Yuan Yong's fraud.

738
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,670
Do you know that?

739
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,530
Another life.

740
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,050
Alright, don't overthink.

741
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,980
The police will solve the problem.

742
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,610
It's said

743
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,720
someone called the police

744
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,340
about the oral liquid today.

745
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,310
Can we get our money back

746
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,490
from the liars?

747
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,160
If they are caught,

748
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,670
we can get the money back.

749
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,050
I heard that Yuan Yong's daughter

750
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,450
knows where the money is.

751
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:07,810
Hear about it again?

752
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,000
Who told you that?

753
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,850
Yuan Yong?

754
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,300
Nonsense.

755
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,080
You always bother your family

756
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:14,810
with others' affairs.

757
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:15,960
Alright, stop it.

758
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,800
So annoying.

759
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:24,730
Cheng.

760
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,490
Cheng.

761
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,930
We didn't mean that yesterday.

762
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,530
Don't be angry.

763
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,170
Don't be angry.

764
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,490
Cheng,

765
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,210
you know

766
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,720
Zheng's temper.

767
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,540
Yeah.

768
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,410
Fuqiang was worried about you.

769
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,160
Alright, don't be angry, Cheng.

770
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:42,970
We've been together

771
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,150
for so long.

772
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,000
Please be generous. Don't be angry.

773
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,200
Well, Zhong Ruitao and I will

774
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,260
buy you ice lollies.

775
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,290
No problem. I'll treat you.

776
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,760
Hurry up. Sit down.

777
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,920
Our teacher is here.

778
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,920
Wait, the final bell has rung.

779
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,090
Why isn't Yuan Yong's daughter back yet?

780
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:58,890
It's better if she doesn't come back.

781
00:29:58,890 --> 00:29:59,610
If Zheng comes,

782
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,810
he may cause trouble.

783
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,400
Class begins.

784
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,540
Stand up.

785
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,790
Good morning, teacher.

786
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,570
Good morning, boys and girls.

787
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,940
Okay, sit down, please.

788
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,400
Thank you, teacher.

789
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,580
Open the book and turn to page 15

790
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,940
and read after me.

791
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,950
This momentous decree

792
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,970
came as a great beacon light of hope…

793
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,590
Excuse me.

794
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,400
Come in.

795
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,170
This momentous decree

796
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,180
came as a great beacon light of hope

797
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,770
to millions of

798
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,210
Negro slaves,

799
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,450
who had been seared

800
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,210
in the flames of withering injustice.

801
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:54,920
It came as

802
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,400
a joyous daybreak

803
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,810
to end the long night

804
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,370
of their captivities.

805
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,650
I have a dream that one day...

806
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,920
Director.

807
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,130
Director, I didn't sleep.

808
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,050
I was thinking.

809
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,670
Why aren't you wearing your uniform?

810
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,640
He is a newcomer.

811
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,240
I didn't ask you.

812
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,470
Why didn't you cut your hair?

813
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,600
He likes this style.

814
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,490
Why didn't you answer

815
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,480
my questions?

816
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,420
Say it.

817
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,050
He may not speak.

818
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,830
No uniform.

819
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,120
Why are you laughing at?

820
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,130
Study.

821
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,250
You've transferred to our school.

822
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,610
You have to follow the rules

823
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:03,920
and dress in code.

824
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,240
And your hair.

825
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,290
How can a young man

826
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,500
have such long hair?

827
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,320
Go to the Logistics Office after class

828
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,250
and get a uniform

829
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,300
and cut your hair.

830
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,160
Director Xiao,

831
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,250
he just transferred here.

832
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,040
I haven't made arrangements yet.

833
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,770
I see.

834
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,350
He should wear a uniform.

835
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,350
And his hair.

836
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,360
Urge him to cut it.

837
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,120
I know.

838
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,680
I'll walk you out.

839
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,050
Turn around and study.

840
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,850
Also,

841
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,740
his dialect is a problem.

842
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,880
It's normal for a kid from outside.

843
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,530
We should help him integrate step by step.

844
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,660
Pay attention to it.

845
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,120
Goodbye, Director.

846
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,050
Go back to class.

847
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,680
[No.2 High School of Linqi Oilfield]

848
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:00,850
From tomorrow onwards,

849
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,510
don't come to school anymore.

850
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,770
Do you hear me?

851
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,120
What are you doing?

852
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,650
Cheng, stay out of this.

853
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,260
I'm reminding her

854
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,450
that Zheng

855
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,800
will come to school tomorrow.

856
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,190
His grandma jumped into the river

857
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,380
because of your dad's fraud.

858
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,290
He is...

859
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,650
He

860
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,730
has a bad temper.

861
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,530
If he meets you at school,

862
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,130
he won't let you go, you know?

863
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,580
It has nothing to do with me.

864
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,600
If I skip class,

865
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,240
it's a violation.

866
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,350
That's better than being beaten.

867
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,000
Luo Zheng will beat you hard.

868
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,810
You can ask for leave tomorrow.

869
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,000
Yes.

870
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,020
Take a leave.

871
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,910
Can a leave solve this?

872
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,560
Why doesn't she listen to me?

873
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,640
I know a new transfer student

874
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,620
is hard to join the group.

875
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,239
If anything happens,

876
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,830
you can tell me directly.

877
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,969
But the school has its rules.

878
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,940
We have to follow the rules.

879
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,239
Wear your uniform

880
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:19,409
and cut your hair.

881
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:21,370
Any problem?

882
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,690
You can practice Mandarin well.

883
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:24,699
It's not that hard.

884
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:25,610
You can ask me

885
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,190
or anyone in your class.

886
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,330
We can help you.

887
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,460
It's tough to talk to you.

888
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,010
That's all.

889
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:37,170
Okay?

890
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,159
Thank you.

891
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,120
Door.

892
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:57,600
The kid...

893
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,800
Sir.

894
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:00,830
Come in.

895
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,350
Mr. Gao, I know Qiang Xiaowa.

896
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,510
He helped us.

897
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,800
Once, I, Li Si, and Hu Qiumin

898
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,090
went out to play and got lost.

899
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,440
He drove us back

900
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,610
by tricycle.

901
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,800
He's a nice guy.

902
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:17,220
I'm willing to take him into the group.

903
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,880
That's great.

904
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:19,850
By the way,

905
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,740
help him practice Mandarin.

906
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,170
No problem.

907
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,400
In less than a week,

908
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,210
he will

909
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,670
integrate into our class.

910
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,690
Yuan Shanqing.

911
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,230
Don't you remember me?

912
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,680
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

913
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:54,980
I just want to say

914
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,530
take care of yourself

915
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,050
and study hard.

916
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,670
Ignore them.

917
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,960
I think it's easy

918
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,110
to solve Qiang Xiaowa's problem.

919
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,340
But Yuan Shanqing gives me a headache.

920
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,580
Students have a lot against her.

921
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,830
If it continues,

922
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,010
Yuan Shanqing

923
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,010
can't handle it.

924
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,730
After all, she's a girl

925
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,320
at 16.

926
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,100
One of my classmates

927
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,630
was bullied

928
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,300
and quit school.

929
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,360
Where's Yuan Shanqing's mother?

930
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,360
I saw her parents' names were empty

931
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,080
on her study registration form.

932
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,720
I asked other teachers.

933
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,760
They said

934
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,560
her mother had passed away.

935
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:50,790
I'm not sure.

936
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:51,680
There are many gossips

937
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,010
about her family.

938
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,200
Some students

939
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,370
told me

940
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,400
her parents, and she all

941
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,490
committed crimes.

942
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,780
They are accomplices.

943
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,120
Let's go to her home sometime.

944
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,140
We need to learn about

945
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,540
her life conditions now.

946
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,560
Do you want an ice lolly?

947
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:27,400
No.

948
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,280
Why are you so petty?

949
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,650
Are you still angry?

950
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,910
You gave me the cold shoulder.

951
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:34,980
Am I being petty?

952
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,620
I'm petty.

953
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,290
I'm petty.

954
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:38,820
Alright?

955
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,830
Don't be angry. I was not mad at you.

956
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,570
Then who were you mad at?

957
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:45,710
Nobody.

958
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:48,320
I was wrong.

959
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,310
Really.

960
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,290
I accept your apologies.

961
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,680
If you do this again,

962
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,860
I'll be against you.

963
00:37:59,410 --> 00:37:59,810
Fine.

964
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,120
There is a new transfer student

965
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,200
from outside,

966
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,130
The one who took us back

967
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,060
by his tricycle.

968
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:08,730
I know.

969
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,870
Our head teacher asked me

970
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,180
to help him.

971
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,330
What does this mean?

972
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:15,920
It proves

973
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,810
my leading position in the class.

974
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:19,080
It's so obvious

975
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,280
that the teacher can see it at a glance.

976
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:20,720
Got it?

977
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,090
Are you two bored all day?

978
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:26,770
Cheng Yaya.

979
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,890
Don't worry. Zheng.

980
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,210
Since you're back at school,

981
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,340
focus on your class.

982
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,920
I'll go first.

983
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,560
It works.

984
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,780
She really doesn't come to class today.

985
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,440
Everything is okay…

986
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,970
You and your father should be arrested.

987
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:15,970
Zheng, calm down.

988
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,560
My aunt asked me to take care of you.

989
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,210
The director hasn't gone far.

990
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,380
Calm down.

991
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,810
Calm down.

992
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,570
Cheng Yaya, what do you mean?

993
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:35,930
Are you going to help her?

994
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,840
Aren't you going to beat her?

995
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:41,810
Go ahead.

996
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,160
In school,

997
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,890
you'll be fired if you beat her.

998
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,180
But the victim won't be.

999
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,810
After that,

1000
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,010
you can wait outside the school

1001
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,140
and keep beating her

1002
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,010
and get arrested by the police.

1003
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,800
Then you can wait inside the prison.

1004
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,450
When Yuan Yong is arrested,

1005
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,450
you can

1006
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,180
fight against each other in it.

1007
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,120
Don't fight in school.

1008
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,890
If you get expelled,

1009
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,050
what about your mother?

1010
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:07,450
No.

1011
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,370
You can neither fight outside the school.

1012
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,570
The police will arrest you.

1013
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,120
Luo, it goes too far to hit her.

1014
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,160
She's still a girl.

1015
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,290
You can't beat her.

1016
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,570
That's right.

1017
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,370
You said you didn't want to let her go to school.

1018
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,300
What's going on?

1019
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,430
Luo Zheng,

1020
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,040
we just don't want

1021
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,620
to be in the same class as her.

1022
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,490
But we don't want to stop her from going to school.

1023
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,010
Yes.

1024
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,810
She didn't hurt you,

1025
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:32,920
right?

1026
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,760
No one died in your family, right?

1027
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,400
Zheng, Zheng, Zheng.

1028
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,320
Stop it. Let's have a class first.

1029
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,650
Have a class.

1030
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:44,670
You

1031
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,570
are in cahoots with the wanted.

1032
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:48,890
Fine.

1033
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,310
Wait.

1034
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,290
Alright.

1035
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,200
Ms. Han is coming.

1036
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,260
Let's have a class.

1037
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,970
Calm down.

1038
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,900
Class begins.

1039
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,940
Xiaowa,

1040
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,490
I think I should

1041
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,980
explain formally to you.

1042
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,620
Don't listen to Miaomiao's nonsense.

1043
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,370
When we first met,

1044
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,800
I was stung by a bee

1045
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,700
and sprained my ankle.

1046
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,760
It's inconvenient to walk.

1047
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,360
Look.

1048
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,830
You transferred to our school.

1049
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:24,830
We are classmates

1050
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,170
and deskmates.

1051
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,540
This must be fate.

1052
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:28,680
Don't worry.

1053
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,850
In this school,

1054
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,710
it's helpful to ask for my help.

1055
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,710
I'll protect you.

1056
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,090
Xiaowa.

1057
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:35,920
Here you are.

1058
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:36,890
I have a tape

1059
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,790
to practice Mandarin.

1060
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,080
It's from the radio station.

1061
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,410
Listen to it for a month.

1062
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,930
I'm sure you'll learn it.

1063
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,680
What do you mean?

1064
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:56,780
Are you unhappy that we want to help you?

1065
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,530
Did your parents

1066
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:58,560
teach you manner?

1067
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,280
What a rude man.

1068
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,920
Ignore him.

1069
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,900
Stop fighting!

1070
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:07,930
Ms. Han is coming.

1071
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,400
Ms. Han is coming.

1072
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,480
Stop! Stop!

1073
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,890
Ms. Han is coming. Stop fighting.

1074
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:12,890
Ms. Han is coming.

1075
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,120
We are all from the family of oilfield workers.

1076
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,250
We grew up in the base

1077
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,250
since childhood.

1078
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,890
For us,

1079
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,730
all places out of the base

1080
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,850
are called outside.

1081
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,130
We've been together

1082
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,470
since kindergarten.

1083
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,850
We know each other in our base.

1084
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:32,240
Some adults get married into the base.

1085
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:33,410
But there was no

1086
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,210
transfer students here before.

1087
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,100
In a small place like the base,

1088
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,020
everyone will know

1089
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,400
the news.

1090
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:42,560
Yuan Yong's fraud

1091
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,280
was a big deal in the oilfield.

1092
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,920
We didn't know

1093
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,040
what happened.

1094
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,290
But

1095
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,990
the title of a daughter of a wanted criminal

1096
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,130
prevented us

1097
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:52,290
to get close to her.

1098
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,610
Qiang Xiaowa and Yuan Shanqing

1099
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,770
suddenly

1100
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,660
entered our world.

1101
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,070
At that time,

1102
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,150
we didn't know

1103
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,330
they

1104
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,660
will participate in

1105
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,970
our life for such a long time.
