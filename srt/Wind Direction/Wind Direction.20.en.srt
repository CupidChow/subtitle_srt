00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,990
I have a lot to do.

193
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:22,850
You...

194
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,230
Xiaowa, you're back.

195
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,110
Uncle.

196
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:32,930
Come here.

197
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,740
Xiaowa, you're back.

198
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,390
Uncle.

199
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,620
Why are you here?

200
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,810
I'm here to see you.

201
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,610
Where did you go?

202
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,110
I went to carry the coal balls.

203
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,050
Where are Li Si and Hu?

204
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know where Li Si is.

205
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,310
Hu went to find Wei Xue.

206
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,190
Let me help you.

207
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,550
Don't do it. It's dirty.

208
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,210
It's okay.

209
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,100
Put on the gloves.

210
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,190
I've grilled some dried fish.

211
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,650
Bring some for them later.

212
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,360
Okay.

213
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,660
How many coal balls do you need?

214
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,390
Director Xiao.

215
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,880
I sincerely

216
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,710
apologize to you

217
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,860
from the bottom of my heart.

218
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,300
I hope Director Xiao

219
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,390
can forgive me...

220
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,170
Can forgive me.

221
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,860
There are so many things.

222
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,210
They're all textbooks.

223
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,220
Thank you.

224
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,290
You're welcome.

225
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,270
Ms. Han.

226
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,640
Mr. Gao.

227
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,300
Miaomiao's uncle.

228
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,230
Why are you here?

229
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,740
I'm fine. I'm taking a walk.

230
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,160
Do you need help?

231
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,360
No.

232
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,700
I'll leave you to it.

233
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,350
Jia Baoshan is so nice to you.

234
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,710
He came to school during school hours.

235
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,060
He went to the dorm during the vacation.

236
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,230
But he's not my type.

237
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,600
I can't say that.

238
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,520
But he could have a try.

239
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,660
What if it works?

240
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,650
We're not from the same world.

241
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,150
I can't tell him clearly.

242
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,000
After all, he's the family number of my student.

243
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,930
It's so awkward.

244
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,150
But I think

245
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,170
he's nice.

246
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,790
He's not like

247
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,990
a hood.

248
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,910
Why are you so opposed to it?

249
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,860
He's too active to handle it.

250
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,950
Besides,

251
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,140
I'll definitely

252
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,820
be going back to Shanghai.

253
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,610
I can't find a boyfriend here.

254
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,350
But do you

255
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,900
want to go back to Shanghai?

256
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,090
I'm from Oilfield.

257
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,430
I have to go back to Oilfield to teach others.

258
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,110
You're here to gain more work experience.

259
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,770
I'm here to serve my hometown.

260
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,110
So...

261
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,810
Ms. Han.

262
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,460
Well.

263
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,480
I need to talk to Mr. Gao.

264
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,410
Me?

265
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,560
What's up? What do you want from me?

266
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,620
Nothing serious.

267
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,670
I just want to ask

268
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,790
if Director Xiao

269
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,350
has a bad temper?

270
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,650
Not bad.

271
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,250
She's straightforward, but she's very nice.

272
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,150
If you offended her

273
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,110
at school,

274
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,010
how would you resolve it?

275
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,230
We haven't offended her.

276
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:07,800
You...

277
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,130
Did you offend her again?

278
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,940
What do you mean "again"?

279
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,960
Director Xiao is good in everything.

280
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,810
But she's narrow-minded.

281
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,290
If you offended her,

282
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,590
you should have apologized to her
as soon as possible.

283
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,740
The Chinese New Year is coming.

284
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,740
She's going home.

285
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,920
If you don't apologize to her quickly,

286
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,050
it will be harder to solve the problem.

287
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,200
It's okay. I'll leave you to it.

288
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,880
I'm leaving.

289
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,840
What is this?

290
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,550
Artificial cochlea.

291
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,590
Who's using it?

292
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,200
Zi is deaf-mute.

293
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,360
She had a fever when she was young.

294
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,430
It became like this after the fever went down.

295
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,329
Come on.

296
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,829
Do you have wine at home?

297
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,150
No.

298
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,840
Get me a bottle tomorrow.

299
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:03,760
Si.

300
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,910
It's so cold.

301
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:07,710
Why are you here

302
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,390
alone?

303
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,470
I'm feeling cool

304
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,790
outside.

305
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,370
Isn't my sister home?

306
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,950
I'm not looking for her.

307
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,960
Have you seen Yuan Shanqing?

308
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,150
No.

309
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,630
When I came here,

310
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,690
the house was dark.

311
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,300
It's strange.

312
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,750
She hasn't been home all day.

313
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,990
Where has she been?

314
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,670
They don't like staying at home.

315
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,770
Your sister doesn't like staying at home either.

316
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,430
What's wrong?

317
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,550
Did you quarrel with my sister?

318
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,320
Quarreled?

319
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,350
No, we didn't.

320
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,650
She always scolded me.

321
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,790
She only dared to scold you.

322
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,340
And me.

323
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,320
Do you know why?

324
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,020
Why?

325
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,230
Because we humoured her.

326
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,500
She knew that no matter how badly she scolded us,

327
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,550
we'd never

328
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,550
turn against her.

329
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,120
She's arrogant because she's favored.

330
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,240
We've grown up together.

331
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,210
You know me well.

332
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,530
I've always been generous

333
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,110
with people, money and matters.

334
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,700
So you're not generous now?

335
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,350
I don't know

336
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,870
what's wrong with me recently.

337
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,930
I've been so upset.

338
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,890
Xiaowa is the reason

339
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,770
you've been so unhappy lately,

340
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:27,930
right?

341
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,190
Well.

342
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,280
How could you know that?

343
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,970
Your mind has been reflected

344
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,630
on your face since childhood.

345
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,540
Now there are only three words on your face.

346
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,930
I am angry.

347
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,190
I...

348
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,530
Is it that obvious?

349
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,130
Look at you.

350
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,340
You're so kind.

351
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,500
You've helped Yuan Shanqing.

352
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,030
And you donated money to Zi.

353
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,010
You said Xiaowa was

354
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,490
not good in a lot of ways.

355
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,540
But you didn't

356
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,000
miss anything to help him.

357
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,150
When it comes to the girl from his village,

358
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,350
you were the first one

359
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,290
to offer help.

360
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,720
If you're really

361
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,940
a petty person,

362
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,810
would you be willing to help others like that?

363
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,970
But I just found it strange.

364
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,180
Since Qiang Xiaowa transferred here,

365
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,710
your sister has been busy

366
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,610
with him.

367
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,310
I've never thought of myself

368
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,310
as being so petty.

369
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,420
I'm sick of myself.

370
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,110
When your sister said something nice to me,

371
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,910
I stopped being angry.

372
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,100
But she turned against me again in a few days.

373
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,900
She kept repeating the process.

374
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,830
My mom once asked me

375
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,350
why I

376
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,010
helped Yuan Shanqing so much?

377
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,190
I thought about the reason.

378
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,590
Was it because she saved me when I was young?

379
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,080
Was it because I believed she was not wrong?

380
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,280
Or was it because she was pretty?

381
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,120
Was it because she was pitiful?

382
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,370
All of these reasons were available.

383
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,800
But what kept me going in the end

384
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,690
was my family.

385
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,190
Because they chose to trust me

386
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,170
and support me.

387
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,400
They finished the help with me.

388
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,790
Haven't you been helping

389
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,990
Yuan Shanqing and me?

390
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,360
Do you remember that?

391
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,050
When we were young,

392
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,250
Hu was bullied.

393
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,020
They said her mom had no man to marry.

394
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,620
My sister was the first one

395
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,680
to fight with them.

396
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,970
Then you two

397
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,730
stood in front of Hu and told her

398
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,440
if anyone dared to scold

399
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,170
or bully her like this,

400
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,370
you would beat him up.

401
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,460
My mom and your mom did similar thing.

402
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,070
Hu Yue

403
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,500
was scolded badly.

404
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,910
Our moms

405
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:40,930
rushed at the woman

406
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:41,790
and hit her in the mouth in the ballroom.

407
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,130
They even pulled that woman's hair

408
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,750
and ripped her hair.

409
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,990
Why did we do these?

410
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,540
Because that's what they did.

411
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,810
They would protect their friends

412
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,990
and unconditionally

413
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,190
trust their friends.

414
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,830
Si.

415
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,820
We've always been like this.

416
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,380
Even if we hadn't encountered Yuan Shanqing

417
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,380
and Qiang Xiaowa,

418
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,470
we will still be like this.

419
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,390
I see.

420
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,130
We are born kind.

421
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,950
It's in the genes.

422
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,000
Let's go.

423
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,590
Go back to sleep.

424
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,180
Why does that boy

425
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,540
always come to you?

426
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,650
He's my deskmate.

427
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,600
His mom works here.

428
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,060
Zi and I could live here

429
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,660
because his mom helped us.

430
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,150
When does his mom usually come?

431
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,770
Tomorrow morning.

432
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:09,800
And an aunt

433
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,630
often helps me to take care of Zi.

434
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,550
I've met with them

435
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,550
every day before.

436
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,350
If tomorrow goes well,

437
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,150
they will definitely

438
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,110
come to me again.

439
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,550
Is there anywhere else

440
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,280
I can go?

441
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,850
I've stopped renting the previous house.

442
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,410
Whatever you do,

443
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,740
don't let them

444
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,080
come to you these days.

445
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,210
Come on. Have some water.

446
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,140
She won't be back for a while, right?

447
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,710
Yes. She just left.

448
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:56,690
It's okay.

449
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,750
Well, you...

450
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,950
Drink slowly.

451
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,870
You look so nervous.

452
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,750
What happened?

453
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,890
Yeah, what's wrong?

454
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,380
You quarreled too?

455
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,580
Quarreled?

456
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,340
If the thing goes wrong,

457
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,880
it'll be much more serious than a quarrel.

458
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,420
Then tell us quickly.

459
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:16,930
Stop dawdling.

460
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,990
It's about the volleyball competition.

461
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,080
The two teams were drawn into a group.

462
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,560
Which two teams?

463
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,710
Second Plant and Third Plant.

464
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,030
The two teams were drawn into a group.

465
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,870
Bai Shuang.

466
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,740
I knew it.

467
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,220
Only Bai Shuang

468
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,690
could make him so nervous.

469
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,710
Have you two been in touch again?

470
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,230
No.

471
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,220
Don't you know what I'm like?

472
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,190
I have family now. How could I do that?

473
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,560
So why are you

474
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,130
so nervous?

475
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:44,730
Why?

476
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,690
I'm afraid to meet her.

477
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,300
There will be too many people.

478
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,100
I haven't told my wife the truth.

479
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,450
Lingling

480
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,720
only knew that

481
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,250
I used to be with Bai Shuang.

482
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,200
They haven't seen each other.

483
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,910
Do you understand?

484
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,750
Yes.

485
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,310
You're doomed.

486
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,290
Bai Shuang is the leader of Third Plant.

487
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,680
She must come.

488
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,510
You're right.

489
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:07,700
About the leader,

490
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,350
our plant asked me to be the leader.

491
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,840
Well...

492
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,750
The leaders will definitely meet each other.

493
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,480
What can I do?

494
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,290
Bai Shuang hates me so much.

495
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:17,970
Well.

496
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,500
It's okay.

497
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,490
A straight man is not afraid of
a crooked shoe, right?

498
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,860
A straight foot is not afraid of a crooked shoe.

499
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,610
A straight person is not afraid of
crooked shadows.

500
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,640
Yes. You have a straight body and straight feet,

501
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,240
right?

502
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,590
You didn't do anything wrong.

503
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,270
Don't be afraid.

504
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,210
Don't be nervous.

505
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:31,880
Yes.

506
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,250
Besides,

507
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,240
it's been years.

508
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,990
Don't scare yourself.

509
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,860
Just be generous.

510
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,600
The more nervous you are,

511
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,940
the more things seem to be wrong with you.

512
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,460
Yes.

513
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,970
It's easy for you to say.

514
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,510
It's not easy

515
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,190
for us to say that.

516
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,710
That's right.

517
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,990
If your ex-wife comes here

518
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:49,880
and stands in front of you,

519
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,210
won't you feel nervous?

520
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:52,720
Can you relax?

521
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,680
Stop talking nonsense.

522
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,440
Let me tell you.

523
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,650
We're buddies.

524
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,350
Please help me.

525
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,600
It's Chinese New Year.
Family matters are the most important.

526
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,550
Help me find out

527
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,450
when she's arriving.

528
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,150
And how many days will she be here?
Where will she be staying?

529
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,660
Help me find out, okay?

530
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,230
You want Bai Shuang's information?

531
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,240
Do I need Niu Lingling's?

532
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,110
Well, I know that...

533
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,250
You don't need to ask Niu Lingling's information.

534
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,310
I know. Bai Shuang. Bai Shuang.

535
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,140
I know.

536
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,940
I'm just afraid of Hu Yue.

537
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,840
Where will she be staying?

538
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,440
Will she be staying at the plant's guesthouse?

539
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,430
I want Bai Shuang's information.

540
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,020
Okay.

541
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,290
Not Niu Lingling's.

542
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,600
Why are you involved in this?

543
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,240
Cheng Pengfei is the referee.

544
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,400
I have to help him with the scoreboard.

545
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,450
Hu Yue, you're here too.

546
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,370
I've bought some oranges.

547
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,210
Here, try it.

548
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,140
Great.

549
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,470
I was just hoping for something to eat.

550
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,110
You'll be thirsty if you eat peanuts.
It's for you.

551
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,110
I'll wash my hands.

552
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,640
What are you talking about?

553
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,290
The volleyball competition of our plant.

554
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,180
Don't mention the volleyball competition.

555
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,920
I'm so angry about it.

556
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,290
What's the point of having a volleyball competition

557
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,810
in the Chinese New Year?

558
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,110
They said Dahai

559
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,330
should be the team leader.

560
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,550
He has got a stomachache again.

561
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,440
I have to

562
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,990
buy medicine for him later.

563
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,110
It was organised by the bureau.

564
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,430
Our labor union

565
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,430
has been busy lately.

566
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,230
I couldn't have a good vacation.

567
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,710
It's not a competition in our plant.

568
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,140
The four plants will compete with each other.

569
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,880
Are the other three plants coming?

570
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,720
Yes. You don't know that?

571
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,060
They will compete together.

572
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,140
Dahai

573
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,910
and Yang

574
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,140
drew the same group.

575
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,750
They will compete with each other.

576
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,550
It will be a boring competition.

577
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,080
Come over then.

578
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,560
Cheng Pengfei is the referee.

579
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,760
You can sit next to me.

580
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:33,890
It's too sour.

581
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,380
What kind of orange is it?

582
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,320
I'll go exchange.

583
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,040
It looks pretty, but...

584
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,270
It's sour? I'll go find the sellers.

585
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,940
Go find the sellers.

586
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,450
But this is not sour.

587
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,600
It's sour. Try this.

588
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,500
Why did you ask me to come back?

589
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,560
Change your shoes.

590
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:58,400
If you bring mud from your shoes
to the floor, will you mop it?

591
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,870
You go up the mountain

592
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,530
more often than you come home.

593
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,890
If you're willing to go to the front line,

594
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,050
why do you want to be a director?

595
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,930
Just continue to be an oil worker.

596
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,710
Who pissed you off?

597
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,140
Who?

598
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,480
Tell me. I'll teach him a lesson.

599
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:26,960
Okay.

600
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,080
I'll see how you can help me.

601
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,510
Who promised your mom

602
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,980
to go to Weihai this Chinese New Year?

603
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,560
Who?

604
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,900
Stop pretending.

605
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,930
Your mom called just now.

606
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,690
She said you promised her

607
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,360
to go back to Weihai this Chinese New Year.

608
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,670
So it's because of this.

609
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,920
Yes. My mom

610
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,790
called me

611
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,900
and asked me

612
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,150
if I would go home this Chinese New Year.

613
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,550
I said I wanted to.

614
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,660
But it would depend on the situation.

615
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,020
What's the situation?

616
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:06,920
I'll be on duty.

617
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,670
Will you be on duty again this Chinese New Year?

618
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,670
Leaders are on duty on holidays

619
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,200
to set examples for others.

620
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,290
To set examples?

621
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,750
To set examples for the plant, right?

622
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,220
Li Dahai.

623
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,010
Have you forgotten?

624
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,180
You promised my mom

625
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,580
to go back to Qingdao this Chinese New Year.

626
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,810
Have you forgotten?

627
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:29,930
No.

628
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,390
Okay, Li Dahai.

629
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,070
You're

630
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,430
such a smooth operator.

631
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,830
At the plant, your family and my family,

632
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,430
you're always a good person.

633
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,770
There's only one New Year's Eve.

634
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,450
Let me see where you are going to spend it.

635
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,360
Honey.

636
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,040
Let me tell you.

637
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,850
Regarding where to

638
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,550
spend the Chinese New Year,

639
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,310
shall we

640
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,310
talk about

641
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,060
it?

642
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,870
What do you want to talk about?

643
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,480
Let me tell you.

644
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,590
We've been married for 20 years.

645
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,150
Only the year we got married,

646
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,100
you came home with me for the Chinese New Year,

647
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,980
right?

648
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,040
After our son was born,

649
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,240
we haven't been back.

650
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,080
Now our son has grown up.

651
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,300
His grandma said

652
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,740
she wanted to spend the Chinese New Year
with her grandson.

653
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,740
What do you think?

654
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,600
I don't think

655
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,850
this request is too much.

656
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,200
Why is that not too much?

657
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,320
I'm not going anywhere this Chinese New Year.

658
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,780
I'll stay at the oilfield.

659
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,170
Go away.

660
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,000
I wasn't discussing it with you.

661
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,920
I'm not discussing it with you either.

662
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,180
No matter where you will go,

663
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,440
this Chinese New Year,

664
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,760
I'll stay at home.

665
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,870
What do you mean?

666
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,150
I need to secure my position.

667
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:57,990
If I leave

668
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,860
at this critical moment,

669
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,550
then I'll really

670
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,770
lose my position.

671
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,960
What are you talking about?

672
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,270
I've already made a statement.

673
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,160
That's the situation.

674
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,330
In my opinion,

675
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,610
we can handle it in this way.

676
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,380
We'll

677
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,600
have our own Chinese New Year this year.

678
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,350
Dad.

679
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,930
You can go to you mom's house
for the Chinese New Year.

680
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,990
Mom, you can go to you mom's house
for the Chinese New Year.

681
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,220
Since we all need someone

682
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,090
to be with us this Chinese New Year,

683
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,100
let's just spend it in our own ways.

684
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,380
We won't be happy if we're tied together.

685
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,190
Okay, that's all.

686
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,730
You bastard.

687
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,230
He's got a point.

688
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,040
Well.

689
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,430
You can spend the Chinese New Year

690
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,490
wherever you want.

691
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,490
I'll listen to my wife.

692
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,320
Okay?

693
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,320
Don't make it hard for me.

694
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,130
Then I won't just arrange

695
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,530
for the Chinese New Year.

696
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,640
I've prepared the stomach medicine for you.

697
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,530
Don't affect your volleyball competition.

698
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,660
You have to continue to be the leader.

699
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,800
I have to

700
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,480
to cheer for you.

701
00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:00,840
[To Aunt and Yaya:
I'll take Zi out for a few days. Don't worry about us.
From Shanqing]

702
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,230
[Four Seasons]

703
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,480
Sister.

704
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,450
What about our night shift?

705
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,910
I'll ask Baoshan and Yaya

706
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,000
to come here often.

707
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,920
In fact, it's so cold,

708
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,720
and no one will come to steal anything.

709
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,730
But I'm used to

710
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,960
taking care of Zi.

711
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,120
I've been a little out of sorts

712
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,640
since she left.

713
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,210
You're used to taking care of her?

714
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,950
After you have a baby,
you'll always take care of him or her.

715
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:23,950
Come on.

716
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,360
Just don't cry.

717
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,470
Will your family come

718
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,520
to take care of the child?

719
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,720
Yes, my mom will come.

720
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,540
Mom.

721
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,110
Aunt Ma.

722
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,120
Yaya is here.

723
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:38,920
Mom.

724
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,020
Have you seen Yuan Shanqing?

725
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,240
No.

726
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,550
Do you know

727
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,810
where she went to play?

728
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,880
How would I know?

729
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,090
Why did she tell me this?

730
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:49,630
Look.

731
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,790
Why did she leave

732
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,270
without saying anything?

733
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,750
Isn't it written here?

734
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,280
It's holiday.

735
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,140
She will take Zi out for a few days.

736
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,520
You really let her stay here

737
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,580
to be on duty for us?

738
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,590
She could have at least told me.

739
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,910
I went to see her yesterday.

740
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,070
But she was not home all day.

741
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,730
Why did she leave a note today?

742
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,139
Are you her leader?

743
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:11,010
Why should she report everything to you?

744
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:11,870
It's written

745
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,670
clearly.

746
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,960
She will be back in a few days.

747
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,420
Why are you in such a hurry?

748
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:16,630
That's all.

749
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,870
Don't get in my way.

750
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,090
I have work to do.

751
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,560
Hello, who is it?

752
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,070
Miaomiao?

753
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,920
Okay. Wait a minute.

754
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,370
Son.

755
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,400
It's Miaomiao. Hurry.

756
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,010
Tell her I'm sleeping.

757
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,400
What's wrong?

758
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:39,969
Nothing.

759
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,670
I'll call her back when I'm free.

760
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:44,860
Okay.

761
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,030
Hello, Miaomiao.

762
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,760
Li Si has a diarrhea.

763
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,200
I'll ask him to call you back later.

764
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,960
Okay, bye.

765
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,740
I've told you Si was upset.

766
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,050
But you didn't believe me.

767
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,370
He is upset every day.

768
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,600
He's just petty.

769
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,480
He's not petty.

770
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,730
You've thought about

771
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,660
everyone else's feelings,

772
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,480
but you never once

773
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,640
considered Li Si's.

774
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,860
Think about it.

775
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,000
We'll have a volleyball competition today.

776
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,490
You can have the meal

777
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,440
with your uncle.

778
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,210
Aren't you waiting for my mom?

779
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:28,980
No.

780
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,320
I have a meeting before the competition.

781
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,990
Bye.

782
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,390
Pengfei! Pengfei!

783
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,130
Hurry up!

784
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,280
Where's your dad?

785
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,290
He's gone.

786
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,090
Why didn't he wait for me?

787
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,230
He's so bad.

788
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,750
[Linqi Oilfield Gym]

789
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,760
If you knock on the car, all of them will...

790
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,230
The windows are open?

791
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,180
Why did you open the windows?

792
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,620
I feel hot. Close them.

793
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:10,620
Okay.

794
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,020
What's wrong?

795
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,380
Something is going to happen.

796
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,520
I didn't know what Lingling knew.

797
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,870
She insisted to come to the volleyball competition

798
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:26,870
to cheer for us.

799
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,660
She hates volleyball.

800
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,670
She doesn’t like volleyball.

801
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,640
Has the news leaked?

802
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,060
I didn't say anything.

803
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,940
I couldn't betray you.

804
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,850
Me too.

805
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,780
Think about it. If I tell others,

806
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,450
Jia Daiyu

807
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,760
will not forgive you.

808
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,270
Yes.

809
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,490
She'll chase you around.

810
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,040
Yes.

811
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,040
I've been feeling bad all morning.

812
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,260
My heart was thumping. My face got hot.

813
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,110
I felt confused.

814
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:56,750
Let me see.

815
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,740
Was your blood pressure okay?

816
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,860
It must be up.

817
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:00,860
You...

818
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,120
Are you worried

819
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,220
that Bai Shuang will come to you?

820
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,210
I feel sorry for her.

821
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,150
If she's coming to get back at me,

822
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,250
What should I do?

823
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,800
I'll lost my career,

824
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,560
my lover and my family.

825
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,260
I'm doomed.

826
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:19,550
But I think

827
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,110
you are too nervous.

828
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,760
It's not that bad.

829
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,670
Bai Shuang and I

830
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,970
used to work in the same plant.

831
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:25,920
I knew her.

832
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,610
She is

833
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,870
a gentle female.

834
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,950
She's a nice person.

835
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,200
And she raises her child alone.

836
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:33,790
She's had a hard time.

837
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,240
What?

838
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,030
What did you say?

839
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,650
I said she was a nice person.

840
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,720
The sentence after that.

841
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,920
She's had a hard time.

842
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,690
What do you mean?

843
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,870
She raises her child alone.

844
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,000
Raise a child alone?

845
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,930
What about her husband?

846
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,150
Her husband?

847
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,310
It's said that he died early.

848
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,270
Anyway,

849
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,580
he's not from the same oilfield as us.

850
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,310
I don't know the details.

851
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,780
She has really had a hard time.

852
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,920
Her husband is dead?

853
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:06,550
Yes.

854
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,420
Then...

855
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,250
How old

856
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,200
is the child?

857
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,380
She's the same age as Yang Tao.

858
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,760
She was born in April.

859
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,590
In April, 1976?

860
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,760
Yes.

861
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,480
Is it a boy or a girl?

862
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,160
A girl.

863
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,720
What's wrong?

864
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,100
Why didn't you tell me

865
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,230
this important information earlier?

866
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,310
Is this information important?

867
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,240
Is it important?

868
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,490
You haven't asked me.

869
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:39,570
Open the windows.

870
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:42,780
Open them.

871
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,000
I'm cold.

872
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,220
Get off the car.

873
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,100
What's wrong with you?

874
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,040
Get off the car.

875
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,920
Let's leave.

876
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,960
It's warm inside. Let's go.

877
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,250
Don't catch a cold.

878
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,310
Don't be so nervous.

879
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,240
Okay.

880
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,440
Let's go. Go.

881
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,830
Where are the tea cups?

882
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:10,750
Here they are.

883
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,480
Yue. Yue.

884
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:32,550
What's wrong?

885
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,590
What are you doing?

886
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,160
To watch the competition.

887
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,160
Why does everyone ask this

888
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,240
when they see me?

889
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,320
Are you dressed like this

890
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,380
for the competition?

891
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:48,910
Yes.

892
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:49,580
I think

893
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,930
you're going to the Spring Festival Gala.

894
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,670
I'm not playing in the competition.

895
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,670
What's wrong with dressing nicely?

896
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:56,910
Go back to your work.

897
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,110
Don't worry about me.

898
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,590
Now let's welcome

899
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,550
the team of Second Oil Extraction Plant

900
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,860
and the team of Third Oil Extraction Plant.

901
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,940
Let's bring in the best players.

902
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:09,850
Applause!

903
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,890
Don't be anxious.

904
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,070
I can see

905
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,390
the referee is anxious.

906
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,960
We have another part.

907
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,930
Next is the leader’s introduction session.

908
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:51,600
Now let’s welcome

909
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,640
our two leaders,

910
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,530
Li Dahai from Second Plant

911
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,160
and Bai Shuang from Third Plant.

912
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,020
Let's welcome.

913
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,420
Now,

914
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,910
please introduce your teams.

915
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:08,520
Come on.

916
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,420
Me first?

917
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:10,900
Okay.

918
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,450
Hello, everyone.

919
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:16,010
I'm the leader of

920
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,250
Second Oil Extraction Plant, Li Dahai.

921
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,690
I'm already familiar with all of you.

922
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:21,970
I've been coming every year.

923
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,100
Secretary Yan Ming.

924
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,680
Well, our Second Plant

925
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,770
will definitely

926
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,610
boost the spirit of oil men.

927
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,470
Well.

928
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,260
Friendship first.

929
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,180
Competition second.

930
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,300
Show our spirit.

931
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,210
Show our skills.

932
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:39,970
What's more...

933
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,000
Thank you.

934
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:45,020
Here.

935
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,510
He said thank you.

936
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:55,850
Hello, everyone.

937
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,080
I'm the leader of Third Oil Extraction Plant,

938
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,800
Bai Shuang.

939
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,500
I've known Li Dahai

940
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:02,910
for a long time.

941
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:11,350
If it weren't for the time when I was 19...

942
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:12,640
You...

943
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,620
I couldn't control myself.

944
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,350
It was only when I was in college

945
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,670
that I read Eileen Chang's

946
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,240
"Red Rose and White Rose".

947
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,710
But I've already known
