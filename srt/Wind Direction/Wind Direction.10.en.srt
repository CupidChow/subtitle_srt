Great job!

5
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,440
Kids, think about it.

6
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,110
What things do we find in nature?

7
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,630
There's the sky. There are trees...

8
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,070
Yaya,

9
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,470
you got this wrong.

10
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,950
The lake should be blue,

11
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,690
not pink.

12
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,270
Use this.

13
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,270
Why does the lake have to be blue?

14
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,630
It's common sense.

15
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,700
Have you ever seen a pink lake?

16
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,590
A pink lake?

17
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,410
Well, I haven't.

18
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,830
It doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,579
That's true.

20

How do you know for sure?

21
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,280
Maybe there's a pink lake

Do you have to go out to sea every day?

When it's windy, we can't go out.

00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,750
No, I can't.

114
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,360
At most, one dive will catch a fish.

115
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,640
That's impressive.

She can't talk yet.

147
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,680
She's only two.

148
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,790
But most kids can talk

149
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,850
by this age, right?

150
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,870
Maybe she's just a bit slow.

151
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,600
I've been teaching her.

152
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,550
Don't worry too much.

153
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,659
Some kids just talk later.

154
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,000
I remember my mom saying

155
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,350
I didn't start speaking properly

156
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,110
until after I was almost two and a half.

157
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,150
She even joked that

158
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,630
she gave birth to a fool!

159
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,870
But I'm saying,

160
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,060
I may have spoken late,

161
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,150
but I walked early—

162
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,910
by the time I was one, I could walk.

163
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,910
Unlike my sister,

164
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,870
who walked late.

165
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,470
Even now, at 17,

166
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,070
she still trips all the time!

167
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,570
Zi's fine with walking, though.

168
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,850
She started wobbling around

169
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,180
at about one.

170
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,430
Exactly,

171
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,130

173
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,050
Don't stress about it.

174
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,110
Here.

175
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,360
Grandpa, this is so delicious!

176
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,550
You don't get to eat this often

177
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,110
at home, do you?

178
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,030
Where would I?

179
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,070
My mom's cooking is awful.

180
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,200
My dad's a little better,

181
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,190
but not by much.

182
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,990
I don't like either of their cooking.

183
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,830
Well, eat up if you like it.

184
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,309
These are fish we caught ourselves,

185
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,909
and seafood too—

186
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,909
super fresh.

187
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,870
Whenever you want more,

188
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,190
just come by the seaside.

189
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,870
Okay, but they used to say

190
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,870
this was a local area,

191
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,600
and we weren't allowed to come over. They said...

192
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,710
They said it's the sea,

193
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,070
but we don't really know how to swim.

194
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,990
Girl,

195
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,070
I wanted to ask you something.

196
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,630
How's Xiaowa

197
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,070
doing in school?

198
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,510
Do the teachers think he's doing alright?

199
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,050
Yeah, he's doing fine!

200
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,230
The teachers and students

201
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,430
all really like him.

202
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,230
Really?

203
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,750
That's great!

204
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,330
Oh right, Grandpa,

205
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,700
our school has some rules.

206
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,190
Like, boys can't

207
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,460
have really long hair.

208
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,110
Also,

209
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,910
we have to wear the same uniform.

210
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,440
Whatever rules the school has,

211
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,710
we'll follow them.

212
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,330
We can't let the teachers worry about us.

213
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,590
But his hair, ever since he was a kid,

214
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,230
his older brother used to cut it for him.

215
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:37,690
Now that

216
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,430
his brother's been working away for a few years,

217
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,760
no one's around to help.

218
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,630
He's gotten stubborn about it,

219
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,430
and won't let anyone else touch his hair.

220
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,990
Isn't it frustrating?

221
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,070
I get it.

222
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,390
My little brother's the same way,

223
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,630
hates getting his hair cut.

224
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,070
Every time it happens,

225
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,830
he cries like the world's ending.

226
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,990
In the end, my mom had to cut it for him.

227
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,800
They're exactly alike.

228
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
But we can't break the school rules.

229
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,720
This time,

230
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,020
whether he likes it or not, he's getting it cut.

231
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,020
Did you hear that?

232
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,290
Did you hear me?

233
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,030
Say something, will you?

234
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,680
Speak up!

235
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,420
Grandpa.

236
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,310
Is it just the two of you living here?

237
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,570
Where are his parents?

238
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,510
I don't have parents.

239
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,430
I found Xiaowa

240
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,170
and picked him up.

241
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,790
Girl,

242
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,510
I'm not well-educated.

243
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,670
I can barely read or write.

244
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,330
Teaching Xiaowa is beyond me.

245
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,350
I just worry

246
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,470
his stubbornness

247
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,020
will make it hard for him to fit in.

248
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,680
He's not being bullied, is he?

249
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,000
Grandpa.

250
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,910
Don't worry.

251
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,770
As long as I'm around,

252
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,130
no one will bully him.

253
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,950
I promise

254
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,850
I'll look after Xiaowa.

255
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,470
Good, good,

256
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,870
good.

257
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,780
Girl, eat.

258
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,030
Here.

259
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,530
She goes to bed right after eating?

260
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,900
She loves sleeping.

261
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,360
You go ahead and eat.

262
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,190
I'm not hungry.

263
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Well, I'm hungry!

264
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,750
I can make scrambled eggs for you.

265
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,950
Wanna try my cooking?

266
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,510
Where are your eggs?

267
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,310
We're out of eggs.

268
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,950
Go home and eat dinner.

269
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,030
It's fine.

270
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,710
I usually just drink milk at night.

271
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,310
Grandpa, that's enough.

272
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,470
Don't pack more.

273
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,510
I can't finish it.

274
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,700
If you finish it, come back for more.

275
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,950
Don't be shy.

276
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,550
Don't worry.

277
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,510
I won't!

278
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,150
Here.

279
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,590
Okay.

280
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,950
Alright, I'm heading out. See you next time!

281
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,700
Okay, walk her out.

282
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,110
The sea breeze is strong. Watch your step. Be careful.

283
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,270
Hurry up.

284
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,900
From now on, we are brothers.

285
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,440
Starting tomorrow, I'll teach you Mandarin.

286
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,090
Think of this as the tuition fee.

287
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,720
Give it to me. I know the way.

288
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,920
No need to walk me out.

289
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,430
Wait, wait!

290
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,870
It's not stolen.

291
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,790
Grandpa gave it to me.

292
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,390
Babao.

293
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,790
You already ate my sausages.

294
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,630
You can't do this!

295
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,270
Babao!

296
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,140
No, no.

297
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,830
My mom said

298
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,230
I was weaned early,

299
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,390
so she worried I wasn't getting enough nutrients.

300
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,470
She made me drink milk powder.

301
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,110
Then

302
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,890
I discovered a new way to eat it—

303
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,530
with a spoon,

304
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,430
straight out of the can.

305
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,110
I'd get in trouble for it all the time.

306
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,470
Wanna try?

307
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,750
No, milk powder's expensive.

308
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,310
It's really good, I swear!

309
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,230
I'm not lying.

310
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,660
Go ahead.

311
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,070
Try it.

312
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,310
Tasty, right?

313
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,310
You better tell me the truth.

314
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,550
What's going on here?

315
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,260
I just tripped and fell.

316
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,550
Did you sneak into someone's house

317
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,750
and steal something?

318
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,720
How could I?

319
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,120
Everything here was given to me by Grandpa.

320
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,430
Later, their dog chased me

321
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,470
and I fell.

322
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,570
He gave this to you?

323
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,370
Then why did their dog chase you?

324
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,630
Why would they give you stuff?

325
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,230
You think you're some model villager?

326
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,710
Believe it or not.

327
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,710
They gave it to me.

328
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,630
Look at you,

329
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,160
eating raw food and getting an upset stomach.

330
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,100
Where did you go?

331
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,240
It's 9:30, and you're only just coming home.

332
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,830
Were you out grave robbing again?

333
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,630
No.

334
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,110
I went to a classmate's house for dinner.

335
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,110
Which classmate?

336
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,910
Wang Fuqiang.

337
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,120
Why didn't you come home for dinner?

338
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,580
I already ate at his place.

339
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,270
Is there no food at home

340
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,390
or something?

341
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,760
Why do you both keep running to other people's houses to eat?

342
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,950
Mom,

343
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,070
where's Yaya's school bag and uniform?

344
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,110
I can't find them.

345
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,590
Do you know where they are?

346
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,030
Why do you need them?

347
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,950
I'm giving them to Qiang Xiaowa in my class.

348
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,470
His family is so poor.

349
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,830
I was shocked

350
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,110
when I went to their house today.

351
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,070
You know what?

352
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,390
It's like they're living 20 years in the past.

353
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,390
They have nothing.

354
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,190
Besides, Dad,

355
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,670
they sleep on a boat.

356
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,090
They eat, sleep, everything up there.

357
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,670
You didn't act all surprised

358
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,070
in front of them, did you?

359
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,470
Of course not! I'm not stupid.

360
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,470
That would've been embarrassing for them.

361
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,270
I just acted like

362
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:00,950
everything was totally new

363
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,470
to me

364
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,870
and everything was so fascinating.

365
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,590
You've got a sharp mind—

366
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,030
understanding and considerate.

367
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,270
But your brain doesn't seem to

368
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,200
be working in the right direction.

369
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,670
Why?

370
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,950
Helping a classmate isn't a good thing?

371
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,320
I'm a candidate for class leader now,

372
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,590
so I've got to step up and take responsibility.

373
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,220
Mr. Gao told me to help Qiang Xiaowa

374
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,150
cut his hair,

375
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,870
wear his uniform, and learn Mandarin.

376
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,230
He needs to fit in with the class.

377
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,710
That's my task.

378
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,710
Mr. Gao said

379
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,950
we need to be true to ourselves.

380
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,620
My goal is to be a good person.

381
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,590
How about you first focus on

382
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,040
being a good student?

383
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,110
Mom,

384
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,190
those two things

385
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,750
don't conflict at all.

386
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,910
Right now, I'm figuring out

387
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,030
my direction in life.

388
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,020
Mr. Gao said

389
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,100
getting high scores isn't a dream;

390
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,510
a dream should be

391
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,640
about planning for the future.

392
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,030
This Mr. Gao

393
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,670
doesn't want students to get high scores now?

394
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,270
What kind of teacher is that?

395
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,310
It's not about not getting high scores。

396
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,030
How are you

397
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,430
not getting it?

398
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,220
Dad, you get it, right?

399
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,069
Wanting to be a good person

400
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,349
is a great goal.

401
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,630
But first,

402
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,470
you need to

403
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,720
strengthen yourself,

404
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,430
so you can achieve that goal.

405
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,190
Understand?

406
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,119
Totally.

407
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,900
Do you know why your classmate

408
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,070
doesn't cut his hair

409
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,080
or wear the uniform?

410
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,810
Because his family is too poor.

411
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,300
So, he feels inferior.

412
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,690
If you really want to help him,

413
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,790
you have to start

414
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,590
by breaking down that sense of shame.

415
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,320
Understand?

416
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,160
You have to fix the root of the problem.

417
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,990
Got it. Thank you, Dad.

418
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,710
What are you thanking me for?

419
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,070
Cheng Yaya, what are you

420
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,330
rummaging through my room for this time?

421
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,800
Something seems off with Zi.

422
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,600
I'm checking the books to see what they say.

423
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,150
Could it be... some sort of

424
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,550
developmental issue with her intelligence?

425
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,120
Wait, who's Zi?

426
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,630
What's going on now?

427
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,150
We've got two kids at home.

428
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,830
One wants to help a local kid,

429
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,110
and the other wants to help the child of a fugitive.

430
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,110
Are we turning our house into a temple

431
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,110
to save the world.

432
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,800
Listen to yourself.

433
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,140
The kids are just trying to

434
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,550
do good deeds.

435
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,070
Good deeds, huh?

436
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,830
Fine, you're all saints.

437
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,540
I'm the only bad one in the family now,

438
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,430
right?

439
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:37,390
Why don't you all

440
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,990
team up and go save the world,

441
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:39,710
and maybe bring home

442
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,150
a banner to hang on the wall?

443
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,920
Or better yet,

444
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,190
hang it on the gate

445
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,830
for everyone in the oil field

446
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,190
to see how noble we are!

447
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,670
You've been talking so much.

448
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,430
Aren't you thirsty?

449
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,390
Here, have some water.

450
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,750
I've been working all day,

451
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,430
watching my boss's every mood.

452
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,190
I don't see you guys treating me any better!

453
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,870
What?

454
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,990
Isn't the whole family

455
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,750
trying to please you?

456
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,510
Right?

457
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,300
How about this,

458
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,140
I'll take the lead.

459
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,970
I'll take the lead.

460
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,990
Let's go for a walk together.

461
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,110
A walk?

462
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,790
You're just trying to

463
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,870
lecture me again, aren't you?

464
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,830
Absolutely not.

465
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,310
I just want to

466
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,830
share my thoughts

467
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,590
with you.

468
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,110
Okay?

469
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,790
No.

470
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,820
Come on.

471
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,350
A short walk after dinner

472
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,470
is good for your health.

473
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,870
It's not like I'm being unreasonable,

474
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,390
acting as if

475
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,430
I don't support

476
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,190
the kids

477
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,630
doing good deeds.

478
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,950
That's not what I meant.

479
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,870
But this situation is different.

480
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,230
You know how people in the oil field

481
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,760
already don't like locals.

482
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,350
And after what happened with Yuan Yong,

483
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,830
it's all anyone's talking about.

484
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,150
If they

485
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:55,910
wanted to help someone else,

486
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,110
I wouldn't hesitate.

487
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,790
Do you remember

488
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,230
when Yaya

489
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,470
was five or six?

490
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,870
He drew

491
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,670
a picture

492
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,550
of a pink lake.

493
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,170
A pink lake?

494
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,390
Yaya,

495
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,110
look!

496
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,360
There actually is a pink lake.

497
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,880
It's the Retba Lake

498
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,380
in Senegal, Africa.

499
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,930
There's really a pink lake!

500
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,190
Keep looking,

501
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,390
see if there are more.

502
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,230
The Retba Lake

503
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,660
in Senegal,

504
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,150
the Hillier Lake in Australia,

505
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,910
and the Rose Lake

506
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,390
in British Columbia, Canada.

507
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,470
All of these lakes have pink water.

508
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,110
It's caused by a type of salt-loving algae

509
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,670
called Dunaliella salina.

510
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,790
These algae

511
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,110
can turn the water red or pink

512
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,550
because of

513
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,910
their unique pigments.

514
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,670
Back then,

515
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,390
if I had told Yaya

516
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,710
that all lakes

517
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,710
in the world

518
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,510
should be blue,

519
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,910
and there can't be a pink one,

520
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,390
what would have happened?

521
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,510
That would have stifled

522
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,790
the child's imagination

523
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,470
and curiosity,

524
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,030
right?

525
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,270
You see,

526
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,510
I took him to the library,

527
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,950
and we actually found information

528
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,350
about a pink lake.

529
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,260
So, he started to develop an interest

530
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,310
in reading and books,

531
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,990
and now he's doing

532
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,950
so well in school.

533
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,810
That makes you happy, doesn't it?

534
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,920
But on the flip side,

535
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,030
let's talk about what happened today.

536
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,630
The kids

537
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,830
are helping others,

538
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,390
and if we bluntly

539
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,320
tell them

540
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,680
not to help

541
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,770
because "those people

542
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,990
are disliked by everyone,"

543
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,230
to avoid

544
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,630
future trouble,

545
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,850
what would happen?

546
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,630
We'd end up stifling

547
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,390
the kindness

548
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,470
and sense of justice in their hearts,

549
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:00,920
wouldn't we?

550
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,070
What do you mean, "Wouldn't we?"

551
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,080
If you've got something to say, just say it all at once!

552
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,710
Why do you keep asking me questions?

553
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,950
I'm not just asking questions.

554
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,470
I'm solving them!

555
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,110
What I'm trying to say is,

556
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,470
as parents,

557
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,190
we should be

558
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,110
the kids' support.

559
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,270
We need to give them

560
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,190
the confidence

561
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,520
to bravely help others.

562
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,550
Sure, doing good deeds now

563
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,740
might lead to hardships

564
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,320
or even bullying later.

565
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,070
But as their parents,

566
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,070
what should we do?

567
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,610
We should step up and protect them.

568
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:37,950
We should

569
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,470
shield them

570
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,330
from any unfairness or bullying,

571
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,930
so that they can

572
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,760
keep that sense of justice

573
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,170
and kindness in their hearts.

574
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,980
What do you think?

575
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,310
Cheng Pengfei,

576
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,040
do you know how much I regret it?

577
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,550
I regret not studying hard

578
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,750
when I was young,

579
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,310
so I can't speak

580
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,510
as eloquently as you.

581
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,520
I studied hard when I was young,

582
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,430
but it doesn't stop you

583
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,750
from being the one leading me around all day long,

584
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,350
does it?

585
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,250
I've just

586
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,720
picked up

587
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,710
a few tricks

588
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,500
under

589
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,750
your great wisdom.

590
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,480
Nothing to boast about.

591
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:18,710
Why does that sound

592
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,110
so sarcastic?

593
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,470
Not sarcastic at all!

594
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,520
It's perfectly sincere.

595
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:25,720
Mosquitoes.

596
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,230
English, crazy.

597
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,670
Morning.

598
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,070
Miaomiao,

599
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,910
check out my look today.

600
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,870
Does it taste good?

601
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,330
Jun styled it personally,

602
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,750
cost me ten bucks.

603
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,630
Not great, you look like a Pekingese.

604
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,900
Pekingese has longer fur.

605
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,980
He looks more like a Teddy.

606
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,390
Come on.

607
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,720
Wa,

608
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,120
try this.

609
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,600
Taste it.

610
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,800
Hu.

611
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,720
What's going on?

612
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,740
No idea.

613
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:09,450
It feels like their relationship has suddenly gotten closer.

614
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,030
How did everything

615
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,090
change overnight?

616
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,270
Even the team dynamic is shifting.

617
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,870
They're definitely hiding something from me.

618
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,360
There's no meat.

619
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,450
The AO and BO connect

620
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,230
at point O,

621
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,470
and rope BO is horizontal.

622
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,910
If we ignore the weight of the rope,

623
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,910
the car moves forward

624
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,310
at a constant speed.

625
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,960
Eyes on the book.

626
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,810
The car moves forward at a constant velocity.

627
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,130
Did you two just smile at each other?

628
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,270
Yes.

629
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,710
Since when are you two close enough

630
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,510
to smile and greet each other?

631
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,000
Always.

632
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,190
Always?

633
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,440
How come I never knew?

634
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,750
What are you looking at?

635
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,950
These are my buns.

636
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,590
Qiang Xiaowa,

637
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,020
I think it's necessary for me

638
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,310
to explain my relationship

639
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,670
with Cheng Miaomiao.

640
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,350
You've already eaten my buns,

641
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,350
so can't you at least hear me out

642
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,470
before leaving?

643
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,390
Here's the deal: Miaomiao and I

644
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,510
were born

645
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,350
in the same staff hospital,

646
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,510
in the same room,

647
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,030
Room 02.

648
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,870
You could say

649
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,630
we grew up together

650
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,110
from birth,

651
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,270
living in neighboring houses,

652
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,070
went to the same kindergarten,

653
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,070
elementary school,

654
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,800
and now the same middle school.

655
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,390
We've spent every

656
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,900
major holiday together,

657
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:10,990
and

658
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,270
not a single small event

659
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,400
has been missed.

660
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,710
Let me put it this way.

661
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,990
For the past 17 years,

662
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,710
we haven't been apart.

663
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,110
So, to Miaomiao,

664
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,230
I'm as important as her father.

665
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,150
Whose father?

666
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,480
You...

667
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,280
My hair's all messed up.

668
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,950
It's just a metaphor.

669
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:29,870
I'm emphasizing

670
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,350
how important

671
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,480
our relationship is.

672
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,210
Do I need you to emphasize that?

673
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:40,910
Let's ignore her.

674
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,640
Back to business.

675
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:46,630
What's wrong with brothers

676
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,960
sharing a secret or two?

677
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,650
Get closer.

678
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:51,550
This girl

679
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,700
This girl is going to marry me in the future.

680
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,150
That was decided

681
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,270
when we were three.

682
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,350
Our relationship

683
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,070
just got better,

684
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,670
so I suggest you

685
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,910
don't create any conflicts,

686
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,640
or I might have to get physical.

687
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,590
Good boy.

688
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,150
Qiang Xiaowa!

689
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,390
Qiang Xiaowa!

690
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,270
Qiang Xiaowa!

691
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,110
Why are you here again?

692
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,200
Is Babao here?

693
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,510
What exactly do you want?

694
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,270
You'll know soon.

695
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,800
Everything I've got here is useful to you.

696
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,150
I'm exhausted!

697
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,590
I saw you doing homework at the market,

698
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,790
but you didn't have a desk.

699
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,110
So I brought over

700
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,150
this old one from home.

701
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:31,880
Look.

702
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,390
Come here, come try it out.

703
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,600
Sit down.

704
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,590
See if the height works for you.

705
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,840
Look, it's a foldable one—

706
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,070
cool, right?

707
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,880
Super easy to carry around.

708
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,310
Isn't it nice?

709
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,310
Where are you going?

710
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,040
Sit back down, I'm not done yet.

711
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,070
These...

712
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,990
These are all my brother's.

713
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,180
Check the size.

714
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:00,750
Let me see.

715
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,350
Looks like a perfect fit.

716
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,350
My mom made sure they were all clean,

717
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,580
so don't worry.

718
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,430
And this.

719
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,230
These are

720
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,430
practice test papers and exercises.

721
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,470
Oh, look at this.

722
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,430
Do you know what this is?

723
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,630
Huanggang test papers!

724
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,550
My dad had someone bring them over

725
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,630
all the way from Wuhan.

726
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,720
These are top-notch.

727
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,310
Use them when you study.

728
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,060
Let me tell you.

729
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,710
I'm not trying to scare you.

730
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,710
But our school exams are super tough.

731
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,670
When the results are out,

732
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,190
they post them up on the big yellow board.

733
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,270
So study hard!

734
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,000
You got this!

735
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,220
Whew, I'm wiped.

736
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,360
Cheng Miaomiao.

737
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,850
I can't

738
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,070
stay for dinner tonight.

739
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:43,870
I've gotta go.

740
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,920
What do you mean?

741
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,400
I got home late last time,

742
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,260
and my mom gave me a good scolding.

743
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,890
Maybe next time.

744
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,430
I mean

745
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,270
I'm talking about all this stuff you brought.

746
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,930
What's that supposed to mean?

747
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,230
I...

748
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,420
I didn't mean anything by it.

749
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,630
I just brought you what you need.

750
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,230
You think I'm too poor

751
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,030
to afford these things, don't you?

752
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,470
Of course not.

753
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,000
I...

754
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,230
I just wanted to help you out.

755
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,550
Did I ask for your help?

756
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,190
Did I ever say I needed it?

757
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,400
Did I beg you?

758
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,690
How could you say that?

759
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,110
What do you want me to say?

760
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,620
Should I thank you

761
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,350
for coming down from your oil-field life

762
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,750
to bless me with supplies

763
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,180
like some charity case?

764
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,790
Qiang Xiaowa.

765
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,630
That's not what I meant.

766
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,910
Why are you being so harsh?

767
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,510
Because I'm sick of

768
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,790
you oil-field people!

769
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,470
You think you're special just because you've got money

770
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,510
and you're from the fancy side of town.

771
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,950
You walk around in your stupid uniforms,

772
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,870
showing off.

773
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:51,870
Well, I'm not wearing that uniform,

774
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,710
and I'm not cutting my hair.

775
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,170
What does it matter to you?

776
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,000
You all just got lucky being born on the other side of the river.

777
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,530
If you were born in this poor fishing village,

778
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,210
you wouldn't be anything either.

779
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,180
Listen, Qiang Xiaowa.

780
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,710
Even if I were born here,

781
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,080
I wouldn't be

782
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,280
ungrateful like you.

783
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,930
You can keep or toss these things—

784
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,630
I don't care anymore.

785
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,870
Every time you go on a business trip,

786
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,270
you end up covering the expenses yourself.

787
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,170
How are we supposed to live like this?

788
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,610
Don't worry, they'll reimburse it.

789
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,610
The company won't leave me hanging.

790
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,150
But last month's receipts

791
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,480
didn't get reimbursed,

792
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,110
did they?

793
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,850
I'm telling you, maybe you should stop going on these trips.

794
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,270
Gas receipts?

795
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,470
You don't even have a car.

796
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,070
Why do you have gas receipts?

797
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,550
93 gas receipts.

798
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,710
It must be Wang's.

799
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,830
It must be his.

800
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,790
He almost mixed up his receipts

801
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,310
with mine last month.

802
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,390
Then I'll take that one out.

803
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,120
I'll return it to him tomorrow.

804
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,390
Yang.

805
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,590
Are these receipts

806
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,310
for your work expenses

807
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,770
or are you just fooling me?

808
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,360
What do you mean?

809
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:03,550
Restaurant bill.

810
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,870
What's wrong?

811
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,260
Which day?

812
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,110
August 28.

813
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,440
Where were you that day?

814
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,760
How would I remember where I was?

815
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,800
You are at home.

816
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,840
Then it must be Wang's again.

817
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,710
Alright, give me all the receipts.

818
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,270
I'll take them back

819
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,430
and get them sorted.

820
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,110
Sit tight.

821
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,330
What about this one?

822
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,440
The hotel receipt.

823
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,310
That's not Wang's, is it?

824
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,250
No, that one's mine.

825
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,310
And where were you that day?

826
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,230
You were in the sea that day.

827
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,130
You weren't in the sea.

828
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,950
You were at the hotel.

829
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,360
Who were you with?

830
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,510
No, no, no,

831
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,870
I really was offshore!

832
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,570
Then explain the receipt.

833
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,190
That receipt really belongs to Wang.

834
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,240
Let me finish.

835
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,490
I borrowed it from him.

836
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,700
Fine.

837
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,699
You borrowed his receipts.

838
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,440
What about the money?

839
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,679
Where did it go?

840
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,770
Speak up!

841
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,480
I lent it out.

842
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:16,889
To who?

843
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,389
You racked your brains to fool me for this.

844
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,520
The answer is clear.

845
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,010
It was Feng Jing, right?

846
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,710
Her family's in trouble,

847
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,870
and they needed money fast.

848
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,270
How much did you lend her?

849
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,050
Three thousand.

850
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,750
I couldn't just stand by and do nothing.

851
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,330
And why can't you help me then?

852
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,230
Do you have any idea

853
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,889
what my life is like every day,

854
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:50,949
Yang?

855
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:54,510
I scrimp and save on everything.

856
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,310
I take care of your whole family—

857
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:58,930
your mom, your brother,

858
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,450
your sister, and your son.

859
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:03,550
And now, your ex-wife is back in the picture.

860
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,510
You help everyone else,

861
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,310
but why do you

862
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,270
only treat me like this?

863
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,020
Don't, don't get upset.

864
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,270
If you and your ex-wife

865
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,230
want to rekindle old feelings,

866
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:12,870
just tell me.

867
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,990
-I’ll make room for you.
-What?

868
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,630
What are you even saying?

869
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,690
You're back.

870
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,010
Let's eat.

871
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,440
I'll cook.

872
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,220
What are you doing?

873
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,790
Is this ever going to end?

874
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,930
If there's anything else you've been hiding from me,

875
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,290
just come clean now.

876
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,050
I swear, there's nothing else.

877
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,870
I just didn't want to make you angry,

878
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,870
-so I…
-You don’t want me to be angry?

879
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,830
If you hadn't done anything wrong,

880
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:30,050
why would you even worry about my feelings?

881
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,780
Didn't want to make me upset...

882
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,520
Yang, let's do this.

883
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,940
Your mom has never liked me anyway.

884
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,640
She's always saying

885
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,920
how great Feng Jing is.

886
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,920
Why don't you two just get remarried

887
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,030
and leave me out of it?

888
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:43,790
I'm begging you.

889
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,390
I'm begging you.

890
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,830
Can you stop making this bigger than it is?

891
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,210
Why aren't you asleep?

892
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,350
I'm just going to the bathroom.

893
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,550
I heard

894
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,110
something fall in there.

895
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,410
Oh,

896
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,310
the basin accidentally fell over.

897
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,040
Yeah, it was me. I stepped on it.

898
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,390
Hurry up and use the bathroom,

899
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,090
then get back to bed.

900
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,440
-It’s too late.
-Okay.

901
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,390
I think my mom and Yang

902
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,050
had another fight yesterday.

903
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,010
Again?

904
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,230
Did you say

905
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,710
they were getting along lately?

906
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,380
No.

907
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,390
You went through all that trouble

908
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,060
jumping in the river for nothing?

909
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,430
Did they break anything this time?

910
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,690
Was there any hitting?

911
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:38,510
Nope.

912
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,090
I was just guessing.

913
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,830
What do you mean?

914
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,230
You didn't see anything?

915
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,430
When I got home yesterday,

916
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,550
they were acting all weird, just sitting in the living room.

917
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,080
They said they were waiting

918
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,160
to welcome me home.

919
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,280
And then at night,

920
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,670
I heard a noise,

921
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,950
like something fell over.

922
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,150
I rushed out to check.

923
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,090
What did you see?

924
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,610
They were both washing their feet.

925
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,000
It looked great.

926
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,350
They said they accidentally

927
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,950
knocked over the washbasin.

928
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,140
Well, that sounds good, doesn't it?

929
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,470
There's another possibility—

930
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,030
they're just not arguing

931
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,290
in front of you anymore.

932
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,410
I think so too.

933
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,750
They're probably

934
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,750
still worried about you

935
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,080
jumping into the river.

936
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,540
So in a way, it worked.

937
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,160
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

938
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,910
Definitely a good thing.

939
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:21,710
Think about it—

940
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,920
they're not arguing like they used to,

941
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,030
which means they're still

942
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,870
considering your feelings.

943
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,350
And if they're not fighting in front of you,

944
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,910
that's less fighting overall,

945
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,110
right?

946
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,270
Last time,

947
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,910
I yelled at Yang Songbai.

948
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,260
I thought for sure

949
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,030
our relationship was over.

950
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,480
But now that he's back,

951
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,420
he's acting like nothing happened

952
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,950
and is even being nice to me.

953
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,150
That means

954
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,990
your scolding really hit home.

955
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,710
I think you should just pretend

956
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,790
like you don't know anything,

957
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,030
and when they don't fight in front of you,

958
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,990
act really happy

959
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,230
about it.

960
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,870
It's like positive reinforcement, you know?

961
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:53,870
My dad always says

962
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,870
that even adults need encouragement from their kids.

963
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,190
Who's this?

964
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,440
It's Qiang Xiaowa.

965
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,200
What's going on?

966
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,820
What's going on?

967
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,160
-Class begins.
-Stand up.

968
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:31,840
Good morning, teacher.

969
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,430
Sit down.

970
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,340
Miaomiao,

971
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,370
between you and Qiang Xiaowa?

972
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,010
What could there possibly be between us?

973
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,610
Don't think I didn't notice.

974
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,910
You two were talking yesterday.

975
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:56,790
Today he's acting like this.

976
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:57,790
Not only are you not happy,

977
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:58,970
you're not even talking.

978
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,290
Something's definitely up.

979
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,420
Nothing's going on.

980
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,590
I just realized that

981
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,190
not everyone can be friends.

982
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,490
What's going on?

983
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,030
You put on the uniform,

984
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,170
cut your hair,

985
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,040
and cleaned up nicely.

986
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,970
It's none of your business.

987
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,740
Did Miaomiao ask you to cut your hair?

988
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,820
You really listen to her, huh?

989
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,830
Why should I listen to her?

990
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,430
You...

991
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,380
Where are you going now?

992
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,590
Breaking news.

993
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,030
I just saw

994
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,510
the police at our school!

995
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,080
The police?

996
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:44,790
Of course.

997
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,920
Who else would it be, security guards?

998
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,720
Why are the police at our school?

999
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,150
No idea.

1000
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,210
Maybe something happened at school.

1001
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,430
There are bad people at school.

1002
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,580
The police should've come a long time ago.

1003
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,090
Tao.

1004
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,020
Where did the police go?

1005
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,150
I think

1006
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,540
they went toward the office.

1007
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,590
I wasn't about to stare at them too long.

1008
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,750
Why not?

1009
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,230
It's not like you did anything wrong.

1010
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,290
-Well, I...
-Sit down, Zhong Ruitao.

1011
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,310
Yuan Shanqing.

1012
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,130
Come with me to the office.

1013
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,200
Are the police here for her?

1014
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,030
Sir.

1015
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,770
Teacher, are the police here to arrest the bad guy?

1016
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:31,840
Who told you that?

1017
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,670
Nobody's getting arrested.

1018
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,700
Now focus on class.

1019
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,360
I'm looking for Yuan Shanqing

1020
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,490
for something else.

1021
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,470
Let's go.

1022
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,290
Miaomiao.

1023
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,430
Big news.

1024
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:11,430
Yuan Yong's daughter was taken away by the police.

1025
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,270
Taken away?

1026
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,050
My dad always told me,

1027
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,110
never lose the courage

1028
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,630
to be a good person.

1029
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,110
But my well-meaning kindness

1030
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,950
hit a wall with Qiang Xiaowa.

1031
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,390
At that time,

1032
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,070
I always felt like

1033
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:42,230
there was a huge wall between me and them.

1034
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,030
Qiang Xiaowa and Yuan Shanqing—

1035
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,630
they always kept people

1036
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,030
at a distance,

1037
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,860
as if they were hiding secrets.

1038
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,230
In every school,

1039
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,040
there are always students like them.

1040
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,350
People label them

1041
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,750
with the same tag:

1042
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,140
they must

1043
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,730
be up to no good.

1044
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,030
But no one ever cares about

1045
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,620
who they really are

1046
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,950
or the burdens they carry.
