00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,060
[Wind Direction]

2
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,110
Okay, kids, have you finished your drawings?

3
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:40,100
[Autumn of 1987]

4
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,910
It's done.

5
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,430
Now, let's take a look at

6
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,350
what all of you like.

7
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,710
I like apples.

8
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,390
I like tomatoes.

9
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,310
Tomatoes aren't fruits,

10
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,479
but watermelons are.

11
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,030
I like watermelons.

12
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,590
I like Cheng Miaomiao.

13
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,030
Cheng Miaomiao isn't fruit either!

14
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,670
Teacher, Li Si is lying.

15
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,430
He clearly likes cucumbers.

16
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,910
But cucumbers aren't fruits either.

17
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,669
[Like you]

18
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,670
They asked me to explain to the union?

19
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,240
Yes.

20
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,390
Officer,

21
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,100
those deceived parents

22
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,730
now all believe that

23
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,870
Yuan Shanqing and her father are in cahoots.

24
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,910
There's also a rumor going around the factory that

25
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,230
the money Yuan Yong swindled

26
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,090
is all hidden with Yuan Shanqing.

27
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,030
It made things even harder to explain

28
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,620
when you went to the school and took her away

29
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,090
earlier.

30
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,630
What's so hard to explain?

31
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,829
We were just investigating the situation.

32
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,630
If Yuan Shanqing is suspicious,

33
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,000
we will definitely deal with her.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,280
I... I believe it.

35
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,280
But it's just that many people,

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,190
including my classmates,

37
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,190
don't believe it.

38
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,710
Those parents who were scammed

39
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,320
even came to the school to cause trouble a while ago,

40
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,870
demanding that

41
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,710
the school expel

42
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,620
Yuan Shanqing.

43
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,829
We went door-to-door

44
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,140
apologizing and explaining,

45
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,070
but no one believed us,

46
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,030
or listened.

47
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,030
Officer,

48
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,800
she's really helpless.

49
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,710
She's pursuing her studies on her own

50
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,110
while also taking care of her younger sister,

51
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,350
and her grades

52
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,080
have been declining recently.

53
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,150
Cheng.

54
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,380
Cheng!

55
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:11,830
Cheng,

56
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,960
I just saw the police

57
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,360
come to our school again.

58
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,230
Don't worry.

59
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,410
Maybe he's here to help you.

60
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,030
Everyone, please be quiet

61
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,400
and sit down.

62
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,270
Wang Fuqiang, quickly sit down.

63
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,790
Everyone, before we start class,

64
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,850
we need to have a brief class meeting.

65
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:37,490
This is Mr. Jiang

66
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,920
from the Heping Town.

67
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,350
Hello, everyone.

68
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,190
I'm Jiang Feng,

69
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,630
a police officer from the Wancheng Road Police Station

70
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,710
in the Linqi Oilfield Public Security Bureau.

71
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,270
I'll take a bit of your time

72
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,030
to make a statement.

73
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,270
Yuan Yong, the father of Yuan Shanqing,

74
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,990
a student in Class 1, Grade 1,

75
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,790
is a fugitive involved in a case.

76
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,510
and is currently a key suspect

77
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,770
under investigation.

78
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,910
A few days ago,

79
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,970
we received some tips

80
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,250
from the public,

81
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,590
so we came to the school

82
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,630
to gather information

83
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,790
from Yuan Shanqing.

84
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,090
She has been very cooperative

85
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,490
with our investigation.

86
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,710
This is a routine inquiry

87
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,140
to assist the police,

88
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,750
which may have caused some misunderstandings

89
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,990
at the school

90
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,269
and even had

91
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,230
a negative impact on

92
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,990
Yuan Shanqing's life.

93
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,550
I apologize to all of you.

94
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,270
We can confirm that

95
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,510
Yuan Shanqing is currently

96
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,750
not directly involved in this case.

97
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,350
We hope that you can

98
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,990
help each other,

99
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,710
remain united, and show mutual kindness.

100
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,550
That's all

101
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,190
for my statement.

102
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,020
Officer,

103
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,770
when will Yuan Yong be caught?

104
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,230
We are working hard on the investigation.

105
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,360
He will certainly not escape justice.

106
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,430
Does it really work?

107
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,710
Of course.

108
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,670
My brother

109
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,200
sent it back from Shenzhen.

110
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,070
It's really expensive.

111
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,120
My mom's waist pain got better

112
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,160
after using it.

113
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,310
Stop

114
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,910
praising big cities so much.

115
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,440
Have you ever been there?

116
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,830
I'll go after graduation.

117
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,030
You just focus on extracting oil.

118
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:13,980
Hu,

119
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,570
you really owe a lot

120
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,770
to the hard work of oil workers.

121
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,280
You're even aware of this?

122
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,680
That's unexpected.

123
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,830
Shouldn't the children of the oil workers

124
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,980
have this awareness?

125
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,580
Miaomiao,

126
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,600
if you can't get into college,

127
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,430
we'll just stay at the oil field.

128
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,590
I'll have my dad arrange a position for you

129
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,150
in the publicity department.

130
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,909
Wait, why wouldn't I be able to get into college?

131
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:34,950
I've had

132
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,750
big dreams

133
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,110
since I was six.

134
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:37,790
Stop

135
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,990
saying such discouraging things.

136
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,310
Wait, how many of your 800 dreams

137
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,710
have actually come true?

138
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,820
I'm only a sophomore. I don't need to be in a hurry.

139
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,500
Cheng, it's too late.

140
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,430
Given our situation,

141
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,030
I've already planned it out.

142
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,150
Once we graduate,

143
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,120
we'll work in the factory office.

144
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,630
I'll be the director, and you'll handle the publicity.

145
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,190
We'll get married when we're of age,

146
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,530
and before my dad retires,

147
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,330
we'll have him get us a big house.

148
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,950
Is your dad the factory manager?

149
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,230
You think you've got everything planned out?

150
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,040
Even the factory manager wouldn't dare to

151
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,540
make plans like yours.

152
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,750
I'll just wait to see

153
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,510
which mountaintop you end up on.

154
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,470
Miaomiao, don't listen to him.

155
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,270
He's someone who's destined to only work in oil fields

156
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,870
if he can't get into college.

157
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,600
You can come to Shenzhen with me

158
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,510
to find my brother,

159
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,830
and we can start a new chapter

160
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,110
in our lives together.

161
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,550
Is your brother the mayor?

162
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,470
Are you planning to sleep on the streets of Shenzhen?

163
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,350
Don't drag me if you're a loser.

164
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,470
You should figure out the exam paper

165
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,670
in front of you first.

166
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,190
Here.

167
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,990
I'll give you a chance

168
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,350
to apply the ointment to me

169
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,950
before I'm disabled.

170
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,590
You don't apologize, do you?

171
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,100
I'm sorry.

172
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,750
I was

173
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,500
out of line

174
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,510
last time.

175
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,930
What's wrong with you?

176
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,150
Nothing.

177
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,630
You wouldn't be showing a long face over nothing.

178
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,820
I know you well.

179
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,590
What's the point in knowing?

180
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,720
You still hide everything from me.

181
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,950
I didn't.

182
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,630
What were you and Qiang Xiaowa

183
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,680
sneaking around doing?

184
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,930
Why did he suddenly apologize to you?

185
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,190
Sneaking around?

186
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,670
I just went to his house

187
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,430
to drop off

188
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,190
my brother's school uniform

189
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,190
and our papers.

190
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,240
But he was sarcastic

191
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,190
and criticized me,

192
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,920
and I was left feeling puzzled.

193
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,030
He might feel like you're just giving him charity

194
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,760
and treating him like a beggar.

195
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,110
Who treated him like a beggar?

196
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,590
I was just trying to be kind.

197
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,590
Kindness has to be directed at the right people.

198
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,190
He is obviously someone

199
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,110
who wasn't cared for as a child

200
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,790
and now doesn't care for

201
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,790
others.

202
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,830
Does he have a heart?

203
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,630
Even if he does, it's a fragile one;

204
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,030
it's delicate and sharp.

205
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,030
Aren't you here to comfort me?

206
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,789
Qiang Xiaowa,

207
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,270
we need to talk.

208
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,430
To be honest,

209
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,030
I wanted to break up with you.

210
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,550
I never thought about that.

211
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,430
Considering the way

212
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,190
you talk to me,

213
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,650
how could you say you never thought about it?

214
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,390
I just

215
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
have a bad temper.

216
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,390
Then I'm just not smart.

217
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,430
I really didn't intend to make you feel hurt.

218
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,310
Li Si told me that

219
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,310
you have a fragile heart,

220
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,840
and that's when I realized.

221
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,230
What else did he say?

222
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,150
He said

223
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,190
I treated you like a beggar.

224
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,270
But it's not really about you.

225
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,930
He mainly meant that I treated you like a beggar.

226
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,470
He's right.

227
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,830
I do feel like

228
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,430
you treated me like a beggar.

229
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,270
No, I really didn't think that way.

230
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,990
I really meant well.

231
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,860
My family is indeed poor.

232
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,020
I can't afford school uniforms,

233
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,360
but I don't want you to

234
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,100
look down on me.

235
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,840
This is mutual help.

236
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,080
Since we were young, Li Si

237
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,820
would buy me treats,

238
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,150
and I'd get him tapes.

239
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,270
We always shared good things

240
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,590
with each other.

241
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,680
That's because you all have plenty,

242
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,160
so it doesn't matter.

243
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,750
I

244
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,170
have nothing to give you.

245
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,590
But the seafood

246
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,510
I took from your home

247
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,790
isn't worth anything?

248
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,510
I have extra school uniforms to give you,

249
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,310
and you have delicious seafood to give me.

250
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,790
Isn't that mutual?

251
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,070
Those things of mine aren't worth much.

252
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:43,950
Qiang Xiaowa,

253
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,190
the stationery, uniform, and the old desk

254
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,150
I gave you

255
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,110
aren't worth much.

256
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,630
It's just the thought that counts,

257
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,540
so don't be picky.

258
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,360
If you want

259
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,790
something more valuable from me,

260
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,470
I can't provide that either.

261
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,910
Don't expect me

262
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,910
to move my TV to yours.

263
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,420
Look,

264
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,490
it's good that we've talked it out.

265
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,950
You need to control

266
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,390
your bad temper.

267
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,630
How can a man

268
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,150
to be so sensitive?

269
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,710
Qiang Xiaowa,

270
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,190
so do we

271
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,630
make up now?

272
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,810
We're still good friends?

273
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,710
It's getting colder.

274
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,030
You and Zi should wear more.

275
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,090
Don't catch a cold.

276
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,030
I know it was you who asked the police for help.

277
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,410
That's not important.

278
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,780
What matters is that

279
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,070
I just wanted to prove that

280
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,430
I can help you.

281
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,590
You've helped me

282
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,660
many times.

283
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,320
What else do you need to prove?

284
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,610
I want to prove that

285
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,840
we're both kind.

286
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,210
Cheng Pengfei!

287
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,490
Cheng Pengfei!

288
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,470
Hurry. Come here.

289
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,990
-What's wrong?
-Hurry up.

290
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,790
What's wrong?

291
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:39,910
What's going on?

292
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,150
Look at Yaya.

293
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,220
What is Yaya doing?

294
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,310
Look at what he's doing.

295
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,190
What do you mean?

296
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:44,790
Look.

297
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,990
He's chatting and laughing

298
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,030
with that girl.

299
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,630
They're just chatting

300
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,510
after school.

301
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,920
What chatting?

302
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,450
I'll ask him.

303
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,030
Wait, what are you going to ask?

304
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,470
I'll ask him.

305
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,780
Why are you bothering them while they're chatting?

306
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,590
Come back.

307
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,830
Go inside!

308
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,070
What... What

309
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,510
do you want to ask?

310
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,480
Cheng Pengfei,

311
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,230
I deeply suspect that

312
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,470
your son is dating early.

313
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,070
At his age,

314
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:09,830
it's easy for these kinds of problems

315
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,710
to occur.

316
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,630
Wait, how can you

317
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,560
determine that he's dating early?

318
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,070
Yuan Shanqing lives

319
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:15,830
near the small white building.

320
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,830
She should go west

321
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,120
after school, right?

322
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,190
Why did she go east,

323
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,310
passing by

324
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,960
our courtyard? Why?

325
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,940
-It's just...
-Has your hat

326
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,770
changed?

327
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,710
Listen to me.

328
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,640
This size is a bit small,

329
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,470
not quite right for you.

330
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,990
What? What hat?

331
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,910
What do you mean “small"?

332
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,670
Let me tell you, you look like my grandma

333
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,790
with that on,

334
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,390
you know?

335
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,000
What do you mean by "like your grandma"?

336
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,030
Let me tell you,

337
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,320
this is the early sign of puppy love.

338
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,590
She just wants to spend more time

339
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,870
with Yaya, you know?

340
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,840
I didn't see

341
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,120
any sign of puppy love.

342
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,380
What I saw is that

343
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,790
your son has been worrying about that little girl

344
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,660
these days.

345
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,990
Finally,

346
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,740
his kind-hearted sincerity

347
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,130
paid off.

348
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,600
He's better than your brother.

349
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,750
Your brother is always

350
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,650
offering warmth to those who respond coldly.

351
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,810
Cheng Pengfei,

352
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,500
I find that your mind

353
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,220
is really all muddled.

354
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,430
How can you read so many books

355
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,190
and still not

356
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,050
grasp the essence of the issue?

357
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,630
I've known the essence.

358
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,490
Then what's the essence? Tell me.

359
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,350
The essence is

360
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,550
my son

361
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,030
is physically and mentally healthy,

362
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,400
with no problems at all.

363
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,710
I've been down this road before.

364
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,870
Of course I know.

365
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,790
Wait, you should know better

366
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,630
if you've been down this road before.

367
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,830
At this age,

368
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,350
if you tell him

369
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,980
not to fall in love early,

370
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,170
not to interact with the opposite sex,

371
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,270
and not to hang out with them all the time,

372
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,030
do you think he will listen to you?

373
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,230
It would be strange if he listens to you.

374
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:38,710
Besides,

375
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,240
they're just experiencing

376
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,910
the youthful enthusiasm typical of their age,

377
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,540
right?

378
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,470
But by prohibiting

379
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,550
and meddling,

380
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,800
you've only made the situation worse.

381
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,440
So what do you suggest we do?

382
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,510
What should we do?

383
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,750
Stay calm, got it?

384
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,090
How can you even blame your son?

385
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,350
Think about what you were doing

386
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,280
when you were 17.

387
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,310
You eloped with someone else,

388
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,190
causing such a commotion

389
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,070
that it was almost like the sky was falling

390
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,650
and the world was ending.

391
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,190
It's only because I was exceptionally kind

392
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,070
and married you;

393
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:13,750
Otherwise,

394
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,590
you'd still be lost

395
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,400
and clueless.

396
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,960
What are you talking about?

397
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,910
This is the harsh reality

398
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,070
of not being able to date early.

399
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,800
I was young and naive back then.

400
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,720
Dinner is ready.

401
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,420
Why is no one getting the rice?

402
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,080
Are you all turned off by the vegetarian dishes?

403
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,670
Put down your chopsticks first.

404
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,430
Well,

405
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:40,710
before dinner,

406
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,510
I'd like to have a brief meeting.

407
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,220
Mom, how can you have so many meetings

408
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,430
when you're just in charge of the nursery?

409
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,030
Cut it out.

410
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,100
Who's in charge of the nursery?

411
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,390
That's part of

412
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,470
the logistics support department.

413
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,510
We handle things like

414
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,350
the bathhouse and the dining hall.

415
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,110
It's clear that Mom

416
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,150
is in a high position.

417
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,710
But we're just four people here.

418
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,080
There's no need for daily meetings.

419
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,750
Right, Dad?

420
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:04,910
Well,

421
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,120
addressing ideological work

422
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,180
is also necessary.

423
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,170
Whose work are we addressing?

424
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,460
Today, we need to focus on Cheng Yaya.

425
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,270
Then it's necessary and we need to be strict about it.

426
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,270
I think this meeting

427
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,380
is very necessary.

428
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,270
Wait. Why are you focusing on me?

429
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:29,900
Don't you see?

430
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,350
He still hasn't recognized

431
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,670
his problem.

432
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,750
If this situation continues,

433
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,450
it could become very serious.

434
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,320
You know that?

435
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,350
I...

436
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,790
I want to explain

437
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,750
the seriousness of this issue

438
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,080
from three dimensions.

439
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,330
The first point

440
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,420
is the perspective of learning.

441
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,310
Yu. Yu.

442
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,390
Let's skip

443
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,310
the multiple dimensions

444
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,110
and the numbered lists.

445
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,510
Well, your mom just wants to know

446
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,110
what's going on

447
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,640
with you and Yuan Shanqing.

448
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,880
Yeah, anyway,

449
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,170
you should first aim for a good attitude.

450
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,619
Mom, what do you mean?

451
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,230
Well,

452
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,150
your dad and I

453
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,230
aren't those

454
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,700
rigid parents, right?

455
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,510
We've never had a rule

456
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,270
against children

457
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,270
interacting with the opposite sex.

458
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:18,950
Look at your sister,

459
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,829
She grew up with Li Si;

460
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:20,550
they've known each other since they were in diapers.

461
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,550
When did we

462
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,510
wear diapers?

463
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,270
Oh, yes, you did.

464
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,710
I just meant you were very close.

465
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,510
It’s like that-an arm around the shoulders, okay?

466
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,280
I never interfered, right?

467
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,350
Li Si has always been

468
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,270
saying that

469
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,290
he wants to marry your sister.

470
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,500
I didn't interfere, right?

471
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,350
Everyone has a

472
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,470
childhood sweetheart, right?

473
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,270
We are just good brothers, okay?

474
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,790
Why are you talking so much?

475
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,550
I say something,

476
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,100
and you say something back.

477
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,200
Is this your meeting to run?

478
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,950
If you want to address him,

479
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,620
why do you keep focusing on me?

480
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,290
You're so annoying.

481
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,530
Where did I end up saying?

482
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,680
You said she was so annoying.

483
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:56,970
No.

484
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,400
Anyway,

485
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,170
it's about you and Yuan Shanqing.

486
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:00,850
Anyway,

487
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,790
your dad and I

488
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,270
think their family is in a tough spot,

489
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,070
and we're willing to help however we can.

490
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,750
But you two

491
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,950
have gotten

492
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,270
quite close,

493
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,680
don't you think?

494
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,910
Mom,

495
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,670
we haven't even had our arms around each other's shoulders.

496
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,190
That's the problem.

497
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:20,990
You know?

498
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,070
Your dad and I...

499
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,670
We

500
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,960
have been down this road.

501
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,910
It's fine to hold her shoulder.

502
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,510
But it's the subtle, flirtatious glances

503
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,510
that are truly problematic.

504
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,420
Right?
Mom.

505
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,580
are you suspecting that they're dating early?

506
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,510
I didn't say that.

507
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,720
Just say it directly.

508
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,630
Stop

509
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,110
beating around the bush.

510
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,300
Dad said

511
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,270
if there's an issue, just talk about it openly.

512
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,880
We're family, so there's nothing we can't discuss.

513
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,940
Just ask directly.

514
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,090
Have you been dating early?

515
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:44,850
No.

516
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,030
He hasn't been dating early.

517
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,090
Come on, let's eat.

518
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,270
-Come on.
-I’ve been craving for it.

519
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,590
This is my new product.

520
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,750
I want to

521
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,190
-add some carrots
-It's delicious.

522
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,870
and some pine nuts next time.

523
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,580
Try it.

524
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:00,870
It's delicious.

525
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,990
You three, always playing along together.

526
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,050
What are you doing?

527
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,400
As a mother,

528
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,460
I can't ask or manage the kids, right?

529
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,230
You just brushed it off?

530
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,860
Then I'm in dating?

531
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,130
I'm really not.

532
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,620
Thank you, boss.

533
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,110
Yang Songbai.

534
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,230
What's going on?

535
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,270
I just went to your house.

536
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,030
Min said you came out

537
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,070
to buy her something to eat.

538
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,670
Yes.

539
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,480
Hu Yue didn't cook today,

540
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,210
so I came here...

541
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,670
Stop thinking about this.

542
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,470
She's in the hospital,

543
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,350
preparing for surgery.

544
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,390
Didn't you know?

545
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,570
What's wrong with you?

546
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,510
You're already in the hospital

547
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,710
and didn't say a word?

548
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,150
Why are you here?

549
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,950
If I hadn't met Niu Lingling,

550
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,210
I wouldn't have known.

551
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:20,880
You...

552
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,080
I've just had a stomach ache these days,

553
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,080
but I didn't take it seriously.

554
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,190
It hurted so much,

555
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,190
so Lingling sent me to the hospital.

556
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,810
It's acute appendicitis.

557
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,540
You should have let me know.

558
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,020
You could have called home

559
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,030
or even paged me.

560
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,390
You're lying here and didn't tell anyone.

561
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,710
What's your deal?

562
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,710
It hurts so much.

563
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:54,990
Doctor,

564
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,270
May I ask

565
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,790
what happened to my wife?

566
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,100
Who is your wife?

567
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,810
Hu Yue.

568
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,150
She has acute appendicitis,

569
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,670
and there's already an infection around the abdominal cavity.

570
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,270
She needs to have surgery immediately.

571
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,070
Is it serious?

572
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,100
This surgery is not complicated.

573
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,470
But due to her condition,

574
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,510
she requires general anesthesia,

575
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,030
so

576
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,590
we need a family member's signature.

577
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,880
General anesthesia? General anesthesia?

578
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,430
Yes.

579
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,970
[In operation]

580
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,110
I haven't eaten the noodles yet.

581
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,670
Hurry up and eat.

582
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,730
Why are the noodles all mushy?

583
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,550
Forget it.

584
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,510
Stop eating.

585
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,110
I'll buy you another one.

586
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,630
It's okay. It's edible.

587
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,520
The doctor said the surgery requires general anesthesia.

588
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,510
Gosh.

589
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,900
She's so careless.

590
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:36,760
Let's go.

591
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,070
Let's go.

592
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,860
You go home first.

593
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,760
You have to go to school tomorrow.

594
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,170
I'll keep an eye on her.

595
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,320
Call me if you need anything.

596
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,990
The doctor said it's not serious.

597
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,840
Don't worry. Just go to sleep.

598
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,680
I'll buy you breakfast tomorrow morning.

599
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:27,990
Okay.

600
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,120
I'm leaving.

601
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:30,730
Okay.

602
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,670
Miaomiao, have some egg pancakes.

603
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,760
Have some egg pancakes.

604
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,080
-Hey, you…
-I'm leaving.

605
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,690
See?

606
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,540
Does he still care about us?

607
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,550
This is the result of your calm mind.

608
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,110
At this rate,

609
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,790
your son is going to empty this house out.

610
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,550
I'll make another one.

611
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,750
Where's the egg pancake?

612
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,580
I'm making it right now.

613
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,550
Here you are.

614
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,670
It's completely broken.

615
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,030
There's no sound at all.

616
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,950
How is your mother?

617
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,210
Is she feeling better?

618
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,390
It's nothing serious.

619
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,310
The doctor said she'll be fine after the surgery.

620
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,030
Yang is there keeping watch.

621
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,590
Yang did well this time.

622
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,070
Not bad.

623
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,090
How about you and Qiang Xiaowa?

624
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:39,950
Did you make up?

625
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,180
Of course.

626
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,710
Qiang Xiaowa has apologized to me.

627
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,540
I can't be unreasonable and hold a grudge.

628
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,340
You're right.

629
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,650
I've been so nice to you.

630
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,620
but I've never seen you be that tolerant with me.

631
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,740
Si,

632
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,990
stop letting others

633
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,470
affect our friendship.

634
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,880
We've been brothers for so many years now.

635
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,130
Don't keep calling us brothers.

636
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,910
You're a girl and I'm a boy,

637
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,160
we can't be brothers in this life.

638
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,710
You...

639
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,750
It's fine.

640
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:08,910
You don't need to

641
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,990
emphasize our friendship anymore.

642
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,880
I got it.

643
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:11,750
Look at you.

644
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,950
Wa,

645
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,200
you need to start practicing Mandarin from today on.

646
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,260
Have you finished copying the paper?

647
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,370
Forget what I said.

648
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,050
I have an announcement.

649
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,790
I heard the latest news

650
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,050
in the office just now.

651
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,950
We're going to hold a singing competition.

652
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,750
A singing competition?

653
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,480
Everyone should prepare well.

654
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,330
I don't want to participate in

655
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,890
the singing competition.

656
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,350
Why?

657
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,670
It's a group event.

658
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,790
I have to pick up Zi after school.

659
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,920
I don't have time to practice with you.

660
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,050
Do you want to participate?

661
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,870
Don't worry about it,

662
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,180
let me help you.

663
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,220
Let's go.

664
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,470
Why won‘t you let Qiang Xiaowa

665
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,830
participate in the competition?

666
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,980
You've been in

667
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,470
a singing competition before.

668
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,230
He can't even speak Mandarin.

669
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,270
How can he perform?

670
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,230
He is practicing Mandarin.

671
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,650
By the time he's learned it,

672
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,280
who knows how long it'll take?

673
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,440
Think about it,

674
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,280
as soon as he opens his mouth, everyone will laugh.

675
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,690
He'd be embarrassed.

676
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,990
Zhu is just worried people will make fun of him.

677
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,830
Besides,

678
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,310
group activities require

679
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,490
a sense of teamwork.

680
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,550
The homeroom teacher said

681
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,870
it doesn't matter if we win or not,

682
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,870
but who wouldn't want to win a prize?

683
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,030
Indeed.

684
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,580
This is about the class's honor,

685
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,300
otherwise, who would participate?

686
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,690
That's right.

687
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,270
Cheng Miaomiao.

688
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,550
I find

689
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,410
you always care for Qiang Xiaowa.

690
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,130
Do you like him?

691
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,690
Nonsense.

692
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,750
We are classmates,

693
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,520
What's wrong with me wanting to help him?

694
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,780
And you even want to help others improve?

695
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,830
Ever since Qiang Xiaowa came,

696
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,270
you're very enthusiastic,

697
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,990
as if you're worried he might leave the school.

698
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,910
There's something wrong with you.

699
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,370
You have something wrong.

700
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:58,760
Zhu Chao,

701
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,110
watch your mouth.

702
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,130
We are all classmates.

703
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,830
Both Hu and I have helped him too.

704
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,960
What's the big deal?

705
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,030
It's just a singing competition.

706
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,310
Why are you taking this so seriously?

707
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,770
You're really flattering yourself.

708
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,290
The homeroom teacher said

709
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,400
it's meant to help everyone relax.

710
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,230
If you don't let Qiang Xiaowa participate,

711
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,460
will you win the championship?

712
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,940
What's the big deal?

713
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,870
Will each of you get a hundred yuan?

714
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,650
Exactly.

715
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,390
This is a team competition.

716
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,420
Why are you talking about nonsense?

717
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,210
You lack vision.

718
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,390
Team activities

719
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,910
are about competing for honor.

720
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:31,880
Is it wrong to

721
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,140
think about the class?

722
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,090
Are about competing for honor...

723
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,190
You know competing for honor...

724
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,190
Do you know your Mandarin

725
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,590
is unclear?

726
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,750
Go back and practice.

727
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,430
Is it sweet?

728
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,260
Defend!

729
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,340
Why are you so slow?

730
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,630
Si, hurry up,

731
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,590
or we'll lose soon.

732
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,950
Can't you see I'm busy?

733
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:08,980
It's fine.

734
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,880
I can't let the ball hit you.

735
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,050
If you get hit by the ball,

736
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,110
Miaomiao will definitely beat me up.

737
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,270
Attack! What are you doing with the ball?

738
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,670
What are you waiting for?

739
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,800
Qiang Xiaowa.

740
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,840
Come here.

741
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,510
Help me carry the baby.

742
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,600
Hurry up. I'm calling you.

743
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:29,990
Help me carry the baby.

744
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,790
I'll take off my clothes. Hurry.

745
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,580
Who is her?

746
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,710
Zi.

747
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,530
Hurry. I'll take off my clothes.

748
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,440
Don't drop her.

749
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,910
Be gentle.

750
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,110
She

751
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,550
doesn't listen to you no matter what you say.

752
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,190
You... Be careful.

753
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,270
Don't drop her.

754
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,280
I suspect

755
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,770
there is something wrong with her.

756
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,090
What do you mean?

757
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,830
Something wrong.

758
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,430
I suspect there is

759
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,230
something wrong with her brain.

760
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,380
Anyway, you have to hold her well.

761
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,450
I'll go up first.

762
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,840
Is your name Zi?

763
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,390
-Nice shot!
-How old are you?

764
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,220
-Defend!
-Yours.

765
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,150
Why is it you? Where is Li Si?

766
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,400
He's unreliable.

767
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,860
That's fine. We'll each take one.

768
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,600
Here.

769
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,150
Take it.

770
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,010
Here, Zi!

771
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,910
Let me hug you.

772
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,640
Come to me. Let me hug you.

773
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,390
Why don't you go home?

774
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,080
Whose child is this?

775
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,430
She's my little brother's desk mate's younger sister.

776
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:05,950
I'm watching her for a while

777
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,280
because they have something to attend to.

778
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,550
How old is she?

779
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,390
About three years old, I think.

780
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:17,310
Can you participate in the singing competition?

781
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,390
Can you pass

782
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,920
your final exams this time?

783
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,720
Why did you ask this all of a sudden?

784
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,110
Didn't you say that

785
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,780
you'll have to copy the exam paper if you fail?

786
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,320
I'll tutor you,

787
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,250
and you teach me Mandarin.

788
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,750
Who inspired you

789
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,350
to actively learn Mandarin?

790
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:40,990
Is it okay?

791
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,580
Sure.

792
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,310
Defend! Yours!

793
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,780
Aren't you going home yet?

794
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,800
I can go home.

795
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,460
I'm not saying you should go home right now.

796
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,740
I'm just asking.

797
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,630
You're always so eager

798
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,100
to leave after school.

799
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,630
It'd be nice

800
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,080
if you stayed and played with us.

801
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,410
Do you play basketball?

802
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,590
No.

803
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,590
Zi.

804
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,470
Look at him.

805
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,070
Why are you so nervous?

806
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,870
She's just a little girl.

807
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,300
She won't bite you.

808
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,320
Zi, this is Brother Wa.

809
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,170
Let Brother Wa

810
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,780
lift you up, okay?

811
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,710
Lift her up.

812
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,840
I'll take it for you.

813
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,130
Lift her up.

814
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,030
Don't show her belly.

815
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,310
Look, you're not holding her properly.

816
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,570
Get up. Let me help you.

817
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:54,950
Is there something wrong

818
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,030
with her?

819
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,650
It's because you're holding her incorrectly.

820
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,020
Let me hug you.

821
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,310
Zi is the best!

822
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,190
Lift up!

823
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,960
Lift up!

824
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,060
Lift up!

825
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,230
Lift up!

826
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,590
Lift up!

827
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,180
Lift up!

828
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,030
Turn around!

829
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,010
Turn around!

830
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,160
Look how happy she is.

831
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,110
Right?

832
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,100
Good girl, Zi.

833
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,000
Good girl!

834
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,510
Hurry up.

835
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,590
Li Si, what's wrong?

836
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,910
Are you alright?

837
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,660
Li Si!

838
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,390
Are you okay?

839
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,030
Are you okay?

840
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,480
Are you okay? Does it hurt?

841
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,790
Are you okay? Have a rest.

842
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,950
Does it hurt? Are you okay?

843
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,710
Don't touch me.

844
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,220
Hurry up.

845
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,900
Hurry up.

846
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,240
[Linqi Oilfield Staff Hospital]

847
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,070
In front.

848
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,430
Sister,

849
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,530
is it necessary to wrap it so tightly?

850
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,390
It needs to be tight;

851
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,110
otherwise, if it gets worse,

852
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,070
you'll need a cast.

853
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:57,740
You... Slow down.

854
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,930
Look at how delicate you are.

855
00:33:58,930 --> 00:33:59,530
Slow down.

856
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,830
Is this really something to be delicate about?

857
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,670
How's your body?

858
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,670
Is his bones okay?

859
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:04,480
It's nothing serious.

860
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,430
Just make sure to rest.

861
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,100
Uncle.

862
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,290
Are you Xiaowa?

863
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,400
You're sweating. Here.

864
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,310
Thank you.

865
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,510
Go back and thank your grandfather

866
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,510
for giving us so many seafood products.

867
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,310
It's nothing.

868
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,350
Miaomiao also sent me

869
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,480
a lot of good things.

870
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,980
It's the least we could do.

871
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:26,800
Dr. Cheng!

872
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,110
I'll go there first.

873
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,840
Come to me if you need anything.

874
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,860
Didn't you only give him the school uniforms?

875
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,380
Why is there something else?

876
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,820
Do your feet not hurt anymore?

877
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,460
I find that you've changed.

878
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,429
Anything good

879
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:40,989
would come to me in the past.

880
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:41,710
What's going on now?

881
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,270
What good things? Just stationery.

882
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:43,870
I've told you before.

883
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,530
Don't pretend you don't know.

884
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:51,600
I have a lot of stationery.

885
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:52,730
I'll give you some later.

886
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,250
Well,

887
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,270
could you share some of seafood

888
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:56,969
from your place with me?

889
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,750
Like octopus

890
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,550
or crabs, the ones with lots of legs.

891
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,110
Give me some

892
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,510
so I can nourish my ankle.

893
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,770
Sister, slow down.

894
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,910
This is the last bottle today, right?

895
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,040
-Mom.
-I don’t know.

896
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,120
Your uncle said

897
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,480
he was going to get some food to bring to you.

898
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,650
I've eaten.

899
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,390
This is yours.

900
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,450
You've already eaten?

901
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,940
I'll go home now.

902
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,070
I have to do the test paper. I'm leaving.

903
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,560
Okay.

904
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,980
Take care.

905
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,560
Come on, let's eat.

906
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,990
I'm really hungry.

907
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,510
Let's see what she bought.

908
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:44,910
She

909
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,210
only brought one pair of chopsticks.

910
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:48,550
It's okay.

911
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,390
There's a spoon here.

912
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,570
Here.

913
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:52,990
Aren't you hungry?

914
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,100
You eat first.

915
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,240
I'm not hungry.

916
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,440
I meant you are hungry. Hurry.

917
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,150
It's not too hot, right?

918
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,990
Most cases of incomplete intellectual development

919
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,950
are congenital,

920
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,290
usually genetic.

921
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,890
There's no cure for it.

922
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,090
I don't think so.

923
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,720
I've asked.

924
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,270
Her parents are normal.

925
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,270
And no one in her family

926
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,200
has the problem.

927
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:38,830
I don't think

928
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,670
it's an

929
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,240
intellectual problem either.

930
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:42,790
How about this?

931
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,070
You should ask your classmate

932
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,130
to bring her sister

933
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,230
to our hospital

934
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,420
for a full check-up.

935
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,290
Okay.

936
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,560
Could it be caused by close-relative marriage?

937
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,070
Mom, no.

938
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,120
you don't even know what's going on.

939
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,980
Who doesn't know what's going on?

940
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,390
You think

941
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,350
I didn't hear you two

942
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,680
talking behind my back?

943
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,470
Weren't you just saying Zi is intellectually disabled?

944
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,390
Look at what you're saying,

945
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,430
you're basically thinking the kid

946
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,440
intellectually disabled.

947
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,200
Exactly.

948
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:10,910
Son,

949
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,590
you're always worrying about

950
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,710
other people's business.

951
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,710
You're really...

952
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,110
Can't you focus that energy

953
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,700
on your studies?

954
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,940
Mom, my studies

955
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,270
are definitely fine.

956
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,220
I help others in passing.

957
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,550
Cut the crap.

958
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,720
Why don't you help others?

959
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,520
Do you like her?

960
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,490
Yes.

961
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,510
Cheng Pengfei!

962
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,910
Wait. It's normal to like someone.

963
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,670
Aren't friendships

964
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,590
based on

965
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,950
liking the person?

966
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,380
Don't you like your friend?

967
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,700
He is right.

968
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,030
Is that so?

969
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,190
Well. Are we talking about

970
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,060
making friends here?

971
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,300
Why not?

972
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,260
I think it is about making friends.

973
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,630
If you think I'm in puppy love,

974
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,030
you're overthinking it.

975
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,950
We're not in puppy love.

976
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,410
Why do you always help her?

977
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,600
She saved me when she was young.

978
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,540
She saved you?

979
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,290
When did she save you?

980
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:16,740
Dad.

981
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,460
Do you remember

982
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,430
when I was young,

983
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:20,990
I went to the drilling team with you?

984
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:21,990
Someone got hurt there,

985
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:22,510
and all the adults

986
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,390
went to help,

987
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,190
and then I fell into that big pit?

988
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,630
You and a little girl

989
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,350
were stuck in the pit

990
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,470
for over two hours?

991
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,570
That little girl

992
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,690
is Yuan Shanqing.

993
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,150
I was crying at that time.

994
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:35,670
She heard it

995
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,870
and came down to rescue me.

996
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:37,670
But she accidentally

997
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,520
fell down too,

998
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:39,830
and then we both

999
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,330
couldn't climb out for a long time.

1000
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:43,860
That little girl back then was Yuan Shanqing?

1001
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,660
How did you know it was her?

1002
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,130
I asked her.

1003
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,910
And I remember

1004
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,550
she had a birthmark here.

1005
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,580
Did you two come together

1006
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,670
because of this?

1007
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,670
What do you mean by “come together”?

1008
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,850
I asked her about it later,

1009
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,430
but she said she

1010
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,730
didn't remember the incident

1011
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:03,970
or me.

1012
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,310
But I remember.

1013
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,890
Because I think it's

1014
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,190
very important to me.

1015
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,530
It's your duty.

1016
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,240
We must repay the kindness

1017
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,910
of saving a life.

1018
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:15,710
Got it?

1019
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,470
You finally found an excuse.

1020
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,030
Come on.

1021
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,310
Of course not.

1022
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,110
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1023
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:23,950
Tell me

1024
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:24,870
why didn't you tell me earlier?

1025
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,370
What was there to say?

1026
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,520
I said that

1027
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,550
because you saved me when I was young,

1028
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,270
now I help you in return.

1029
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,500
Is it necessary?

1030
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,310
If you hadn't

1031
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,190
suspected that I was in puppy love,

1032
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,850
I wouldn't have brought it up.

1033
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,080
How can you

1034
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,560
not make me suspicious?

1035
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm worried about you.

1036
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,020
Mom, don't worry.

1037
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:48,620
We are good friends now.

1038
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,270
And I'm willing to

1039
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,390
to help her and Zi.

1040
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,910
I don't have many friends.

1041
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:54,550
Now that I have two more.

1042
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,460
I'm happy to have two more people. I'm happy to have them.

1043
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,180
Besides,

1044
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,270
don't always think about us

1045
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,400
with your thoughts.

1046
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,130
Don't be too nervous.

1047
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,870
If I really were in puppy love,

1048
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,370
you wouldn't be able to stop me.

1049
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,250
See if I can stop you.

1050
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,390
Don't worry.

1051
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,570
In order not to give you a chance to stop me,

1052
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,940
I won't be in puppy love.

1053
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,580
How is it?

1054
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,460
Have you been educated?

1055
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,030
Haven't you?

1056
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,520
As parents,

1057
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,070
we mustn't complicate

1058
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,040
something that is

1059
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,590
complicated.

1060
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,130
Well,

1061
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:38,100
it's normal to be interested in

1062
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,040
the opposite sex

1063
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,950
when they're around fifteen or sixteen

1064
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,820
and just starting to develop romantic feelings.

1065
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,750
Look at our son.

1066
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,070
He can talk about this

1067
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,060
so openly.

1068
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,430
I think it's very good.

1069
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,690
Like I said,

1070
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,240
our son is no problem.

1071
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,510
He's healthy, both physically and mentally,

1072
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,400
and he's open and straightforward.

1073
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,150
Right?

1074
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,430
Isn't that great? Aren't you happy?

1075
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,880
What is it?

1076
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,530
Do you have any questions?

1077
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,800
What questions do I have?

1078
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,130
If you have any more questions,

1079
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,730
it's your problem.

1080
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,940
Anyway, I feel relieved.

1081
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,870
I'm going to wash my feet and sleep.

1082
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,710
Why is it my problem?

1083
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,580
[Linqi Oilfield Staff Hospital]

1084
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,030
Don't be too nervous.

1085
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,160
It'll be fine.

1086
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:29,870
Dr. Cheng.

1087
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,010
Dad.

1088
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,260
How did it go?

1089
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,890
It's just as I judged.

1090
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,590
Zi doesn't have any problems with her intelligence.

1091
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,390
Really?

1092
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,710
I knew it! Great!

1093
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,830
Zi is so smart;

1094
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,110
how could there be a problem with her?

1095
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:43,910
Right?

1096
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,950
I just examined her.

1097
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,770
Her main problem is related to her ears.

1098
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,520
Her ears?

1099
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,440
What's wrong with her ears?

1100
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,640
She can't hear.

1101
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,680
She is deaf and non-verbal.

1102
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:06,950
We all thought that

1103
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:07,750
Zi might be

1104
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,310
a child with intellectual developmental problems.

1105
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:10,990
We even

1106
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:11,670
accepted that she

1107
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,000
might not be very smart.

1108
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,370
But no one expected that

1109
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:17,060
Zi's fate

1110
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,860
would turn out to be like this.

1111
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,070
My mom is always afraid that

1112
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,410
Cheng Yaya and Shanqing might be involved in puppy love.

1113
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,150
Our parents

1114
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,430
are very reluctant to talk about love

1115
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:26,230
with kids.

1116
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,530
It seems like a taboo subject.

1117
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,820
Everyone told us

1118
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,400
puppy love is not allowed.

1119
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,600
But no one explains

1120
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,620
why it's not allowed.

1121
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,820
At our age,

1122
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,830
we're curious about love,

1123
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,000
but we're also naive.

1124
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,630
If possible,

1125
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:46,750
why can't we

1126
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,080
openly sit down

1127
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,280
and discuss our curiosity and naivety

1128
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,490
like friends?

1129
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:53,880
You should know that

1130
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,830
the person we secretly liked

1131
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,690
at sixteen or seventeen

1132
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:58,590
is

1133
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,900
the initial image of love

1134
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,210
in our life.
