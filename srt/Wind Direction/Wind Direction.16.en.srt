Great. You need to study hard

13
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,390
to become a scientist, right?

14
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,820

120
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,400
Was it hard to sell?

Look at you.

131

What's wrong with me?

132
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,260
Why do you look unhappy?

133

No.

141
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,820
I suspect Yang bought it for me.

142
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,250
It's not cheap.

143
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,090
Of course.

144
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,570

148
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,940
Listen to the sound quality.

149
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,740
You're right.

150
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,770
Listen to this song.

151
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,690
-What about me?
-How do you switch songs?

152
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,600
What about me?

It only has one pair of earphones.

154

There's no place for you.

155
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,780
Just put it on speaker.

156
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,970
Don't break it.

157
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:23,900
There's no speaker.

158
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,900
I'll sing for you.

159
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
I'm sorry.

160
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,510
Are you okay?

161
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,620
I'm fine.

162
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,470
Again.

163
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,070
I'm sorry.

164
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,340
I didn't mean it.

165
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,620
If you did,

166
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,150
it wouldn't be so accurate.

167
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,160
Cheng Yaya,

168
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,860
let's change positions.

169
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,810
Go.

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,870
Nice shot!

00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,260
Miaomiao,

172
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,070
I caught crabs today.

173
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,170
Are you going?

174
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,400
Uncle asked everyone

175
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,960
to have a barbecue tonight.

176
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,620
Let's go. Don't let your uncle wait too long.

Let's go together.

179
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,990
It's a no from me.

180
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,580
Yeah, he's not familiar with Uncle.

181
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,820
What does this have to do with familiarity?

182
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,050
Uncle is not an outsider.

183
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:10,970
-Let's go.
-Yeah, let's go together.

184
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,010
This is a group event.

185
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:12,780
Let's go.

186
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,720
Let's go for a group activity.

187
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,820
You can speak Korean?

188
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,600
Impressive.

189
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,150
Just a little.

190
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,060
Xiaowa, have some skewers.

191
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,630
Oh yeah.

192
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,350
Order whatever you want.

193
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,470
If it doesn't taste good enough,

194
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,220
I'll personally grill them for you.

195
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,700
I used to be a barbecue prince

196
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,920
in the night market.

197
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,890
People call me

198
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,350
Master of Cumin.

199
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,620
Really. I spread it this way.

200
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,860
Listen, barbecue

201
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,050
is all about seasonings.

202
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:38,660
You know?

203
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,060
The key is the technique.

204
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,320
Also,

205
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,560
drinking beer while eating barbecue

206
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,440
brings you good luck.

207
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,490
Uncle, let me have a drink too.

208
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,330
Forget it.

209
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:48,900
If your dad finds out,

210
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,160
he'll beat me up again.

211
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,420
What are you in a daze?

212
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,300
You didn't even drink.

213
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,620
Can't you drink? Come on.

214
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,480
-Let's drink together.
-Cheers.

215
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,420
Cheers.

216
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,200
Did you quarrel with Yang Songbai again?

217
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,180
When she had appendicitis,

218
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,820
Yang treated her well.

219
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,700
Yes.

220
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,820
It's not about Yang

221
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,820
but my precious daughter.

222
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,460
What's wrong with Min?

223
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm really pissed off.

224
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,200
Sister,

225
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,240
the old saying is true.

226
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,770
Money talks.

227
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,060
Yang just bought her

228
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,420
a Walkman.

229
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,180
And she is already

230
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,570
on his team.

231
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,940
Do you know what she said today?

232
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,220
I'm so mad.

233
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,540
It really makes me sad.

234
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,820
She said our family

235
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,900
is falling apart

236
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,660
because I'm a drama queen.

237
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,210
Do you think I've raised

238
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,610
an ungrateful daughter?

239
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,440
How can you say that

240
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,420
about your daughter?

241
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,890
I quite like Min.

242
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,160
She's tall and good-looking.

243
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,420
She always ranks first in the class.

244
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,380
If Li Si

245
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:21,940
were your child,

246
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,800
you would have been more enraged.

247
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,000
What's the use of getting good grades?

248
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,380
I'd love to have a child

249
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,540
like your son.

250
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,410
He loves you so much.

251
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,180
I remember there was one winter,

252
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,850
Dahai said you were fatter

253
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,180
than when you were younger.

254
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,140
Then your son got mad

255
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,290
and fought back with him.

256
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,420
Have you forgotten?

257
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,900
He cares about you so much.

258
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,290
I'm so jealous of you.

259
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,460
You always think others are better than you.

260
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,020
Have you forgotten how Min scolded Yang

261
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,750
when you jumped into the river?

262
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,120
She stood up for you.

263
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,820
Don't dislike her.

264
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,060
You think too highly of Yang.

265
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,290
Actually, I was really touched

266
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,900
after the operation.

267
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,500
I think Yang has changed.

268
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,940
He took care of me well.

269
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,090
I was quite touched.

270
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,500
Who knew

271
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,700
he'd go back to how he used to be

272
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,060
after I'd recovered?

273
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,460
Exactly the same as before.

274
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,860
No changes at all.

275
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:16,980
This

276
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,300
is my fate.

277
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,420
Why are you so late?

278
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,220
Your skewers are ready.

279
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,410
Thank you.

280
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,880
Is your uncle okay?

281
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,240
He's always like this.

282
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,460
He gets drunk every time

283
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,740
and becomes so sentimental

284
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,670
that he starts reflecting on life.

285
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,140
Kids,

286
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,710
as a parent...

287
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,430
Here we go.

288
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,210
It's my duty

289
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,180
to tell you

290
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,140
the essence of life.

291
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:45,860
Look.

292
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,740
When a person is first born,

293
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,080
they're basically a little fool.

294
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,360
Eating and sleeping, then sleeping and eating,

295
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,110
with almost no meaning to it.

296
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,240
Then they grow up to be three years old, right?

297
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,170
Three years old.

298
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,360
They can talk and walk.

299
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,380
Then they go to kindergarten.

300
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,180
In kindergarten, they lock us up

301
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,900
in a little yard,

302
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,380
having us play games

303
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,180
and perform little shows together.

304
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,010
After that, they give you a small bowl

305
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,660
and put big noodles in it,

306
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,800
making you eat the noodles.

307
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,300
I hate big noodles the most.

308
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,250
I always wonder

309
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,340
why the kindergarten

310
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,860
only had big noodles.

311
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,210
Xiaowa,

312
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,140
have you ever eaten

313
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,800
big noodles in kindergarten?

314
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,160
I've never been to kindergarten.

315
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,550
Great, Xiaowa.

316
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,420
You...

317
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,630
Had a beautiful childhood.

318
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,860
It's not like our childhood

319
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,740
being wasted

320
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,800
by the big noodles.

321
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,690
Where were we?

322
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,690
After kindergarten,

323
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,330
they go to primary school.

324
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,000
Right?

325
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,920
Then it's all over.

326
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,110
Abyss. A dark abyss.

327
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,060
You have to use your brain

328
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,140
to learn math, physics, and chemistry every day, right?

329
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:51,810
How tiring.

330
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,940
You have exams too.

331
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,900
Then the teachers

332
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,940
give you a ranking

333
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,380
and set an order,

334
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,700
for fear that people don't know

335
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,560
you're a loser.

336
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,870
Also...

337
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,740
Parents and teachers

338
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,050
will make comparisons.

339
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,660
They will say, "Look at that kid.

340
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,100
He's so outstanding and promising.

341
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,820
Look at you. You're nothing."

342
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,340
My dad thinks

343
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,200
I'm the biggest fool in the world,

344
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,890
even worse than a dog.

345
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,590
He did say those words.

346
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,700
What your dad said

347
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,100
makes sense.

348
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,340
You'll definitely become that kind of parent.

349
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,010
You will.

350
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,580
-You will.
-You will.

351
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,580
Be quiet.

352
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,560
Control your emotions.

353
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,970
As for men,

354
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,810
if you take them too seriously,

355
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,780
they will abuse their power at home.

356
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,580
It's just that you're too tolerant on usual days.

357
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,420
You're lowering your own status too much.

358
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,260
She's right.

359
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,740
From the very beginning,

360
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,090
you've already bowed down to him in your mind.

361
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:42,690
Hu Yue,

362
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,750
you graduated from the vocational school.

363
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,060
You're a local in Oilfield.

364
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,130
You can earn money outside, right?

365
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,170
You have a salary and bonus.

366
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,380
You do the household chores

367
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,460
and clean the house.

368
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,260
You're pretty.

369
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,260
What makes you inferior to Yang Songbai?

370
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,020
Why do you always

371
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,420
have to live according to his mood?

372
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,340
Exactly.

373
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,050
You know what?

374
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,220
Of course, I'm not saying that

375
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,020
a couple

376
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,650
has to compete with each other.

377
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,140
But in life,

378
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,820
you can't just follow

379
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,180
one person's ideas.

380
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,850
No matter how great Yang Songbai thinks

381
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,370
he is outside,

382
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:08,970
when he comes home,

383
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,650
he's still your husband.

384
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,100
He eats the food you cook,

385
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,900
wear the clean clothes

386
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,100
you wash for him.

387
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,180
He has no right to pick on you.

388
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,100
Right.

389
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,210
What's so great

390
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:18,850
about him?

391
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,380
He's just an engineer.

392
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,420
As for some men,

393
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,690
the less capable they are outside,

394
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,020
the more bad-tempered they are at home.

395
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,540
Yes.

396
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:26,780
If he's unhappy,

397
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,030
you should be more unhappy than him.

398
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,150
Ignore him.

399
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,610
Don't cook for him if you have a fight.

400
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,580
Let him do it himself.

401
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,930
Let him do the laundry himself.

402
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,460
If he thinks it's good outside,

403
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,740
he should just stay at sea

404
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,540
and live with the drilling machine.

405
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,800
Be tough.

406
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,020
It's fine if he's angry.

407
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,280
The earth still spins.

408
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,290
You two,

409
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,820
it's easier said than done.

410
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,960
I've divorced once.

411
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,060
Am I supposed to divorce him too?

412
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,140
Divorce again.

413
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,940
It's not illegal.

414
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,140
If life isn't going well, just break up.

415
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,020
Yes, if you divorce today,

416
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,940
I'll introduce you

417
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,210
to a better one tomorrow.

418
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,450
Nonsense.

419
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,290
An unpleasant marriage

420
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,550
is not a good marriage.

421
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,100
Today, let's just enjoy

422
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,980
the singing and dancing here.

423
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,060
We won't go home

424
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,380
until the party ends.

425
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,260
We're not going home! Come on, cheers!

426
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,020
Take it.

427
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,660
You go to school

428
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,250
and study things like math, physics, and chemistry,

429
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,580
and now,

430
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,110
Math Olympiad and biology.

431
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,420
What's the point of learning all that?

432
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,130
Can you change money when you grow up?

433
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:27,970
Have you ever thought about

434
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:28,700
this question?

435
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,890
I think

436
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,860
you think too much.

437
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,420
You gave up your studies long ago.

438
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,190
So you don't make money now.

439
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,730
It's all because,

440
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,420
in the adult world,

441
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,700
life is truly too hard.

442
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,580
Let me tell you.

443
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,220
I used to know

444
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,450
how to solve equations.

445
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,660
I could draw circuit maps

446
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,310
and memorize the periodic table.

447
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,580
I was a talent who used to be very smart.

448
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,650
I didn't expect

449
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,590
when I grew up,

450
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:03,980
I was

451
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,380
bound by love.

452
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,930
Uncle,

453
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,010
did you break up?

454
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:11,890
I don't think so.

455
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,900
Maybe

456
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,450
he was dumped by the other.

457
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,220
Wrong.

458
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,579
Love is mutual.

459
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,020
No one...

460
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,609
No one is dumped.

461
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,380
Do you think that's possible?

462
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,099
Yes. You and Wang Chanchan...

463
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,980
What's wrong with me and Wang Chanchan?

464
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,710
Let me tell you.

465
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,380
We were separated.

466
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,180
We really loved each other.

467
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,500
Who separated you?

468
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,050
Who dared to separate you?

469
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,730
Her parents thought my job wasn't good enough.

470
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,000
Weren't they shallow?

471
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,180
So what if her parents didn't say yes?

472
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,140
You two still could

473
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,060
be together.

474
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,070
Most importantly, she also disagreed,

475
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,100
criticizing me for this and that.

476
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,650
Listen.

477
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,840
I was really sincere to her.

478
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,100
I bought the watch

479
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,900
that cost 80 yuan

480
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,690
for her without hesitation.

481
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,220
I also gave her two gold necklaces.

482
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,260
Really, my love for her

483
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:00,940
could be

484
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,090
proven by heaven and earth.

485
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,020
Uncle,

486
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,860
I understand now.

487
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,580
She didn't fall for you at all.

488
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,820
But you gave her so many gifts.

489
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,420
You were quite an easy touch.

490
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,260
Yes.

491
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,340
I've been traveling far and wide,

492
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,770
crossing mountains and ridges.

493
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,830
I've fought tigers in the mountains

494
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,820
and caught softshell turtles in the sea.

495
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,260
None of those turtles even bit me,

496
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,490
yet Wang Chanchan managed to knock me down.

497
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,460
Let me tell you.

498
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,540
This woman...

499
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,500
Forget it.

500
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,930
[Ballroom]

501
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,710
One for you.

502
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,110
What's going on?

503
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:29,820
Hu Yue.

504
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,710
One more glass.

505
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,970
You scared me.

506
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,790
How much did you drink?

507
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,570
Lower your voice.

508
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,870
She's sleeping.

509
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,970
Cheers.

510
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:43,980
As a mother,

511
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,380
how could you be so drunk?

512
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,080
Can't a mother drink?

513
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,650
Fine, you can.

514
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,040
Which law specifies this?

515
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,300
Show it to me.

516
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,370
-Okay, you can drink.
-Show it to me!

517
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,170
Okay. Let's go to sleep.

518
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:55,890
Hurry up.

519
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,640
Who said a mother can't drink?

520
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,540
You can drink.

521
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,220
Go to sleep.

522
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,420
All right.

523
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,280
What are you doing?

524
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,660
Go to sleep.

525
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,410
Okay, go to bed.

526
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,580
Hurry up.

527
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,900
Let's go to bed.

528
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,210
Go to sleep.

529
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,140
Why are you lying on the floor?

530
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:17,850
This is not a bed.

531
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,580
This is my home.

532
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,610
This land is mine.

533
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,780
I mopped the floor.

534
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,380
You mopped it.

535
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,970
I tidied up the house.

536
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,140
-I can do whatever I want.
-Okay.

537
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,380
-I can do whatever I want.
-Okay.

538
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,740
-Enough.
-I can do whatever I want.

539
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,940
If you don't like it,

540
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,540
just leave.

541
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,060
Leave me alone.

542
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,020
Let's go.

543
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,620
I want to drink.

544
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,540
Enough.

545
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,770
I want to drink.

546
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,580
Okay, I'll pour you some.

547
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,020
-I'll pour you some.
-Two bottles.

548
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,260
Okay.

549
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,740
I want two bottles.

550
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,510
How much did you drink?

551
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,400
Uncle.

552
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:48,720
Uncle.

553
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,440
You are a devil!

554
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,850
This way.

555
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,450
Wake up. You vomited on my clothes.

556
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,900
-Let's go to bed.
-Leave me alone!

557
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,760
Cheng Pengfei,

558
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,130
we've been married

559
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,170
for so many years.

560
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,140
Who has a higher status?

561
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,100
Cheng Miaomiao, I'm asking you.

562
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,820
Who has the highest status in our family?

563
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,900
Well, you have the highest status.

564
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,530
Honey.

565
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,820
Are you afraid of me?

566
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,810
I'm so scared of you, darling.

567
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,940
-Li Dahai.
-Coming.

568
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:19,060
Li Dahai.

569
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,780
Coming. What are you shouting for?

570
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,740
Li Dahai.

571
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,690
Couldn't you drink less?

572
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,330
What did you drink so much? You're a woman.

573
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,450
Li Dahai.

574
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,990
-Li Dahai.
-Drink this.

575
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,450
I want to drink.

576
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,670
Do you look down on me?

577
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,460
Drink this. Don't drink that.

578
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,940
Leave me alone.

579
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,430
Let me ask you.

580
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,820
Are you happy

581
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,260
being with me?

582
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,180
Yes, I'm suffering.

583
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:53,580
I mean, happy.

584
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,240
-What did you say?
-I'm happy.

585
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,990
I'm so happy.

586
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,210
Were you also happy

587
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,690
being with

588
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,730
your ex-girlfriend?

589
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,650
There you go again.

590
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,160
What girlfriend?

591
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,260
Your ex-girlfriend.

592
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,450
After we got married,

593
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,020
I never think of other women.

594
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,780
It's water under the bridge now.

595
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,380
You can't wait to meet her again?

596
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,300
I said, water under the bridge.

597
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,660
-You still want to meet her?
-What are you talking about?

598
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,620
Get up.

599
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,860
Look at you. I told you to stop drinking.

600
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,370
You didn't listen to me. Look.

601
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:20,660
Hurry.

602
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,980
Bottoms up.

603
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,700
Hurry.

604
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,620
Okay.

605
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,090
What are you doing?

606
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,310
This is not alcohol.

607
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,700
You are all liars.

608
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,850
You're all lying to me.

609
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,870
Okay.

610
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:37,970
Go to bed first.

611
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,620
This is clearly not alcohol.

612
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,010
Keep your voice down. If the neighbors hear you,

613
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,140
they will tease you.

614
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,020
So what?

615
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,280
I want the neighbors to hear it.

616
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,780
I'm drunk. What's wrong?

617
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,380
Enough.

618
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,010
I divorced before. So what?

619
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,180
Have I not heard enough

620
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,380
of their idle talk?

621
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,660
I'm already used to it.

622
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,300
Listen.

623
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,440
Yang.

624
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,140
Fine.

625
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,820
Come here. I'm talking to you.

626
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:04,940
Listen.

627
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,540
You reek of alcohol.

628
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,980
Hurry up.

629
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,900
An unpleasant marriage

630
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,010
is not a good marriage.

631
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,660
Let's go.

632
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,730
Hurry up. Let's go. I beg you.

633
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Go to bed. You have to work tomorrow.

634
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,220
Okay, you stay here.

635
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,010
Okay.

636
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,970
I don't care whether you get over her

637
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,350
or still miss her.

638
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,960
It's all in the past anyway.

639
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,510
Right, honey, listen to me.

640
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,030
For me,

641
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,580
you are the most important at the moment.

642
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,780
The rest is bullshit.

643
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,890
Just put them aside.

644
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,420
We have a son.

645
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,460
Our son.

646
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,060
Yes.

647
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,060
We still have a son.

648
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,740
Son.

649
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,700
-Son!
-Coming.

650
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,180
Hurry up.

651
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,730
Come and have a drink with me.

652
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,900
Drink with you? Let me try it.

653
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,260
-Come on.
-Put it down.

654
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,300
How dare you.

655
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,020
My mom asked me to drink it.

656
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,340
Just put it there.

657
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,190
Drink this.

658
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,950
Drink it.

659
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,090
I'm very happy now.

660
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,660
I have a good husband.

661
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,210
My son...

662
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,750
Still has room for improvement.

663
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,940
My son is handsome.

664
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,380
Forget it. Is he handsome?

665
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,640
He's not like me at all.

666
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,440
Why are you so annoying?

667
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,330
I hate

668
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,770
your way of education.

669
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,740
Do you know that?

670
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,530
You grew up

671
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,820
being beaten up by your father.

672
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,260
So you're traumatized.

673
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,700
Do you have to

674
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,780
use your kind of shadowed mindset

675
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,090
to deal with my son?

676
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,890
Li Dahai.

677
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,740
You're a loser.

678
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,060
You're a failure.

679
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,850
Yes, I'm a loser.

680
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,380
Zi.

681
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,860
Zi.

682
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,340
When can you hear me?

683
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,660
[Linqi Oilfield Logistics Office]

684
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,540
No, Mom.

685
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,480
Can you listen to me?

686
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,360
Mom,

687
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,250
you must ask your son

688
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,420
to go back.

689
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,700
Listen.

690
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,060
Last night, he spent all night

691
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,620
talking about his terrible love story

692
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,890
to the kids.

693
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,620
He even took them out drinking.

694
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,300
No.

695
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,660
Yu, I didn't.

696
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,190
I was just by myself.

697
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,010
Yes. What do you mean by yourself?

698
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:45,850
Even by yourself, it's still not okay.

699
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,400
You've set a bad example for the kids.

700
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,120
No.

701
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,580
Mom, you can't let him mess with my children

702
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,740
just to make him happy.

703
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,780
I didn't.

704
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,010
I just drank a little more.

705
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,690
You were also drunk last night.

706
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:56,960
Are you comparing with me?

707
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,730
-For goodness' sake.
-No.

708
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,720
-Mom.
-Cut it out. Hurry and put it down.

709
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,450
Yesterday, I...

710
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,180
I must have drunk fake alcohol last night.

711
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:04,730
If you drink again,

712
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,930
I'll seal your mouth.

713
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,610
Oh, Mom. No.

714
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,690
Yu.

715
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,280
Pour me some water.

716
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,860
It hurts.

717
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,050
My head.

718
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,630
It must be fake alcohol.

719
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,700
Mom, you're awake.

720
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,390
I'll make you breakfast.

721
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:39,850
Hold on.

722
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,220
No need to make breakfast for me.

723
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,620
I'm going out to eat buns.

724
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,140
Weren't you

725
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,430
drunk yesterday?

726
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,760
Sleep a little longer.

727
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,140
Mom

728
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,420
can't drink much.

729
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,460
That's good.

730
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,580
Hang out with them

731
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,050
more often.

732
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,300
Go out and drink.

733
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,540
Your lipstick yesterday

734
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,700
looks nice.

735
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,980
My brother sent it to me.

736
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,940
It's yours now. Bye.

737
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,740
Why are you standing there?

738
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,600
What are we having for breakfast?

739
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,540
Nothing.

740
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,500
Nothing to eat.

741
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,390
What do you mean?

742
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,590
Nothing.

743
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:32,970
If you're hungry,

744
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,580
go out and have breakfast.

745
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,420
What?

746
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,010
I'm busy too.

747
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,780
I'm going to work soon.

748
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,260
I'm going to be late.

749
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,400
As for dinner, handle it yourself.

750
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,600
I'm going straight to dance after work.

751
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,130
Wait, how much fake alcohol

752
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,260
did she drink last night?

753
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,990
Cheng Miaomiao,

754
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,780
your English grade

755
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,250
is really bad.

756
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,380
How many times have I urged you?

757
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,480
You always can't finish the homework after class.

758
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,500
Even if you do finish it,

759
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,980
it's just to get by.

760
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,510
If you don't take it seriously,

761
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:19,850
I can only ask your parents

762
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:20,850
to supervise you.

763
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,570
Don't, Ms. Han.

764
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,140
This trivial matter

765
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,700
isn't worth calling the parents.

766
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,340
English is not a trivial matter.

767
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,540
It is a main subject.

768
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,140
If you continue with these grades,

769
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,180
it will not only affect

770
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,730
your school exams

771
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,380
but also directly impact your college entrance exam.

772
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,490
I'll take it seriously from now on.

773
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,450
I will definitely do a good job on my homework in the future.

774
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,910
I can't trust you anymore.

775
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,200
This time, I can't let you go.

776
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,350
Call your parents.

777
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,020
Ms. Han.

778
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:47,940
Can't we

779
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,820
resolve this matter internally?

780
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,970
No, if you don't call your parents,

781
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,020
I'll call them

782
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,770
personally.

783
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,380
That question is so simple.

784
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,900
But he still wrote another zero.

785
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,420
I even gave him a hint.

786
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,450
Luo Zheng invited me

787
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,650
to play volleyball together tomorrow.

788
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,900
I need more practice.

789
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,320
He's not that good at volleyball.

790
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,520
Anyway, he's much better than me.

791
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,620
Do you think I should

792
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,280
start by practicing serving?

793
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,340
I don't know.

794
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,200
I don't like playing volleyball.

795
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,700
Didn't you ask me to

796
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,230
play volleyball together?

797
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,300
Just take it as exercise.

798
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,140
What's wrong?

799
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,100
Are you upset?

800
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,700
No.

801
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:54,940
I also think

802
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,670
playing volleyball is boring.

803
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,790
Let's play table tennis together.

804
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,240
I didn't say I wouldn't want to play volleyball.

805
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,410
Let's play table tennis.

806
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,480
Volleyball.

807
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,810
Table tennis.

808
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,250
I said I want to play volleyball,

809
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,580
so I'm going to play volleyball.

810
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,660
Let's play table tennis.

811
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,320
-Volleyball.
-Table tennis.

812
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,520
My current situation

813
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,940
is quite passive.

814
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:18,930
Your mother

815
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,600
just scolded me so badly.

816
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,620
She even complained

817
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,820
to your grandmother.

818
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,260
Oh no.

819
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,140
My mom is in a fit of anger.

820
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,230
If I tell her,

821
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,760
I'll die at home.

822
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,580
Look.

823
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,180
This is quite a coincidence.

824
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,300
Is it just about your study?

825
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,330
What else could it be?

826
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,260
It's just that I didn't do well in the exam.

827
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,570
I'm so annoyed

828
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,270
with teachers who always call parents

829
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,940
when students don't do well in exams.

830
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,780
You kids

831
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,770
are so fragile.

832
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,010
Yet they always go to your parents.

833
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,140
Who can stand it?

834
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,500
When I was young,

835
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,060
I was tortured in the same way.

836
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:57,540
Let me tell you.

837
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,490
Your grandpa

838
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,490
broke several rolling pins over me.

839
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:01,580
How scary.

840
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,790
Well, don't worry about it.

841
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:05,700
I'll go to school tomorrow

842
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,620
to see your teacher.

843
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,950
I'll teach him a lesson.

844
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,820
You can't let my mom know about this.

845
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,580
Of course.

846
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,300
My stance is very firm.

847
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,300
Right?

848
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,760
You'd better go back tomorrow.

849
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,290
I already told Mom about it.

850
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:25,580
I have something to do tomorrow.

851
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,380
I can't leave.

852
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,120
What could you possibly have to deal with?

853
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,060
It's a personal matter.

854
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,990
I can't tell you.

855
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,510
I'll leave after that.

856
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,040
Okay?

857
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,090
You dropped chopsticks again.

858
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:45,750
Go wash up.

859
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,370
It's okay.

860
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:47,940
Here, Uncle.

861
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:48,630
You eat.

862
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,460
Enough.

863
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,770
I'll do it myself.

864
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,220
Uncle.

865
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,420
Uncle.

866
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,970
Uncle.

867
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,100
I'm going to school.

868
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,360
Don't oversleep.

869
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:19,860
Don't worry.

870
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:20,740
Listen.

871
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,540
When I arrive,

872
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,820
I'll show him who's boss.

873
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,480
No problem.

874
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,890
Is your teacher male or female?

875
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:29,100
Female.

876
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,420
Female?

877
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,570
That's even less difficult.

878
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,550
Who didn't turn off the tap?

879
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,440
Is anyone there?

880
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,560
Is anyone there?

881
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,230
Who's in the toilet?

882
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,730
Who was not in class but in the toilet?

883
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,590
Director Xiao,

884
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,020
can you ask a boy

885
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,860
to get some tissues for me?

886
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,940
Is it Li Si?

887
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,020
Yes.

888
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
I had diarrhea.

889
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,220
Awesome, Si.

890
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,380
I heard that Director Xiao

891
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,310
asked someone to send you tissues.

892
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,300
Is that true, Si?

893
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,410
Don't you bring tissues to the toilet?

894
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,740
What do you mean?

895
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,820
I've had diarrhea all day.

896
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,820
I've used them up.

897
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,180
Fang is really something.

898
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:41,770
Is it necessary to spread

899
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,340
such a small matter everywhere?

900
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,690
What did you eat recently?

901
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,890
Why do you always have diarrhea?

902
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,290
The barbecue yesterday.

903
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,490
You're fine?

904
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,500
I'm fine.

905
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,690
Wa. Did you have diarrhea?

906
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,460
No.

907
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,030
He can eat raw fish without any issues,

908
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,510
but I get diarrhea from anything I eat.

909
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,910
I've really got to

910
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,990
take better care of my health lately.

911
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,320
Xiaowa.

912
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,820
Do you have tissues? Hurry up.

913
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,460
Hurry.

914
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,540
Thank you.

915
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,580
If I don't come back later,

916
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,909
explain to the teacher.

917
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,980
Miaomiao.

918
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,489
Your uncle seems to be here.

919
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,690
He went to the office.

920
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,690
I know.

921
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,510
What's going on?

922
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,290
Good news.

923
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,780
Mr. Yang, your class...

924
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,670
What time is it now?

925
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,840
Isn't it a bit too relaxed?

926
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,400
You must be the English teacher.

927
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,450
During class hours

928
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,820
is it appropriate for you

929
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,820
to eat and drink in the office?

930
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,580
You even eat until your cheeks are puffed up.

931
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,460
Don't you need to prepare lessons

932
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,660
or mark the homework?

933
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,260
As parents, do we pay the school fee

934
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,330
and send our children to you,

935
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,140
just to see you, the teacher,

936
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,660
eating chive dumplings

937
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,820
in the office?

938
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:25,890
What's your surname?

939
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:29,630
Ms. Wang.

940
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,380
I just want to know

941
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,690
what happened to my child.

942
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:33,620
I also want to see

943
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,220
how you

944
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,220
educate the kids.

945
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,490
Hold on.

946
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,770
Who are you?

947
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:42,210
The parent of Cheng Miaomiao from Class 1, Grade 2.

948
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,830
First of all, this is not chives stuffing

949
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,770
but Shepherd's purse.

950
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,220
Secondly, I'm not a teacher.

951
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:48,940
If you're not a teacher,

952
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,540
who gave you the right

953
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,800
to eat in their office?

954
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,780
Well, I think...

955
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,700
Director.

956
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,180
Director?

957
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,740
Ms. Han, the parent is looking for you.

958
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,300
Ms. Han.

959
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,140
Who are you?

960
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,520
I'm Cheng Miaomiao's parent.

961
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,180
My name is Jia Baoshan.

962
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,530
You look very young

963
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,860
and beautiful.

964
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,100
I told you to guard against the kid in Class 2.

965
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,960
Your three-pointer is just not as accurate as mine.

966
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,060
Where is my water?

967
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,780
Cheng,

968
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,220
is your birthday coming?

969
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,020
Why don't we go roller-skating?

970
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,770
I agree.

971
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,980
Sounds good.

972
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,330
Do you know how to roller-skate?

973
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,740
No.

974
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,830
It's okay. I'll teach you.

975
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,980
Actually, I'm better than him.

976
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,340
You're just bragging.

977
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:03,300
Luo Zheng.

978
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,740
It's my birthday this weekend.

979
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,340
Let's roller-skate together.

980
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,420
Do you know how?

981
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,380
Why not?

982
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:12,660
All of you

983
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,720
are no match for me.

984
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,310
Showing off.

985
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,500
Give me a bite.

986
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,060
Don't eat random stuff,

987
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,390
or you'll end up stuck in the toilet again.

988
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,500
You'd better worry about yourself.

989
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,660
Aren't you worried?

990
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:33,820
Even if I'm worried,

991
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,550
I'm worried about Chingmy Yau.

992
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,100
My uncle is very sharp-tongued,

993
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,260
I'm afraid your Chingmy Yau

994
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,190
can't handle it.

995
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,570
Not necessarily.

996
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,680
Let me tell you.

997
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,260
In front of women,

998
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,610
especially

999
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,760
in front of beautiful women, Uncle...

1000
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,840
Did you bring the tissues?

1001
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,420
Miaomiao,

1002
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:58,930
Ms. Han wants you

1003
00:37:58,930 --> 00:37:59,990
to go to the office.

1004
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:01,700
Okay.

1005
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,060
Ms. Han,

1006
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,390
you were right.

1007
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,620
Let me tell you.

1008
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,590
Teacher.

1009
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:09,820
Come in.

1010
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:13,780
This is ridiculous.

1011
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,500
We worked so hard

1012
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,780
to send you to school

1013
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,580
to face such a good-looking teacher...

1014
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,780
Such a good teacher,

1015
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,930
but you only got 30 points

1016
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:21,930
as a reward?

1017
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,660
Is this the kind of grade

1018
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,970
a high school student should have?

1019
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:25,540
How can you

1020
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,780
go to college,

1021
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,360
and contribute to Oilfield

1022
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,440
and our country in the future?

1023
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,530
What?

1024
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,420
What did I teach you?

1025
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,270
I told you

1026
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,700
to study hard.

1027
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,380
Don't let down

1028
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,780
the teacher's "earliest" guidance.

1029
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,820
"Earnest."

1030
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,410
Don't correct me.

1031
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,330
You should accept whatever guidance

1032
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,420
with an open mind.

1033
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:47,970
Our family

1034
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,340
has always focused primarily on foreign language education,

1035
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,940
with other subjects as supplementary, right?

1036
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,280
Your family

1037
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,830
also focuses on foreign language education?

1038
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,380
Mainly, it's something I do myself.

1039
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,380
Since young,

1040
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,580
I've been very interested in this field.

1041
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,820
I watch foreign films

1042
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,880
without subtitles

1043
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:06,890
or translations.

1044
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,580
To be honest,

1045
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,960
I not only study English

1046
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,750
but also research some less common languages.

1047
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,410
I've systematically studied

1048
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,370
Henan dialect,

1049
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,420
Tianjin dialect,

1050
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,870
Sichuan dialect,

1051
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,310
Shaanxi dialect

1052
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,820
and Cantonese.

1053
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,610
You see, I speak very fluently.

1054
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,440
You're studying dialects,

1055
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,150
not less common languages.

1056
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,660
They're essentially the same concept, right?

1057
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,460
So,

1058
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,700
when it comes to languages,

1059
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,140
it really relies on talent.

1060
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,460
Cheng Miaomiao's not like me at all.

1061
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,660
She's like my sister.

1062
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,580
When my sister was young,

1063
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,900
she spoke with a bit of a lisp.

1064
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,010
Not to mention English,

1065
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:45,820
even the Pinyin,

1066
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,180
she could also mix up, you know?

1067
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:47,900
When did my mom

1068
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,050
speak with a lisp?

1069
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,350
You weren't there.

1070
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,520
Ms. Han, I...

1071
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,340
As a parent,

1072
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,380
I guarantee

1073
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,460
I'll supervise Cheng Miaomiao

1074
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,210
to improve her English grades.

1075
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,860
I'll supervise her myself.

1076
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,660
Be confident.

1077
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,270
You have to believe in the power of faith.

1078
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,380
Are you my uncle?

1079
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:14,360
What aunt?
[There's a homonym here.]

1080
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,710
You don't have an aunt.

1081
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,720
You let Ms. Han down.

1082
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:21,890
Ms. Han.

1083
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,360
Sorry to trouble you.

1084
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:26,810
Where is Ms. Han from?

1085
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,380
I'm from Shanghai.

1086
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,860
Shanghai?

1087
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,520
What do you like to eat?

1088
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,700
Miaomiao, let me explain.

1089
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,340
Uncle Zhang, open the door for me.

1090
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,100
Okay.

1091
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,460
Traitor, because of you,

1092
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,020
I don't believe in

1093
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,060
the power of faith anymore.

1094
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,700
No.

1095
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,620
-Miaomiao.
-Thank you.

1096
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,010
No.

1097
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,440
I did it for your own good.

1098
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,330
Only you got around 30 points.

1099
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,260
Don't you feel ashamed?

1100
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,650
Why should I be embarrassed?

1101
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,980
You betrayed me today.

1102
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,370
I'll call Granny and tell her

1103
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:55,260
that you smoke secretly.

1104
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,860
Don't. You don't have to do that.

1105
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,780
How can our internal conflict

1106
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,310
escalate to involving the older generation?

1107
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,660
Who taught you that?

1108
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,220
Anyway, I have the goods on you.

1109
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:02,970
Just wait.

1110
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:03,900
I...

1111
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:10,140
[Linqi Oilfield No. 2 High School]

1112
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,730
Hello, Director.

1113
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,130
Why don't you go to class?

1114
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,770
Hello, sir.

1115
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,840
Hello, Ms. Wang.

1116
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,420
Director Xiao.

1117
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,580
I know. Hello, Director Xiao.

1118
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,510
Nice to meet you.

1119
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,030
Cut it out.

1120
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,330
We've all met.

1121
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,260
You yelled at me

1122
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,860
in the office just now.

1123
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,210
It was a misunderstanding.

1124
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,580
I just gave you some advice.

1125
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:28,820
People like you

1126
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,060
who don't respect teachers

1127
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,120
are rare to be seen.

1128
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,340
Miaomiao,

1129
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,560
your parent really opened my eyes.

1130
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:35,570
Director Xiao,

1131
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,810
he is not my parent.

1132
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,540
We don't know each other at all.

1133
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:39,940
Zhang,

1134
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,220
starting today, all unauthorized personnel

1135
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,000
are strictly prohibited from entering.

1136
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,550
Noted.

1137
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,500
Cheng Miaomiao, go back to class.

1138
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,100
Okay.

1139
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,780
Director Xiao.

1140
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,710
For goodness' sake.

1141
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,500
What happened?

1142
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,730
He was fascinated by beauty

1143
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:16,990
and turned against me.

1144
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:22,660
In puberty,

1145
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,900
we have already developed feelings of affection.

1146
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,140
You might unintentionally

1147
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,340
glance at a certain boy a little longer,

1148
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:28,780
and

1149
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,410
you might find your ears

1150
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:31,450
inexplicably turning red

1151
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,920
when you see a particular girl.

1152
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,100
We secretly listened

1153
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,700
to those popular love songs,

1154
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,790
and our friends

1155
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,380
secretly wrote immature love letters.

1156
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,310
We whispered in mysterious voices

1157
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,530
about who liked whom,

1158
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,580
and the basketball court

1159
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,780
was often filled with cheering shouts.

1160
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,220
These moments

1161
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,450
make our youth so captivating

1162
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,320
and make our memories so passionate and vivid.

1163
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,700
We may not understand coffee

1164
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,100
or have tasted fine wine,

1165
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,100
but that doesn't stop us

1166
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,420
from singing loudly together.
