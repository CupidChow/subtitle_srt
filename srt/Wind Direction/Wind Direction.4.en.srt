00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,350
Does he even look like a professional?

197
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,210
He can't even pronounce the English word properly.

198
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,150
How could a person who only got 8 marks

199
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,280
in English say that?

200
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:11,950
Son.

201
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:12,800
Drink it.

202
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,390
What is this?

203
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,430
High protein for your brain.

204
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,710
They said twice a day,

205
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,790
one in the morning and one in the evening.

206
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,630
You should drink two every time.

207
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:22,550
Come on.

208
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,590
Hurry up.

209
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,230
Why didn't you tell me?

210
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,750
The problem is you bought so many.

211
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,350
Everyone bought ten boxes at a time.

212
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,030
I didn't buy that much already.

213
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,669
Besides,

214
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,130
I didn't spend your money.

215
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,020
I'm not talking about money.

216
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,950
Why has it become

217
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,150
your money and mine?

218
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,030
Didn't I give all my money

219
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,910
to you?

220
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,350
I give you my salary every month,

221
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,010
why are you drawing a line now?

222
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,630
Who drew the line first?

223
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,870
You gave me your salary,

224
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,350
but it's all for your son.

225
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,480
Don't you know that?

226
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,550
At that time, your son

227
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,190
had the chance to

228
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,190
go to college in Jinan.

229
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:00,670
But no,

230
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,830
you insisted that he must go to Shenzhen.

231
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,190
What type of place is that?

232
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,070
The price of a bottle of mineral water

233
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,430
is the same as a bowl of noodles.

234
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,870
He never comes back during holidays.

235
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,230
He always goes out to play.

236
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,550
Don't you know how much he spends

237
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,690
every time he does that?

238
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,430
Have you asked me about the money

239
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,800
you spent on your son?

240
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,590
Anyway, I'm against it.

241
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,390
They cannot drink the oral liquid.

242
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,430
This whole set

243
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,990
is a fraud.

244
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,030
If I arrange some lessons for the kids,

245
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,230
and let them drink some oral liquids,

246
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,070
I'm considered a fraud?

247
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:25,870
Whenever it comes to our kids,

248
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,530
you only beat around the bush.

249
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,230
When they make a mistake,

250
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,740
you just know how to lecture them.

251
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,030
What should we call your actions?

252
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,890
Hypocritical.

253
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,310
I'm doing this for our children.

254
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,830
You call that hypocritical?

255
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,030
You're full of talk

256
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,430
and never give any practical suggestions,

257
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,630
that is being hypocritical.

258
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,010
What if they can't go to college?

259
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,720
You're going to let them extract oil for a living?

260
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,050
What's wrong with that?

261
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,390
What's wrong with oil fields?

262
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,150
All these years,

263
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,950
you and I,

264
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,550
our two kids,

265
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,230
are nurtured by this oil field.

266
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,430
Don't project your own failures

267
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,870
onto the kids, okay?

268
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,230
Why do you have to force them

269
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:53,990
to go to a big city?

270
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,590
What if we don't push them?

271
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,630
Kids nowadays

272
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,990
can't bear any hardships.

273
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,710
Compared to us,

274
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,840
they're far behind.

275
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,470
He has drunk all kinds of strong drugs

276
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,800
and it's fine that his brain is not developed,

277
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,460
but he hasn't even grown tall.

278
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,550
You.

279
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,110
If you had inherited some of my genes,

280
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,230
I'd kneel and burn incense

281
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,680
in front of our ancestors every day.

282
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,470
Li Dahai,

283
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,870
what do you mean?

284
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,790
He didn't inherit your genes then that means he inherited mine?

285
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,350
Honey,

286
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,470
let's be honest.

287
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,510
Whether it's you or me, it doesn't matter.

288
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,430
What matters now

289
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,390
is natural selection.

290
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,270
Survival of the fittest.

291
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,440
Look at our kid.

292
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,820
He's a mess,

293
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,450
isn't that being useless?

294
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,310
Who's useless?

295
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,550
Who are you talking about?

296
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,270
Good purchase.

297
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,200
I think you made a good purchase.

298
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,020
Good purchase.

299
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,050
As long as it works,

300
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,790
we not only can buy him brain supplements,

301
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,150
we can even buy him a brain.

302
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,870
Li Dahai,

303
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,150
do you think your son

304
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,600
is not as good as you?

305
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,720
When you were

306
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
at your son's age,

307
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,810
you were just playing with mud.

308
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,310
I think my son

309
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,550
is much better than you.

310
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,270
Your son is better than my daughter.

311
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,550
He can go to Hong Kong if he wants to.

312
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,750
My daughter wanted to go to Hong Kong

313
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,550
but she got caught

314
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,350
before leaving the oil field.

315
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,030
He went to Hong Kong for an internship.

316
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,390
He went to improve himself.

317
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,270
Yes.

318
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,270
I bought these things

319
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,070
to help Min improve too.

320
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,470
Why can't I do that?

321
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,870
You can be partial to your son.

322
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,830
Why can't I

323
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,710
be biased towards my daughter?

324
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,830
How am I biased?

325
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:06,710
Hey,

326
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,260
we're not even talking about the same thing.

327
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,590
We're talking about the same thing.

328
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,780
Yang, listen.

329
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,790
I have work.

330
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,390
Right?

331
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,520
I have a salary, right?

332
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,840
We don't rely on you to support us.

333
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,100
I don't need to be concerned about you.

334
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,260
You're unreasonable.

335
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,050
You're the unreasonable one.

336
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,550
If that traitor hadn't betrayed me,

337
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,880
I would have rushed out.

338
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,070
I was hoping to marry you

339
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,600
to support me.

340
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,350
In the end...

341
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,390
you're still here.

342
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,390
in this stupid hospital

343
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,710
for more than a decade.

344
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,910
Cheng Pengfei,

345
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,590
you've studied too much.

346
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,620
What are you doing?

347
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,190
What?

348
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,190
You've studied your mind to death.

349
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,720
You have no ambition at all.

350
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,070
You still think that earning a stable salary

351
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:47,780
and labour insurance

352
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,070
is a stable life.

353
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,090
People calling you Dr. Cheng,

354
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,070
reading some stupid English books

355
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:53,790
and drinking some coffee,

356
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,750
and you think that you're

357
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,720
an intellectual?

358
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,270
Do you even know what intellectuals are?

359
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,150
You keep going on about

360
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,270
intellectuals?

361
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,700
Do you know Tao Yuanming?

362
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,790
Do you know Socrates?

363
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,550
Let me tell you.

364
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,030
If I didn't marry you,

365
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,440
I wouldn't be here.

366
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,350
No.

367
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,590
That's not what I meant.

368
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,790
You finally said what's on your mind.

369
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,470
Right?

370
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,830
I held you back, is that right?

371
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,470
No.

372
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:21,830
I...

373
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,070
I owe you, is that right?

374
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,230
That's not what I meant.

375
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,350
What do you want to say?

376
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,750
I really didn't mean that.

377
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,790
I meant

378
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,830
we should live

379
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,280
based on our current situation.

380
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,000
Okay?

381
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,630
Children

382
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,230
have their own fate.

383
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:35,670
Right?

384
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,190
Don't force them

385
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,750
to become what you want.

386
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,840
Can't you do that?

387
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:41,690
No.

388
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,490
It's not about the children now.

389
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,090
You just couldn't hold it in.

390
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,150
You've been thinking like that

391
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,430
for a while already, right?

392
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,350
How many years have you thought like that?

393
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,410
Am I right, Cheng Pengfei?

394
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,400
Cheng Pengfei.

395
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,550
You're 42 years old anyway.

396
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,840
-You’re in your prime.
-No.

397
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,120
Our children are all grown up.

398
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,910
-Fine.
-You…

399
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,910
Where are you going?

400
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,550
Where am I going?

401
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,310
I want a divorce.

402
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,750
Where am I going?

403
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,910
Why are you wearing shoes?

404
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,440
You're regretful, aren't you?

405
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:00,990
Regretful.

406
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,950
Don't.

407
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,310
Don't touch me. You can divorce me anytime.

408
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,150
Can we stop this?

409
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,230
I want to divorce you.

410
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,050
It's my fault, okay?

411
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,090
It's useless.

412
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,060
Wait for me.

413
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,680
Dad, my mom is...

414
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,190
Let her go.

415
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,020
What's going on?

416
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,450
Divorce?

417
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,040
Who mentioned it?

418
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,150
Our mom.

419
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,910
What did she say?

420
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,310
She said, "Divorce."

421
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,300
What about Dad?

422
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,140
Dad said, "Let her be."

423
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,470
And then?

424
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:48,950
Then,

425
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,860
Dad went back to the living room.

426
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,290
He even broke the remote control.

427
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,240
Look how angry Dad is.

428
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,510
No.

429
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,600
We can't let Dad fight alone.

430
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,750
Don't you know

431
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,670
our mother's temper?

432
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,270
All these years,

433
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,720
Dad has suffered a lot.

434
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,880
This is when a scholar meets a soldier.

435
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,040
The scholar and soldier have been together for years.

436
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,230
The scholar has already become a soldier.

437
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,730
Don't stir up trouble.

438
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:21,720
Boss,

439
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,120
put less chili in mine.

440
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,270
Forget about your skewers.

441
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,230
Let's go home.

442
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:25,890
I haven't eaten yet.

443
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,070
Stop eating. Let's go.

444
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,670
The skewers were just served

445
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,910
This wine is very strong.

446
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,470
I'm already overwhelmed.

447
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,470
I'm so angry.

448
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,690
It's so frustrating.

449
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,600
You...

450
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,410
What's wrong with you?

451
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,090
I can't live with him anymore.

452
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,230
I failed to persuade one

453
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,690
and now another one comes.

454
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,000
How can I live.

455
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:07,630
Why...

456
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,390
would you come in without changing your slippers again?

457
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,150
When your mom comes back,

458
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,150
she'll scold you.

459
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,600
Dad, have some.

460
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,440
Why?

461
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,390
You have to drink if you're upset.

462
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,590
Drink and say

463
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,230
what you want to say.

464
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,270
We'll help you.

465
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,640
You help him yourself.

466
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,920
Cheng Yaya.

467
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,750
At this time,

468
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,940
don't you know who's the enemy?

469
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,050
Who is the enemy?

470
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,110
Our mom.

471
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:29,660
Wait.

472
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,390
You two...

473
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,230
Did your mom tell you

474
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,750
about our quarrel?

475
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,360
He heard everything.

476
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,370
My mom wants to divorce you.

477
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,830
Look at her.

478
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,920
Dad,

479
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,360
I'll make it clear today.

480
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,170
Tell me if you feel wronged.

481
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,630
I'll help you.

482
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,670
Come on.

483
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,160
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

484
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,180
Don't spill it.

485
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,250
Cheers.

486
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,830
Well,

487
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,230
back then,

488
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,710
I was a good girl

489
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,910
who's quite popular.

490
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,190
I only chose to stay here

491
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,470
for Dahai.

492
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,070
My dad introduced

493
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,390
guys to me back then.

494
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,920
They were all from the city.

495
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,210
The city is not as stable as us.

496
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,320
There are so many laid-off workers

497
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,470
in the city.

498
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,820
I still think the oil fields are good.

499
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,510
Can you be more ambitious?

500
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,350
We...

501
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,230
We are in a remote countryside.

502
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,210
You should have high standards.

503
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,700
Be ambitious.

504
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,350
I said it straight.

505
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,690
I'm not going to Beijing.

506
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,030
I'll stay here.

507
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,550
I want to get married.

508
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,870
Oh my.

509
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,790
Look.

510
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,510
How much...

511
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,620
did Dad sacrifice?

512
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,660
We would have become

513
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,750
Beijingers.

514
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,710
Shut up.

515
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,310
Dad, stop drinking. Come on.

516
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,870
No.

517
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,730
I want to drink.

518
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,670
It's just one bottle.

519
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,220
All right.

520
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,490
Bottoms up.

521
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,099
You finished one bottle.

522
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,380
Dad.

523
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,680
It's not that serious.

524
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,829
Why not?

525
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,790
All these years,

526
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,630
Dad has suffered so much.

527
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,950
Don't you see?

528
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:16,210
Jia Daiyu

529
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,990
is always showing off

530
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,030
and arrogant.

531
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,740
She's always scolding

532
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,270
and looking down on people.

533
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,359
I'm already 17

534
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,020
and she still hits me with a feather duster.

535
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,510
She wouldn't let me do anything.

536
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,270
All my dreams

537
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,270
are just crushed

538
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,230
in the cradle.

539
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,960
You're right.

540
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,270
I just used the dictionary

541
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,600
and read English books.

542
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,220
She said I was pretending to be an intellectual.

543
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,030
I am an intellectual.

544
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,470
Dad, in this oil field.

545
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,260
Who is educated as you?

546
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,110
Who can paint oil paintings?

547
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,460
Who has read One Hundred Years of Solitude?

548
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,260
I've read it twice.

549
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,250
Amazing.

550
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,450
She nagged about me drinking coffee.

551
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,710
I drink

552
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,830
hand ground coffee, okay?

553
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,990
Think about it,

554
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,870
can a soya milker drinker

555
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,070
like her understand the concept of

556
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,370
hand ground coffee?

557
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,740
What does she do?

558
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,170
To put it nicely, she's just in charge of logistics and greenery.

559
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,680
She's just a farmer.

560
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,970
Taking care of plants in the greenhouse.

561
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,510
That's all she does.

562
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,440
And yet, she's still bragging.

563
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,300
You know what?

564
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,980
She said she knows the factory manager.

565
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,590
She just goes to his office

566
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,960
every month

567
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,230
to deliver flowers.

568
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,750
Speaking of knowing the manager,

569
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,910
I even met him

570
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,750
face to face.

571
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,310
His father's ears

572
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,430
was cured by me.

573
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,390
You're the best, dad.

574
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,230
Calm down, both of you.

575
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,270
Calm down?

576

00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,360
What are you fighting for?

767
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,590
Rumor has it that

768
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,250
I'm going to divorce your dad.

769
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,930
Do you know that?

770
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,730
What is this?

771
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,950
Let's make it clear today.

772
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,460
How do we divide our family?

773
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,150
-See, it's just child's talk...
-Shut up.

774
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,110
You're the reason

775
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,270
we got to this point.

776
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,650
I don't think it's all my dad's fault.

777
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,170
You're already taking sides?

778
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,980
Fine, tell me

779
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,420
who caused this.

780
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,890
Can I tell you?

781
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,990
Just tell me.

782
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,870
This is a friendly discussion.

783
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:52,670
There's no taboo.

784
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,590
Just tell me.

785
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,120
Do you want some?

786
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,250
I'll pour it for you.

787
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,490
Mom, I don't want it.

788
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:08,990
Just say it.

789
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,590
I think

790
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,830
you and my dad

791
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,780
are not suitable.

792
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,080
Miaomiao.

793
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,230
Go on.

794
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:27,470
Look.

795
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:28,670
My dad

796
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,130
went to college

797
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,060
and joined the army.

798
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,940
He read a lot of books

799
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,620
and helps the wounded.

800
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,260
Your...

801
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,280
best education qualification

802
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,470
was a technical school.

803
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,450
I studied in a normal university.

804
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,270
You only studied for three months and didn't graduate.

805
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,510
That's not a diploma.

806
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,110
After that,

807
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,280
you went to the boiler team in the oil fields.

808
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,350
But I didn't mean that

809
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,710
the boiler team is bad.

810
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:46,630
But this is

811
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,190
a mismatch.

812
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:48,910
Look at you.

813
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,430
You like drinking and wearing heavy makeup.

814
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,130
You talk loudly

815
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,000
and are unreasonable.

816
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,110
Bad-tempered, irritable,

817
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,040
doesn't study or make progress.

818
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,570
Your sense of beauty is still old-fashioned.

819
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,140
Your habits are completely

820
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,690
opposite from our dad's.

821
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,630
All these years, Cheng Yaya and I

822
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,410
have witnessed everything.

823
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,470
We just kept quiet.

824
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,750
Don't get me involved.

825
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,590
I'm blind.

826
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,330
What a loser.

827
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,340
And my dad has been

828
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,900
devoted to this family

829
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,400
and worried about the family.

830
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,950
Not only did you not thank him,

831
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,020
but also bullied him.

832
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,430
When did this happen?

833
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,310
Dad, don't be afraid.

834
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,270
That's enough.

835
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:27,870
I'm not...

836
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,540
My mom said

837
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,550
it's a friendly discussion today.

838
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,910
It's bad for your health

839
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,310
to keep things pent up for too long.

840
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,710
I didn't say anything.

841
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,310
Anyway,

842
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,070
what's the most important thing

843
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,590
in a family?

844
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,150
Harmony.

845
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,830
If two opposites are forced

846
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,480
to be together,

847
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,610
they'll be unhappy.

848
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,550
An unhappy marriage

849
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,510
is not a good marriage.

850
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,910
You can't just make do for your children.

851
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,590
No one's life should be compromised.

852
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,390
That’s all.

853
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,640
Cheng Miaomiao.

854
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,150
What made you

855
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,070
think about such a thing?

856
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,750
Since you already

857
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,480
brought things up to this point

858
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,700
and even divided our assets.

859
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:09,750
Give a stance.

860
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:10,580
Mom.

861
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,000
Raise your hand if you agree to our divorce.

862
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,560
I won't divorce.

863
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,910
I never said

864
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,070
I want a divorce.

865
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,710
Cheng Miaomiao.

866
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,870
For you,

867
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,010
I'm getting divorced!

868
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,240
They were the ones who proposed it.

869
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,080
I just gave

870
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,570
a reasonable suggestion.

871
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,750
Yeah.

872
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,350
I did it for my mom.

873
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,390
But my mom and dad

874
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,520
beat me up together.

875
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,940
It seems that they really love each other.

876
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,310
The most frustrating thing is

877
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,040
my brother scolded me.

878
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,830
What's wrong with this world?

879
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,830
Maybe this world

880
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,870
is too kind to you.

881
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:28,670
You deserved

882
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,710
to be beaten.

883
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,920
I think we were to kind to him.

884
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,470
Just beat him to death.

885
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,510
Aren't sons

886
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,990
meant to be disciplined?

887
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:47,650
Why? You...

888
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,870
Won't let me discipline him every time.

889
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,710
Won't let me discipline him every time.

890
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,670
Look at him now.

891
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,440
How can I not care?

892
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,510
Now they're all sowing discord

893
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,570
and telling us to divorce.

894
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,010
What kind of trouble are they brewing?

895
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,160
I think

896
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,230
we should communicate more.

897
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,050
Nonsense.

898
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,000
Those small mouths

899
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,110
are unstoppable.

900
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,390
You just say one thing,

901
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,350
they have 100 more sentences waiting.

902
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,670
What's happening to the oil fields now?

903
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,920
It's a critical moment.

904
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,510
But they're

905
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,510
still obliviously happy.

906
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,120
Gosh.

907
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,890
What if they can't go to college?

908
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,290
Where will they get a job?

909
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:19,710
Right.

910
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,110
Have you heard

911
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,910
about the reform of our company?

912
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,590
The one about

913
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,910
adjusting 30% of the employees?

914
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,030
Yes, I heard about it.

915
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,310
That many?

916
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,070
It seems to be 30 percent.

917
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,740
Are you sure?

918
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,390
Yes.

919
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,030
Which department will be adjusted first?

920
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,070
Definitely logistics.

921
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,070

922
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,270

926

Don't be so blunt.

937
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,070
Aren't we going to discuss

00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,620
Look at this.

958
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,480
It's not neat.

959
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:24,910
Do you hear me?

960
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,210
Yes.

961
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,180
Place the red flag like that.

962
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,380
Very nice.

963
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,610
Why are these flowers withered?

964
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:29,660
Change another pot.

965
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,420
Hurry up.

966
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,060
Hurry up.

967
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,470
Make sure to clean up the area

968
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,030
thoroughly.

969
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:33,630
Do you hear me?

970
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,190
Hurry up.

971
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:34,930
Hurry up.

972
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,390
Come in.

973
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,040
Okay.

974
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,130
Do you want to change your shoes?

975
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:00,770
No.

976
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,400
Okay.

977
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,270
Sit.

978
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,300
Have a seat.

979
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,389
Sit here.

980
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,050
Is this place easy to find?

981
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:12,510
Not bad.

982
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,639
My driver is familiar with this place.

983
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,150
You are as delicate as ever.

984
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,770
You wear high heels at home too, right?

985
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,800
I've always been like this.

986
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,750
Pengfei

987
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,350
is a very particular person.

988
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,500
He likes painting oil paintings

989
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,620
and reading English books.

990
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,659
He's also quite well dressed.

991
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,590
I don't think it's necessary.

992
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,989
But I've gotten used to it for so many years.

993
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,889
Do you want coffee?

994
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,239
Italian handmade coffee.

995
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,489
But it doesn't look like

996
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,710
it's from Italy.

997
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,410
I don't care which one it is.

998
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,650
It's not as good as China's anyway.

999
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,760
Do you want me to make you a cup?

1000
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,980
No, don't bother.

1001
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,400
I love tea.

1002
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,650
Your house

1003
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,890
is really nice.

1004
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,230
Not bad. Two floors.

1005
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,630
Look here.

1006
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,830
These are all buildings for officials.

1007
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,710
Pengfei has a high status.

1008
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,670
Otherwise,

1009
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,200
we can't stay in such a good house.

1010
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,600
But I heard that

1011
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,990
you volunteered

1012
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,030
to transfer to the Green Department to work

1013
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,950
on greenery,

1014
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:26,950
that's the reason the department

1015
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,080
gave you this house.

1016
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,240
You're right.

1017
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,280
If your two kids

1018
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,480
live in a two-bedroom house,

1019
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,730
it'll be too crowded.

1020
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:36,830
This house is nice.

1021
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,020
There's a attic upstairs, right?

1022
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,360
Secretary Pei,

1023
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,050
you're quite knowledgeable.

1024
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,910
What else did you find out?

1025
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,190
Daiyu.

1026
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,190
I...

1027
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,760
I don't mean anything else.

1028
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,070
It's just that...

1029
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,580
We haven't seen each other for years.

1030
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,730
I've been thinking

1031
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,170
of visiting when you have time.

1032
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,290
And to catch up.

1033
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,160
I heard that

1034
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,860
you and Dr. Cheng

1035
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,760
are having difficulties

1036
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,100
in marriage?

1037
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:14,700
Well...

1038
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,050
What do you mean?

1039
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,200
No. For example, if you have any difficulties

1040
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,390
in marriage,

1041
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,990
you must report it

1042
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,280
in time.

1043
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,310
The director of their hospital

1044
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,170
and Section Chief Zhang of your department,

1045
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,630
I'm quite close with them.

1046
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,910
After all, we've been friends

1047
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,770
for so many years.

1048
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,440
I don't want you

1049
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,020
to be wronged

1050
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:38,810
in marriage.

1051
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:39,510
No.

1052
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,630
Wait a minute.

1053
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,370
Who suffered losses?

1054
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,080
Who has a marriage problem?

1055
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,040
Pei Dawu, you came to our house

1056
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
for what purpose?

1057
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,160
You're acting all high and mighty

1058
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,990
just to mediate?

1059
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,900
Are you working part-time in the Women's Union?

1060
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,900
Listen.

1061
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,480
I have no difficulties.

1062
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,550
We are living in harmony.

1063
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,980
Our children are promising.

1064
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,630
Everyone knows

1065
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,390
our family is a model family.

1066
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,410
Everyone knows my marriage is good.

1067
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,550
Everyone knows

1068
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,230
our kids are top students

1069
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,670
in school.

1070
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,520
Not long ago,

1071
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,900
our son found a tomb of a Ming Dynasty general.

1072
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,700
My daughter

1073
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,610
came back from Hong Kong during summer vacation.

1074
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,140
They are not ordinary kids.

1075
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,590
Otherwise, I wouldn't have this complexion.

1076
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,460
Listen,

1077
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,380
Pengfei and I

1078
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,440
since we started dating,

1079
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,820
we haven't had a fight.

1080
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,110
Daiyu.

1081
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,310
Don't get me wrong.

1082
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,830
I mean

1083
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,930
if you have any living difficulties...

1084
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,110
Why didn't you close the door?

1085
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,770
Mosquitoes will come inside.

1086
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,150
Who's back?

1087
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,420
Pengfei.

1088
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,770
Pei Dawu is here.

1089
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,020
-Pei Dawu.
-Okay.

1090
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,510
Mr. Pei.

1091
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,030
Cheng.

1092
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,120
Long time no see.

1093
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,720
Come, sit down and talk.

1094
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,160
Let me change my shoes.

1095
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,590
-No need.
-Don’t change them.

1096
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,660
No need.

1097
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,830
Is it Secretary Pei now?

1098
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,880
Yes.

1099
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,850
You also attended

1100
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,990
our meeting, right?

1101
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:19,470
Yes.

1102
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,410
This morning, they organized all the units

1103
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,670
to attend the meeting.

1104
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,770
This morning,

1105
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,110
I had

1106
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,140
a very difficult surgery.

1107
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,460
It's okay.

1108
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,410
Dr. Cheng is someone who saves lives.

1109
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,010
You're worth learning from.

1110
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,510
Do you wear this

1111
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,040
when you work?

1112
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,460
I organized a volleyball competition.

1113
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,740
In the whole arena,

1114
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,600
I'm at...

1115
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,800
the highest position.

1116
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,750
That's...

1117
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,210
a referee.

1118
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,890
Why do you keep shaking?

1119
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:12,950
Let me check your pulse.

1120
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,530
Come on, let me check your pulse.

1121
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,090
Okay.

1122
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:17,550
Normally,

1123
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,330
do you eat a lot of

1124
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,360
meat?

1125
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,490
I have to attend a lot of social gatherings for work.

1126
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,750
Your liver is not good.

1127
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,340
Daiyu.

1128
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,090
I know

1129
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,600
all these years,

1130
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,630
you must have hated me.

1131
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:36,160
Back then,

1132
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,040
I was too young.

1133
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,200
We're both old now.

1134
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,530
Don't mention what happened back then.

1135
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,190
Seriously.

1136
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,470
Everyone was once young and ignorant.

1137
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,350
Right?

1138
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,430
I'm really sorry.

1139
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:50,450
I'm sorry.

1140
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,760
Speaking of resentment,

1141
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,400
I definitely did feel that way before.

1142
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,630
But when I think back,

1143
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,560
I'm grateful to you.

1144
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,350
If it weren't for your betrayal,

1145
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,520
I wouldn't have met Cheng Pengfei.

1146
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,750
I wouldn't have

1147
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,880
such good children.

1148
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,470
Yes.

1149
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,120
Dawu,

1150
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,400
I'm just a commoner.

1151
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,580
I can't compare to you officials.

1152
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,530
But I'm quite satisfied.

1153
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,210
I don't blame you, really.

1154
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,110
Thank you.

1155
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,290
Okay.

1156
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,390
I feel relieved

1157
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,590
to see you doing well.

1158
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,150
Cheng

1159
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,410
is a good husband

1160
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,040
and a good doctor.

1161
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:39,840
Let's shake hands and let go of our grudges.

1162
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,990
Daiyu,

1163
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,920
there's something

1164
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,950
I didn't realize it before.

1165
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,610
I don't know if you noticed it.

1166
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,950
Doesn't Cheng

1167
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,690
look more and more like me?

1168
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,830
-You…
-Just saying.

1169
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,670
Bye.

1170
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,750
Pei Dawu.

1171
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,100
What's wrong?

1172
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,220
You're hugging me too tightly.

1173
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,670
Cheng Pengfei,

1174
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,200
you've worked hard these years.

1175
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,040
Don't mention it.

1176
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,020
If it weren't for me,

1177
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,750
you wouldn't have stayed here.

1178
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,550
If it weren't for me,

1179
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,240
you would be the wife of a Secretary now.

1180
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,710
Why didn’t you knock?

1181
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,640
Cheng Miaomiao.

1182
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,230
If it weren’t for you

1183
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,830
spreading news about my divorce,

1184
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:07,930
I wouldn't be so embarrassed

1185
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,250
in front of the traitor.

1186
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:09,980
Don't think...

1187
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,240
you can escape from me!

1188
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:15,980
Help!

1189
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,520
How dare you step on my sofa!

1190
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,270
Slow down.

1191
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,980
Hit her butt.

1192
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,430
Our war in August

1193
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,120
ended with a tragic defeat.

1194
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,600
Even a small setback

1195
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,910
very tragic.

1196
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,850
We never realized

1197
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,440
our parents' hardships.

1198
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,300
I didn't see my mom

1199
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,230
trying so hard to prove that

1200
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,410
she's living a happy life in front of her ex.

1201
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,690
I didn't see my dad

1202
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,960
sitting on the balcony at midnight

1203
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,560
moping.

1204
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,370
I still remember the different

1205
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,670
incidents that happened

1206
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,750
every summer.

1207
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,720
It helped me grow up step by step

1208
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,180
and filled my youth.

1209
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,390
When my Dad told me,

1210
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,040
"Daughter,

1211
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,930
don't be too sensible."

1212
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,040
At that moment,

1213
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,210
I cried.
