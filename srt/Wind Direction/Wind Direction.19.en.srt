slightly different.

Hello, what would you like?

93

You're right, Si.

If Fang became my aunt,

120
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,630
would there be any difficulty

121
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,630
dealing with the enrollment of Hua'er?

He also said you were well-educated.

150

He said you became good friends once you met

151
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,980
and had similar interests.

But Director, I'm here

158
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,130
not for what happened last night.

159
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,130
Then for what?

160
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,470
Did Mr. Gao tell you the issue

161
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,830
regarding Hua'er?

162
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,670
The girl in the village who needs to go to school?

163
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,600
I've told Mr. Gao

164
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,080
about this.

165
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,430

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,150
it's not up to me.

168

to fight the bad guys head-on

174
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,909
and saved us in the Linqi Oilfield?

175
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:39,510
It was you.

176
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,750

and become our mentor?

It's still you, Director Xiao.

186
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,920
Alright.

187

Those are all what I should do.

188
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,120
It's not worth mentioning.

189
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,190
So this time,

190
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,960
it still has to be you

191

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,150
On behalf of the family of Hua'er

195
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,240
and the whole village of Xiaowa,

196
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,640
I would like to extend appreciation to you.

197
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,430
And I am also on behalf of my uncle.

198
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,790
After all,

199
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,320
we have become closer than before.

200
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,520
Let me think about it.

201
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,870
Don't tell anyone

202
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,350
what happened last night.

203
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,870
I'm going back to class.

204
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,480
Okay.

205
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,190
Remember to bring me my bag this afternoon.

206
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,710
Sticky rice.

207
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,920
Peas, shrimps, dried bamboo shoots,

208
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,550
diced mushroom, dried scallops, diced chicken,

209
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,310
lotus seeds, pork and diced ham.

210
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,030
All done.

211
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:10,830
Does it require so many ingredients

212
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,690
to make the Eight-Treasure Duck?

213
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,370
I will indeed do anything for love.

214
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,380
Director.

215
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,150
Mr. Gao.

216
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,990
Director Xiao.

217
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,390
Why are your cheeks red?

218
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,080
I'm allergic. Not a big deal.

219
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,200
Why are you here?

220
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,830
I'm here to send you antihypertensive medicine.

221
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,950
No need. I found my medicine.

222
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,750
You may take it back.

223
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,250
It's okay. You can keep it.

224
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,780
Thank you.

225
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,630
Well...

226
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,640
Anything else?

227
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,150
Director.

228
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,370
Still about the enrollment of Hua'er

229
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,560
that I mentioned this morning.

230
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,340
I want to try my best

231
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,790
to strive for a chance for her.

232
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,920
I've seen that girl.

233
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,640
She really loves studying.

234
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,750
I think

235
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,150
we should provide an equal opportunity

236
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,630
for every child

237
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,340
who is eager to be educated.

238
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,550
Director.

239
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,740
I am wondering if you can

240
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,880
think of another way.

241
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,550
Yes.

242
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,530
How about this?

243
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,790
Let's arrange an entrance exam for her.

244
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,830
If she fails,

245
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,910
don't mention this matter any more.

246
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,150
But if she passes,

247
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,430
I will take her report card

248
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,290
to negotiate with Principal Qin.

249
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,120
That will be reasonable.

250
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,260
This is a good idea.

251
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,110
Not only will we give Hua'er

252
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,700
a chance for the fair competition,

253
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,310
but also we can show

254
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,770
our care for the students.

255
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:53,840
Director.

256
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,910
It's our honor

257
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,830
to have a leader like you.

258
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,040
I promise

259
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,010
to do every job well

260
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,000
under your leadership

261
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,680
and reduce your burden.

262
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,220
Let's work hard together.

263
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,750
Yes, let's work hard together.

264
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,950
Thank you, Director.

265
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,580
I'm leaving.

266
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,260
Okay.

267
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:20,890
It's reasonable.

268
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,850
Did Xiao Fang really agree to the issue of Hua'er?

269
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,330
Of course, she showed respect to me.

270
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,880
This is not her style.

271
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,790
It depends on who asked her.

272
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,150
She will do her best for me.

273
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,470
After all, I have been closer with her

274
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,390
than before.

275
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,000
She will be my aunt

276
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,110
one day.

277
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,510
Then I should boost our friendship,

278
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,370
shouldn't I?

279
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,470
There are a lot of letters recently.

280
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,150
It's a bit messy.

281
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,070
It's okay.

282
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,630
Who's that?

283
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,880
You can't park the motorcycle here.

284
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,040
Move it away.

285
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,400
He's looking for me.

286
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,200
Hello.

287
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:08,970
Mr. Jia.

288
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,570
Director Xiao.

289
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,150
I've told Miaomiao

290
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,710
that she could bring me the bag

291
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,870
this afternoon.

292
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,730
Why bother coming here in person?

293
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,300
No worries. This is what I should do.

294
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,810
Well, I...

295
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,210
I was busy cooking.

296
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,990
I forgot to bring your bag here.

297
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,110
Did you cook again?

298
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,550
Yes, I want to

299
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,390
thank you.

300
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,880
I just learnt a new dish.

301
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,310
Don't mention it.

302
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,470
Thank you so much.

303
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,180
Mr. Jia.

304
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,730
Let's go to the office.

305
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,790
Come with me.

306
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,830
What a waste.

307
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,030
Director Xiao, let me help you.

308
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,230
Don't bother. Go ahead with your work.

309
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,020
Okay.

310
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,860
Nice to meet you.

311
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,740
Come here, Baoshan.

312
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,160
Please come in.

313
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,500
Make yourself at home.

314
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,590
It's noon.

315
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,300
Won't teachers and students come here after their classes?

316
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,310
This is Director's Office.

317
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,620
The faculty won't come here unless they have something to deal with.

318
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,680
Please have a seat.

319
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,440
Make yourself at home.

320
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,830
Okay.

321
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,480
Look at you.

322
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,990
We are friends.

323
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,550
Why bother cooking so many dishes?

324
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,610
I do not consider myself an outsider.

325
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:26,750
Here.

326
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,210
Have some water.

327
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:28,940
Thank you.

328
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,950
Then I'll try the dish now.

329
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,040
I'll try it before it gets cold.

330
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,610
You are so considerate, Baoshan.

331
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,450
You even packed it with a handkerchief.

332
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,590
What is this?

333
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,930
The Eight-Treasure Duck.

334
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,350
There are eight precious ingredients in it.

335
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,670
I know you have been busy

336
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,710
and working hard all the time.

337
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,190
So I learnt this dish

338
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,050
which can replenish your energy.

339
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,360
Delicious.

340
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,640
Why is it so sweet?

341
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,880
It is Shanghai cuisine.

342
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,390
You could have just cooked local dishes,

343
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,590
but you invested your energy in making Shanghai cuisine.

344
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,980
Eat less.

345
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,980
Take your time.

346
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,430
Sure.

347
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,560
Director.

348
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,460
Ms. Han, class dismissed?

349
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,670
Hello, Mr. Jia.

350
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,390
Baoshan

351
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,270
learned to cook a new dish, Eight-Treasure Duck.

352
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,330
He brought it here to let me have a try.

353
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,790
What's wrong, Ms. Han?

354
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,990
Nothing serious.

355
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,950
I would like to know the arrangement

356
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,310
for the final exam.

357
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,510
Arrangement for the final exam?

358
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,310
I'll send it to you all tomorrow.

359
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,390
You came at the right time.

360
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,550
Join us and have a try.

361
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,100
Yes.

362
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,360
Thank you, Director. I'm not hungry.

363
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,430
You have to try it.

364
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,150
I used

365
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,060
the best ingredients.

366
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,910
My cooking skills

367
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,340
are as good as Shanghai locals.

368
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,870
It's good for your stomach.

369
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,350
Mr. Jia.

370
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
Don't force her if she's not hungry.

371
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:11,800
Ms. Han.

372
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,190
The winter vacation is coming.

373
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,470
Don't slack off.

374
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,270
Kids tend to

375
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,650
get distracted by the upcoming vacation.

376
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,980
Don't worry, Director.

377
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,870
I'll go back now.

378
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,270
Okay.

379
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,270
Enjoy your meal.

380
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,870
Have a seat, Baoshan.

381
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,530
Have a seat.

382
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,550
Why don't you try it?

383
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,590
I... I...

384
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,560
I don't like sweet food.

385
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,240
Really?

386
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,670
May I come in?

387
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,230
Yes.

388
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,590
Director agreed

389
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,080
to let Hua'er take an exam.

390
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,550
As long as she passes the exam,

391
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,590
we can negotiate with the principal

392
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,520
with her grades.

393
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,950
Isn't my aunt reliable?

394
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,520
She will also be my aunt.

395
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,640
By the way,

396
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,990
these are the textbooks and test papers I found

397
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,080
from the Junior High School Department.

398
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,060
Take them back to Hua'er

399
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,990
and ask her to review accordingly.

400
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,670
This is a rare opportunity.

401
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,590
Help her

402
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,670
when you have time.

403
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,460
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

404
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,310
Look at you.

405
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,849
How many times have I told you?

406
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:09,510
Look at you.

407
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,390
Can't you take good care of yourself?

408
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,869
You've suffered from stomach illness

409
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,150
since you were young.

410
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,589
Can't you be more careful?

411
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,220
Don't sit here.

412
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,470
Director

413
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,150
will come here for patrol later.

414
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,450
Well, it's inappropriate for you to sit here.

415
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,450
Sit here. Come on.

416
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,119
What should I do now?

417
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,710
I still have to drink when it's necessary.

418
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,480
I can't say I agree with you.

419
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,280
Do you have to drink like that?

420
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,070
Well, if you

421
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,030
do what you should do at work,

422
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,150
leaders won't pick holes

423
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,010
or judge you about your drinking.

424
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,990
After you drink with this leader today,

425
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,610
you'll drink with another one tomorrow.

426
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,630
You just want

427
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,590
to get along well with leaders

428
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,790
and take some shortcuts, don't you?

429
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,270
I don't think this is advisable,

430
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:48,830
you know?

431
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,670
And such leaders

432
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,430
will find trouble for themselves sooner or later.

433
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,360
I don't think their behaviors are advisable either.

434
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,960
Yes, I shouldn't drink.

435
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,070
But I should take the medicine.

436
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,660
Hurry up.

437
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,710
It hurts so much.

438
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,070
I'm just an ENT specialist.

439
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,090
What medicine should I get for you?

440
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,010
Open-throat sword spray

441
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,820
or nasal relief?

442
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,870
Can they cure your stomachache?

443
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,870
Well, don't you

444
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:02,550
get along well with the female gastroenterologist?

445
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,330
You can get her help through the back door.

446
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,530
Don't talk nonsense.

447
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,220
Well, let's go.

448
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,070
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

449
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,910
Who is this again?

450
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,550
Are you going or not? Don't you have a stomachache?

451
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,210
I'm always busy making calls.

452
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,430
This is an internal line.

453
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,030
Only internal calls can be made.

454
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,330
Your rank is still low.

455
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,230
You are rich now,

456
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,430
yet you still want to take advantage of others.

457
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,030
It's been years.

458
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,360
Why haven't they installed an external line in your office?

459
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,060
Secretary Wang.

460
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,130
Volleyball game?

461
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,460
I must be the one who leads the team.

462
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,000
Well.

463
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,870
I'm not scrambling.

464
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,910
I... Do you want to be the champion?

465
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,510
I have to be the leader if you want to win a championship.

466
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,510
I'm capable

467
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,140
of stirring up the atmosphere.

468
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,220
So annoying.

469
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,420
Damn it.

470
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,710
I spent so much money

471
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,690
and so much energy.

472
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,170
But you ate everything!

473
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,780
A duck weighing 1.5 kilometers with ingredients weighing one kilometer.

474
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,260
There was nothing left!

475
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,470
Can you tell if it's delicious or not?

476
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,070
The more you eat, the fatter you'll be

477
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,000
and the less attractive you'll be.

478
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,640
Hua'er, let's eat.

479
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,590
Brother, what's the school like over there?

480
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,820
It's big and beautiful.

481
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,730
Will they look down on us?

482
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,740
No.

483
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,030
I saw the clothes

484
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,830
your classmates wore before.

485
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,370
They're so beautiful.

486
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,280
So are their shoes.

487
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,590
Those white tourist shoes

488
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,830
looked expensive.

489
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,500
I dare not talk to her.

490
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,390
Actually, she's very nice.

491
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,750
You'll know

492
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,410
after you get into the school.

493
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,720
Are you guys

494
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,060
friends now?

495
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,310
Kind of.

496
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,110
When I worked

497
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,310
in the restaurant,

498
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,050
I saw the kids who came from the city

499
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,480
celebrate their birthdays.

500
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,710
They even ate a two-layer cake.

501
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,270
I hadn't seen one before.

502
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,560
My boss's daughter was nice to me.

503
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,190
She even bought me

504
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,360
a boxed ice cream.

505
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,800
I dare not talk to her.

506
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,060
I was afraid she would look down on me.

507
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,570
At first,

508
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,790
I thought so too.

509
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,750
Not long ago, it was her little brother's birthday.

510
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,860
I had nothing to offer him as a present.

511
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,350
So I gave him

512
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,680
a self-made pen holder.

513
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,600
I was afraid he would dislike it.

514
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,900
Later I found he liked it.

515
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:53,880
[Linqi Oilfield No. 2 High School]

516
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:54,890
You're coming.

517
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,540
Dude.

518
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,440
Please open the gate for me.

519
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,790
I'm here to deliver something.

520
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,790
Are you going

521
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,030
to bring food to Director Xiao again?

522
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,640
Yes. Yes.

523
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,090
Hold on.

524
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,830
Who is it?

525
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,280
It's me.

526
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,090
Ms. Han.

527
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,300
What's up?

528
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,030
You didn't get a chance

529
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,130
to eat the Eight-Treasure Duck at noon.

530
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,260
I made another one for you especially.

531
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,140
It's late now and you were still preparing for the lessons?

532
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,650
Mr. Jia,

533
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,270
you shouldn't send anything

534
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,790
to me anymore.

535
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,340
I'm Miaomiao's teacher.

536
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,310
It's my duty

537
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,540
to care about her.

538
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,490
Don't be so distant.

539
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,230
Look how hard you work every day.

540
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,630
Your face looks slimmer.

541
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,510
If you don't take good care of yourself,

542
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,070
how can you

543
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,150
manage such a large class?

544
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:07,790
Right?

545
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,110
If you keep doing this,

546
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,190
others might get the wrong idea about us.

547
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,550
Speaking of this,

548
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,270
I'll have to explain it

549
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,390
to you later.

550
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,350
This duck

551
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,970
would taste better.

552
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,700
Actually, the one I sent at noon

553
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,780
was for you.

554
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,430
But I didn't expect to meet Director Xiao.

555
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,270
She was being self-deluding,

556
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,100
like a peacock spreading its tail feathers in a display.

557
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,110
She thought it was made for her.

558
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,370
So she ate it directly.

559
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,390
By the way, don't get me wrong.

560
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,370
I only have respect for Director Xiao.

561
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,030
I don't have feelings for her.

562
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,410
Mr. Jia,

563
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,070
I really don't understand.

564
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:12,480
It doesn't matter.

565
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,670
We have plenty of time.

566
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,690
We can talk about it later.

567
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,120
But the duck is getting cold.

568
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,090
Sit down and eat.

569
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,630
No need. I'm not hungry.

570
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,140
You have to even if you're not.

571
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,890
You didn't get a chance to eat the one I sent at noon.

572
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:23,640
But it's okay.

573
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,930
Let's just take it as my first try.

574
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,060
Without that one,

575
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,690
I couldn't make a better one.

576
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:28,670
It's really delicious.

577
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,470
Try it.

578
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:30,910
By the way,

579
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,030
well, when we were at the office this noon,

580
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,420
I knew you kept a distance from me deliberately.

581
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,470
I understand.

582
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,890
Since you understand,

583
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,950
please leave.

584
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,350
I said there's no need for you to do this.

585
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,220
Look at you.

586
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,940
Ms. Han, I...

587
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,750
Director Xiao.

588
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,710
Well, you…

589
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,330
You're still up?

590
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,450
Well, this noon,

591
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,560
it seemed you liked to eat the Eight-Treasure Duck.

592
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,120
So I made another one tonight

593
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,980
and I especially brought it here.

594
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,030
I saw Ms. Han

595
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,450
in the corridor just now.

596
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,530
So I also invited her.

597
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,990
As teachers,

598
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,810
you've really worked very hard.

599
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,870
You're the one who works harder here.

600
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,390
Aren't you tired of

601
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,150
lying to me?

602
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,230
You're here

603
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,290
for Ms. Han, right?

604
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,500
The Eight-Treasure Duck you brought at noon

605
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,300
was also made for Ms. Han, right?

606
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,260
Well, look at you.

607
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
I didn't make it for her especially.

608
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,000
Well...

609
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,140
It's mainly because I admire you

610
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,350
very much.

611
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,470
And,

612
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,510
I also

613
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,040
care about other teachers.

614
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,740
I don't think

615
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,670
Ms. Han

616
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,000
likes this kind of care.

617
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,480
Well, what do you mean?

618
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,070
Do you mean you're the only one

619
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,900
who can eat it?

620
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,250
Besides, we're both single.

621
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,110
Why should everyone be like you?

622
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,460
You've been single for 30 years for your work.

623
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,440
I dare you to say that again!

624
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,160
Shut up!

625
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,100
Jia Baoshan,

626
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,920
you should have principles.

627
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,430
I hate people

628
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,910
like you who are two-faced and deceitful

629
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,310
the most.

630
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,640
Who was like a peacock?

631
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,620
Who was being self-deluding?

632
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,140
What's your first try?

633
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,390
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

634
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,230
If I had known,

635
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,340
I wouldn't have eaten your meal no matter what happened.

636
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,140
Besides,

637
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,790
I've been single for 30 years for my work.

638
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,830
What's wrong with that?

639
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,670
This is the evidence

640
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,250
that I've devoted myself to the cause of education.

641
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,180
I feel honored.

642
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,910
A despicable person like you

643
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,570
would never understand that.

644
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,030
You'd better get lost.

645
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,230
Or I'll call security.

646
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,680
Well.

647
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,340
Get lost!

648
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:06,990
Uncle.

649
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,880
Uncle, where did you go?

650
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,700
I didn't go anywhere.

651
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,210
What happened?

652
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,000
Uncle, you're finally back.

653
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,900
What is this delicious food?

654
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,070
Let me see.

655
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,030
Why does it smell so sweet?

656
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,230
How can it taste good?

657
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,150
Just eat it. You talk too much.

658
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,450
Can't you notice Uncle is in a bad mood?

659
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,130
What's wrong?

660
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,290
Are you heartbroken again?

661
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,920
It's hard to explain.

662
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,590
When I saw Fang today,

663
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,170
she looked so happy,

664
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,700
and she even mentioned you.

665
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,940
What did she say about me?

666
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,400
She said...

667
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,090
She wanted to thank you for sending her back to the dorm.

668
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,190
She also said...

669
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,250
Anyway, what she said about you

670
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,220
is all about

671
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,920
praising you.

672
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,800
She said you're a nice man,

673
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,050
and you're a person of impressive appearance and talent.

674
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:44,900
You're dignified and respectable.

675
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,630
You have a high alcohol tolerance and you're loyal to your friends.

676
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,120
Why don't you give this bag

677
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,630
back to her tomorrow?

678
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,830
Uncle.

679
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,440
You have to return it to her yourself.

680
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,700
This is how you can show your sincerity. Do you understand?

681
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,250
I want to express my true feelings openly, much like how the moon shines brightly in the sky.

682
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,300
But things didn't go as planned...

683
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,900
What's wrong with him?

684
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,510
Something's wrong with him.

685
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,370
Romantic relationship

686
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,860
makes people sad.

687
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,080
But I think

688
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,180
we will soon have an aunt

689
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:31,690
who's the director of teaching and discipline.

690
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,590
Let's pray for him, Cheng.

691
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,240
What are you doing on the stairs?

692
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:45,910
Director Xiao.

693
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:46,770
Director Xiao.

694
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,370
Director!

695
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,290
Hello, Director Xiao.

696
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,430
Director!

697
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,860
Director, your bag!

698
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,480
Director.

699
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,190
My uncle planned

700
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,560
to return it to you personally.

701
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,870
But he has been at home

702
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:03,790
studying cuisine every day,

703
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,640
like Eight-Treasure Duck and Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs...

704
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,430
What else is in your mind

705
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,030
besides eating and playing?

706
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,190
If you have time,

707
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,500
you should memorize more English words,

708
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,630
so that you can pass the English exams.

709
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,020
What happened?

710
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,350
My uncle

711
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,590
praised you before me yesterday.

712
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,190
He said you're beautiful and graceful...

713
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:20,920
From now on,

714
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,320
don't talk about your uncle before me again.

715
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:23,790
Tell him

716
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,440
he shouldn't come to school if he has nothing to do.

717
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,720
This is school!

718
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,550
Unauthorized personnel are not allowed to enter!

719
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,710
How is it?

720
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,520
Isn't she going to be your aunt?

721
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,110
Uncle

722
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,840
must have pissed Xiao Fang off.

723
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,570
Xiao Fang is a person

724
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,900
who will seek revenge for the smallest grievance.

725
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,120
It's hard to say if Hua'er can take exams now.

726
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,560
I'm speechless.

727
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,250
It doesn't have a good ending even with a good start.

728
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,710
Then what should we do now?

729
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,070
Mr. Gao.

730
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,180
Mr. Gao. Mr. Gao.

731
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,520
Mr. Gao!

732
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,750
Is Hua'er not allowed

733
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,070
to take exams?

734
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,420
Why?

735
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,450
Because my uncle

736
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,050
pissed Xiao Fang off.

737
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,950
But it has nothing to do

738
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,010
with Hua'er's exams.

739
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:36,840
In the meeting this morning,

740
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,900
Director Xiao asked me

741
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,150
to determine the content of the exams.

742
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,170
The time has been determined.

743
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,350
Director Xiao will supervise the exams herself.

744
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,410
-Really? -Really?

745
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,830
Director Xiao is really magnanimous.

746
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,160
She also said

747
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,230
the principal will approve her enrollment

748
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,960
as long as she passes the exams.

749
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,550
I admire Director Xiao

750
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,520
more.

751
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,610
All right, you should go back to your class.

752
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,370
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

753
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,450
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

754
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,810
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

755
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,590
I didn't find the book,

756
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,880
but I can give you this pencil case.

757
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,800
It is

758
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,750
the least

759
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,950
I can do.

760
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,610
Thanks.

761
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,680
Xiaowa, look.

762
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,210
There are many sunflower patterns on it.

763
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,870
My grandma said

764
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,590
people should always grow toward the sun

765
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,470
just as sunflowers do,

766
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,950
so that there will be hope.

767
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,580
I believe

768
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,460
there will be no problem for Hua'er to pass the exams.

769
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,460
There will be no problem for Hua'er.

770
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,550
But what should we do

771
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,810
about the final exams?

772
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,950
My dad has been back frequently recently.

773
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,150
I need to figure out

774
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:28,870
how to seek shelter in my grandma's home

775

after the exams.

776
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,790
You can hide in your grandma's home.

777
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,150
But where can I hide?

778
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,390
Why don't we go together?

779
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,620
Don't think too much.

780

You might as well read more books if you have time.

781

Well.

What's the secret

785
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,660
of your Boiled Sliced Pork?

786
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,510
I've been studying it for a long time.

I only know how to eat it.

792

and told you about it,

793
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,310

These days,

796
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,390
I've reflected on myself.

I

798
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:09,960
am an excellent man in essence,

799
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,429
right?

800
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,280
The reason why I

801
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,110
offended Director Xiao

802
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,949
lies in my blindness

It seems

809
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,139
Director Xiao

810
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:27,620
is also an excellent woman,

811
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,219
right?

812
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:30,190
So we are

813
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,199
both excellent people,

814
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,210
and we shouldn't have a misunderstanding between us.

815
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,219
So I've decided

816
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:35,270
to get back

00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,840
I'll let her to have a fresh new recognition

822
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,040
of how excellent I am.

823
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,010

I think you'd better stop doing such a thing.

827

At first, everyone thought

828
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:55,179
Director Xiao didn't deserve you.

829
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,699
But now I firmly think

you don't deserve her.

831

Should I ask my mom?

837
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,900
Forget it. I can do it myself.

00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,990
Go back to Guangdong to work.

948
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,990
I've made a deal with your boss.

949
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,260
Go back and keep working there.

950
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,270
Dad, Mom, I want to go to school.

951
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,600
After I finish my studies,

952
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,330
I'll make money to support you.

953
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,670
After she graduates from school,

954
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,180
she'll earn much more than now!

955
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,050
I don't care whether the times have changed.

956
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,200
she will work

957
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,350
and earn money

958
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,360
for her brother's marriage!

959
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,570
What does it

960
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:15,840
have to do with her?

961
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,500
What were you saying?

962
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,430
That's her biological brother!

963
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,560
You think it has nothing to do with her?

964
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,380
Her brother went out to work

965
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,620
before he graduated from elementary school.

966
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,660
With our help,

967
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:24,750
she finished her middle school.

968
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,840
Others' daughters

969
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,230
have long gone out to make money.

970
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,350
Do you still think it has nothing to do with her?

971
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,590
Cut the crap! Take her away!

972
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,230
Move away!

973
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,800
Move away!

974
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,490
Come with me!

975
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:32,930
No!

976
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,310
Hua'er is good at studying!

977
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,580
I can't let you cause any delays in her studies!

978
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,190
Move away!

979
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,010
No!

980
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,460
Dad!

981
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,010
You brat!

982
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,880
Even your grandpa

983
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,790
can't control me!

984
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,510
Who do you think you are?

985
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,370
You little brat!

986
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,480
I'll kill you!

987
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,300
-I'll kill you! -I'm not going to school!

988
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,610
Li! Li!

989
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,250
I won't go to school anymore!

990
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,190
I'll go back to Guangdong with you now.

991
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
Will you? Have you made up your mind?

992
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:05,610
Let's go!

993
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,760
Let's go home.

994
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,720
Hua'er!

995
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,850
Please extend my thanks to them!

996
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,230
Brother, everyone has their fate.

997
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,880
Everyone has their own way of living a life.

998
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,380
If this continues,

999
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,510
I'll get you into trouble.

1000
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,140
And I'll feel more guilty.

1001
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,550
Fate can be changed

1002
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,620
through efforts!

1003
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,430
Don't worry, Xiaowa.

1004
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,390
Although I can't go to school,

1005
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,840
I will never

1006
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,250
give up studying.

1007
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,760
I can teach myself.

1008
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:36,940
Let's go!

1009
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:38,680
Let's go.

1010
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:14,970
If possible,

1011
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:16,730
I can talk to her parents.

1012
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:19,340
I don't believe I can't persuade them.

1013
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,280
They have left.

1014
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,670
Thank you, Director.

1015
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,080
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

1016
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,590
Thank you.

1017
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,780
What the heck is this?

1018
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,480
It's all in vain.

1019
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:57,550
I believe Hua'er

1020
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,410
will make it by teaching herself.

1021
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:06,380
I will study hard in the future.

1022
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,080
I have to

1023
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:14,260
cherish the opportunity others dream of.

1024
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,070
We all thought as long as we worked hard,

1025
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,670
there would be good results,

1026
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:26,750
and as long as we grew toward the sun,

1027
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,550
we could all become a sunflower.

1028
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,340
But in the real world,

1029
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,720
the sun is always there.

1030
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,700
However,

1031
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,230
not every flower

1032
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,190
has a chance to grow toward the sun.

1033
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,320
Uncle has never got a chance

1034
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,750
to treat Han Shu to a meal.

1035
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,770
Hua'er couldn't make it to take exams.

1036
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,060
This is the first time

1037
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,730
I've felt helpless.

1038
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,690
With the help of so many people,

1039
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,100
the kid still

1040
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,400
didn't make it to go to school.

1041
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,240
Hua'er,

1042
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:56,130
no matter where you go in the future,

1043
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,510
I hope

1044
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,300
you can

1045
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:00,230
grow up safely and nicely.

1046
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:01,890
We

1047
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,560
will meet again.
