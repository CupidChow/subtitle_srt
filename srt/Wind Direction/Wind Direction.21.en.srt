00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,010
Lingling will definitely suspect.

196
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,710
Of course, she will.

197
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,950
I already figured that.

198
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,150
That's why I brought you two along,

199
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,750
to help me think of a plan.

200
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,440
Just say you've got something urgent at work.

201
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,860
I do that all the time.

202
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,990
Yeah, but you're on the night shift.

203
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,030
One phone call from her

204
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,910
and I'd be caught.

205
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,420
Yes.

206
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,820
How about saying you've got a stomache

207
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,020
and hospitalized?

208
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,070
Then she'd come

209
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,600
visit me at the hospital.

210
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,020
Yes.

211
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,720
Maybe don't go home at all.

212
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,710
Just say you're too drunk.

213
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,510
That's right.

214
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,350
That's

215
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,930
more like suiside.

216
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,150
Listen,

217
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,260
here's the thing.

218
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,440
As long as Lingling isn't home,

219
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,950
it'll be easy.

220
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,710
Exactly.

221
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,390
Exactly what? How are you going to get rid of her?

222
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,550
I'm telling you,

223
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,880
with just the two of us, we can't do that.

224
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,330
They can help.

225
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,590
Who's "they"?

226
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,110
My wife.

227
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,230
And my wife too.

228
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,910
No way,

229
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,510
that makes things harder.

230
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,630
It's already tough getting rid of one,

231
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,150
now you want to get rid of three?

232
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,610
It's the safest option.

233
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,250
Is it really?

234
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,510
In the middle of a cold winter night,

235
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,310
where are they supposed to go?

236
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,810
What do you mean?

237
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:04,570
Mom.

238
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,790
Yeah, Yang Tao is coming back.

239
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,520
Spend New Year at your place?

240
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,000
Sure.

241
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:17,880
Okay.

242
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,790
I'll send you

243
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,430
a lamb leg later

244
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,330
so we can all eat together.

245
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:24,690
Okay.

246
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,710
I just called

247
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,710
my mom.

248
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,430
Since Yang Tao is coming back,

249
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,270
we're spending

250
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,000
New Year's at my mom's place.

251
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,410
Min will probably be there too.

252
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,440
Okay.

253
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,790
I can be at home alone.

254
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:58,740
Well,

255
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,750
can you call my mom

256
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,020
on New Year's Eve?

257
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,030
I can't.

258
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:12,730
Stop!

259
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,640
What?

260
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,810
Why can't you call her?

261
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,950
I don't understand.

262
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,330
Why can't you call her?

263
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,070
It's common courtesy

264
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:35,950
to call the elderly

265
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,460
during the festivals.

266
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,560
Yang Songbai, are you sick?

267
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,430
I'm not sick.

268
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,910
I'm sick. What's wrong?

269
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,820
Take medicine if you're sick.

270
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,580
No.

271
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,950
I can't afford it!

272
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:49,750
I can't take it!

273
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,910
I have no money!

274
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,430
Your brother still

275
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,930
hasn't paid me back!

276
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,730
So

277
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,990
this is all because of that?

278
00:16:58,990 --> 00:16:59,630
Yeah!

279
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,350
Yang,

280
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,440
my brother only borrowed

281
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,480
2,000 yuan from you.

282
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:02,950
Is it that big a deal?

283
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,550
You talk about it every day.

284
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,390
Of course,

285
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,550
it's a big deal.

286
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,210
2,000 yuan is still money!

287
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,390
We all have to live, don't we?

288
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,310
What about your ex-wife?

289
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,630
Did she pay back the money

290
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,310
she borrowed?

291
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,710
When will she pay back?

292
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,150
She borrowed it because

293
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,950
she was going through a tough time.

294
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,640
Right? She can't pay it back right now.

295
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,150
These are two different things.

296
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,310
What kind of logic is that?

297
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,349
You're willing to help your ex-wife

298
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,069
when she's in trouble,

299
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,990
but when my brother's in trouble,

300
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:25,990
you refuse to help.

301
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,270
Hu Yue.

302
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,890
Are you trying to start a fight?

303
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,020
You want to fight?

304
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,260
Do you?

305
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,340
Go ahead!

306
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,710
I'm not afraid of you.

307
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,590
Every time I bring up my ex, it never ends!

308
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,400
I've had enough of you!

309
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,310
You know?

310
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,050
We can argue,

311
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,440
but don't drag the kid into this.

312
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,970
Wait... wait for me.

313
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,250
Min.

314
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,080
Why are you going to Min?

315
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,630
Call your two aunts to come here

316
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,290
now.

317
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,030
Your mom's about to fight with me.

318
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,290
She's really upset.

319
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:05,980
Hurry, hurry.

320
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,030
Calm down.

321
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,360
I am calm.

322
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,370
So, you want to fight?

323
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,110
Alright, go ahead.

324
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,710
You're a bully!

325
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,230
Why are you still up?

326
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,510
I'm not sleepy.

327
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:01,860
Have some water.

328
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,920
Where is Li Si?

329
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,560
He went to bed early.

330
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,150
He's been acting strange these days,

331
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,150
not talking to anyone.

332
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,550
He didn't even answer Miaomiao's calls.

333
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,830
Did he cause trouble?

334
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,750
What trouble?

335
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,150
He stays home every day during the holiday.

336
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,190
He wants a beating.

337
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,240
Don't go easy on him.

338
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,820
Go to bed.

339
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,500
I'm not sleepy.

340
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,630
Don't you have

341
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,790
anything to tell me?

342
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,510
What?

343
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,110
Your old flame

344
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,190
I met today.

345
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,750
Why bring her up?

346
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,610
That was so long ago, Lingling.

347
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,720
I heard her husband passed away early,

348
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,950
and she's raising a kid all by herself.

349
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,940
It's not easy.

350
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,940
You didn't help her out?

351
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,050
How could I help?

352
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,220
It's got nothing to do with me.

353
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,910
I had no idea.

354
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,550
We haven't been in touch.

355
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,270
If you hadn't mentioned it, I wouldn't

356
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,950
have known her situation.

357
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,070
Her husband passed away

358
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,570
and she has a kid?

359
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,550
Why are you so nervous?

360
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,480
Look at the sweat on your forehead.

361
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,600
Oh my,

362
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,830
stop making fun of me.

363
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,030
Why would I be nervous?

364
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:20,630
Why...

365
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,600
should I be nervous?

366
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,130
Turn off the TV.

367
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:42,840
Dahai,

368
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,750
do you remember what you told me

369
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,010
when we got married?

370
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,030
I'd never let you down,

371
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,220
no matter what.

372
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,680
For the rest of our lives,

373
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,150
I'd say whatever you want to hear,

374
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,480
and do whatever you say.

375
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,300
You'd say whatever I want to hear?

376
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,390
Well, now I want to

377
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,790
hear about Bai Shuang.

378
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,230
You're still drinking coffee this late?

379
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:29,990
I'll get it.

380
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,590
Miaomiao.

381
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,190
I'll go.

382
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,350
Coming.

383
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,030
Miaomiao.

384
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,150
What?

385
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,070
Aunt.

386
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,550
What's wrong?

387
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,200
My mom...

388
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,470
My mom and Yang are fighting again.

389
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,350
Hurry and get Aunt Ling

390
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,550
to go check on them.

391
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,950
That Yang Songbai!

392
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,610
Looks like I need to step in.

393
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,670
Call Ling and tell her

394
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,600
to go to Hu Yue's place right now.

395
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,070
Min, give me your house key.

396
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,590
Here.

397
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,440
-Geez.
-Mom.

398
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,100
Mom.

399
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,520
Put on your coat.

400
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,300
It's cold outside!

401
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,350
Miaomiao.

402
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,430
Well, you should

403
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,640
call Aunt Lingling.

404
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,150
I...

405
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,350
You make the call.

406
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,550
Answer the phone.

407
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,110
The phone is ringing. Hurry.

408
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:10,870
Who is it?

409
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,400
Who's calling this late?

410
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,420
Hello, you-

411
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,740
Now?

412
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,790
-Let go!
-Don't smash it.

413
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,990
This is expensive!

414
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,270
I bought it anyway!

415
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,750
No, no. Give it to me!

416
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,750
Yang Songbai, what are you doing?

417
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,590
Now you're smashing stuff?

418
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,200
Are you going to hit her next?

419
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,600
-Daiyu.
-Don't cry.

420
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,450
-Yang.
-You're here.

421
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,780
Why are you smashing things?

422
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,300
So what?

423
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,290
Why are you here?

424
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,190
This is between

425
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,030
me and Hu Yue.

426
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,890
What does it have to do with you?

427
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,550
Let me tell you,

428
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,390
the reason Hu Yue and I are like this

429
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,610
is all because of you, Jia Daiyu,

430
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,470
and Niu Lingling!

431
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,530
What did you say?

432
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,550
Say it again!

433
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,270
-Lingling!
-What did you say?

434
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,000
I've put up with you for years.

435
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,310
You're sick!

436
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,150
So you've hated us all along, huh?

437
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,430
Lingling, you're finally here!

438
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,360
Let me tell you,

439
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,670
we're Hu Yue's family.

440
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,430
As long as we're around,

441
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,310
you can't bully her anymore.

442
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,240
That's not the...

443
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,950
Who are you?

444
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,430
You're bullying me?

445
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,190
Are you a man or not?

446
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,470
Yue, listen to me,

447
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,440
no matter what,

448
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,100
you're still a couple, right?

449
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,950
You have to live your life, right?

450
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,230
You've been together for so many years,

451
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,630
and he just has this bad temper...

452
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,590
She can't live like this anymore.

453
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,390
Come on, Hu Yue,

454
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,480
Come to my house.

455
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,370
-Let's go.
-No.

456
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,760
No one's going anywhere.

457
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,840
Where are you taking her?

458
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,220
She is my wife.

459
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,300
Who are you?

460
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,590
I'm telling you,

461
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,390
I've put up with you

462
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,720
long enough.

463
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,790
Yang,

464
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,740
what's that supposed to mean?

465
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,670
What do you mean by

466
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,630
"put up with you"?

467
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,830
Who?

468
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,180
Me

469
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,710
or Daiyu?

470
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,750
Who exactly

471
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,310
have you been putting up with?

472
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,950
Listen,

473
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,270
you're not leaving this room

474
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,700
until you explain it.

475
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,270
I'm talking about your wife.

476
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:54,810
So what?

477
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,740
And you, Niu Lingling!

478
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,490
None of you

479
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,300
are any good!

480
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,870
Okay, thank you.

481
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,930
We haven't seen each other in 20 years.

482
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,130
23 years, actually.

483
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,120
You've been doing well, right?

484
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:20,860
It's alright.

485
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,950
You've been promoted.

486
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:26,870
At least you didn't waste

487
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,470
all the hardship you went through back then.

488
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,030
Don't mention it

489
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,670
Just a minor director.

490
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,190
I heard you're about to be promoted again.

491
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,270
Congrats.

492
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,720
Thanks.

493
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,750
Aren't you hot?

494
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,070
Aren't you hot?

495
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,630
Not really, I'm fine.

496
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,140
You're doing well too.

497
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:05,980
Yeah.

498
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,290
What about the kid?

499
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,830
The kid's in university in Guangzhou,

500
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,130
senior year.

501
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,910
Already in university?

502
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,070
Thanks to you,

503
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,920
you're good at parenting.

504
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,490
The kid takes after you.

505
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,160
But you didn't come here

506
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,160
so late just for tea, did you?

507
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,690
The heat's pretty strong in here.

508
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,340
I...

509
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,000
I just want to know...

510
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,920
is the kid mine?

511
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:24,820
Daiyu, you...

512
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,030
You can argue all you want.

513
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,110
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Let go!

514
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,590
Daiyu!

515
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,350
What kind of people are you?

516
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,050
We don't have to waste time talking to you.

517
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:31,890
Leave him alone!

518
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,380
Yang, just say something nice.

519
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,740
The kid looks like you, doesn't she?

520
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,390
Bai Shuang, I'm sorry.

521
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,340
I was a jerk.

522
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,800
Back then, I just wanted...

523
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,280
But don't worry.

524
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,670
I'm not the kind of man

525
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,270
without responsibility.

526
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,650
I've already let you down.

527
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,310
I won't let the child down.

528
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,690
After all these years,

529
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,230
I finally hear you admit

530
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,590
you let me down.

531
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,700
Yes,

532
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,080
I let you down.

533
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,440
I...

534
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,410
I couldn't admit it.

535
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,110
I just wanted a stable job,

536
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,570
to stay at the oil field.

537
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,160
I wanted to change my fate.

538
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,560
Because I was too poor.

539
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,480
I was terrified of being poor.

540
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:56,750
I had no chance.

541
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,630
Do you understand, Bai Shuang?

542
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,830
I had no chance.

543
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,950
I didn't have a chance back then.

544
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,320
I understand.

545
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,730
That's why I agreed.

546
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,270
I didn't make it hard for you

547
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,290
and let you go.

548
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,470
But

549
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,430
I didn't know

550
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,670
you were pregnant.

551
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,990
Isn't my daughter pretty?

552
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,650
Yes.

553
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,270
Do you think

554
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:43,790
you could have

555
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,270
such a pretty daughter?

556
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,340
Actually,

557
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,630
she has nothing

558
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,080
to do with you.

559
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,160
After we broke up,

560
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,070
I went back to my hometown.

561
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,870
My brother and sister-in-law

562
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,710
were buried in a landslide.

563
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,900
Only my sister-in-law was rescued,

564
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,230
but when they got her

565
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,670
to the hospital,

566
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,720
they saved the baby,

567
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,320
but she didn't make it.

568
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,530
That baby

569
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,280
is her.

570
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,210
I've never told anyone about this.

571
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,180
She still doesn't know.

572
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,110
Later,

573
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,670
I took her back to the oil field.

574
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,120
I told everyone

575
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,500
I got married back home,

576
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,190
and my husband worked out of town.

577
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,380
Then

578
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,430
as she grew up,

579
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,410
I got scared that one day

580
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,070
she'd ask about her father.

581
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,590
So I told her

582
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,160
her father had passed,

583
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,920
and that I was a widow.

584
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,890
That's how we've made it

585
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,910
through 22 years,

586
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,310
relying on each other.

587
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:25,910
A child

588
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,150
needs a mother

589
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,960
to feel loved in this life.

590
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,260
Right?

591
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,710
Have you thought about getting married?

592
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,750
Why would I?

593
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,030
I already have a daughter.

594
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,150
Her name

595
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,590
is Bai Qingyun.

596
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,490
Qing is my brother's name,

597
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,610
and Yun is my sister-in-law's.

598
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,030
She looks

599
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,580
just like my brother

600
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,400
with those eyes,

601
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,770
and her mouth

602
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:10,090
is exactly like my sister-in-law's.

603
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,540
We're doing just fine.

604
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,400
You don't need to feel guilty anymore.

605
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,350
Now

606
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,440
you've got a great wife

607
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,670
and a good son.

608
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,410
Everything's fine.

609
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,310
We all made the right choices.

610
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,870
I can't hold on anymore.

611
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,830
Why are these

612
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,530
three women so tough?

613
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,220
Just hang in there for a while.

614
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,200
Open the door!

615
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,840
You're finally back!

616
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:54,760
Honey!

617
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,470
I'm gonna kill you!

618
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,070
Wife, I'm sorry.

619
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:01,830
If you were sorry,

620
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,740
why'd it take you so long to come?

621
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,270
Niu Lingling, I'm sorry!

622
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,600
Are you out of your mind?

623
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,070
Get lost!

624
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,840
Li Dahai.

625
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:24,950
Did you

626
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,940
betray my mom?

627
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,760
Get lost!

628
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,660
Get off!

629
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,030
What did you say?

630
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,310
I said get off!

631
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,270
-Come.
-Go ahead!

632
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,480
Go ahead, hit me!

633
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,590
I've known about your first love for long.

634
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,310
You got drunk in the middle of the night,

635
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,840
crying over her picture.

636
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:47,590
I kept it from my mom

637
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,510
because I didn't want her

638
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,230
to get hurt.

639
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,070
But then

640
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,110
that woman came!

641
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,910
How could you do that to my mom?

642
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,110
What are you

643
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,620
talking about?

644
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,750
Stop pretending!

645
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,410
Yang told me everything!

646
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,760
Hu told me too!

647
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,469
Stay out of grown-up matters, kid.

648
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,530
-Tell me!
-Go home.

649
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,199
Did you meet Bai Shuang?

650
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:13,889
Yes, I did.

651
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:15,030
So you admit it.

652
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,550
You ditched your first love for wealth,

653
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,190
and you only stayed with my mom

654
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,449
to climb the ladder!

655
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,190
My mom's face,

656
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,120
my mom's mind,

657
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:22,190
all wasted on you

658
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,070
to help you succeed.

659
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,199
You meeting her is a betrayal of my mom!

660
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,670
This thing

661
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,310
has nothing

662
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,679
to do with you.

663
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,920
Who do you think you are?

664
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:31,909
Get lost!

665
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:32,850
Li Dahai!

666
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:34,270
What else can you do

667
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,330
besides hitting me or yelling at me?

668
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,270
Li Si,

669
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,130
what else can you do

670
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,510
besides wasting money, causing trouble,

671
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,040
and coming last in class?

672
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,440
I love my mom!

673
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:43,900
I love your mom too!

674
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,280
I love my mom for real!

675
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,880
Who's faking it?

676
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,770
Who's faking it?

677
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,230
What do you want from me?

678
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,080
Listen to me, Li Si.

679
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,360
If you truly love your mom,

680
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,070
you wouldn't still be such a

681
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,200
disappointment.

682
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,430
If you really cared

683
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,560
as much as you say,

684
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,750
you wouldn't still

685
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,880
be a failure at 17.

686
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:05,990
Let go!

687
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,400
Be good and go home now.

688
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,130
Go.

689
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:43,880
Why are you here?

690
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,230
I was passing by

691
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,230
and saw your lights were still on,

692
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,090
so I stopped by.

693
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,760
Let's go inside. It's cold outside.

694
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,640
No.

695
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,150
The sea breeze is quite comfortable.

696
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,410
I'm just taking a walk.

697
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,670
I just went back to grab a coat.

698
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,600
I didn't expect you to walk so fast.

699
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,110
I didn't ask you to accompany me!

700
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,630
You're not familiar with the road here.

701
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,350
If you fall into the sea, no one will catch you.

702
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,680
Do you think I'm scared?

703
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,660
Let go! Let go!

704
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,350
Let go!

705
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,860
You scared me.

706
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,120
Did your parents treat you badly?

707
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:38,210
No.

708
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,830
But...

709
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,590
one's always busy running

710
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,550
a business,

711
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,450
and the other's busy working as a leader in the oil field.

712
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,720
My mom always says,

713
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:50,700
"Son,

714
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,430
do you have enough pocket money?

715
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,350
Need more?"

716
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,130
And my dad always says,

717
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,270
"What trouble have you

718
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,670
gotten into this time?"

719
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,330
They're happy together,

720
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,520
but too busy to care about me.

721
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,510
I've barely had

722
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,770
a home-cooked meal.

723
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,550
I don't even have parents.

724
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,670
But you have such a great grandpa.

725
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,720
And a big brother too.

726
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,690
My big brother's great.

727
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,540
He's coming home this New Year.

728
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,350
I haven't seen him in two years.

729
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,860
Look at you, your whole face lights up

730
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,320
when you talk about him.

731
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:29,930
It's nice

732
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,470
to have a good brother.

733
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,330
Hu has a great brother too.

734
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:37,220
But I only have Miaomiao since I was young.

735
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,070
Honestly,

736
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,910
I'm kinda jealous of you all.

737
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,390
I don't have any friends.

738
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,770
What are you saying?

739
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,360
Miaomiao's always said

740
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,020
we're good friends, right?

741
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,090
Qiang Xiaowa,

742
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,670
do you all think

743
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,760
I'm a loser?

744
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,670
What's success, anyway?

745
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,670
No matter how hard I try,

746
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,470
I can't live a life like yours.

747
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,600
Even without success,

748
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,290
you can still be happy.

749
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,860
Now I kind of understand

750
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,850
why Miaomiao likes you.

751
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,290
Compared to us,

752
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,080
you're sensible and responsible.

753
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,410
You live with purpose,

754
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,480
like a real man.

755
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,280
Unlike me,

756
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,450
always causing trouble,

757
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,020
never doing anything right.

758
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,540
I spend only my parents' money.

759
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:38,990
I think my dad

760
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,150
was right today.

761
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,760
Why should he respect me?

762
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,570
I'm just a failure.

763
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,990
He has one hope for me:

764
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,690
To work in the oil field.

765
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,720
But I don't want that.

766
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,210
I don't want to suffer.

767
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,860
But I can't admit it.

768
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,080
That'd be too embarrassing.

769
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:00,890
What's embarrassing about that?

770
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,510
No one wants to suffer.

771
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,480
You know, I often want to

772
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,030
work in the outside world.

773
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,970
I just want to prove myself.

774
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,750
I want to

775
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,510
show I could

776
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,980
earn money on my own.

777
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,750
But that's not

778
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,080
the right way to do it.

779
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:19,910
You don't know how dangerous

780
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:20,970
the world can be.

781
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,310
Your life's pretty good now.

782
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,150
Just enjoy it,

783
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,210
don't mess it up.

784
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,020
Do you sometimes

785
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,730
get annoyed with me too?

786
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,390
I used to.

787
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,520
But now,

788
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,680
I think you're nice.

789
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,310
You came to me in the middle of the night

790
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,770
just to complain to me?

791
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,000
What complain?

792
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:48,120
I was just wandering around.

793
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:48,880
Hey,

794
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,270
how about

795
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,890
giving me some dried fish?

796
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,800
I can't leave empty-handed.

797
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,280
I'm leaving.

798
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,860
Who are you?

799
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,350
Get down.

800
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,110
Go!

801
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,170
Go!

802
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:19,840
He's just

803
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,730
-a relative of mine.
-Yuan Yong.

804
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:21,770
You are Yuan Yong!

805
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,180
-Stop!
-He's just a relative.

806
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:23,950
Let go of me!

807
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,030
Let go of me!

808
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,890
Yuan Shanqing!

809
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,470
I know he's Yuan Yong!

810
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,760
Why did you stop me?

811
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,680
He's a fugitive.

812
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,040
He can do anything.

813
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,120
I'm not afraid!

814
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,620
I'll call the police now.

815
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,380
Yaya,

816
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,260
I beg you.

817
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,650
Don't call the police.

818
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:45,960
Just pretend

819
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,520
you didn't see anything.

820
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,620
Pretend you didn't come here today,

821
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,460
okay?

822
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,380
Yaya, please,

823
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,040
I'm begging you.

824
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,300
Do you know you're

825
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,590
harboring a criminal?

826
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,400
He's a wanted man!

827
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,080
But he's also my dad.

828
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,210
Please, Yaya,

829
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,990
I'm begging you.

830
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,860
I'm begging you.

831
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,500
Hu's mom didn't forgive Yang.

832
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,270
She said Yang always treated others

833
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:37,410
better than his own family.

834
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:38,520
He'd do anything to help a friend,

835
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,850
even if it meant fighting with his wife.

836
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:41,790
Li Si's mom

837
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:42,650
forgave Li.

838
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:43,760
She said

839
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:46,070
Bai Shuang deserves to leave a place in Li's heart.

840
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,670
That night, my dad talked to

841
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,390
my mom for a long time.

842
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,640
I don't know what they said.

843
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,270
Maybe they remembered

844
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,350
their first lovers.

845
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,510
It wasn't until many years later that I understood.

846
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,970
The person who loved you when you were young

847
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,950
will always be

848
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,810
worth holding in your heart.
