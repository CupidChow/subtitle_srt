You're my best bro, indeed.

By the way, well,

18
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,950

to Director Huang.

Last time in Beijing,

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,550
I listened to his presentation.

22
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,210
It's really beneficial to me.

23
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:35,829
Okay.

24
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,380
How about this?

I'll treat Director Huang to a meal

Yes.

I just heard

34
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,470
you said you'll treat them to a meal.

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,460
Can't you

00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,910
afford a train ticket or what?

40
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,110
No, well...

41
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,590
You may spend a lot

42
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,750
in Beijing.

43
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,170
Will Dahai go with you?

44
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,950
No. They...

47
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,610
It'll be great for them to complete the task

by working overtime.

49
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,630
Then how can you

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,430
Well, should I ask for leave and go with you?

52

No need.

00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,990
He can go with me.

Yang Songbai is not nice normally,

56

Songbai

58
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,070
is just a rough man.

59
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,660
He's not good at expressing himself.

60
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,040
But he harbors no evil intentions.

61
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,550
People who harbor evil intentions are few.

62
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:50,990
As a man,

63
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,750
you should

-Yes. -You should be good to your wife.

Yes, yes, yes. That's right.

67
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,880
Actually, the main conflict

68
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,490
in Songbai's family

69
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,550
lies in the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, right?

70
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,510
If a man

71
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,420
can't figure out a way

72

to take care of

73
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,940
such relationship,

74
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,270
trivialities can also become big matters.

75
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,020
He just lacks such a kind of wisdom.

76
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,149
Then you should impart your wisdom

77
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,310
to him.

78
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,070
Sure.

This pizza is called Durian for the Rest of Your Life.

00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,300
It's made of durian.

84
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,700
It's delicious.

85
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,150
You should eat it while it's hot.

86

Here.

87
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,150
What's this smell?

88
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,750
A sweet smell.

89
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,550
Do you know how much it costs?

90
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,250
Eat it while it's hot.

91
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,580
It tastes good this way.

92
00:04:58,909 --> 00:04:59,550
Try it.

93
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,290
How is it?

94
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,100
It's so delicious.

95
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,740
Try it. Try it.

96
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:20,820
It's so delicious.

97
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,420
Okay.

98
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,230
What do you think?

99
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,870
Just go to school normally without worrying about anything.

The director of the hospital in Beijing

101
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,490
is my dad's senior.

102
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,409
The hospital director was his teacher back then.

103
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:46,510
There will be no problem

104
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,110
if he takes Zi for a check-up.

105
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,830
I'm not worried.

106
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,350
I just think...

107
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:53,909
I know.

108
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,260
That's why you need to study harder

109
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,220

110
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,450
Uncle.

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,070
Yuan Shanqing asked me to thank you.

112
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,680
For what?

113
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,550
You and Uncle Cheng

114
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,660
are going to take Zi to Beijing for surgery.

115
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,510
You're not her relatives or friends.

116
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,300
Yet you're still willing to help her.

117
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,150
No need to thank me.

118
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,550
It's what I should do.

119
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,830
Yes.

120
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,510
Your uncle's kindness to others

121
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,950
is what he should do.

122
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,780
He should be nice to others.

123
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,070
I'm not others.

124
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,750
I'm your wife.

125
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,710
When will you

126
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,590
treat me like that?

127
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,050
-Let me... -Mom. Mom. Mom.

128
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,210
I have something to discuss with you.

129
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,250
Go ahead.

130
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,980
My personal stereo doesn't work.

131
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,080
Then you should take it out for repair.

132
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,430
It has been used for years.

133
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,350
It can't be fixed.

134
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,700
It would be better if it can't be fixed.

135
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,430
You won't listen to it anymore.

136
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,190
You're a sophomore now.

137
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,070
You should focus on your studies.

138
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,950
Listen to those Hong Kong and Taiwan songs every day

139
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,030
won't do you kids

140
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,350
any good.

141
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,240
What do you mean by doing no good?

142
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,350
It won't affect my studies.

143
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,410
Why shouldn't I listen to such songs?

144
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,860
What are the lyrics of the songs?

145
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,430
They're all about romantic love.

146
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,590
How can such songs do you any good?

147
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,520
Tell me about it.

148
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,030
Look at you.

149
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,520
You're narrow-minded.

150
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,990
Those are literary and artistic works.

151
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,820
Love is a permanent topic

152
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,150
for human beings.

153
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,950
Do you know what love is?

154
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,650
Young people can also have their love.

155
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,970
It's different now.

156
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,410
Don't always apply your way

157
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,830
to cope with the current life.

158
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,080
People have to move forward and make progress.

159
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,210
What is progress?

160
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,860
Does progress mean talking back to your parents

161
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,180
when you're home?

162
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,750
Does it mean you can do whatever you want

163
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,200
and do something out of line,

164
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,659
and you can do things that don't act your age?

165
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,790
Have I been...

166
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,850
Listen to me.

167
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,670
You should have your meal now.

168
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,790
The dishes are getting cold.

169
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,650
Hurry and eat your meal.

170
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,270
Dad,

171
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,600
thank you.

172
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,270
You

173
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,030
should thank yourself.

174
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,630
Why do I

175
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,180
have a sudden stomach ache?

176
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,710
I'm going to use the bathroom.

177
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,030
M-My stomach...

178
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:32,610
Sit down.

179
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,309
Let's get straight to the point.

180
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:39,980
I want to talk to you

181
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,309
about your puppy love with Yuan Shanqing.

182
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,310
It's not like that.

183
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,550
Didn't we talk about this before?

184
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,950
It was before.

185
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,070
You...

186
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,430
You skipped classes and organized donations.

187
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,950
Quantity change has led to quality change, right?

188
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,620
A fundamental change has taken place, Cheng Yaya.

189
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,430
Mom,

190
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,070
quantity change does not always lead to quality change.

191
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,070
Take my sister and Si for an example.

192
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,990
They were engaged when they were three.

193
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,000
Now they're 17.

194
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,310
It's been 14 years.

195
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,510
Nothing has changed.

196
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,550
Do you think

197
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,870
they will get married?

198
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,430
They'll get married...

199
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,630
It's okay...

200
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,490
- If they'll get married... -Mom.

201
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,420
You can't change your subject.

202
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,640
Don't get misled by Cheng Yaya.

203
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,990
Don't you know

204
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,190
what's going on between Li Si and me?

205
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,590
We're just good friends.

206
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,160
What smell is that? It stinks.

207
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,090
Cheng Miaomiao, did you eat poop?

208
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,350
Do I stink?

209
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,060
Yes.

210
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,380
Mom,

211
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,710
what I ate

212
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,060
is definitely not poop.

213
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,110
Anyway, what's going on between Cheng Yaya and Yuan Shanqing

214
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,150
is fundamentally different

215
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,350
from that between Li Si and me.

216
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,530
Then what about Qiang Xiaowa?

217
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,590
We are good friends too.

218
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,420
What's wrong?

219
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,070
Really?

220
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,450
Each of you has some stories, huh?

221
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,560
I'll...

222
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,800
I'll break your legs!

223
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,270
-Don't! -Each of you is busy!

224
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,190
Hurry up.

225
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,470
Open the door!

226
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,430
-Open it! Do you hear me? -What are you doing in my room?

227
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,190
-I'll count! -You should go out.

228
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:12,710
One.

229
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,750
-Your wooden door is stronger than mine. -Two.

230
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,010
-Three! -So annoying.

231
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,880
It's coming.

232
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,350
-Let's go. -Let me get it for you.

233
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,000
Let me get it for you.

234
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,510
Okay.

235
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,510
Let's take the bus. Let's take the bus.

236
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,950
Let's take the big bus.

237
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,270
Let's go.

238
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,070
Okay, let's go.

239
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:30,950
Let's get on the bus.

240
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,350
Okay, thank you.

241
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,510
Let's go.

242
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,750
Yu, I'll put it here.

243
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,860
You can put it wherever you want.

244
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,400
Don't you need to work?

245
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,090
Why do you keep coming here all the time?

246
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,130
I miss you.

247
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,440
I'm here to visit you.

248
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,280
That's nonsense.

249
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,630
Did you break up

250
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,760
with Wang Chanchan?

251
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,740
You made a scene in her workplace

252
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,710
and got punished due to the violation of discipline.

253
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,670
You got kicked out by Mom,

254
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,590
so you came to my place for shelter?

255
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,850
Did our mom call you?

256
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,780
The old lady's got a big mouth.

257
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,870
She just can't get rid of these bad habits

258
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,000
after so many years.

259
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,790
She likes being exaggerating

260
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,710
and reading things into what I did.

261
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,220
A triviality

262
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,720
can be interpreted as a serious crime

263
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,560
by her.

264
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,380
Is what you did

265
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,790
a triviality?

266
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,380
Yu, don't listen to what Mom said to you.

267
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,230
Wang Chanchan and I

268
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,450
broke up peacefully.

269
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,620
We are both well-educated,

270
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,710
civilized young people.

271
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,300
Right?

272
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,470
I went to her workplace

273
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,540
in an attempt

274
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,150
to officially say goodbye to her.

275
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,480
Step aside. Step aside.

276
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,790
But... But the guard

277
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,150
refused to let me in no matter what I said.

278
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,310
I said I was looking for my girlfriend,

279
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,590
and I was not here for him.

280
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,310
But he

281
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,590
saw himself as a man with authority.

282
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,670
He used his limited power to prevent me from getting in,

283
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,240
saying

284
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,230
he would not let me

285
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,380
harass the workers of their company.

286
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,110
How could this become a harassment?

287
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,270
Well. We're all from the Oilfield.

288
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,510
We're in the same boat.

289
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,190
How could he

290
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,230
be so cliquish?

291
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,980
Before I finished my words,

292
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,110
he was holding a mop.

293
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,030
How can I let him do what he wants?

294
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,070
With a quick move forward,

295
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,070
I argued with him.

296
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:13,790
He took the mop

297
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,670
and waved it at me.

298
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,800
Then I seized the time to lie down all of a sudden.

299
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,330
Let's see who would suffer.

300
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,730
Jia Baoshan, look at you.

301
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,510
You're an adult.

302
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,310
Look

303
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,390
what you have done.

304
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,430
Each of your relationships ended badly.

305
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,190
Each time you got a new job,

306
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,590
you got punished as well.

307
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,750
You haven't built a family,

308
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,870
and nor have you established your career.

309
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,070
Don't you feel ashamed?

310
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,110
Why would I feel ashamed?

311
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,920
Well, which law says

312
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,550
if one doesn't get married in his thirties,

313
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,880
he should feel ashamed?

314
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,840
Yu, marriage

315
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,550
should be built

316
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,190
on the basis of love, right?

317
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,210
I can't just find a girl I met on the street

318
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,800
to get married to her, right?

319
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,240
Then I'll ask others to give me money as a wedding gift.

320
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,670
This is not how we should enhance the social construction of ideological infrastructure.

321
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,310
Right?

322
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,430
Yu, over the past 30 years,

323
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,120
I've observed disciplines and obeyed the laws, and I'm an optimistic, open-minded man.

324
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,030
I'm loyal to my friends

325
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,340
and filial to my parents.

326
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,600
I'm one of the young people

327
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,590
who have an excellent performance

328
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,550
in society.

329
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,430
But for so many years,

330
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,740
they just

331
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,910
haven't noticed my shining points

332
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,430
in my work.

333
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,320
Besides,

334
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,840
I don't want to be a leader.

335
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,590
It's hard for you to work for someone else now.

336
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,430
Any company that offers you a leading post

337
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,370
will be crazy.

338
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,350
Two days' stay is enough.

339
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,030
You should leave when the time is due.

340
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,100
My home is too small

341
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,590
to accommodate you.

342
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,180
Well.

343
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,450
Can you inherit the good qualities from Mom?

344
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,870
Brother.

345
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,180
Brother, the floor has been mopped.

346
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,390
Aren't we on duty today?

347
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,860
Who did it for us?

348
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,310
Yuan Shanqing.

349
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,590
She told the class monitor today

350
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,320
that she'll take on responsibility

351
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,370
for doing what a student-on-duty

352
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,230
should do.

353
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,870
The pain and happiness...

354
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,520
Mr. Qiao gave it to me.

355
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,250
Here you are.

356
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:40,710
However, fate

357
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,710
is often designed for ordinary people.

358
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,830
As time goes by,

359
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,360
what happened in the past will be washed away.

360
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:49,840
Delicious.

361
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:07,740
I just saw

362
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,070
that Qiang Xiaowa and Cheng Miaomiao

363
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,530
walked side by side, laughing and chatting.

364
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,170
Is there something going on between them?

365
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,100
Are they dating?

366
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,750
Zhu Chao,

367
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,660
you are the class monitor.

368
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,150
Do you need me to teach you this?

369
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,870
You can't just focus on appearances.

370
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,430
You have to see beyond appearances to understand the essence,

371
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,270
understand?

372
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,030
Miaomiao, Qiang Xiaowa, and I

373
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,190
are best friends.

374
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,790
It's not like what you think.

375
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,510
What? Who's dating whom?

376
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,470
Xiaoxue,

377
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,030
don't get so excited

378
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,190
when it comes to such a topic.

379
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:41,710
You're a student.

380
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,620
Shouldn't you focus on your studies

381
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,150
instead of dating someone?

382
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,890
You're so ignorant, you know?

383
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,060
I'm not.

384
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,500
I just care about my classmates.

385
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,110
What's wrong with that?

386
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,070
You should care more about

387
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:50,790
when Xu Wenwu

388
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,780
will talk to you.

389
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,270
Since you went to the basketball court

390
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,470
to cheer for him,

391
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:54,950
you should have at least

392
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,810
bought him a bottle of soft drink.

393
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,430
None of your business.

394
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,230
I don't have enough pocket money

395
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,270
for myself.

396
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,000
Why would I buy him a soft drink?

397
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,320
Look. Look.

398
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,670
She kept saying

399
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,510
how she likes

400
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,070
and admires him.

401
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,210
None is real.

402
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,550
When it comes to pocket money,

403
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,880
she shows her true form.

404
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,030
It's just about romantic love. They have no ambition.

405
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,290
What is your ambition?

406
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,240
To be a factory manager.

407
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,900
Qiang Xiaowa.

408
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,480
Were you laughing at me just now?

409
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,470
Was I?

410
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,970
It's obvious to see.

411
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,080
Do you think it's funny

412
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,740
for me to be a factory manager?

413
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,150
Shouldn't you aspire

414
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,000
to marry Cheng Miaomiao?

415
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,230
That's not my ambition.

416
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,430
That's the truth.

417
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,710
It was approved by our two families.

418
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,070
Our marriage has been arranged.

419
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,150
Getting married is just a matter of time for us.

420
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,950
Do you get it? Do you understand?

421
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,270
You won't marry me.

422
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,800
I don't need to understand.

423
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:50,820
Look.

424
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,290
You can't say that.

425
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:52,830
When the time comes,

426
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,850
you would say I don't treat you as my best bro.

427
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,650
You're going to be my groomsman.

428
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,030
And you, Zhu.

429
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,310
Seize your time to lose some weight.

430
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,060
Otherwise,

431
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,960
you won't be able to fit into groomsmen's attire.

432
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,600
Well...

433
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,030
It won't be long.

434
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,190
Graduation is just around the corner.

435
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,839
You should think about

436
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:06,859
how to graduate.

437
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,030
Well.

438
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,910
What do you mean by saying that?

439
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,630
Look at him.

440
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,200
I think

441
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,470
graduating from school is much more difficult than being a factory manager.

442
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,020
You...

443
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,000
Shanqing is at our home.

444
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:25,460
Okay, wait a minute.

445
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,220
Shanqing,

446
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,960
your uncle wants to talk to you.

447
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,640
Here. Here.

448
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,510
Hello, Uncle.

449
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,600
I know.

450
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,390
Zi didn't annoy you, did she?

451
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,520
I'm glad to hear that.

452
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,540
I'm relieved now.

453
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,940
I was so worried about her since she's in an unfamiliar place.

454
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,030
Okay.

455
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,590
Thank you, Uncle.

456
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,520
And please thank Uncle Yang for me.

457
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:51,980
Goodbye, Uncle.

458
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,270
Aunt.

459
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,490
-Hello? Hello? -How is it?

460
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,550
-Be careful. -Uncle said...

461
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,830
-If it goes well... -Okay.

462
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,730
The surgery is likely to be performed next week.

463
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:00,960
Dad is the best.

464
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,960
If I had known it,

465
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,190
I would have come earlier.

466
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,190
I have a buddy in Beijing.

467
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,710
I'm planning to go to Beijing.

468
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,430
Then you should seize your time.

469
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,950
Go to Beijing to find your buddy.

470
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:09,870
You'd better settle down there

471
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,000
and don't come back.

472
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,220
Your mom

473
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,760
is just like your grandma.

474
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,230
Daiyu, Daiyu, well...

475
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,710
-What's wrong? -Something happened!

476
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,900
Calm down. Calm down.

477
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,270
What's wrong? Calm down.

478
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,800
We've lost some items!

479
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,480
Look.

480
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,030
Well... Well...

481
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,670
What should we do?

482
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,430
Call the team.

483
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,110
Slow down! Slow down!

484
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,230
Slow down! Slow down!

485
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,250
[Four Seasons]

486
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,310
Well.

487
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,670
There are only two female workers

488
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,670
in the afforestation team.

489
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,270
Ma is pregnant.

490
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,430
Well, Leader.

491
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,340
I'm not shirking my responsibility.

492
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,190
We don't have any guards

493
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,830
in the flower garden.

494
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,390
Besides, we didn't lose anything

495
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,120
when we were working.

496
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,630
You can't blame us

497
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,470
for that.

498
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,760
It doesn't make sense.

499
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,450
Then you should deduct my salary!

500
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,230
Daiyu, you don't have to offend the leader

501
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,140
for this.

502
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,720
Well, you...

503
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,790
You don't know how sarcastic he was.

504
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,590
As if

505
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,330
we stole the things.

506
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,440
Everyone can get into there.

507
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:48,970
Gosh.

508
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,640
Didn't we tell him before?

509
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,210
What did he say?

510
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,880
There's nothing valuable

511
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,460
in the flower garden.

512
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,110
Now that flowers

513
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,190
and fertilizers were stolen,

514
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,990
he thought he lost a lot of money.

515
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,470
My salary is not enough for him to deduct.

516
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,300
Does he think he has great power?

517
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,090
Why wasn't he on duty?

518
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,780
He's a leader.

519
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,460
We can't give orders to him.

520
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,310
He's just a team leader of the afforestation team.

521
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,790
It's not an important title.

522
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,190
What kind of leader is he?

523
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,270
It's better than us grassroots workers in the factory.

524
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,630
What should we do now?

525
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,520
What should we do?

526
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
He said we should take turns on duty.

527
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,460
I... I...

528
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,470
We'll not take turns.

529
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,430
I'll do it alone.

530
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,660
Who is it?

531
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,190
Yu.

532
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,390
What?

533
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,440
Look at you.

534
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,330
Ying, be gentle.

535
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,750
Well, you fell down

536
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,990
while you were using the bathroom.

537
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,050
I thought you really ran into a thief.

538
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,210
If I had run into a thief,

539
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,340
he would have been sent

540
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,450
to the hospital.

541
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:00,920
Stop bragging.

542
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,600
Ying, thank you for what you did.

543
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,750
Your birthday is coming, right?

544
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,050
Gosh.

545
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,710
Why didn't you

546
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,240
bring me a pair of slippers?

547
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,710
Add some cold water!

548
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,500
Don't you want hot water? Now you think it's hot.

549
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,230
It's not even the time for you to serve me.

550
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,000
Look how unfilial you are now.

551
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,090
Go and add some cold water.

552
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:24,880
Go. Go. Go.

553
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,830
So troublesome.

554
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,340
Your mom is just like that.

555
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,670
Uncle.

556
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,310
Hello, Uncle.

557
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,160
Shanqing, you're here.

558
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,270
Mom, how's your leg?

559
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,330
-Aunt. -Shanqing.

560
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,400
Yaya said you got injured.

561
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,350
Is it serious?

562
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,250
I'm fine. I just sprained my ankle.

563
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,600
And I scratched my arm.

564
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,950
It's so swollen.

565
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,630
How will you walk?

566
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,180
It'll take some effort but I can walk myself.

567
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,350
Don't worry.

568
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:54,940
Mom,

569
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,210
this is the canned food Shanqing bought for you.

570
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:57,950
Kid,

571
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,630
there's no need for you to buy me these.

572
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,270
Yaya said you like canned yellow peaches.

573
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,350
So I bought two.

574
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,150
I'm really fine. Well.

575
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,310
-You bought these... -Are you?

576
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,070
What if you ran into a bad guy?

577
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,350
Even without a bad buy,

578
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,960
she could get herself hurt.

579
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,830
Shanqing, stay for dinner tonight.

580
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,330
Let's wish the surgery a success.

581
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:16,920
Okay.

582
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,870
Let's eat the canned food first.

583
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,290
Shanqing, take a seat.

584
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,430
You're too skinny.

585
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,750
You need to eat more.

586
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,550
Although my uncle is not good at other things,

587
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,200
he cooks well.

588
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,000
Nonsense.

589
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,790
Cooking is one of my skills.

590
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,450
When your sister comes back,

591
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,110
I'll make you something nice.

592
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,190
Are you gonna keep living here till then?

593
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,110
Look at you.

594
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,800
I've just stayed here for several days and you want me to leave?

595
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,300
I haven't seen Pengfei yet.

596
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,630
Besides, I have to see the kid

597
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:54,690
after the surgery.

598
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,590
What does it have to do with you?

599
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,870
How can it have nothing to do with me?

600
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:59,750
Shanqing

601
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,630
is the most important friend to our family,

602
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,710
which makes her my best friend as well.

603
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,110
Right?

604
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,700
I'm not in a hurry to leave.

605
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,110
Then you can be on duty

606
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,770
in the flower garden tonight.

607
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,790
Why don't you

608
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,250
live there?

609
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,790
The place is great,

610
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,250
full of birds and flowers.

611
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,350
Stop it, Yu.

612
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,810
How can I live a life there?

613
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,020
Why can't you?

614
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,350
You can stay in the storage room

615
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,500
after a clean-up.

616
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,830
You should play your part.

617
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,960
Don't be a deadbeat.

618
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,790
I've been playing my part, Yu.

619
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,110
I cook every day.

620
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,850
Besides, your leg is injured.

621
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,160
I have to take care of you,

622
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,730
right?

623
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,660
Ma is pregnant.

624
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,330
She can't do anything.

625
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,960
We can't get all the work done

626
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:34,830
during the day,

627
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,560
not to mention the night shift.

628
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,080
My next month's salary will go up in smoke.

629
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,230
Let's eat first.

630
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,640
Eat more.

631
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,820
Ma.

632
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,230
Yu.

633
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,150
Who is it?

634
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,270
Is it that serious?

635
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,950
I'm fine. I'm fine.

636
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:57,910
Which girl?

637
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,030
I don't know her.

638
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,230
You got hurt from a fall.

639
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,520
So I came.

640
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,310
I saw this girl

641
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,270
waiting at the door when I came.

642
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,550
She said you got injured from a fall,

643
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,990
and she came to help you with work.

644
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:07,870
When I opened the door,

645
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,930
she rushed in to sweep the floor.

646
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,210
I couldn't stop her.

647
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,430
Who is it?

648
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:12,670
Look.

649
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,040
-Slow down. -Shanqing.

650
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,950
Aunt.

651
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,220
Why are you here?

652
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,080
I'm here to help you.

653
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:21,870
I...

654
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,230
You and Aunt Ma

655
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,990
are not able to work now.

656
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,430
I don't know what I should do.

657
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,040
So I did some cleaning.

658
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,870
She said these flowers need to be moved out.

659
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,000
So I was moving them.

660
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,950
No need. You have to go to school.

661
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,440
It's okay. I'll go after this is done.

662
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,900
It won't cause any delays.

663
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,800
Aunt,

664
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,560
I want to discuss something with you.

665
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,600
Are you really gonna move into the flower garden?

666
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,920
Does the place fit for habitation?

667
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,250
Yes. I've checked it.

668
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,840
I also told Aunt about this.

669
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,110
Did My mom agree?

670
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:57,470
No.

671
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,430
What if there is a thief?

672
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:02,830
Believe it or not,

673
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,260
there are no thieves.

674
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,650
They just came to steal some pots of flowers

675
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:07,990
when there was no one in the flower garden at night,

676
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,910
where all the lights

677
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,080
were turned off.

678
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,400
The Oilfield is safe.

679
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,390
If there's someone living in the flower garden

680
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,250
with lights on,

681
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,920
they wouldn't dare to come.

682
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,220
-But I... -Yaya.

683
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,630
Let me do something

684
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,710
for your family.

685
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,670
So many people donated money to Zi.

686
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,070
I've been thinking

687
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,430
what I can do.

688
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,100
But there's very little I can do.

689
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,950
I can only do something that needs physical strength,

690
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,680
like cleaning up for everyone.

691
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,000
I have nothing

692
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,030
to repay your family.

693
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,450
Just let me do something for Aunt.

694
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,930
I can feel better this way.

695
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:57,750
Fine.

696
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,870
You convinced me.

697
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,460
Am I amazing?

698
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,430
The light bulb must be broken.

699
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,890
I'll replace it tomorrow.

700
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:13,790
Yaya,

701
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,610
I can see stars here at night.

702
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,790
So beautiful.

703
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,040
Morning.

704
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,150
Yu, are you feeling better?

705
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,270
Yes.

706
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,770
This girl is so nice.

707
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,270
She came in the morning and did all the work.

708
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,870
Look how clean it is now.

709
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,800
She even prepared hot water for us.

710
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,540
How can the scumbag Yuan Yong

711
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,870
deserve such a good daughter?

712
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:06,120
Yuan Shanqing said she would treat us to a meal today.

713
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,750
Treat us?

714
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,790
She's not rich.

715
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,190
She can cook herself.

716
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,990
You think we're going to the Xiaoshudu Restaurant?

717
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,300
If we go to the Xiaoshudu Restaurant,

718
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,360
it can't be right to have her treat us.

719
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,500
Shanqing especially told me

720
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,630
to invite you.

721
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:18,910
She wants to thank you.

722
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,270
Come on.

723
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,350
We've been through life and death.

724
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,030
You must go.

725
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,270
Yes.

726
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,770
It's a token of her gratitude.

727
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,570
You should go.

728
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,560
Miao,

729
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,290
I'm not going.

730
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,790
My brother will give me a call tonight.

731
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,550
I'll give Shanqing

732
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,470
a small desk lamp

733
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,790
as a housewarming gift.

734
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,550
You should give it to her for me.

735
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,400
-Okay. -I'm leaving.

736
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,040
Bye.

737
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,640
Let's go.

738
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,870
So she moved in

739
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,870
to help your mom

740
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,390
with the night shift?

741
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,110
Yuan Shanqing

742
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,950
is a person who is grateful and repays kindness.

743
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,410
You should learn from her.

744
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,570
Who should I repay?

745
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,870
Me.

746
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,110
I'm so nice to you.

747
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,390
You should somehow repay the kindness.

748
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,390
Otherwise, I'll gain nothing back.

749
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,440
Then you should.

750
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,110
Although this place is a bit shabby,

751
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,530
she cleaned up here very well.

752
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,020
I think this place is too small.

753
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,190
If I want to move something in,

754
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,720
I don't know where to put it.

755
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,100
For Qiang Xiaowa,

756
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,390
the ship

757
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,530
can even have space for a table.

758
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,750
But you can't do the same here?

759
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,240
It's unfair for you to think like that.

760
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,030
Then bring your desk

761
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,670
here.

762
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,910
Well, my desk

763
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,430
can't fit in here.

764
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:32,880
It can't.

765
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,350
Xiaowa,

766
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,280
come on, let's have fun.

767
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,080
It's fun.

768
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,800
I feel dizzy.

769
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,350
Come on, dinner is ready.

770
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,350
The fish is ready.

771
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,580
Yuan... Yuan Shanqing.

772
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,830
You're so amazing.

773
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,830
You can even make such a big dinner

774
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,390
with just a pot.

775
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,150
You should learn how to do this too.

776
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,030
Go home if you don't want to eat.

777
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,910
Stop nagging.

778
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,600
You didn't cook these dishes.

779
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,400
Yuan Shanqing made this for us.

780
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,930
It's a housewarming party.

781
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,040
Why are you so eager to eat?

782
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,060
I caused a lot of trouble

783
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,940
for you before.

784
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,590
And I haven't expressed my gratitude to you.

785
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,510
Take this meal

786
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,870
as a token of my gratitude.

787
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:11,830
Come here often.

788
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,950
I'll cook for you.

789
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,310
I just think

790
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,390
the kitchen here is too small.

791
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,540
It's not convenient.

792
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,510
Let's have meals at my place in the future.

793
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,390
It's convenient.

794
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,390
Besides, cooking

795
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,090
doesn't need large room.

796
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,310
Whether it's convenient or not,

797
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,970
you can come to my home anytime.

798
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,370
Anyway, we're close now.

799
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,650
And, Xiaowa,

800
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,630
you can come to us

801
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,960
whenever you have time.

802
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,350
This flower garden

803
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,030
is the place

804
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,960
where we grew up.

805
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,350
It can be seen as a secret base.

806
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,390
It is our secret base more than ever.

807
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,990
Now, we can settle down here.

808
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,950
If I had known this place was fit for living,

809
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,950
I wouldn't have gone to the cave.

810
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,680
I would have been here long ago.

811
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,390
Shanqing, do you know how to plant flowers?

812
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,230
Yes.

813
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,330
I plan to plant a pot of flowers with Yaya.

814
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,820
It will bloom next spring.

815
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,190
Yes, we've got a name for it.

816
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,520
It'll be called Qingya.

817
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,390
Miaomiao,

818
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,980
we should also plant one together.

819
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,710
It... It can be called Si'miao.

820
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,010
Well, we should.

821
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,090
With this name,

822
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,070
it won't grow.

823
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,590
It's impossible. It'll thrive for sure.

824
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,710
Okay.

825
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,690
Thank you.

826
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,100
Yuan Shanqing.

827
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,580
Don't bear everything on your own anymore in the future.

828
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,910
We can discuss it together

829
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,170
if something happens.

830
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,160
Got it.

831
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,390
We're talking about planting flowers.

832
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,470
How romantic it is.

833
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,600
You just can't keep up with the rhythm.

834
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,030
Let's not talk about the unhappy past.

835
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,440
Here.

836
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,070
Today is

837
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:25,930
Yuan Shanqing's housewarming party.

838
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,560
Let's have a toast happily.

839
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,870
Congratulations to Yuan Shanqing.

840
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:30,510
Now she

841
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,470
has a place to settle down.

842
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:31,980
Here.

843
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,800
Thank you.

844
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,270
Cheers!

845
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,350
Hurry up.

846
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,550
Did you see

847
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,610
what he looks like?

848
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,680
I didn't see him clearly.

849
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,070
I was afraid we couldn't catch them

850
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,040
if we alert them.

851
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,700
So I followed them home

852
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,450
and remembered their address.

853
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,410
Smart.

854
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,280
Well done. You're so brave and shrewd.

855
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,350
I'll go catch him

856
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:52,990
now.

857
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,080
No need.

858
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,780
I'll call the Security Department.

859
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,710
It's a good idea.

860
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,060
Have some.

861
00:33:59,210 --> 00:33:59,940
Thank you.

862
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,150
Are you okay?

863
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,470
I'm fine.

864
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,550
Those from the Security Department

865
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,890
saw the stolen goods upon they were there.

866
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,700
What was stolen

867
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,429
was all hidden in Liang's home.

868
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:11,260
Liang is also weird.

869
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,230
So many other things appeared in his home

870
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,290
But he didn't even question about it.

871
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,000
Who is the thief from the Liang family?

872
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,150
It's said it's his nephew.

873
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,870
He colluded with another one.

874
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,810
His nephew even wants to get a job.

875
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:26,690
I knew it.

876
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,580
It can't be the staff in the Oilfield.

877
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,080
None of us can do that.

878
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,800
Since he committed a crime of theft,

879
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,159
he even wants to be hired by the Oilfield?

880
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,170
No way.

881
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:34,949
Exactly.

882
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,780
It's all thanks to the girl.

883
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,989
If she hadn't lived here,

884
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:42,050
we would have lost other more things.

885
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,590
Yes, that girl can do great things.

886
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,540
She's smart and brave.

887
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,630
Yu, where are you going

888
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,590
since you have limited mobility?

889
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,790
I'm going to find the leader.

890
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,690
I'm going to get our salary

891
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,330
back.

892
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,140
Yuan Shanqing is a good girl.

893
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,400
She's so capable.

894
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,460
If I were her, I would have been scared to death.

895
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,580
Scared to death?

896
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,030
If I were her,

897
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,680
I would have caught him without breaking a sweat.

898
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,600
What's wrong?

899
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,180
You're quite interesting.

900
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,710
You have an expressive face but you talk less.

901
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,990
Do you think

902
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,190
I can't catch a thief?

903
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,080
You can't.

904
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,620
Really.

905
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,640
Really.

906
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,810
May I come in?

907
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,160
Come in, please.

908
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,110
Shanqing.

909
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,050
I just received a call.

910
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,250
Your sister's surgery went well.

911
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,960
They'll be back in a few days.

912
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,700
I didn't tell you because you were in class.

913
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,220
Are you relieved now?

914
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:06,980
Alright.

915
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,670
Go back to class.

916
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,060
Thank you, Director Xiao.

917
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,950
You flattered me.

918
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,220
I didn't perform the surgery.

919
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,800
I know.

920
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,790
You've tried what you can

921
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,190
to help everyone,

922
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,060
right?

923
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,960
But Yuan Shanqing, remember,

924
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,660
you should study hard.

925
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,060
And you should strive

926
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,370
to get into a good university.

927
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,900
This is the biggest reward

928
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,130
for the Linqi No. 2 High School.

929
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,690
Let's get off the bus.

930
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,890
-Let's get off the bus. -Let's go.

931
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,160
-Let's get off the bus. -We're back where we came from.

932
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:01,760
Dad!

933
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,440
Zi.

934
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,300
-Zi. -You must have waited for us for a while.

935
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:05,790
No. No.

936
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,990
Come on. Come on.

937
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,110
Uncle Yang,

938
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:08,790
let me help you. Let me help you.

939
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,150
No need. Just taking your dad's luggage is all right.

940
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,750
Okay.

941
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:11,540
Here.

942
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,430
Thank you, Uncle Cheng.

943
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,370
Thank you, Uncle Yang.

944
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,440
You're welcome.

945
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,910
Come home with me for dinner.

946
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,890
Baoshan is cooking.

947
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:17,600
I'm not going.

948
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,020
Hu Yue is waiting for me at home.

949
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,530
Okay.

950
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:20,970
We'll talk about it later.

951
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:21,460
Okay.

952
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,020
Thank you.

953
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,780
I'm going back.

954
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,570
-Bye, Uncle Yang. -Bye, Uncle Yang.

955
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,160
Bye.

956
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,380
Zi.

957
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,350
Are you happy?

958
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,250
Cheng Pengfei.

959
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,310
Why do I think

960
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,900
she's still not reacting to us?

961
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,230
Can she hear us?

962
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,430
It takes time.

963
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,670
What?

964
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,510
After she went to Beijing,

965
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,270
she's still like this.

966
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,410
How can we not be worried?

967
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,480
Well, it doesn't mean

968
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,590
she can hear us

969
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,080
or speak immediately

970
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,310
after the cochlear implant surgery.

971
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,210
This is different from other kinds of surgery.

972
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,180
Now,

973
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,190
the surgery is done.

974
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
And the implant has been activated.

975
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,390
She can hear us

976
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,830
vaguely.

977
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,000
Really?

978
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,490
-Then I… -Cover your ears.

979
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,630
Why would I?

980
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,160
Well, do it.

981
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,140
Feel it.

982
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,770
To testify if you can hear me.

983
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,140
Can you hear me now?

984
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,240
Vaguely.

985
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,080
Daiyu.

986
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:19,450
Yu.

987
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:20,900
Take your hands off.

988
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,400
Daiyu.

989
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:23,670
Yu!

990
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,690
You scared me!

991
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,560
When Zi's implant

992
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,420
was activated for the first time,

993
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,150
that's how she felt.

994
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,760
Zi was shocked too.

995
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,360
She searched everywhere,

996
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,270
wondering

997
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,750
where the sound came from.

998
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,350
The scene

999
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,260
was really touching.

1000
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,950
Then when can she talk?

1001
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,420
In terms of this,

1002
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,910
it'll take time for her

1003
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,720
to slowly recognize voices

1004
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,480
and get familiar with them.

1005
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,790
Then, she will learn to speak slowly.

1006
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:55,550
The process

1007
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,470
is not that simple.

1008
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,310
It

1009
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,620
needs long-term rehabilitation training.

1010
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,640
But don't worry.

1011
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,020
I'll help Zi

1012
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,800
with the rehabilitation training.

1013
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,840
Don't worry.

1014
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,130
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1015
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,460
Thank you, Uncle Cheng.

1016
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,470
The Steamed Egg I made

1017
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,470
is not something

1018
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,370
that ordinary people can do.

1019
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,360
We have to

1020
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,170
enhance her sense of taste first.

1021
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,920
Uncle, it has nothing

1022
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,180
to do with the sense of hearing.

1023
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,820
Aren't the sensory organs linked?

1024
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,350
Am I right, Director Cheng?

1025
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,020
You're right.

1026
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,560
But I'm not the director.

1027
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,050
In my heart, you are.

1028
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,130
You must have been

1029
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,320
to many places this time, right?

1030
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,020
Well...

1031
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,270
The Great Wall.

1032
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,490
And the Tiananmen Square.

1033
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,360
Did you go to these places?

1034
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,030
We didn't have time for this.

1035
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,250
But I saw the Tiananmen Square.

1036
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,850
I saw it when I was passing by.

1037
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,940
That should be fine.

1038
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,910
Was it magnificent?

1039
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,730
I can only watch it on TV.

1040
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,080
I remember when we got married,

1041
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,220
you said you would take us

1042
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,110
to Beijing

1043
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,050
to see the Tiananmen Square.

1044
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,950
What got us delayed?

1045
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:07,660
Right.

1046
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,190
That year, there was a blowout.

1047
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,650
You rushed to deal with it.

1048
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,110
Then you said

1049
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,320
we should take a rain check.

1050
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,400
Take a rain check.

1051
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,320
And here we are.

1052
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,710
We haven't been to any other places.

1053
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,790
This is fate.

1054
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:44,330
Zi,

1055
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,710
you'll be able

1056
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,910
to hear my voice soon.

1057
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,110
What do you want to hear the most?

1058
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:57,220
Look.

1059
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,770
Yuan Shanqing said

1060
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,070
she doesn't think

1061
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,450
she's the most unfortunate person anymore.

1062
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:06,410
Because she wants to do her best

1063
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,500
to repay everyone.

1064
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:08,820
She moved into the flower garden

1065
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,870
for my mom.

1066
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,840
She's as diligent as a bee.

1067
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,390
She's busy

1068
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,560
even in the school.

1069
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,190
Dad said

1070
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,310
we should

1071
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,860
accept Yuan Shanqing's kindness to us.

1072
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,700
In doing so,

1073
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,140
we can all feel relieved.

1074
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:23,770
Sometimes in life,

1075
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,570
you don't know the things that happened

1076
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:26,980
will bring good or bad results.

1077
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,510
It's like a planted flower.

1078
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:29,970
Maybe,

1079
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,360
it won't blossom.

1080
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,360
Let me try.

1081
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,030
Let me. Let me.

1082
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:33,800
Let me get some.

1083
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,990
I should do it for you.

1084
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,070
Let me try!

1085
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,840
I just can't do anything right.

1086
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,190
Miao!

1087
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,700
[Qingya]
