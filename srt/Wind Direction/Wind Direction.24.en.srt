3
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:43,990
Dad.

4
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,940
Didn't you quit smoking?

5
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,229
Why are you smoking again?

6
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,210
Quit it.

7
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,920
When your mom is home, she controls me.

8
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,200
When she's not, you do.

9
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,670
I don't even have any freedom

10
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,460
now that I'm old.

11
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,690
Who has freedom these days?

12
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,420
Alright, you are free enough,

13
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,610
with no family to worry about.

14
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,230
I think being single

15
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,510
is quite good for him.

16
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,389
Marriage or not,

17
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,370
it's not that important.

18
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,889
If you find the wrong mate,

19
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,030
you'll never feel comfortable

20
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,670
in the lifetime.

21
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,790
You're implying something.

22
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,950
Did you wake up too fast this morning

23
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,990
and let out what's been on your mind,

24
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,550
right?

25
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,740
Wait, Dad.

26
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,630
My mom always said if you can live together, fine,

27
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,270
but if not, just get a divorce.

28
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,310
Are you two really

29
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,730
going through a crisis?

30
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,370
Pengfei,

31
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,120
the day after I married your mom,

32
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,540
she told me,

33
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,870
"If we can live together, fine;

34
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,400
if not, just get a divorce."

35
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,350
How many years have passed?

36
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,750
It's been decades.

37
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,530
Are we getting a divorce? She was just bragging.

38
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,770
Dad, tell me the truth.

39
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,270
Have you ever thought about it?

40
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:50,829
No.

41
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,680
It's just the three of us at home today.

42
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,890
Say whatever you want,

43
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,090
we won't betray you.

44
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,520
The three of us must be united,

45
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,120
right?

46
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,700
If you say I never had those thoughts,

47
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,100
that's just nonsense.

48
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,000
But I don't believe it.

49
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,620
Which family

50
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,400
has lived together for decades

51
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,190
without any grievances

52
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,660
or dissatisfaction?

53
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:16,860
Yes.

54
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,630
No matter how much

55
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,310
love there is,

56
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,670
it can't stand up to the everyday trifles.

57
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,130
When Baoshan was born,

58
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,200
the family's food supply was tight.

59
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,140
I'd get up early in the morning

60
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,930
to work

61
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,030
and wouldn't come back until it was dark.

62
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,440
I couldn't see the sun all day.

63
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,030
You know

64
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,040
your mother's temper.

65
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,940
She spoke harshly

66
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,540
and was very vain,

67
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,980
always bragging.

68
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,500
It made me so angry

69
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,010
that my chest hurt.

70
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,860
My coronary heart disease today

71
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,990
is caused by the anger I felt back then.

72
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,280
Dad,

73
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:00,310
did you

74
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,820
run away from home once?

75
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,930
I stayed at the drilling team

76
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,420
for more than half a month.

77
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,830
At the time, I thought

78
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,690
the worst would be getting divorced.

79
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,770
I'm not afraid.

80
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,310
Wait. Why?

81
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:15,990
Back then...

82
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,560
Because I bought cigarettes

83
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,070
or

84
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,840
borrowed money? No.

85
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,370
I can't remember

86
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,400
why

87
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,930
it got to that point.

88
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,850
I have a realization.

89
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,840
It got so bad

90
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,550
that I even ran away from home,

91
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,190
but I can't remember

92
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,510
why it happened

93
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,870
when you asked.

94
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,290
What does this mean?

95
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,360
-It means...
-It means you have a poor memory.

96
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,260
Bullshit!

97
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,480
It means I can't live without your mother,

98
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,320
our family,

99
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,180
and you two siblings.

100
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,120
We used to argue and fight when we were young,

101
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,100
and now I really can't remember the details.

102
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,300
At my age,

103
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,600
what I can remember...

104
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,530
I remember you and your sister

105
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,530
learning to speak when you were little,

106
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,130
and the first time you called me "Dad."

107
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,010
I remember being wronged,

108
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,560
and your mom

109
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,700
went to the factory to confront others on my behalf.

110
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,920
What I remember most clearly

111
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,490
is the night

112
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,159
we got married;

113
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,630
I whispered to your mom.

114
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,740
What did you say?

115
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,420
I told her that

116
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,560
I would die after her,

117
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,000
and I couldn't bear to

118
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,610
let her alone.

119
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,390
You're quite nasty.

120
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,060
Were you cursing my mom?

121
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,120

122
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,990

Sister, well,

194
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,520
you think about it seriously;

195
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,990
do you think Director Xiao and I

196
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,920
are a good match?

197
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,020
No.

198
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,270
Do you also think

199
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,600
Director Xiao is a bit

200
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,610
too...

201
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,799
Too excellent.

202
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,870
What kind of man are you?

203
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,280
How can you compare

204
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,679
to her?

205
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,429
She is

206
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,740
the director of Teaching and Discipline at Linqi No. 2 High School,

207
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,990
wielding great influence.

208
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,320
You're just an unemployed

209
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,210
drifter,

210
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,350
and just know eating and sleeping.

211
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:46,910
Let me tell you,

212
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,150
even if she gives you a glance,

213
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,630
it's because she's an intellectual

214
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,430
with a kind heart.

215
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,750
The way you look at things

216
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,790
is very strange.

217
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,210
Anyway,

218
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,040
you're just a middle-aged woman

219
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,870
with limited understanding,

220
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,130
so it's not your fault.

221
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,820
A man should establish himself by 30.

222
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,260
You're over 30.

223
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,660
That's not important.

224
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,520
Let me tell you,

225
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,990
Mom is right.

226
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,720
I'm a late bloomer;

227
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,970
I'll make achievements after 30.

228
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,130
I'll establish a career before starting a family.

229
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,210
Establish...

230
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,950
Let me see what you can establish.

231
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,070
I really have an

232
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,870
immature idea.

233
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,930
Listen to me first.

234
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,440
You see, a man's career

235
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,860
generally falls into two categories:

236
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,390
employment

237
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,970
or entrepreneurship.

238
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,830
I've been employed

239
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,910
for so many years.

240
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,350
I don't think it suits me.

241
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,270
But since I've had in-depth discussions

242
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,310
with Director Xiao,

243
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,560
I feel there's a bit of a connection

244
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,380
between me and the education sector.

245
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,980
You... You're going to cause trouble for the school again.

246
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,190
Stop it!

247
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,990
The education sector

248
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,790
doesn't just involve teaching;

249
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,120
there's also the canteen,

250
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,050
and I have an advantage in that area.

251
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:50,990
Sister, think about it.

252
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,750
If I really work

253
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,870
in their school,

254
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,590
it wouldn't just

255
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,730
be about me and Director Xiao;

256
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,400
I could also support Miaomiao and Yaya.

257
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,570
That would be all harm and no benefits for our family...

258
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,310
No, that would be all benefits and no harm for our family, right?

259
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:01,840
You...

260
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,760
Are you trying to pursue Director Xiao

261
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,590
or just looking for a job?

262
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,480
I want

263
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,300
love

264
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,520
and career both.

265
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,410
I need to excel in both areas.

266
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,910
It's broken.

267
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:19,710
You...

268
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,700
Class begins.

269
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,590
Stand up.

270
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,410
Good afternoon, teacher.

271
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,700
Sit.

272
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,670
Before class,

273
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,390
I have good news to announce.

274
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,500
Our classmate, Qiang Xiaowa,

275
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,130
won first place

276
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,080
in this essay contest

277
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,010
with the work "The Ideal Country."

278
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,000
Qiang Xiaowa

279
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,630
will go to Qingdao

280
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,040
to represent our Linqi No. 2 High School

281
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,170
in the provincial essay competition.

282
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,740
Okay, let's start the class.

283
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,270
Turn to page 68.

284
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,370
I knitted it myself.

285
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,720
This is so beautiful.

286
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,070
I like this color.

287
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,850
Help me give it to Grandma.

288
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,020
This is for Grandma?

289
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,830
She made vests

290
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,990
for me and Zi.

291
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,950
I don't even know

292
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,650
what I can give Grandma,

293
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,650
so I learned to knit a scarf.

294
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,580
It might not be perfect,

295
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,590
but it's the thought that counts.

296
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,580
Okay.

297
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,170
I'll help you give it to her later.

298
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,560
This is for you.

299
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,590
Inside

300
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,500
is the poem I wrote

301
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,780
for the essay contest.

302
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,510
Even though it didn't win any awards,

303
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,110
I still want to give it to you.

304
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,030
Thank you.

305
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,270
When is the final?

306
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,560
During the May Day holiday.

307
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,420
Going to Qingdao during the May Day holiday?

308
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,350
I want to go too.

309
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,910
I don't want to go.

310
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,110
Why?

311
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
I don't have time.

312
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,520
You don't have time during the May Day holiday?

313
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,870
Xiaowa,

314
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,380
why?

315
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,600
Nothing.

316
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,520
It's just an essay contest,

317
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,650
not very important.

318
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,320
It is important.

319
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,600
It's not your own business.

320
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,200
It's about our team.

321
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,750
We finally have a proper reason

322
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,760
to get out,

323
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,810
especially during the holiday.

324
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,960
Let's go together.

325
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,060
Right?

326
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,680
I have to ask my mom.

327
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,040
I have no freedom at all.

328
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,480
Right?

329
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,720
I'm fine with anything.

330
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,580
It's settled then.

331
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,060
We're going to Qingdao during the May Day holiday.

332
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,030
To Qingdao!

333
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,920
Can I go?

334
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,550
Just tell me.

335
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,820
Get up from the floor.

336
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,600
You're really...

337
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,690
Aren't you shamed to sit on the ground like that,

338
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,050
especially as a girl?

339
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,230
Why are you always

340
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,310
thinking about having fun all day long?

341
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,550
It's not just for fun.

342
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,200
I'm participating in the contest.

343
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,320
What contest?

344
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,130
Did you win any awards?

345
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,490
What does it have to do with you?

346
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,620
It's our team's business.

347
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Besides, it's the May Day holiday.

348
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,550
It's only three days. Why can't I go?

349
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,560
Go.

350
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,670
Go ask your dad.

351
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,790
I don't care.

352
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,040
Dad.

353
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,690
You're finally back.

354
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,890
Let me take it for you.

355
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,930
Let me take it.

356
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,660
-What happened?
-Give it to me.

357
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,910
I want to go to Qingdao

358
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,830
with Li Si and Qiang Xiaowa

359
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,950
during the May Day holiday.

360
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,550
Qiang Xiaowa won the essay contest

361
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,210
and is moving on to the finals.

362
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,790
Li Si and I want to go with him. You know,

363
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,130
it's such an important event,

364
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,420
and we want to broaden our horizons

365
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,870
and see how large contests are run

366
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,270
in the city.

367
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,310
Maybe we can even make some

368
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,400
talented friends.

369
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,690
You just want to go to Qingdao for fun, don't you?

370
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,590
No, that's just secondary.

371
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,160
Dad, please.

372
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,430
Can you let me go?

373
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,570
Please.

374
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,530
Come.

375
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:09,850
You can go.

376
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,580
Thank you, Dad. I Love you.

377
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,210
Aren't you going to take my bag inside?

378
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,510
What are you talking about?

379
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,690
Did you even listen to what she said

380
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,690
before agreeing?

381
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,110
It's not a big deal.

382
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,540
It's the May Day holiday,

383
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,400
let the kids go have fun together.

384
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,630
Have you forgotten the last time they went to Hong Kong?

385
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,660
If it hadn't been for the injury,

386
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,270
they might not have come back.

387
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,030
You see, last time,

388
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,030
it was because

389
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,720
we kept stopping them

390
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,610
that they almost got into trouble?

391
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,590
They've grown up now,

392
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,310
and they need to gain some experience.

393
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,720
Besides, it's not far.

394
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,590
If she can't figure out a short trip like this,

395
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,490
how will she handle

396
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,630
the journey of life later on?

397
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,150
You can't say anything

398
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,830
without dragging it into a life lesson, can you?

399
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,860
You're even turning this

400
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,740
into a life lesson for life.

401
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,670
Have some water.

402
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,200
Wasn't it your dad

403
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,730
who said life is a long road?

404
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,640
Yeah, life is a long road

405
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,030
with hurdles at every step.

406
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,620
Go cook.

407
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,800
Go cook!

408
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,350
With words of family love, my eyes fill with tears;

409
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:18,100
years of separation weigh heavily on my heart.

410
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,740
My father has long since passed away,

411
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,550
and every festive season, my tears flow like a spring.

412
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,570
What does "passed away"

413
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,380
mean?

414
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
You mean I'm dead?

415
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,750
No.

416
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,390
I'm expressing longing.

417
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,850
But isn't it still about death?

418
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,710
How can you miss me if I'm not dead?

419
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,010
Forget that part. Listen to the next one.

420
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,950
In front of my father's tomb, the grass grows tall.

421
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:54,510
Wait, Li Si.

422
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,730
What do you want?

423
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,550
Do you want me to die?

424
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,430
Are you playing some kind of truth game?

425
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,780
What truth game?

426
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,270
Do you think I'm unfilial?

427
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,280
It's just an artistic metaphor,

428
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,369
and an allusion to classical references.

429
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:07,849
I didn't write the poem.

430
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,780
My essay for the contest

431
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,250
is mainly about expressing

432
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,910
how fatherly love is as steadfast as a mountain.

433
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,089
Dad!

434
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,700
Fatherly love is as steadfast as a mountain?

435
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,630
Tell me, how much money do you want?

436
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:25,220
I don't want money.

437
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,579
This contest is free.

438
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:27,910
It's free?

439
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,540
I'm going to Qingdao.

440
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,340
Qingdao?

441
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,720
I'm going to Qingdao during the May Day holiday.

442
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,250
It won't interfere with school.

443
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:36,820
Just go.

444
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,590
Dad. Dad.

445
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,040
Well...

446
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,300
Participating in the contest in Qingdao

447
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,340
is free,

448
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,520
but the travel to Qingdao

449
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,400
costs money.

450
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,950
You still want money, do you?

451
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,260
You've been reciting

452
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,040
Tang and Song poetry here;

453
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,440
are you trying to make a profit?

454
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,080
Li Si,

455
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,490
you can't even set a price for it.

456
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,600
I can't set a price?

457
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,080
Wait, Dad.

458
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,440
-Listen to the remaining part.
-Get lost!

459
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,550
Dad, you stay inside.

460
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,150
I'll read it for you outside.

461
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,540
Lying peacefully in the tomb for 40 years,

462
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,190
with yearly offerings during the Lantern Festival and Tomb-Sweeping Day.

463
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,790
You little bastard!

464
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,180
What's Qingming?

465
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,620
Min?

466
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,550
Come in.

467
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:23,950
I'm coming in.

468
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,760
What's wrong?

469
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:28,690
Here.

470
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,740
Have some water.

471
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,880
Are you hungry?

472
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,810
What do you want for dinner?

473
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,760
I don't want to cook.

474
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,360
Let's have tomato egg noodles.

475
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,570
Making it simple, okay?

476
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,440
Okay.

477
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,470
Mom,

478
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,810
I have something

479
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,040
to discuss with you.

480
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,360
-Well, I…
-Wait a minute.

481
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,590
Hello?

482
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,990
Really?

483
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,540
Is she coming alone?

484
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,270
Where is she staying?

485
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,880
Okay, I got it.

486
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,040
Bye.

487
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,240
Mom.

488
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,760
Who's coming?

489
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,530
Yang said that Grandma is coming during the May Day holiday.

490
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,260
She is going to live in our home.

491
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,030
Why is she coming?

492
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,950
She said her colleague's grandson is getting married.

493
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,640
She's coming for the wedding.

494
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,950
It's Grandma's first time

495
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,820
visiting our home,

496
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,080
so you need to be on your best behavior.

497
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,920
Do you hear me?

498
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,760
No matter how she treats us,

499
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,410
we must be polite to her.

500
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,630
Don't drop the ball.

501
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,520
Do you hear me?

502
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,170
Yes.

503
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,280
Weren't you going to discuss something with me?

504
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,070
What is it?

505
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,160
Nothing.

506
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,580
I want to eat meat tonight.

507
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,640
Tomato and egg noodles are too plain.

508
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,700
Okay.

509
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,910
I'll cook some meat for you.

510
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,060
Wait for me.

511
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,910
Have some water.

512
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,380
I want to go to Qingdao.

513
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,890
I also want to go.

514
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,160
The movies at the Cultural Palace

515
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,710
aren't worth watching.

516
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,340
Even if I want to go on a date,

517
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,430
there's no decent place around

518
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,890
in our oilfield compound.

519
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,660
Are you going to date with Fang?

520
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,280
Not exactly.

521
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,190
It's just that we've been getting along

522
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,110
well recently,

523
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,360
so I want to take things

524
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,550
a step further.

525
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,210
I'm doing this for you and Miaomiao.

526
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:40,890
No.

527
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,240
If you two end up together,

528
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,710
Fang would be my aunt.

529
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,110
But if things don't work out,

530
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,830
Cheng Miaomiao and I will have a tough time

531
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,800
at school.

532
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,890
If I really take action,

533
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,810
there's no way it won't work out.

534
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,310
I'm

535
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:57,990
in the stage of

536
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,790
moving forward right now.

537
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,890
But with the current limitations,

538
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,080
it's hard to make progress.

539
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,380
Uncle,

540
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,170
I know a place that

541
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,070
can help you make a breakthrough.

542
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,280
The green one next to it.

543
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:16,760
Here.

544
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,670
Thank you.

545
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,840
You're welcome.

546
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,940
You've won first place,

547
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,350
so why don't you want to go?

548
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,820
They are willing to go with you.

549
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,900
That's great.

550
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,860
Even if I go, I might not win.

551
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,890
They are all students from big cities.

552
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,180
They must write better than me.

553
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,910
Who cares if you win or not?

554
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:36,410
Xiaowa,

555
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,900
you just go to broaden your horizons,

556
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,540
okay?

557
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,150
If you don't want to go,

558
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,600
why do you call me?

559
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,320
I just want to discuss with you.

560
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,870
The school will cover the travel expenses.

561
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,730
Don't worry about it.

562
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,550
I'll send you money.

563
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,430
You must go.

564
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,270
Confidently. Xiaowa.

565
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,550
No need, brother. I have money.

566
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,420
I'm hanging up. I'm going to work.

567
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,840
My little brother is about to win another award.

568
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,540
You know this place?

569
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,390
I haven't been here many times.

570
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,860
I'm not bragging,

571
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,080
but normally,

572
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,990
I have a wide range of interests,

573
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,850
including culinary arts, medicine, plants and animals,

574
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,200
archaeology, history,

575
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,620
poetry and literature.

576
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,220
I'm practically an expert

577
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,510
in astronomy and geography.

578
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,030
Yaya's interest in this area was nurtured by me.

579
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,660
I even bought him

580
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,860
his first telescope.

581
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,650
Orion, Andromeda,

582
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,520
and the Big Dipper.

583
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,280
I know exactly where they are,

584
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,680
even with my eyes closed.

585
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,800
I'm a Virgo, how about you?

586
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,520
I mean star sign.

587
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,470
I...

588
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,840
I was born on October 30th, that's...

589
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,510
Scorpio.

590
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,260
Fierce and vengeful.

591
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,870
No, well, I mean intense and passionate.

592
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,480
Yes.

593
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,150
I didn't expect you to know so much.

594
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,680
I didn't realize it before.

595
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,590
I'm a reserved man

596
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,240
who doesn't like to show off or draw attention.

597
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,760
Here.

598
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,610
I specially made you some sweet and sour ribs

599
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,670
and chicken wings.

600
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,620
You can just sit here, munch on the ribs,

601
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,780
and watch the stars.

602
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,990
The atmosphere here

603
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:09,790
is something

604
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,810
those little restaurants can't match.

605
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,270
If we're talking about it,

606
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,150
you really know how to enjoy life.

607
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,640
Lately, I've been focused solely on my career.

608
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,840
I haven't done enough yet.

609
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,350
From now on, I'll handle all the little surprises

610
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,110
in your life.

611
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,110
Is it good?

612
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,960
I want to buy a new TV for our home.

613
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,620
Our current TV

614
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,000
is pretty old,

615
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,290
and the signal isn't great.

616
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,000
No, no.

617
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,910
Min's grandma is coming in a couple of days.

618
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,040
Her eyesight isn't very good,

619
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,910
I want to change a big one

620
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,270
so we can see better.

621
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,050
What size of yours

622
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,430
at that time?

623
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,460
Was it expensive?

624
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,200
How much did it cost?

625
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,940
You want to work at the canteen in Linqi No. 2 High School?

626
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,400
That's what I'm thinking.

627
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,790
You know my cooking skills are pretty good.

628
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,690
If I don't put them

629
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,610
into use,

630
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,710
it'd be a waste.

631
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,030
I just want to let the hardworking teachers and staff

632
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,090
on the front lines of education

633
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,870
taste my cooking.

634
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,750
If they eat well,

635
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,830
they'll be able to better nurture the next generation.

636
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,840
So that's your purpose.

637
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,980
No wonder you brought me here today.

638
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,280
No.

639
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:40,580
You've been thinking about this since before the New Year, haven't you?

640
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,400
I see.

641
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,130
I get it now.

642
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,840
What? What have you got?

643
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:45,490
Jia Baoshan,

644
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,030
I'm too naive compared to you.

645
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,720
Fang...

646
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,130
Don't try to get close to me.

647
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,090
Let me tell you,

648
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,320
I'm just a small department director,

649
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,720
with limited authority.

650
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,890
There's no need for you to be circling around me

651
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:54,990
to gain any benefits.

652
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,300
What benefits did I get?

653
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,070
Isn't my coming to school

654
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,070
also to take care of you?

655
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,090
Fang. Fang.

656
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,270
Fang, slow down.

657
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,970
I'm not going.

658
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,830
I'm not going, okay?

659
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,100
Qingdao, we're coming!

660
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,450
We're coming, Qingdao.

661
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,430
Hurry up!

662
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,890
Hide under the bridge.

663
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,320
[Entrance]

664
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,970
North is up, south is down, west is left, east is right.

665
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,780
East, this way.

666
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,670
That's for a map.

667
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,950
We're on the street,

668
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,430
that doesn't really apply here.

669
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,510
We've been searching since this morning,

670
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,490
and it's already noon,

671
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,150
but we still haven't found the right direction.

672
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,360
Give it to me.

673
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,550
You won't find it tomorrow with this approach.

674
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,350
Where is east?

675
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,960
[Lotus Lake Youth Culture Palace of Qingdao]

676
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,180
Let's go.

677
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,440
Teacher!

678
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:12,780
Teacher!

679
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,700
Teacher!

680
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,110
You are...

681
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,430
We're here to register.

682
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,110
You're late. It's over.

683
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,870
Where did you come from?

684
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,100
Linqi Oilfield,

685
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,720
in Heping Town.

686
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,440
Linqi Oilfield?

687
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,740
I've never heard of it.

688
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,260
But it's over.

689
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,020
You'd better head back.

690
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,070
Teacher, we are indeed late,

691
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,570
but he's the first place winner

692
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,190
in our school's essay contest.

693
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,270
Can you give us a chance?

694
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,070
There's still time.

695
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,740
Alright,

696
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,310
come with me to the office up front

697
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,090
and register. Let's go.

698
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,490
Thank you, teacher. You should go quickly.

699
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,410
It's right that you can't get into the school canteen.

700
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,650
She's not stupid.

701
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,110
It mainly because that place

702
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,330
can't fulfill my aspirations.

703
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,170
What aspirations?

704
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,960
Starting a business,

705
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,980
and becoming an entrepreneur.

706
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,020
I wish you success.

707
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,820
Sister, where are you going?

708
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,940
-What are you doing?
-I'm going to dance.

709
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,820
No, no, no.

710
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,020
I'm serious.

711
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,380
I don't have time to listen to your nonsense.

712
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,710
I want to prove it to her.

713
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,470
To whom?

714
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,390
To you women.

715
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,740
Come, sister, sit down.

716
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,340
Here.

717
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,490
In my business plan,

718
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,770
there's a part for you.

719
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,960
Can you lend me some money?

720
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,640
You always ran away when I mentioned borrowing money,

721
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,640
and yet you still say that blood is thicker than water.

722
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,110
Insert.

723
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,180
Guys,

724
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,400
you need to insert the card to get power.

725
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,840
Thank you, Monica.

726
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,190
The person who loves me hasn't arrived yet.

727
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,470
Hello.

728
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,000
Hello.

729
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,350
Are the Four Heavenly Kings here?

730
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,660
No.

731
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,140
I'm Cheng Miaomiao.

732
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,860
What are you doing with the tissues?

733
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,800
Going to the restroom.

734
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,560
Wait, there's tissues in there.

735
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,940
Don't we have to spend money on the tissues?

736
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,020
No need.

737
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,230
We've already spent money.

738
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,700
It covered everything here.

739
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,560
It's obvious you've never stayed in a hotel before.

740
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,320
The hotel my parents and I stayed at

741
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,640
in Shanghai before

742
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,130
was much more upscale than this one.

743
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,100
The tissues they used even smelled nice.

744
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,540
Chow Yun-Fat, it's me.

745
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,740
I'm Miaomiao.

746
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,260
You know me, right?

747
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,450
Once the curtains were opened,

748
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,060
the Huangpu River was outside.

749
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,660
Do you know where the Bund is?

750
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,120
Do you know the Oriental Pearl Tower?

751
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,270
Back then,

752
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,000
I had a big room to myself.

753
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,270
Now, suddenly sharing with someone,

754
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,600
I'm not quite used to it.

755
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:40,890
Miaomiao,

756
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,440
ask Chow Yun-Fat

757
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,320
what Stephen Chow is up to lately.

758
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,940
If he's free, let's have a meal together.

759
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,380
Chow Yun-Fat.

760
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,880
I have a friend

761
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,850
who wants to know what Stephen Chow is up to these days.

762
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,650
If he has some time, let's all have a meal together.

763
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,250
Grandma is not coming?

764
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,170
It's not that she's not coming.

765
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,650
She came yesterday

766
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,620
but just didn't come to our house.

767
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,350
She's staying at a guesthouse.

768
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,820
It's also fine if she doesn’t come.

769
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,480
It's quiet.

770
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,620
There's no need to change the TV.

771
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,480
It saves money.

772
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,990
Not changing the TV?

773
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,640
Our TV is still pretty good;

774
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,370
it can last for a few more years.

775
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,790
If I had known, I would have gone to Qingdao instead.

776
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,920
What a waste of time.

777
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,330
She said she would come, but she hasn't.

778
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,200
I'm going to dance.

779
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,650
Wash the dishes after dinner.

780
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,870
I'm leaving.

781
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,270
Still need to wash the dishes.

782
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,380
Alien.

783
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,430
Come and pick me up.

784
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,770
[A slip of the tongue and deeply regretted, Baoshan]

785
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,770
[Fang, I'm at fault, but the sweet and sour ribs and chicken wings are not. For their sake, please give them another try.]

786
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,220
The ribs and chicken wings are nice.

787
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,430
I can't waste food.

788
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,420
[Divorce Certificate]

789
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:25,870
Wait.

790
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:27,760
Wait.

791
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,000
This is...

792
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,380
When did this happen?

793
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,230
This morning.

794
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,780
Why all of a sudden?

795
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,870
Did something happen?

796
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,360
Did Yang hit you?

797
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:40,910
No.

798
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,550
Yang never

799
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,520
hits me.

800
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,650
Then why?

801
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,900
Just because we had a drink

802
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,060
last night.

803
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,350
He started hitting me

804
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,830
shortly after we got married,

805
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,020
but I chose to forgive him that time.

806
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,150
Because that day,

807
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,740
he went out for a drink.

808
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,389
But guess what?

809
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,420
I forgave him once,

810
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,540
then there was a second time, a third time,

811
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,090
and countless times after that.

812
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,340
I could put up with it,

813
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,790
but I can't tolerate

814
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,489
how he treats the kid.

815
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,170
Back then, Min was just a kid.

816
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:36,510
She accidentally

817
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,440
broke

818
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,199
a glass.

819
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,389
That glass wasn't even worth much.

820
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,850
But he grabbed an ashtray

821
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,150
and threw it at Min.

822
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,699
I rushed over to shield her,

823
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,219
but still couldn't dodge in time.

824
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:51,889
You asked me

825
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,650
where this scar is from, right?

826
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,120
Now you know.

827
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,050
I had to get several stitches,

828
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,560
and it hurt quite a bit.

829
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,600
That's why

830
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,540
I didn't tell you the truth

831
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,070
back when we met.

832
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,880
I was too embarrassed to say it.

833
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,370
It's too shameful.

834
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,080
I didn't dare mention it to anyone.

835
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,090
I'll drink as a punishment.

836
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,190
But if we're talking about this,

837
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,600
I'll drink as a punishment too.

838
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,830
My divorce from Feng Jing

839
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,370
wasn't due to a lack of affection.

840
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,840
She... She hit you?

841
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:54,390
She cheated on me and ran off with someone else.

842
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,590
It's embarrassing, right?

843
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,310
I haven't told anyone about this.

844
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,280
My mom doesn't even know.

845
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,600
That's why my mom

846
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,300
still blames me.

847
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,250
Because she always thinks

848
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,230
Feng Jing

849
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,570
is great in every way.

850
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,880
She believes our divorce

851
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,070
was all my fault.

852
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,260
How could that be?

853
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,530
But I can't really talk about it;

854
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,190
the issue of cheating

855
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,680
is difficult to discuss.

856
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,560
Yang,

857
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,100
so your mom

858
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,760
has always been so unfavorable towards me.

859
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,140
Yes.

860
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,250
Yes.

861
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,070
She doesn't know.

862
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,780
So...

863
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,080
Drink!

864
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,810
I must pour another cup as a punishment.

865
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,870
I must be punished.

866
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,900
Hu, I'm sorry.

867
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,230
I'm sorry.

868
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,560
I'm really...

869
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,310
-I feel so wronged.
-The truth is out.

870
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,850
-The truth is out.
-My goodness.

871
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,750
I've been busy all day.

872
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,760
I'm busy with work and busy with the house,

873
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,090
dealing with big things and small things.

874
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,350
I'm almost exhausting myself.

875
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,230
And I still end up living my life

876
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,630
in chaos.

877
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,840
Why?

878
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,440
Really, Yang, every time

879
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,780
we had a quarrel,

880
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,950
I felt like I had a mental illness.

881
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,320
Yang,

882
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,490
do you really think

883
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,840
I have a mental illness?

884
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,060
I really...

885
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,810
I really do feel like you might have a mental illness.

886
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,490
Wait, you don't know

887
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,770
every time I got off work and came home,

888
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,900
I was afraid to go in.

889
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,630
I had to mentally prepare myself

890
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,310
at the door

891
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,660
before I dared to enter.

892
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,920
I'm afraid...

893
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,840
I was afraid that

894
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,270
if I said something wrong,

895
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,000
you would start getting angry.

896
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,600
I was nervous.

897
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,360
And even when the phone rang, I got anxious.

898
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,090
Why?

899
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,250
I was afraid that my mom called

900
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,030
and something went wrong.

901
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,380
I got nervous talking about Min

902
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,470
or Tao.

903
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,510
I felt uneasy

904
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,250
and anxious all day long.

905
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,950
You deserve it.

906
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,210
You pushed me into this.

907
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:16,660
I'll drink as a punishment.

908
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,290
I'll drink as a punishment.

909
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,820
I'll drink as a punishment.

910
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,770
We two patients, here.

911
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,800
Here. Cheers.

912
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,110
Patient, I've wronged you.

913
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,570
I've wronged you.

914
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,340
It's all my fault.

915
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,710
Actually, you feel wronged too.

916
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,420
Yang,

917
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,780
tell me

918
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,580
how did we end up living

919
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,900
such a wronged life?

920
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,790
It's because

921
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,520
neither of us

922
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,000
told the truth from the beginning.

923
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,880
So, if we

924
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,970
had both told the truth back then,

925
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:40,940
do you think

926
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,510
we would still be together?

927
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,060
I don't know.

928
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:47,570
I don't know.

929
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,600
But if we hadn't been together,

930
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,880
would our lives

931
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,710
have been less awful afterward?

932
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,090
Maybe.

933
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,120
We used to say that

934
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,200
we divorced

935
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,730
for the kids.

936
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,850
But why are we together?

937
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,670
For kids.

938
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,150
Also for kids.

939
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:29,330
Yang,

940
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,230
when will we

941
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,910
ever live for ourselves?

942
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:40,650
Anytime.

943
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,550
I've applied for annual leave.

944
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,260
I haven't been anywhere

945
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,500
all these years.

946
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,520
So this time I want to go on a proper trip

947
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,840
and see what the world

948
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,140
is really like.

949
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:14,710
We all thought we

950
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,750
had grown up,

951
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,260
but once we got out, we realized that

952
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,320
the world outside

953
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,110
is nothing

954
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,370
like we imagined.

955
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,530
No matter how well we dress up,

956
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,960
we're still easily recognized as

957
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,040
country bumpkins

958
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:26,580
and will be mocked

959
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,400
by those kids.

960
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,760
I always remember their looks,

961
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,300
and I also remember

962
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,650
Qiang Xiaowa's

963
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,770
torn socks.

964
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:34,960
It was at that moment

965
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,550
that I truly felt

966
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,570
Qiang Xiaowa's embarrassment

967
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,900
after crossing the bridge to get to Hexi.

968
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,210
Hu's mom ended up getting divorced

969
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:45,410
on a day

970
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,570
when we all thought everything was calm

971
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:48,230
and they wouldn't even argue.

972
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:50,940
We later found out that

973
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,710
Yang Tao had told his mom

974
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,070
that story on the train.

975
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,940
Only after growing up did I understand

976
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,620
why Aunt Hu Yue

977
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,710
had left that home

978
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,950
so calmly

979
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,300
yet so resolutely.
