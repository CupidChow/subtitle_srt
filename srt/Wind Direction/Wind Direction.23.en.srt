[Autumn, 1980]

4
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,990
Is there anyone?

[Home]

6
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,710
Grandpa.

7
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,829
These knee pads are warm, right?

8
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,050
Yes, they're warm.

9
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,190
Very warm.

10
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,030
They are made of pure cotton,

11
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,490
specially designed to help with arthritis.

12
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,790
All thanks to both of you.

13
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:34,990
Dawa,

14
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,630
since I'm still able to walk,

15
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,390
you should get married and have a baby soon.

16
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,590
I'll help you with babysitting then.

17
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,110
Isn't it great? You don't have to worry about it.

18
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,110
I can help you too.

19
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,460
What can you do?

20
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,310
You're still a kid.

21
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,450
How can you help me?

22
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,870
Grandpa.

23
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,180
Besides,

24
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,550
this matter can't be rushed.

25
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,280
I can't believe you're not in a hurry.

26
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,790
There are hundreds of girls

27
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,829
in the factory.

28
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,950
Is none of them suitable?

29
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,120
Our supervisor

30
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,280
wants to introduce his daughter to me.

31
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,490
What is a supervisor?

32
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,310
The supervisor of the construction project.

33
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,330
He manages all of us

34
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,530
and has a lot of power.

35
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,350
You should go meet her.

36
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,160
We're not social climbers.

37
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,950
We don't care

38
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,270
whether he is a supervisor or not.

39
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,390
As long as you two get along well,

40
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,750
it's a good marriage.

41
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,990
I did meet her.

42
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,430
She's quite nice.

43
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,810
But she has a bad temper

44
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,300
and is very aggressive.

45
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,230
Now he picks on her.

46
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,829
You see, he's picking on her.

47
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,350
Our family is not bad now.

48
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,829
Xiaowa will be

49
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:34,920
a college student soon.

50
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,200
He can go to my place.

51
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,590
I'll take you there too.

52
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,390
We can live a good life together.

53
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,310
Okay.

54
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,850
You two focus on developing your relationship.

55
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,870
When the time comes, I'll help you

56
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,400
take care of your children.

57
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,760
Then I'll come back.

58
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,710
I can't leave this place.

59
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,870
I'm used to it.

60
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,150
Put her down.

61
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,350
Let her rest.

62
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,800
You keep carrying her and rubbing her.

63
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,510
Can she stand it?

64
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,360
This little kid is very clever.

65
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,180
She can tell

66
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,310
who a good person is.

67
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,830
Why didn't she let you carry her?

68
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,000
She is onto you.

69
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,420
-She is onto you.
-Come on.

70
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,390
Let Grandpa carry you.

71
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,310
See if she'll come.

72
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,630
-Come here.
-Let's see if she'll go to you.

73
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,450
-Come here.
-Let's see if she'll go to you.

74
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,980
Grandma, Grandpa, stop fighting.

75
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,860
Time to eat.

76
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,550
Zi.

77
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,390
Let her eat first.

78
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,430
Yeah, eat first.

79
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,870
She likes me. How adorable she is.

80
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,120
Listen.

81
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,920
Don't worry about Zi's illness.

82
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,270
I know a TCM physician.

83
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,390
If treated according to traditional Chinese medicine methods, it can be cured.

84
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,150
Or else,

85
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,390
I know a priest.

86
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,250
-Wait, Mom.
-A priest.

87
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,070
Well, I've already arranged for someone

88
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,520
to treat Zi.

89
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,150
Currently, it looks very effective.

90
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,390
Well...

91
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,390
What?

92
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,670
What are you talking about?

93
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,070
What did I say? I was watching TV.

94
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,190
You were gesturing.

95
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,520
-I didn't.
-Don't talk.

96
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:00,550
Go ahead.

97
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,270
I'm afraid your treatment method

98
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,750
might conflict

99
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,070
with ours

100
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,290
and cause issues later.

101
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:06,970
Let's see

102
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,310
how effective this treatment is.

103
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,630
If it doesn't work well on my end,

104
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,130
I'll definitely ask you to help find someone in the future.

105
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,070
You're right. Okay.

106
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,870
Go ahead and do your thing first.

107
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,390
Where is Baoyu?

108
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,920
Why isn't he home during the Chinese New Year?

109
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,220
Grandma, you don't know.

110
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,910
The Chinese New Year

111
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,390
is the best time for Baoyu to pursue love.

112
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,610
Where did he go?

113
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,490
He went to my...

114
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:35,850
Your teacher's house?

115
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,890
No.

116
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,880
Where did he go?

117
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,630
The director's place.

118
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:41,990
He made a big step forward

119
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,390
in life.

120
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,110
Our son

121
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,120
didn't win over the teacher,

122
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,600
and now he's shamelessly going after the director.

123
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,950
You taught him well.

124
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,990
Come on.

125
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,800
Look who's here.

126
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,550
Director Xiao, you're here.

127
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,230
Hello.

128
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,150
Happy Chinese New Year.

129
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,470
-Happy Chinese New Year.
-Happy Chinese New Year.

130
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,590
-What's wrong with you?
-What happened to you?

131
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,790
I'm fine.

132
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,670
He fell when helping me

133
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,830
hang up the spring couplets.

134
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,830
Are you stupid?

135
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,790
Is your bone okay?

136
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,950
I'm fine, Pengfei.

137
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,830
Apply some ice on it.

138
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,750
No need.

139
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,930
Come on, Director Xiao.

140
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,030
Let me change my shoes.

141
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,750
No need. Come on in.

142
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,630
Come on in.

143
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,830
I'll get you some ice.

144
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,910
Hello, Director.

145
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,030
Hello, Director.

146
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,360
This is not a home visit. Why do you bow?

147
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,830
Look at these kids.

148
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,870
Director Xiao really has authority.

149
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,070
They immediately behaved themselves.

150
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,470
Mom, this is Director Xiao

151
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,030
from the school, right?

152
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,770
Hello, Director Xiao.

153
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,310
Director Xiao.

154
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,710
I'm so happy that you're here.

155
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,550
Let me do it.

156
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,880
You're more beautiful

157
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:39,710
than I heard.

158
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,950
Aunt...

159
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,070
My mom.

160
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,270
Baoshan told me

161
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:44,890
that

162
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,530
Aunt and Uncle are here for the Chinese New Year.

163
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,030
Happy Chinese New Year, Uncle.

164
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,110
I came in a hurry today

165
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,070
so I didn't prepare anything.

166
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,950
Sorry.

167
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,710
Let me tell you.

168
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,110
No need to prepare anything.

169
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,350
Everyone here is one of us.

170
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,510
There's nothing to prepare.

171
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,690
Make yourself at home.

172
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,410
We're lucky to have you here.

173
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,390
Say something.

174
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,650
Hello, Director Xiao.

175
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,670
Uncle.

176
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,250
Just call me Xiao Fang.

177
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,310
I'm flattered.

178
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,950
Listen, Director.

179
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,590
You've helped Baoyu

180
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,820
a lot.

181
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,480
So we are very happy

182
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,670
that you came.

183
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,310
Mom, I'm Jia Baoshan, what Baoyu?

184
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:19,630
Is that a name

185
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,910
for a true man?

186
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,240
You forgot your origin.

187
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,170
The name given by your parents

188
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,390
is Jia Baoyu.

189
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,630
You should take it to the grave.

190
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,270
That name, Jia Baoyu,

191
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,630
was given by Cao Xueqin.

192
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,920
What does that have to do with you?

193
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,470
Mom, look at you.

194
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,600
Can't you read?

195
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:31,860
Your knowledge

196
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,030
of Dream of the Red Chamber

197
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,310
has really become a part of you.

198
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,430
Look at you.

199
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,350
See?

200
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,510
-Don't just stand here.
-Come.

201
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,310
Have a seat.

202
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,330
-Okay.
-Right.

203
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,550
Open your mouth.

204
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,430
Drink it.

205
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,550
What is this?

206
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,510
I'm afraid you'll drink at night.

207
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,230
Finish it.

208
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,530
I'm on duty. I won't drink.

209
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,110
It's good for your stomach.

210
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,670
It's the Chinese New Year.

211
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,070
Yet you drugged me.

212
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,630
Look at you.

213
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,030
Why do you have to be on duty

214
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,310
every New Year's Eve?

215
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,190
Then who should I assign to be on duty?

216
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,490
Then why does the factory manager

217
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,150
never take a duty shift every year?

218
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,150
You think you are so capable.

219
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,990
It's because I'm not the factory manager.

220
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,480
If you make me the factory manager, just wait and see.

221
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,790
I'll take a shift on New Year's Eve

222
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,910
and set an example.

223
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,150
What's going on, Dad?

224
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,350
Are you going to be the factory manager?

225
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,630
Can I

226
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,390
smoothly take over

227
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,590
and become the director?

228
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,670
First, you can smoothly get lost.

229
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,630
Go over there.

230
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,750
Come here.

231
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,390
Why did you kick him?

232
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,100
Take it off.

233
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,640
Am I not wearing it anymore?

234
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,049
It's a new year.

235
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,350
We have to switch to a new one.

236
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,050
Last year was quite good.

237
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,080
I'll keep you safe.

238
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,760
This one is fine too.

239
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,240
May it keep our Li Si

240
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,430
safe and sound this year as well.

241
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,050
No, you tied me up again.

242
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,080
I'll take the old one.

243
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,280
Wait.

244
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,560
Is this all we're eating for the New Year?

245
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,310
Your dad still has to

246
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,240
go on duty later.

247
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,070
There are still customers at the restaurant.

248
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,000
Hurry up and eat while there's time.

249
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,230
Seriously, who does this?

250
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,580
Running off on New Year's Eve?

251
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,010
This is our New Year's Eve dinner!

252
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,370
What's so special about New Year's Eve dinner?

253
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,670
Have we treated you poorly

254
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,190
usually?

255
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,870
Regular meals are different from

256
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,310
New Year's Eve dinner.

257
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,270
We'll have fewer chances to have a New Year's Eve dinner.

258
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:19,950
Why can't you

259
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,550
talk properly

260
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,550
with your mouth?

261
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,280
I'm getting frustrated with both of you during the New Year.

262
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,880
Go help out at

263
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,070
your mom's restaurant later.

264
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,400
If you don't go, I'll deal with you myself.

265
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,490
I want to eat pork knuckles.

266
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,820
You look like a big pork knuckle yourself.

267
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,960
Can you stop shouting?

268
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,410
Son, be good.

269
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,980
Eat the dumpling first.

270
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,750
It's mutton stuffing.

271
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,590
I made it specially for you.

272
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,510
I'll make a call in a bit

273
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,230
and have them deliver it.

274
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,600
You're spoiling him.

275
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,450
Bring me a bottle of liquor too.

276
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,070
Didn't you say you weren't drinking today?

277
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:53,770
I've taken the medicine.

278
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,970
Wouldn't drinking protect my stomach?

279
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,510
Just spoil him.

280
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,880
He doesn't look like me.

281
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,110
Eat your food.

282
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,510
Why are you so talkative?

283
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,730
Come on. Have one too.

284
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,790
Mom, how much lucky money

285
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,110
are you giving to me this year?

286
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,070
How old are you?

287
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,990
Why do you still want money?

288
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,870
No, you should still give me what I'm supposed to get.

289
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,190
No way, there's none for you.

290
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,520
Then how much are you giving to my brother?

291
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,980
It's rare for him to come back.

292
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,830
He's so grown up,

293
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,630
what does he need lucky money for?

294
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,390
See.

295
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,240
Aunt Yue.

296
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,290
This past year, my dad has been busy with work,

297
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,910
and he's not the type to say sweet things.

298
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,070
You've been the one

299
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,620
taking care of everything.

300
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,040
You must have suffered a lot.

301
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:28,680
Here.

302
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,920
Let me toast you first.

303
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,680
Why are you being so formal all of a sudden?

304
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,160
Come on.

305
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,990
I never have a hard time.

306
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,120
Everything's fine.

307
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,180
Here.

308
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,070
Drink slowly.

309
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,750
Don't drink too much.

310
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,150
Have some more food.

311
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,550
Have some more food, Tao.

312
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,630
The dumplings are so delicious.

313
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,350
-Right?
-I think so too.

314
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,460
Is it because Tao is back?

315
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,510
Of course.

316
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,430
It's specially made for Tao.

317
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,800
Here, Dad.

318
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,690
You're biased.

319
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,390
Don't toast me. Just eat.

320
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,330
-Dad, it's rare for me
-Hurry up and eat.

321
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,420
to come back.

322
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,660
Fine. Come on.

323
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,030
Dad, don't always focus so much on work.

324
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,340
Put more effort into the family.

325
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,780
The home is your real battlefield.

326
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,980
Yes, come on.

327
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,000
Take it easy.

328
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,430
Although Min

329
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,670
is no longer a child,

330
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,150
she's still the youngest in our family.

331
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,230
From now on, she will be

332
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,630
the focus of our protection.

333
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,760
When I'm not at home,

334
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,950
you two must make sure that

335
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,550
Min isn't treated unfairly.

336
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,590
Do you hear me?

337
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,670
Is it true that our brother is always worried about you,

338
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,000
afraid that we won't take good care of you?

339
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,180
With my brother backing me up,

340
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,510
my status in the family is quite high.

341
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:40,990
Here, Brother.

342
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,070
-I toast you.
-It's quite high.

343
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:42,670
Come on.

344
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,240
Today is really joyful.

345
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,590
So happy.

346
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,870
Mom, let me pour you some liquor.

347
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,430
Come on, let's pour the drinks ourselves.

348
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,990
Mom.

349
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:50,570
All right.

350
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,410
Come on, Dad.

351
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,750
Here, honey.

352
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,910
Come on.

353
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,150
Why don't you have a drink too?

354
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,990
Director Xiao, have some.

355
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,030
No, thanks.

356
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,230
She can drink.

357
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,780
Drink some if you can drink.

358
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,080
Pour her a little.

359
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,830
I want to thank my wife.

360
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,820
Here you go.

361
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,310
Thank you.

362
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,510
Alright, let me say a few words.

363
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,010
Okay.

364
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,150
The country has its laws, and the family has its rules.

365
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,030
You can tell

366
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:13,950
how well a household is managed

367
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,590
by looking at the one in charge.

368
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,850
As the old saying goes,

369
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,630
'May there be wealth and abundance, year after year.'

370
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,690
Guests come first.

371
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,130
Today, I want to present the first fish

372
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,930
to our most honored guest.

373
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,900
Fang.

374
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,270
Here.

375
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:26,830
Fang.

376
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,190
Thank you, Aunt.

377
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,750
Spring silkworms spin till death, running out of yearning thread;

378
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,990
Burning "candies" weep, till no more tears.

379
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,630
Grandma,

380
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,350
it's "candles".

381
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,830
What? They're almost the same.

382
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,820
The candles.

383
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,710
Yes, they're the same.

384
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,110
Both mean the same thing.

385
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,710
That's good then.

386
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,790
Here's the second one.

387
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,190
I'll give Shanqing,

388
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,750
the great scientist.

389
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,950
Even Beethoven said,

390
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,080
"Through suffering, we move toward joy."

391
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,350
-Thank you, Grandma.
-Grandma.

392
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,150
Beethoven was a pianist.

393
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,580
He could play the piano?

394
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,350
Alright, now

395
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,710
I'm giving it to my son-in-law.

396
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,060
When he's outside,

397
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,230
he saves lives. How noble it is.

398
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,410
At home,

399
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,230
he shows unity, mutual assistance, and dedication.

400
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,350
Thank you, Mom, your summary

401
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,630
is very accurate.

402
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,030
Now I feel a bit embarrassed.

403
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,030
Don't flatter me.

404
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,150
Guess who I'm giving this fish to.

405
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,170
I give it to my daughter.

406
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,220
Yu,

407
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,790
only a mother knows

408
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,070
the pain and happiness of being a mother.

409
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:19,800
Understand?

410
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,590
Thank you, Mom. Thank you.

411
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,430
Here, this one

412
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,600
is for Miaomiao.

413
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,590
Thank you, Grandma.

414
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,310
Miaomiao, Yaya, come on.

415
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,270
One for each of you.

416
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,400
Thank you, Grandma.

417
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,590
Take it.

418
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,350
Take good care of your parents.

419
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:32,910
Got it?

420
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,840
-Yes.
-Thank you, Grandma.

421
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,750
Okay.

422
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,030
Let's have a drink.

423
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,270
What should Baoshan and I eat?

424
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,750
Didn't I tell you just now?

425
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,430
The country has its laws, and the family has its rules.

426
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,720
There are rewards and punishments.

427
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,310
Think about last year,

428
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,870
what contributions did you make to this family?

429
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,750
What have you done?

430
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,630
Just eating a couple of green onions

431
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,670
-is pretty good, isn't it?
-No, Mom.

432
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,040
-Last year, I...
-Shut up.

433
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,670
Objection!

434
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,430
Overrule.

435
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,130
Come on.

436
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,030
Let's eat.

437
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,390
Happy Chinese New Year, everyone.

438
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:56,910
Happy Chinese New Year.

439
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,640
Wishing everyone good health!

440
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,030
Coming.

441
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,710
-Xiaowa.
-Happy Chinese New Year, Aunt.

442
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,870
Happy Chinese New Year.

443
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,670
Come on in.

444
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,030
No, thanks.

445
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,750
This is the New Year's goods

446
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,790
we prepared ourselves.

447
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,820
My grandpa sent me to pay a New Year's visit.

448
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,010
So many?

449
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,830
Please convey my gratitude to your grandpa.

450
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,500
We've enjoyed a lot of your family's fish

451
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,050
in the past year.

452
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,470
Mom, my grandma is calling you.

453
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,120
Go now.

454
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,120
Thank you.

455
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,280
Why don't you come in?

456
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,510
I'm going to pay a New Year's visit to the principal.

457
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,870
So I'm going in.

458
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,120
What is this?

459
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,420
Dumplings with wild vegetable stuffing.

460
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,730
I made the wrappers myself.

461
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,790
I don't know if you can

462
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,710
get used to it.

463
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,430
I love wild vegetable dumplings.

464
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,890
My grandma loves them too.

465
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,950
That's good.

466
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,090
This is for you.

467
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,040
Happy Chinese New Year.

468
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,430
Xiaowa.

469
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,780
-Xiaowa is here too.
-Happy Chinese New Year.

470
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,350
Li Si, moving so many things,

471
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,870
have you emptied out your whole house?

472
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,190
Isn't Grandma and Grandpa here?

473
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,390
I have to behave well.

474
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,910
I'm leaving.

475
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,510
You're leaving?

476
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,280
My brother is back.

477
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,570
We'll go play with you later.

478
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,330
Okay.

479
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,850
Bye.

480
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,550
I'll go to your home to pay a New Year's visit later.

481
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,310
Bye, Xiaowa.

482
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,070
Bye.

483
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,960
What did Xiaowa bring?

484
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,190
Wild vegetable dumplings.

485
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,140
He made them myself.

486
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,710
Look, they smell so good.

487
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,730
Yaya, listen.

488
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,150
Wild vegetable dumplings.

489
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,030
Those are things that recall the sorrows of the past and savor the joys of the present.

490
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,670
Try one.

491
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,590
My grandma hasn't eaten yet.

492
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,270
Happy Chinese New Year, Grandma and Grandpa.

493
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,270
Hello, Grandma, Grandpa, Uncle.

494
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,230
Hello, Aunt. Happy Chinese New Year.

495
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,310
Li Si is here.

496
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,850
Come here. Take a seat.

497
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,640
You're all here.

498
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:56,910
Oh yeah.

499
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,830
Here.

500
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,560
I brought this

501
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,440
wild ginseng from the Changbai Mountain

502
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,160
for you two.

503
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,900
My mom wanted to

504
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,790
give it to my grandma, but I didn't let her.

505
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,520
I brought it to you two instead.

506
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,430
My grandson-in-law is so generous.

507
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:08,990
Grandma.

508
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,990
You'll make a fortune in the future.

509
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,070
What grandson-in-law?

510
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,110
Grandma, try it.

511
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,230
They're wild vegetable dumplings, given by Xiaowa.

512
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:15,950
Great.

513
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:16,900
Grandma,

514
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,070
I'll treat you well in the future.

515
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,590
Tell me what you want to eat.

516
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,710
If you like wild vegetable dumplings,

517
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,570
I have some too.

518
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,110
Not only does it fill you up, but it's also delicious.

519
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,120
Good.

520
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,500
That's great.

521
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,350
You know what?

522
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,990
Since the older generation has already

523
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,950
made their decisions,

524
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:29,970
as the younger generation,

525
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,770
we shouldn't keep pushing back.

526
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,770
By the way, look.

527
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,230
I knew Yuan Shanqing

528
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:35,970
and Zi were here.

529
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:36,570
Look.

530
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,390
I brought Zi a little doll.

531
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,120
-That's great.
-Do you like it?

532
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,700
-That's great.
-Thank you, Si.

533
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,360
No worries. As long as Zi likes it.

534
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,470
How nice he is.

535
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:44,950
Grandpa.

536
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,310
-He's thoughtful.
-How's your health?

537
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,230
Not bad.

538
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,500
Your grandma didn't piss me off to that extent.

539
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,570
Don't believe him.

540
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,650
He's just nagging.

541
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,150
When did I piss you off?

542
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,630
Brother.

543
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,630
Happy Chinese New Year, Miaomiao.

544
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,830
Come on in.

545
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,030
Brother's here.

546
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,190
My brother is more handsome now.

547
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,790
Anyway, he's from a big city.

548
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:03,870
Have a seat.

549
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,069
Why bother buying things? It's just wasting money.

550
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,589
Look at these things.

551
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:07,869
Really.

552
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,740
Grandpa, Grandma.

553
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,640
This is the egg waffle I queued up to buy for you

554
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,710
from the most famous pastry shop

555
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,230
in Shenzhen.

556
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,730
Really?

557
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,960
This is great.

558
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,880
It's a pity if

559
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:18,829
Si doesn't go on to be a leader after this.

560
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,760
He will at least be a section chief.

561
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,190
Did you change your shampoo?

562
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,030
No.

563
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:26,230
My brother bought me perfume.

564
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:27,770
It smells good.

565
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,860
It smells different from that rouge.

566
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,260
He bought it in Hong Kong.

567
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,430
Your brother is so nice.

568
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,030
He even went to Hong Kong to buy it for you.

569
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,030
Who knows?

570
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,380
What do you think? I'll listen to you.

571
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,550
It's specially for you.

572
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,200
Let me see.

573
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:40,930
Do you like it?

574
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,930
Thank you, Brother. It's so pretty.

575
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,630
Try it.

576
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,430
Miaomiao is more beautiful now.

577
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,470
Why do they have gifts?

578
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,790
I don't have any gifts.

579
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,420
-So many things.
-I'll give it secretly

580
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,370
to you later.

581
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,070
Aunt isn't here yet.

582
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,530
-It's time to receive red packets.
-Aunt Yu.

583
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,870
-Here.
-Thank you, Aunt.

584
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,200
Happy Chinese New Year.

585
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,100
It's not yours.

586
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,040
Yang Tao is back. Come on.

587
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,130
I'm too old to receive red packets.

588
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,830
No need.

589
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,190
You're all kids before getting married.

590
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,470
Shangqing, Zi.

591
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,110
One for each of you.

592
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,110
She even prepared for Zi.

593
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,620
You see. Since you and your sister

594
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,030
were that tall,

595
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,630
I've been giving you red packets.

596
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,110
This rule can't be broken.

597
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,470
Yang Tao, you can't grow any taller.

598
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,630
If you grow any more, you'll be hitting the ceiling.

599
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,670
I'm 22 already, Aunt Yu.

600
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,000
I won't grow any taller.

601
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,750
Then let's have lunch at home.

602
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,910
-By the way, Min and I...
-Okay.

603
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,270
We still have some New Year's goods to deliver.

604
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,390
Once we finish delivering these in the next couple of days,

605
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,550
I'll come over and have a drink with you.

606
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,640
Okay.

607
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,610
Why did you take it off?

608
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,160
It's a bit prickly.

609
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,140
The wool is usually prickly.

610
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,310
Tao told me

611
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,700
he bought cashmere.

612
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,440
Cashmere doesn't feel prickly at all.

613
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,330
Smell it.

614
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,450
This isn't cashmere.

615
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,070
It's mixed

616
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,900
with a little bit of wool.

617
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,530
I don't know much about this.

618
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,820
It's okay. Tao doesn't have much money.

619
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,860
It's expensive to buy cashmere.

620
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,460
How come he doesn't have money?

621
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,310
Look at him.

622
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,550
He works outside

623
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,210
and works part-time at school.

624
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,190
He earns more than you.

625
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,820
So it should be cashmere.

626
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,830
What do you mean?

627
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,610
Everyone else is good.

628
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,830
They are all better than me.

629
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,890
Only I am terrible.

630
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,470
You misunderstood.

631
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,030
I mean,

632
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,670
you thought Tao

633
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,750
didn't have money to buy cashmere.

634
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,950
Is it that as soon as someone mentions your son,

635
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,430
you can talk endlessly?

636
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,790
-How about...
-Fine.

637
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,910
I was wrong.

638
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,270
Fine.

639
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,590
I'll stop.

640
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,950
You can't stop.

641
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,180
You have to tell me.

642
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,390
Didn't you say I was wrong?

643
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,070
What did I do wrong?

644
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,680
Tell me.

645
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,230
I didn't say you were wrong.

646
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,870
I mean you got it wrong.

647
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,830
How was I wrong?

648
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,570
I'm just afraid that he might be cheated.

649
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,230
The money spent was for buying cashmere,

650
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,510
but he ended up with a mixed-fabric sweater.

651
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,400
What did I do wrong?

652
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,470
You even took it to another level,

653
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,470
saying I can't do anything,

654
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,670
that I don't earn money.

655
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,390
Yes, I don't earn money.

656
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,630
I'm busy every day at home,

657
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,590
managing everything.

658
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,510
If you calculate all this

659
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,670
as nanny expenses,

660
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,710
see how much I could earn.

661
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,430
What does this have to do with a nanny?

662
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,510
I'm worse than a nanny.

663
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,170
Did you marry a woman?

664
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,430
Did you marry a woman?

665
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,760
You married a free nanny.

666
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,470
Do I deserve it?

667
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,110
Is this how I

668
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,630
should be serving you all?

669
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,750
You're really calculating.

670
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,870
We are a family.

671
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,150
What kind of calculating is this?

672
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,440
What do you mean by family?

673
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,550
What do you mean by family?

674
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,430
Did your mom speak anything to me

675
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,630
on the phone yesterday?

676
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,640
Not a word.

677
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,270
When did she treat me

678
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,960
like family?

679
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,550
Can we not quarrel during the Chinese New Year?

680
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,190
Our son

681
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,160
bought it specially for you.

682
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,350
Don't call him our son.

683
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,040
That's your son.

684
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,070
Not my son.

685
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,160
What did you say?

686
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,650
Min.

687
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,750
Tao.

688
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,870
Min.

689
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,780
How could she say that about you?

690
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,110
She's in menopause.

691
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:07,990
It's cold outside.

692
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,230
Let's talk at home.

693
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,030
Why should I go home?

694
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,180
To watch them fight

695
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:11,790
and listen to her

696
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,860
say those hurtful things to you?

697
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,110
I think Aunt Yue

698
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,730
didn't mean that.

699
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,360
Brother,

700
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,870
stop acting foolish.

701
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,480
That's what she meant.

702
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,150
Don't you know what's going on between them

703
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,350
all these years?

704
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,460
Let's not shout on the street

705
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,090
during the Chinese New Year.

706
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,630
I don't care.

707
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,670
Am I still afraid that

708
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,780
If I shout here,

709
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,230
others will mock me?

710
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,070
By the time I jumped into the river,

711
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,030
everyone had already seen me as a joke

712
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,310
long enough.

713
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,400
When did you jump into the river?

714
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,530
I...

715
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,970
I was just trying to scare them.

716
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:41,850
It was not real.

717
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,830
Why didn't anyone

718
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,890
tell me about this?

719
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,230
Xiaowa.

720
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,360
Happy Chinese New Year.

721
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,750
Happy Chinese New Year.

722
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,470
You scared me.

723
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,610
Brother.

724
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,070
Brother, my classmates are here.

725
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,930
Brother, Happy Chinese New Year.

726
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,870
-We've always heard about you
-Happy Chinese New Year.

727
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,710
from Xiaowa.

728
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,180
Miaomiao, right?

729
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,860
Xiaowa always talks about you.

730
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,110
Didn't Xiaowa mention me?

731
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,470
Are you Li Si?

732
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,050
Si.

733
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:16,750
Don't.

734
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,890
-Cut the vegetables.
-Just...

735
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,930
Just call me Li.

736
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,560
It's thanks to you both for taking care of Xiaowa

737
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,070
while he attends school there.

738
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,640
Thank you.

739
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,920
No need. We are brothers.

740
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,780
Right, Xiaowa?

741
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,550
And Xiaowa has the best grades

742
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,270
among us.

743
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,590
We have to rely on him.

744
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,610
Where's Grandpa?

745
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,070
Is he not here?

746
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,890
He went to pay New Year's visits.

747
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,030
Well, Brother,

748
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,310
I don't know what you like to eat,

749
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,270
so I simply bought something.

750
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:38,950
Thank you.

751
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:39,590
Thank you, Si.

752
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,470
No worries. It's not expensive.

753
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:40,990
Come on.

754
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,090
Let's go inside. It's windy outside.

755
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:42,880
Let's go.

756
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,230
Let's go.

757
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,690
Have you finished eating?

758
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,270
Brother, look at that.

759
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,190
Sugar figures.

760
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:48,910
Do you want it?

761
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,100
He's putting a flower on top. Look.

762
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,420
It's pink, so beautiful.

763
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,290
It's stuck.

764
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,630
Done.

765
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,670
Fifty.

766
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,900
Awesome.

767
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,470
[Cotton Candy]

768
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,510
Add the sugar in.

769
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:20,830
Boss, here's the money.

770
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,470
Okay.

771
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,800
Look at your sister's. It's so big.

772
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,500
Go, hit her.

773
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,350
Fuqiang,

774
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,830
take a photo of us.

775
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,290
Okay, no problem. Come on.

776
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,200
Come on. Three, two, one. Cheese.

777
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,430
Yes.

778
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,510
So, when it comes to finding a partner,

779
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,330
you need to consider the person's family.

780
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,810
Is their family harmonious?

781
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,510
-What is the family atmosphere like?
-Yes.

782
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,030
Look.

783
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,750
If the parents have a good relationship,

784
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,400
then the whole family

785
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,390
will definitely have a good atmosphere.

786
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,030
-Of course.
-You know, right?

787
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:02,920
They will be very harmonious.

788
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,400
And then, regarding the children's views

789
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,630
on love and marriage,

790
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,870
they will be positively guided

791
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:07,800
and influenced.

792
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,990
So, when you're looking for a partner,

793
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,750
you should definitely seek out this kind of family atmosphere

794
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,480
that's harmonious and joyful.

795
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,470
We...

796
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,140
Be careful with your waist.

797
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,670
I'm fine.

798
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,020
What am I trying to tell you?

799
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,680
Well,

800
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,800
my parents.

801
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,970
I'm not bragging.

802
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:26,790
Both of them

803
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,080
have been together for decades.

804
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,480
They are so close.

805
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,020
Even now,

806
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,150
they're still romantic

807
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,100
like young people like us.

808
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,270
None of them can leave each other.

809
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,260
Really?

810
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,350
It's not that I gave you

811
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,070
too much pocket money.

812
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,070
I showed you too much respect.

813
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,990
Do you know that

814
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,470
you're being too bold?

815
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,660
You dared to smoke behind my back.

816
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,590
I'm telling you,

817
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,330
if we can get along, let's still be together;

818
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,190
if we can't, then let's separate.

819
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,220
Fang.

820
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,190
Fang, what brings you here?

821
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:51,910
Uncle, Aunt.

822
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,110
I didn't prepare anything

823
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,310
when I came yesterday.

824
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,150
So I bought some

825
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,190
for you today.

826
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,610
You're too courteous.

827
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,710
Are you stupid?

828
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,590
There are so many things.

829
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,670
Yet you're still carrying them?

830
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,430
Slow down.

831
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,630
His dad is so nice to me.

832
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,430
He cared about me,

833
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,310
worried that I would get tired.

834
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,350
He insisted on

835
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,190
carrying all those things by himself,

836
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,510
treating me like a child,

837
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,110
and even bought me tanghulu.

838
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,680
Where is the tanghulu?

839
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,500
Did you lose it?

840
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,310
Let it be.

841
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,390
Look at this hand.

842
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,390
Look at this hand.

843
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,870
His hand is so numb that he can't move it.

844
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,670
He's so tired. Look at him.

845
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:22,150
-Let me blow it for you.
-They're very close.

846
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,770
Blow it.

847
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,660
Fang.

848
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,090
You must be upset

849
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,580
for not going back home during the Chinese New Year, right?

850
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,830
No, I'm not a kid anymore.

851
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,640
The transportation is inconvenient in my hometown.

852
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,150
It's a hassle to go back.

853
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,200
Plus, it's hard to get tickets now.

854
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,070
Baoshan tried to buy it for me,

855
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:45,830
but he couldn't get any.

856
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,640
Exactly.

857
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,070
Baoshan spent the night there

858
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,470
with a quilt.

859
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,070
He came back with a pale face.

860
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:51,830
If I had known,

861
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,700
I definitely wouldn't have let him go.

862
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,350
A man

863
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,030
should do things for the woman he likes.

864
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,710
It's his duty.

865
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,270
No.

866
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,220
-Come on.
-We...

867
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,930
Have some food while talking.

868
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,510
I'll go clean up in the kitchen.

869
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,500
Mom, don't talk too much.

870
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,950
Don't scare Fang.

871
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,030
So diligent. He's a good man.

872
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,160
Aunt, we're not in that relationship.

873
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,120
Sooner or later.

874
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,010
You two are destined to be together.

875
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,280
Look at you.

876
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,790
You achieved success at a young age,

877
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,980
while he flourished later in life.

878
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,660
You are a match made in heaven.

879
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:24,480
Really?

880
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,120
Yes, don't be fooled

881
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,300
by our Baoyu's carefree attitude.

882
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,630
He's kind and smart.

883
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,390
He just hasn't hit the right timing.

884
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,340
Yes, he said it himself.

885
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,910
He's just like a tiger that has fallen to the plains.

886
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,030
He was bragging.

887
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,030
He's not much better

888
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,920
than the wild dogs in the village.

889
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:41,990
I can't praise him

890
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,090
just because he's my son.

891
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,240
When it comes to marriage,

892
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,880
it mainly depends on the person

893
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,750
and whether they have a good heart.

894
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,080
This is very important.

895
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:49,900
Yes.

896
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,390
Well,

897
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,160
how to find a good person?

898
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,830
When you look at someone,

899
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,750
you have to consider their family.

900
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,790
If a man

901
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,000
is unmanly at home,

902
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,110
he can still work hard outside

903
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,810
and people will praise him

904
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,600
for treating his wife well at home.

905
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,590
If a woman can't hold her own

906
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,550
at home,

907
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,410
then it's over.

908
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,310
Not only will outsiders look down on her,

909
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,950
but if the wife isn't feeling well,

910
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,160
the whole family won't feel comfortable.

911
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,400
You're right.

912
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,910
My mom's in charge of my family.

913
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,230
My family is fine,

914
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,490
but not my aunt.

915
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,590
She's always suffering

916
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,830
and keeps fighting.

917
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,990
Right?

918
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,570
Isn't that proof?

919
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,200
Yes.

920
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,080
So, in living your life,

921
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:27,870
you should find a man

922
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,680
who has a sense of responsibility.

923
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,000
A responsible man

924
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,760
can make the days

925
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,490
without love

926
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,230
rich and fulfilling,

927
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,190
bringing you a sense of security.

928
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,580
Aunt, you're amazing.

929
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,480
What you're saying is simple and easy to understand.

930
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,390
No wonder Uncle

931
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,650
listens to you so much.

932
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,550
I was indeed pretty

933
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,870
when I was young.

934
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,710
If it weren't for a moment of confusion,

935
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,430
I definitely could have married a deputy factory manager.

936
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,070
Auntie, you're so humorous.

937
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,990
Do you know how to read faces?

938
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,670
Aunt,

939
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,990
look at my face.

940
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:58,470
Can my career

941
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,150
advance further?

942
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,560
Of course.

943
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,780
Look at you.

944
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,440
You have a broad forehead

945
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,520
and a rounded lower part.

946
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,780
Especially this nose.

947
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,450
Lucky nose.

948
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:10,870
What's your position now?

949
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,360
The Director of Teaching and Discipline.

950
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,490
Director of Teaching and Discipline?

951
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,370
Alright, within three years,

952
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,100
you will be the vice principal.

953
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:22,580
[Windward]

954
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,750
Yes.

955
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,150
Old man.

956
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,990
You scared me.

957
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,430
Put it out.

958
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,240
Did your mom see it?

959
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,110
No.

960
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,750
She can't take care of you now.

961
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,870
She was telling Fang that

962
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,590
she could have married the factory manager

963
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,630
when she was young,

964
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,350
but ended up marrying you

965
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,350
out of confusion.

966
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
Who was confused?

967
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,550
Your mother was confused?

968
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,940
I was confused.

969
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,190
Marrying the factory manager?

970
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,230
Was that factory manager crazy

971
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,270
or had water gotten into his brain

972
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,400
to dare to marry her?

973
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,500
Let me tell you, son,

974
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,880
I was confused back then

975
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,450
and got tricked by your mom.

976
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,670
She told me

977
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,470
she has a fate that brings good fortune to her husband.

978
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,670
Brings good fortune?

979
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,330
What kind of good fortune?

980
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,120
I'm about to retire,

981
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,320
and I haven't even become a team leader.

982
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,830
And she talks about bringing good fortune?

983
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,230
My whole life

984
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,470
has been delayed by her.

985
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,800
Dad, stop smoking.

986
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,770
If Mom finds out,

987
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,310
you'll have delayed me too.

988
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:32,910
Son,

989
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,890
I think this chubby girl is pretty good.

990
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,920
Can you two make it work?

991
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,000
Dad, I...

992
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,500
To be honest,

993
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,590
at the beginning,

994
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,990
I really didn't want to do anything.

995
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:48,820
But

996
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,550
for some reason,

997
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,870
I don't know why.

998
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,590
Somehow I'm a little panicked.

999
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,440
Feeling panicked?

1000
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,480
A little.

1001
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,480
The book "Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio" says it well,

1002
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,550
"People panic when they meet ghosts."

1003
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,500
Who is the ghost?

1004
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,180
Love.

1005
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,790
Love.

1006
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,420
[Carefree]

1007
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,400
Don't prick your fingers.

1008
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,880
How could I possibly prick my fingers after sewing for a lifetime?

1009
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,350
I'm fine. Don't worry.

1010
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,110
Grandma.

1011
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:28,740
My grandpa said

1012
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,960
he couldn't find his socks.

1013
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,230
Let him barefoot.

1014
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,150
Here, your vest is ready.

1015
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,070
Try it on.

1016
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,060
It's quite soft.

1017
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,820
It's warm and soft.

1018
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:41,890
Perfect.

1019
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:44,990
Perfect.

1020
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,830
Didn't you say

1021
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,510
Zi will leave in a few days?

1022
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,500
She just knew how to speak.

1023
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,230
Why are you in a hurry to go back?

1024
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:51,990
Grandma,

1025
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,160
she can't live in our house forever.

1026
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,900
Shanqing is worried about causing you trouble.

1027
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,400
What trouble? I'll take care of Zi.

1028
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:57,800
I...

1029
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,390
I'm so willing to do so.

1030
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,350
Bring back

1031
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,210
what she likes to eat later.

1032
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:01,810
-Okay.
-Okay.

1033
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,670
Thank you, Grandma.

1034
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,340
Good.

1035
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,150
How is it?

1036
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,020
Great.

1037
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,990
Isn't it nice?

1038
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,570
It fits you well.

1039
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,050
Grandma,

1040
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,080
you must live a long life.

1041
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,620
When I get married and have kids in the future,

1042
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,590
I need you to help me with babysitting.

1043
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,590
Don't worry,

1044
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,750
Grandma will at least live for another 20 years.

1045
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,310
No problem.

1046
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,710
No, make it 40 years.

1047
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:21,530
Then I'll turn into an old witch.

1048
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,700
Here, this is yours.

1049
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,190
-Mine?
-Put it on.

1050
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,300
All right. Yours is done too.

1051
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,790
My little granddaughter,

1052
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,430
you look good in anything.

1053
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,670
What do you think?

1054
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:33,710
This little beauty.

1055
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,530
There's nothing we can do. She's so good-looking.

1056
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,170
Alright,

1057
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,270
Grandma will make one for you

1058
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,790
each year,

1059
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,370
and then I'll feel at ease.

1060
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,070
But looking at so many pieces,

1061
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,730
Yaya and I can't wear them all.

1062
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,350
Do you think it's just you and Yaya who will wear them?

1063
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,390
There's also your mom.

1064
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,690
Your mom is my child too,

1065
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:49,530
right?

1066
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:50,890
And your uncle.

1067
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,080
Although your uncle is a loser,

1068
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,590
you can't dislike him

1069
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,120
just because he's useless.

1070
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,390
This world is so vast.

1071
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,390
There are not many

1072
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,520
successful people.

1073
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,470
For ordinary people,

1074
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,380
even if they're not successful,

1075
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,820
if they're healthy

1076
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,630
and can be good people,

1077
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,160
that's already a blessing for their parents.

1078
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:11,030
Then, Grandma, do you treat my dad

1079
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,310
like a little kid too?

1080
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,990
Of course.

1081
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,280
Since Pengfei married into the family,

1082
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,730
he's been my own son.

1083
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,670
You say, in this lifetime,

1084
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,000
how many people can call me "Mom"

1085
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,200
or call me "Grandma"?

1086
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,100
It's rare and all about fate.

1087
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,200
Even when you're 80,

1088
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,660
you're still my children.

1089
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:28,990
Grandma,

1090
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:29,990
this piece is so small,

1091
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,030
I can't wear it.

1092
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,430
You surely can't wear it.

1093
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,030
This is for Zi.

1094
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,070
Zi

1095
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,390
doesn't have parents or a grandmother.

1096
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,180
You can imagine how much suffering

1097
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,710
she has to endure to grow up.

1098
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,470
So I sewed her a little vest

1099
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:44,850
to let her know

1100
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:47,880
there are still people who care for her in this world.

1101
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,670
Here, look at these.

1102
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,280
They're all Grandma's,

1103
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,580
secretly put in

1104
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,710
for you.

1105
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,210
This is 100 yuan.

1106
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,170
This is a sycee.

1107
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,060
This is rice.

1108
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,160
This is a blessing.

1109
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,860
They're all sewed in here.

1110
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:04,690
I have one too.

1111
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,250
Everyone has one.

1112
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,100
What do you think?

1113
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,950
Grandma, you are so nice.

1114
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,620
I must live until 100 years old.

1115
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,720
A thousand years old.

1116
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,920
A thousand years old.

1117
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:15,970
You're back!

1118
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:16,930
Welcome back.

1119
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,650
Happy Chinese New Year.

1120
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,250
Happy Chinese New Year.

1121
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,630
Give them to me.

1122
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:18,219
Tao,

1123
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,409
don't take

1124
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,389
what I said yesterday

1125
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:27,230
personally.

1126
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,870
That's because

1127
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,600
I was quarreling with your dad.

1128
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,110
I didn't mean it.

1129
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,750
It's okay.

1130
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,719
Min told me

1131
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,150
she almost jumped into the river

1132
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,320
because of your quarrel.

1133
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,679
All these years, you and my dad

1134
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,409
have had a bumpy life together.

1135
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,239
Actually, I know all about it.

1136
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,949
It's been almost four years

1137
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,340
since I left home for school.

1138
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,909
I haven't really come back during the winter and summer breaks.

1139
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:56,989
When I told you

1140
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:59,790
I had to make up classes or work during my vacation,

1141
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,490
I was actually lying to you.

1142
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,460
I really understand Min.

1143
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,640
This is something I owe her.

1144
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,310
I avoided it

1145
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,910
and left her to face it alone.

1146
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,610
I was young before.

1147
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:12,850
I didn't know

1148
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,250
how to face these things.

1149
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,950
After I went to college

1150
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,710
and went to another city,

1151
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,150
I realized what freedom is.

1152
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,320
One year during the summer vacation of my sophomore year,

1153
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,920
I took a train to Guangzhou with my classmates.

1154
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,710
Next to us was a little boy

1155
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,270
with his mom and dad.

1156
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,390
His mom, being careless,

1157
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,270
left the luggage on the platform,

1158
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,750
but the train left,

1159
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,500
and they couldn't retrieve it.

1160
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,100
His dad said,

1161
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:41,070
"Your mom is such a silly goose."

1162
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,880
His mom kept laughing and said,

1163
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:46,450
"Looks like I've got early-onset Alzheimer's!"

1164
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,170
Then the boy said,

1165
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,720
"Luckily, I'm not like you two.

1166
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,850
I have a good memory.

1167
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,400
My backpack is still here!"

1168
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,420
And the three of them burst into laughter.

1169
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,660
I was sitting next to them

1170
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,120
and suddenly felt like crying.

1171
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,310
In that moment,

1172
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,950
I really envied

1173
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,210
their family of three.

1174
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,150
I was thinking,

1175
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,580
that if something like this happened in my family,

1176
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,310
we would have definitely been in a huge argument.

1177
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,360
That day, I realized

1178
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,440
that there can be such a lighthearted,

1179
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,970
joyful family atmosphere.

1180
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,820
I realized that a harmonious attitude

1181
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,030
between parents

1182
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,870
can help a child

1183
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,750
face difficulties

1184
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,870
without fear.

1185
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,340
From that moment on, I told myself

1186
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,350
that I didn't want to be influenced

1187
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,080
by the tension, indifference,

1188
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,080
and conflicts in my family anymore.

1189
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,430
I want to be a

1190
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,830
lighthearted and happy person.

1191
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,170
I don't want to live cautiously,

1192
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,090
being sensitive and suspicious

1193
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,010
like before.

1194
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,260
I wanted to break free from here.

1195
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,310
Aunt Yue.

1196
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,550
Over the years,

1197
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,280
you've worked hard to raise me,

1198
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,360
and I remember

1199
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,280
how much you've cared for this family.

1200
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,720
We are one family,

1201
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,350
and it's natural for families to have

1202
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,880
their ups and downs, right?

1203
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,390
But living life

1204
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,700
is not about competing with each other.

1205
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,620
Whether we have blood ties or not isn't important.

1206
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,670
How others view our family

1207
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,930
is also not important.

1208
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,340
What matters is that

1209
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,560
we are only responsible for ourselves

1210
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,170
and for our family.

1211
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,970
We only live for a few decades,

1212
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,370
and it's just this one family.

1213
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,390
I'm sorry.

1214
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,880
It's my fault.

1215
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,190
Okay, no more crying.

1216
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,170
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

1217
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,520
You've done really well, Aunt Yue.

1218
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,890
You've truly put in a lot of effort

1219
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,590
taking care of Dad and Min all these years.

1220
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,390
You've really worked hard.

1221
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,470
Alright, alright, no more crying.

1222
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,140
Do you know how many years it's been

1223
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,270
since my mom made this vest?

1224
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,380
It's as old-fashioned as can be.

1225
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,310
But I really like this vest.

1226
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:27,770
Do you remember

1227
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,780
the vest Mom made for us

1228
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,210
when we got married?

1229
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,460
How many years did we wear that vest?

1230
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,660
Even now, that vest

1231
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,880
has no empty spaces where the cotton is.

1232
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,460
Every stitch and thread

1233
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,840
is filled with love.

1234
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,530
I think it can last for another twenty years

1235
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,000
without any problem.

1236
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,360
You should flatter her in front of her.

1237
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,040
I'm not flattering her, you know?

1238
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,350
If I really do,

1239
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,290
I'll do it face-to-face.

1240
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,150
What I'm saying is from the heart.

1241
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,190
You see, many of our friends

1242
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:01,990
no longer have their moms.

1243
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:04,790
And we still have our mom making us little vests.

1244
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,080
How lucky we are!

1245
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,490
In this life,

1246
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,590
as long as we have our mom,

1247
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,640
there's no hardship.

1248
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,400
Look.

1249
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,550
We also have a vest

1250
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,060
made by Grandma.

1251
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,900
Someone cares for us now,

1252
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,030
so we won't feel cold anymore.

1253
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,990
Zi.

1254
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,340
Look.

1255
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,100
This is yellow.

1256
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,120
Yellow.

1257
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,270
That one.

1258
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,040
That's pink.

1259
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,510
And that. See?

1260
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,420
That's white.

1261
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:07,120
Zi. What color is

1262
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,480
your sister's clothes?

1263
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:13,630
Sister.

1264
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,300
Zi just called you Sister.

1265
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,080
Zi.

1266
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,720
Say it again.

1267
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,780
Sister.

1268
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,760
Sister.

1269
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,140
Zi, you're a good girl.

1270
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,390
I'm leaving, Grandpa.

1271
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,940
Let me see him out.

1272
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,060
Grandpa,

1273
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,350
take care of yourself.

1274
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,980
The New Year has passed,

1275
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,580
the winter vacation is over,

1276
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,520
and the people we miss have returned,

1277
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,920
but then they left again.

1278
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,020
The year 1998 has come to us.

1279
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,430
Grandma was eighteen

1280
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,940
when she got together with Grandpa,

1281
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,880
and they've been fighting for a lifetime.

1282
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,010
Grandma always says

1283
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,350
that the deputy factory manager liked her back then,

1284
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:35,390
but she still impulsively married Grandpa

1285
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,870
who had nothing.

1286
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,710
Grandpa didn't have any great skills,

1287
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:39,920
but he was good to Grandma

1288
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,050
and good to the kids,

1289
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:42,900
always cheerful every day.

1290
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:44,620
Parents often think

1291
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,580
that as long as they love their children, that's enough.

1292
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,020
But they don't realize

1293
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,220
how important

1294
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:50,620
a cheerful and laughter-filled home is

1295
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,740
for children.

1296
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,360
It determines whether you open the door each day

1297
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,730
to return to a safe harbor

1298
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:56,930
or step into a cellar.

1299
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,320
It also affects

1300
00:42:58,630 --> 00:42:59,410
whether, as you grow up,

1301
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,340
you still remember and are willing

1302
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,250
to open that door countless times.
