00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,180
Fang is here! Run!

194
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,850
It's already this hour.

195
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,230
Cheng Yaya is still not home yet.

196
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,500
He went to the arcade.

197
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,560
Hello? Hello?

198
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,920
Hello?

199
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,220
Cheng Yaya wouldn't be at the arcade.

200
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,670
What if he really went there?

201
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,200
There's a surprise inspection today.

202
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,470
The dean of students will call you later.

203
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,000
Don't say I didn't warn you.

204
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm not worried at all.

205
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,560
Last time you said

206
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,920
Yaya was in the arcade.

207
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,790
But what happened?

208
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,650
He was studying at the bookstore.

209
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,660
Cheng Miaomiao,

210
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,490
don't try to frame your brother.

211
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,490
Hello.

212
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,390
Can you stop hello?

213
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,650
Mr. Cheng Pengfei,

214
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,760
your wife is framing me.

215
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,480
Can't you see?

216
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,640
Don't you care?

217
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,840
I'm not good at studying,

218
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,910
but I'm honest.

219
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,440
Sit down.

220
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,240
John Doe once said

221
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,240
honesty is

222
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,240
the most valuable quality of a man.

223
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,990
John Doe also said

224
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,400
it's not a big deal

225
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,520
if you're not good at school.

226
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,480
It's not his call.

227
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,680
I have the final say in this family.

228
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,400
Go back to your room and do your homework.

229
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,280
Daiyu, John Doe

230
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,560
is not someone's name.

231
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,920
For example, this song

232
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,040
is very famous.

233
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,920
-But...
-Just shut up.

234
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,380
You are so knowledgeable.

235
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,440
Your son is always right.

236
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,680
I'm always wrong.

237
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,460
Why do you always take his side?

238
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,270
Me?

239
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,130
Cheng Miaomiao,

240
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,280
Think about it.

241
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,200
Since you were young,

242
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,800
haven't you always been the first to be considered?

243
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,440
Your brother

244
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,100
always wore your hand-me-downs.

245
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,680
You've always received the most red packet
money during Chinese New Year.

246
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,640
You pocket money has always been double

247
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,840
that of your brother's.

248
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,800
Those snacks at home

249
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,080
are all for you.

250
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,710
You even got the best bedroom.

251
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,560
Your brother has to sleep in the attic.

252
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,920
You're still strutting

253
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,470
around the house.

254
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,190
You still have a favorite. Favorite.

255
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,840
I have a favourite. Your dad...

256
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,470
Your dad is taking your side.

257
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,720
No no no. Not me.

258
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,360
When did I have a favorite?

259
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,880
I've always been fair and square.

260
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,720
When have you been fair?

261
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
Your daughter's behavior

262
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,270
is entirely a result of you spoiling her.

263
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,200
You only care about your daughter.

264
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,840
You're happy when you see your daughter.

265
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,000
Your son is ranked top one every year.

266
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,640
Look.

267
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,320
Look at the awards on the wall.

268
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,000
What an excellent kid.

269
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,890
I never need to worry about Yaya.

270
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
I know my own son.

271
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,820
He's so talented

272
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,600
and highly educated.

273
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,730
He must be studying in a bookstore now.

274
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,240
He can't go to the arcade.

275
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,520
Hello.

276
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,510
Answer it.

What? Where is Cheng Yaya?

281

Where is he?

282
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,690
-Cheng Pengfei, hurry up!
-Coming.

283
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,600
Change your shoes.

284
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,480
Don't let your feet get hurt.

285

Wait for me.

We're not concerned about causing trouble.

289
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,480
You snuck to the back of the mountain

290
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,200
in the middle of the night to rob a tomb.

291
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,140
It's very dangerous.

292
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,690
Yes.

293
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,920
Dad, Mom, we didn't rob a tomb.

[Cheng Yaya]

295
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,720
It was just a cave.

296
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,440
I just dug some stones.

297
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,520

[Wang Fuqiang] [Zhong Ruitao]

299
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,720
It used to be a tomb.

300
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,360
Then,

301
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,160
it was robbed by some criminals.

302
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,720
It ended up being a mess.

303
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,000
Let's put other things aside.

304
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,920
What if the tomb collapsed,

305
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,780
and buried you,

306
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,160
how would we rescue you?

307
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,090
Exactly.

Otherwise, I'd be scared to think about it.

Say thank you to him.

312
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,150
No need.

Weren't you at the hospital?

Why did you go to the arcade?

It didn't stop me from using a great tactic.

It wasn't a serious illness.

00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,830
Tell my mom that you

382
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,200
always go to the arcade with Cheng Yaya.

383
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,880
No.

384
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,440
This is what a traitor does.

385
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,960
I can't do that.

386
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,220
I'd rather get beaten.

387
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,069
Miaomiao, you are so mean.

388
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,940
You two go ahead. I'm going home.

389
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,910
Miss Hu Qiumin.

390
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,839
The organization needs you.

391
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,400
For the 5,000-word reflection,

392
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,680
let's split in two and eight.

393
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,810
I'll do the two and you two do the eight.

394
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Shameless!

395
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:26,089
What a bastard.

396
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,460
He's talented

397
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,010
and highly educated.

398
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,660
Stop it.

399
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,230
Stop the sarcasm.

400
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,990
If we don't get to the bottom of this,

401
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,650
no one is going to sleep today.

402
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,100
I'm fine with discussing.

403
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,070
You're not good either.

404
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,630
Stop crossing

405
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,400
your legs.

406
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,510
Put it down.

407
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,820
Yaya,

408
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,430
you have to learn your lesson.

409
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,910
You can't do this again.

410
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,080
I have a complaint.

411
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,680
Last week,

412
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,640
Cheng Yaya said he went to take a remedial class,

413
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,240
but he went to the back mountain

414
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,830
to roast potatoes with Zhong Ruitao and
Wang Fuqiang.

415
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,080
You're doing it again.

416
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,720
What bookstore?

417
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,650
-He went grave raiding.
-I didn't.

418
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,390
I was simply trying to find out

419
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,620
whose tomb it was.

420
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,920
Roasting potatoes.

421
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,680
When did I roast potatoes?

422
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,680
Shut up!

423
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,880
Cheng Yaya, I really...

424
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,610
I really didn't expect

425
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,520
that you are just like your sister.

426
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,000
The older you are, the more out of control
you become.

427
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,880
Are you both

428
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,940
going to a failure?

429
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:32,930
Mom,

430
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,440
I was just doing research.

431
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,320
What's there to research in that stupid
cave?

432
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,580
Learning to dig a hole?

433
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,660
I don't want it.

434
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,710
Go to that corner.

435
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,440
Stand there.

436
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,960
You too!

437
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,640
I didn't dig a cave.

438
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,910
What did I do?

439
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,280
I get punished when he's in trouble.

440
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,360
It's not fair. I don't want to.

441
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,180
Say that again!

442
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:10,980
Get over here.

443
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,010
You...

444
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,240
Listen to me.

445
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,800
Listen to me.

446
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,120
It really

447
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,760
has nothing to do with Miaomiao.

448
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,600
Cheng Pengfei, say one more thing.

449
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,160
And you also stand in the corner.

450
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,290
I haven't said anything about you yet.

451
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:27,410
[Oriented towards Moderalization]

452
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,200
Linqi No.2 High School

453
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,560
was awarded first place

454
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,040
among the excellent institutes

455
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,120
in the oil field.

456
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,320
We must organize an outstanding event.

457
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,640
I am confident to set an example

458
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,400
in the No.2 plant,

459
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,320
and even in the entire oil field.

460
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,440
I believe you are confident too.

461
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,840
Where were you?

462
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,440
Helping Mr. Li write the reflection.

463
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
We were just able to meet the word count.

464
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,660
How is the assembly progressing?

465
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,770
She just finished the serious topic.

466
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,430
I guess it's almost your turn.

467
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,280
That's all for the event.

468
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,110
Next, it's a punishment decision.

469
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,360
Li Si from Class 1, Grade 1.

470
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,360
Li Si.

471
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,640
Li Si.

472
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,060
Why are you hiding back there?

473
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,200
My stomach hurts.

474
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,680
You're not getting away

475
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,360
with your tricks. Get up here.

476
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,840
Faster.

477
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,550
Stand there.

478
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,860
Li Si from Class 1, Grade 1

479
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,420
was at the county farmer's market

480
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,760
at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday

481
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,680
with some idle people,

482
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,920
playing games.

483
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,350
It has caused a very negative impact.

484
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,640
It was reported by a classmate,

485
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,640
and verified by the school leaders.

486
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,770
Now I'll announce

487
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,130
the punishment result.

488
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,600
Li Si from Class 1, Grade 1

489
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,440
has repeatedly violated school rules, and

490
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,270
refused to disclose other students involved.

491
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,400
He has already

492
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,220
met the criteria for expulsion.

493
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,440
But the school

494
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,050
didn't want give up

495
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,760
any student,

496
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,990
and decided to be lenient with him.

497
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,900
His misbehavior is noted as a major demerit.

498
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,720
Next, Li Si will give

499
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,990
a reflective speech

500
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,610
to the entire school.

501
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,120
Hello.

502
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,170
What hello?

503
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,580
Dear teachers and students,

504
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,220
have committed...

505
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,360
Dean, I said it wrong.

506
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,200
This is the second page.

507
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,510
I can't find the first page.

508
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,080
I...

509
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,760
Let me say it again.

510
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,970
Well, I made a mistake.

511
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,650
The mistake I made

512
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,860
was a big mistake.

513
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,420
I wrote a reflection for nothing, loser.

514
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,840
I'm sorry, Dean.

515
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,840
I'm sorry, teacher and students.

516
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,910
Let me summarize.

517
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,680
I made a mistake.

518
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,040
I won't do it again.

519
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,840
Lastly,

520
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,360
I wish you all good health

521
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,840
and all the best. Thank you.

522
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,520
Get down.

523
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,100
Enough. Stop laughing.

524
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,800
Next, I'd like to share a compliment.

525
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,260
You really are something.

526
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,650
A major compliment is awarded to

527
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,720
Cheng Miaomiao from Class 1, Grade 1.

528
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,580
She

529
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,910
bravely reported

530
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,000
Li Si's misbehavior to the teachers.

531
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,110
Traitor!

Anti-Japanese hero, Yang Jingyu,

533
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,330

535
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,430

the same enemy.

538
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,160
That is a traitor.

539
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,030
Where are you going, Little Beard?

540
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,560
To the toilet.

541
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,280
There's a traitor

542
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,280
in our team.

543
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,380
You're still in the mood to go to the toilet?

544
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,020
Sit down.

545
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,630
Do you have any fundamental principles?

546
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,560
Do you have a basic understanding of right
and wrong?

547
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,320

548
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,540
as the monitor,

549
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,180
you have the obligation to uphold justice.

550
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,030
Which side are you on?

551
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,950
[Zhu Chao]

552
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,800
It occurs to me that

553
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,160
I need to go to the teacher's office.

554
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,020
I'll come back.

555
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,430
Look.

556
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,560
He's the next traitor.

557
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,420
His expression has betrayed him.

559
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,530
[Wei Xue]

560
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,440
You did make a mistake.

561
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,080
Yes.

562
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,080
You went to the arcade.

563
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
How dare you!

564
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,470
Fine, you guys have fallen too deep.

565
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,730
Today, I got betrayed.

566
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,120
You two will be betrayed tomorrow.

567
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,990
What to betray?

568
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,720
What did I do?

569
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,760
What did you do?

570
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,560
Didn't you break

571
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,030
the kettle in the teacher's office?

572
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,150
No, I didn't. It was an accident.

573
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,070
And you got a boyfriend.

574
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,880
When did I get a boyfriend?

575
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,320
I didn't even talk to him.

576
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,120
You can't tell right from wrong.

577
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,320
Let me tell you.

578
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,850
Even if I have to fight alone today,

579
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,160
I'll teach the traitor, Cheng Miaomiao

580
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,440
a lesson.

581
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,960
Who are you calling a traitor?

582
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,800
You.

583
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,930
I didn't expect

584
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,560
you to be the traitor.

585
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:02,840
Si.

586
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,360
This is Fang's mischief-making.

587
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,970
Then why did she criticize you first,

588
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,360
and then praise me?

589
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,520
She's trying to turn us

590
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,720
against each other.

591
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,600
That's right.

592
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,830
You two came up with

593
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,080
Mrs. Xiao's nickname.

594
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,860
You called her Fang so many years.

595
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,160
She must hold a grudge against you two.

596
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,600
Look.

597
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,930
Reason identified.

598
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,660
Si, we can't fall into the trap.

599
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,380
Stop quibbling, Cheng Miaomiao.

600
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,090
Listen.

601
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,800
you were the only one

602
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,800
singing Fang's song

603
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,760
in the corridor.

604
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,720
Don't blame me.

605
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,940
Okay, let's set

606
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,400
Fang aside for now.

607
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,200
Let's talk this out first.

608
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,920
I swear to God.

609
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,110
I didn't know you were at the arcade.

610
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,180
The person I reported to Fang

611
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,510
definitely wasn't you.

612
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,140
Who did you report?

613
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,070
Who I reported...

614
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,280
Who I reported doesn't matter.

615
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,100
Yes, it does.

616
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,680
It is very important.

617
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,170
This means you did report.

618
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,970
Look.

619
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,400
The crime of a traitor has been confirmed.

620
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,390
Cheng Miaomiao,

621
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,240
we've known each other since childhood.

622
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,200
Do you know

623
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,100
what your behaviour meant?

624
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,250
You betrayed your friend.

625
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,510
I've always listened to you since childhood,

626
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,640
yet you betrayed me.

627
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,050
Don't worry. I won't fall for your tricks again.

628
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,330
I have a brain now.

629
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:21,740
Oh no.

630
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,490
He got a brain now.

631
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,360
♫It's such a great honor to be an oil worker♫

634
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,760
Is Li Si going to

635
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,290
break up with you this time?

636
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,720
How many times have you betrayed me?

637
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,210
Have you ever succeeded?

638
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:15,960
Yu.

639
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,640
The ancients said that self-destruction is unforgivable.

640
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,350
Miaomiao is back.

641
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,230
Wash your hands and have dinner.

642
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,690
Cheng Miaomiao.

643
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,560
Get over here.

644
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:30,590
Go.

645
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,330
What I hate most in life is a traitor.

646
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,440
If Cheng Yaya told you about my secret,

647
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,680
isn't he a traitor?

648
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,480
That is reporting

649
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,480
your mishavior in school in time

650
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,340
in order not to

651
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,640
cause an irreversible mistake.

652
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,520
I was reporting the situation

653
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,710
to the teacher in time

654
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,470
to rescue my classmate.

655
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,720
To rescue me, right?

656
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,850
You thought I was at the arcade.

657
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,840
Oh my god.

658
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,880
Cheng Miaomiao.

659
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,600
You kept shouting that day

660
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,130
that Yaya was at the arcade.

661
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,800
I only thought

662
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,440
you were only naughty

663
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,440
and had bad grades

664
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,480
I really didn't

665
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,920
know you that well.

666
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,320
All these years,

667
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,230
exactly which part of the process

668
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,470
went wrong for you?

669
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,120
You have

670
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,520
flaws in your character.

671
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,910
Are you serious, Daiyu?

672
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,560
What does it have to do with her character?

673
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,120
Cheng Pengfei, don't meddle in.

674
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,910
Don't you know

675
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,160
how shameless a traitor is?

676
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,040
If I hadn't been betrayed

677
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,600
by a traitor,

678
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,440
I don't even need to be telling you this.

679
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,440
If it weren't

680
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,720
for that traitor,

681
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,600
we

682
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,720
wouldn't be living

683
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,800
like this today,

684
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,450
right?

685
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,620
I'm quite grateful to that traitor.

686
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,330
Cheng Miaomiao, listen.

687
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,630
I can accept you ranked at the bottom one.

688
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,660
I can't accept that you are a traitor.

689
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,080
You aren't allowed to have dinner tonight.

690
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,920
Don't even think about

691
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,870
the pocket money for this month.

692
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,130
Go back to your room and write a reflection.

693
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:58,930
I suggest

694
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,360
posting it on the living room wall after she finishes.

695
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,360

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,570
What were you doing at home?

707
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,570
I was reading.

708
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,760

Why didn't you close the door, Li Dahai?

711
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,920
Did you watch TV?

712
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,690
No, Director Li.

713
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,770
It's turned off.

714
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,860
The TV was turned off when we left.

715
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,710
This is what happens

00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,660
when you turn it off with a remote control.

717
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,060

When I came back home,

720
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,480
I wanted to know about national affairs.

721
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,710
Can't I watch the CCTV news?

722
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,720

What is it?

Give me some money.

I'll tell Grandma.

759
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,770
Using your grandma to pressure me.

760
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,880
Lingling, help me get up.

761
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,630
Can you get up?

762
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,440
Help me.

763
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,330
Look at you.

764
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,550
You two.

765
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,190
What's all the fuss about every day?

766
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:22,740
Look at your waist.

767
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,140
Be careful. My leg.

768
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,520
You're at this age.

769
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,920
You still want to make a move.

770
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,640
Come on. Lean on this cushion.

771
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,500
Get lost!

772
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,040
Your dad and I

773
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
don't run a bank.

774
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,300
Finish the spicy chicken.

775
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,840
I don't want to.

776
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,360
I'm an unfilial son.

777
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,080
Why should I eat?

778
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,480
I won't eat even if I starve to death.

779
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,400
You'd better keep your promise.

780
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,800
Don't even eat tomorrow.

781
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,400
Why not?

782
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,840
My mom bought the spicy chicken for me.

783
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,600
Not you.

784
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,460
I have to eat it.

785
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,280
I'll beat you even if I'm injured.

786
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,080
Enough.

787
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,860
He's old enough. Why are you scolding him?

788
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,070
When I was his age,

789
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,550
I went to

790
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,620
watch the well in the mountains.

791
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,370
In the middle of the night,

792
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,840
the tent was surrounded by wolves.

793
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,680
I took a torch,

794
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,580
and fought off a pack of wolves.

795
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,580
You beat wolves when you were young.

796
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:05,900
You beat your son when you're old.

797
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,560
You're not as strong as a wolf.

798
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,440
By the way,

799
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
go to the mountain during the holiday

800
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,440
to get more exercise.

801
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,600
Otherwise, how will you produce oil in the future?

802
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,440
I don't want to.

803
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,100
How dare you!

804
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,140
-Enough!
-I dare!

805
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,070
We'll discuss about producing oil in the
future.

806
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,460
What are you doing?

807
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,280
-You didn't answer your phone.
-Li Si.

808
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,740
You have to put more effort

809
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,740
in the final exam this semester.

810
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,790
Offer incense to Caishen.

811
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,040
Mom, is Caishen in charge of the exam?

812
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,200
Well, I am.

813
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,320
I'm good at it.

814
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,470
Let's have a drink.

815
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,560
No.

816
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,920
[Hu Yue]

817
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,120
Why not?

818
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,960
No reason.

819
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,310
Shenzhen is too far away.

820
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,040
How can you go there on your own?

821
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,240
My brother said he would pick me up

822
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,240
at the train station after I get off.

823
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,690
He has no time for you.

824
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,880
If you go there,

825
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,140
what will you eat and where will you stay?

826
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,860
Why won't he have time during the holiday?

827
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,800
He has a dorm

828
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,330
and a canteen. Don't worry.

829
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,800
It has nothing to do with that.

830
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,990
He went to a good university.

831
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,630
He's not coming back to our oil field.

832
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,360
Understand?

833
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,060
You belong to different worlds.

834
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,500
We are a family.

835
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,480
I don't care.

836
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,900
I'm going to see my brother.

837
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,310
I'll go wherever he goes.

838
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,810
Don't even think about it.

839
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,290
I won't agree.

840
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,440
Are you sure you don't want

841
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,270
the stable job in the oil field?

842
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,400
Are you stupid?

843
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,290
Mom, what time are you living in?

844
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,320
The money you earned in the oil field

845
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,840
is hardly worth anything.

846
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,800
It's as if you gained a huge advantage

847
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,390
from the low salary every month.

848
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,470
So petty.

849
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,690
Who are you calling petty?

850
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,040
Am I petty?

851
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,760
That's right. I'm petty.

852
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:52,930
Let me tell you.

853
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,200
You've grown up

854
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,160
because I

855
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,200
raised you

856
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,400
on this petty salary.

857
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,110
You aren't independent yet.

858
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,720
Now you're turning your back on me.

859
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
If it weren't for you, Min,

860
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,400
would I have

861
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,960
such a miserable life?

862
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,440
Are you so ungrateful?

863
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,840
Not again. You're saying you did it for me.

864
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:10,800
You always put the blame

865
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,080
on me.

866
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,350
Hello.

867
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,600
It's for you.

868
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,260
Who is it?

869
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,600
Yang Songbai.

870
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,380
Quiet down.

871
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,679
Hello?

872
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,770
What's the matter?

873
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,380
I can't go back home tonight.

874
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,870
I'll be back in a few days.

875
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,989
Why?

876
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,409
Didn't you say you would be back home?

877
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,949
[Yang Songbai]

878
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,199
Something went wrong with the equipment.

879
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,790
Are you the sole engineer?

880
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,590
What do you mean?

881
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,020
An investigation reveals that the sensor is
broken.

882
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,170
Okay. See you.

883
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,719
I'll go back when it's done.

884
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,310
Let's go.

885
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,700
Good morning, Yu.

886
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,560
Morning, Dad.

887
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,480
Time to eat.

888
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,360
Did you brush your teeth?

889
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,620
Let me smell it.

890
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,380
Breathe out.

891
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,070
It's Sunday.

892
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,200
Where are you going?

893
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,520
I'm going to help my teacher

894
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,760
print the final exam papers.

895
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,440
You're printing the exam papers yourselves.

896
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,790
Won't you leak the questions that way?

897
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:49,620
We're printing the exam papers

898
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,280
for the high school division.

899
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:54,080
Then, take two eggs.

900
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,640
I'm not eating.

901
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,560
It's too late.

902
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,260
I'm leaving.

903
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,620
Put them in your pocket.

904
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,140
Where are you going?

905
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,690
Dad, I'm not eating either.

906
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,290
Take two eggs with you.

907
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:04,860
Come on.

908
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,870
Just get to the point.

909
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,500
I have the answers for the math final exam.

910
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,800
Can we settle this?

911
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,750
Where did you get it?

912
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,960
It's not good for you to know too much.

913
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,360
Is it real?

914
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,520
Do you want it or not?

915
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,760
[Take all risks. Bend over backwards for friends.]

916
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,950
I'll trust you for the last time.

917
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,620
I forgive you

918
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,840
since you took risks for me.

919
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,030
If you do it again,

920
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,200
if you and I aren't in the same boat,

921
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,000
I'll really end our friendship.

922
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,280
If you really end our friendship,

923
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,200
you won't have any friends.

924
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,500
Stop saying

925
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,720
ending our friendship.

926
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,840
We're gonna make it big this time.

927
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,340
What are you doing?

928
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,470
Focus on your exam.

929
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,150
Miaomiao.

930
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:30,960
It's not my fault.

931
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,680
I really didn't know

932
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,080
it was not the same set of paper.

933
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,640
So I was...

934
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,720
Stop it.

935
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,480
You really broke my heart.

936
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:41,080
From now on, we are no longer friends.

937
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:53,990
Tell me.

938
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,060
Who are you blaming this time?

939
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:57,880
The stairs.

940
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,430
Okay.

941
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,990
Let's end our friendship.

942
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,400
Didn't we agree that don't mention

943
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
this topic when something's wrong?

944
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,260
You betrayed me as a traitor.

945
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,200
Then you cheated me with fake exam papers,

946
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,760
and made me fall down the stairs in public.

947
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,480
Why do you think it shouldn't be ended?

948
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,340
Everything was just an accident.

949
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,520
Okay.

950
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,480
Little Beard.

951
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:27,590
Enough.

952
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,610
Aren't you too old for this? Stop it.

953
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:30,500
Si.

954
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,050
I take full responsibility.

955
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:33,910
Although everything was an accident,

956
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:34,960
it's all my fault.

957
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,210
I shouldn't be a traitor.

958
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,640
I also shouldn't have played tricks.

959
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,840
I will make up for my mistakes,

960
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,370
and reverse the situation.

961
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,920
You go first.

962
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,810
Where did you get this paper?

963
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,360
Did you actually go into the men's toilet?

964
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,860
How is it different from women's?

965
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,700
It's quite...

966
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,520
Your point is so weird.

967
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,560
Analyze

968
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,160
what happened to the papers.

969
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,000
High school final exam paper

970
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,240
is so important.

971
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:52,840
How is it possible to ask

972
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,580
a middle school student to handle the
printing?

973
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,180
All he could do was print some practice
papers.

974
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,420
You must be tricked by Cheng Yaya.

975
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,160
Cheng Yaya

976
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,640
is so mean.

977
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,580
He was taking revenge on me.

978
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,320
No wonder he stayed in the bathroom

979
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,880
for so long that day.

980
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,670
Why did he take revenge on you?

981
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,000
I planned to report to Fang

982
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,660
that he had gone to the arcade.

983
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,910
I was expecting him to get caught.

984
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,570
But he didn't go to the arcade.

985
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,390
He went to rob a tomb.

986
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,790
So she caught me instead.

987
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,270
That mischievous boy

988
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,870
must knew my real intention.

989
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,490
Why am I the one who got hurt

990
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,400
because of your conflict with your brother?

991
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,650
Bring it on.

992
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,690
I can't stay in this house anymore.

993
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,070
Seriously?

994
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,430
She just

995
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,770
doesn't like to change shoes.

996
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,590
[Apology]

997
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,840
That was 1997.

998
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,030
In those distant days,

999
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,520
we didn't have the Internet.

1000
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,120
We didn't have smartphones either.

1001
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,330
We lived on a remote

1002
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,390
oil site,

1003
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,000
not knowing

1004
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,240
what the outside world was like.

1005
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,030
I didn't know

1006
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,690
what the future would be like.

1007
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,360
Everyone was welcoming

1008
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,640
the return of Hong Kong.

1009
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,640
But I

1010
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,490
became a foolish traitor,

1011
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,630
being controlled by my mother,

1012
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,240
and retaliated by my brother.

1013
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,240
I almost lost

1014
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,300
my best friend.

1015
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,690
The opening of my youth was a mess.

1016
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,080
My mom's 17-year-old

1017
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,020
started with an elope.

1018
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,640
My 17-year-old

1019
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,430
began as a traitor.

1020
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,960
That year, I was 17.

1021
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,180
My brother was 16.

1022
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,880
I was fooled

1023
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,390
by him again.
