Are you making braised pork?

Auntie, my mom asked me

32
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,079
to bring you this chili sauce.

33
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,180
Your mom is always so diligent!

34
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,130
Thank you!

35
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,510
Later, take some ribs with you.

36
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,550
That's right.

37
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,410
Take some ribs later.

Miaomiao.

Give Min a few pieces

43
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,270
why don't you and your mom come over

44
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,790
to our place for New Year's Eve dinner tonight?

45
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,270
We can't make it.

46
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,230
Why not?

47
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,570
That uncle is coming over

48
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,370

They'll be here soon.

51
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,680
My mom is cooking right now.

52
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:23,990
Alright, alright.

53
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,990
You go play.

54
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,590
I'll be right back.

55
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,850
Li Si, where is your mom?

56
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,730
She's at home.

57
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,670
Hello, Uncle.

58
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,350
Hello.

59
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,670
What's this?

60
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,990
It's so heavy. Did you bring it yourself?

61
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,829
Yes,

62
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:38,870
my mom asked me

63
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,400
to bring you some sausages.

64
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,829
Go ahead, they've got bubble gum.

65
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:42,960
Have some with them.

66
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,590
I carried this all in one go,

67
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,990
didn't even take a break!

68
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,060
You're amazing!

69
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,590
This liquor is pretty good, isn't it?

70
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,320
Strong stuff. Let's have some!

71
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,070
A bit, sure.

72
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,390
Sure. Come on.

73
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,270
Thank you.
It’s New Year.

74
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,470
We should drink some!

75
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,910
Let's pour everyone some.

76
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,470
Yes.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,070
Here comes the fish.

78
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,870
-Close the door.
-Coming.

79
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,470
Okay.

80
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,180
Are the kids

81
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,350
done eating?

82
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,149
Yeah, they finished.

83
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:18,910
Yang's son took them outside

84
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,149
to play with firecrackers.

85
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:21,110
Enough dishes.

86
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,950
They set them off with cigarettes, right?

87
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,510
This new big brother

88
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,190
is great.

89
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,230
Look at you three.

90
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,830
You look stunning today.

91
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,350
Even more beautiful than

92
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,590
the actresses at the Spring Festival Gala!

93
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,830
Are you saying they don't

94
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,350
normally look good?

95
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,830
No, no! They always look great.

96
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,870
They're just

97
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,630
too good for us.

98
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,230
Honestly, the three of them

99
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,310
could be on stage.

100
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,430
Alright, enough fussing, let's get started.

101
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,560
Everyone's hungry!

102
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,060
What's wrong with you?

103
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,500
Why are you here today?

104
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,790
My brain must be muddled from drinking.

105
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,470
Today, we're here to welcome...

106
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,830
Yang Songbai.

107
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,140
-Brother Songbai.
-Yang Songbai.

108
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,870
Brother Songbai.

109
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,670
Though this is the first time we've met,

110
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,670
I've always had this feeling—

111
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,870
like we're old friends

112
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,060
from the moment we met.

113
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,990
Our three families get along well,

114
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,480
just like one big family.

115
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,590
So, relax!

116
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,710
Yang Songbai.

117
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,190
Yang Songbai.

118
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,110
Good brother.

119
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,510
Welcome.

120
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,110
As long as you treat Hu Yue and Min well,

121
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,910
we'll treat you as one of our own.

122
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,770
But if you don't treat them well,

123
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,630
we won't be easy

124
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,310
to deal with either.

125
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,750
Alright, stop with the nagging.

126
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,540
It's the New Year.

127
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,860
Why are you talking about this now?

128
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,390
Let's not get carried away.

129
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,650
You've already started drinking?

130
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,620
I was feeling a bit thirsty.

131
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,750
Let me pour you some.

132
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,390
Just wanted to drink, haha.

133
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,590
Don't mind what was said earlier.

134
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,760
Let's focus on this—

135
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,550
Yang Songbai.

136
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,750
-Songbai.
-Yang Songbai.

137
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,030
You are really something.

138
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,190
Brother Songbai,

139
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:45,870
I can tel

140
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,670
you are an honest man

141
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,670
at the first look.

142
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,390
You've been raising a child alone

143
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,520
since your divorce.

144
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,430
Songbai

145
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,230
is a man

146
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,200
who takes responsibility.

147
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,060
Raising a child alone

148
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,350
is no easy task.

149
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,110
She's been both a father and a mother.

150
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,000
Right?

151
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,110
From now on,

152
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,910
let's help each other out.

153
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,790
Min is a great kid, really.

154
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,470
Good kid.

155
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,150
Yes, she is.

156
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,600
And Hu is a wonderful person too.

157
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,910
She's fantastic!

158
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,830
Honestly, if it weren't for the fact

159
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,360
that we see you as a good guy,

160
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,310
Ling and I

161
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,190
wouldn't have

162
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:21,910
-agreed to this match.
-Exactly.

163
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,390
You know how many people

164
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,630
Hu has turned down?

165
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,310
At least a dozen!

166
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,270
Yes, at least ten.

167
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,790
Where are you getting this number from?

168
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,830
What are you...

169
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,670
Well...

170
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,390
-Let's raise a glass to that.
-Come on.

171
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,670
-Thank you.
-Great.
-Come on.

172
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,590
Cheers.

173
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,150
-Come on.
-Come on.

174
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,110
Come on.

175
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,150
Happy New Year!

176
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,540
[Happy New Year]

177
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,350
What if Yuan Yong comes back?

178
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,070
I hope

179
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,200
he never comes back.

180
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,790
New Year is coming.

181
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,230
Mom, have some water.

182
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,910
Mom, I told you

183
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,190
to call Jia Baoshan back.

184
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,670
But you came over instead.

185
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,310
Why?

186
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,230
Can't I come over to your place for the New Year?

187
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,390
No, no, Mom.

188
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,940
We were all hoping you'd come.

189
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,710
We call you

190
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,790
every year,

191
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,350
but you always say

192
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,100
you're busy.

193
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,910
Right?

194
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,270
Last year, the retirement office

195
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,030
had a program.

196
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,150
I couldn't get away.

197
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,590
This year, you're not in the program?

198
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,870
No, I didn't want to perform this year.

199
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,710
As long as Wang Xiuzhen is there, I won't be.

200
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,150
Who's Wang Xiuzhen?

201
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:14,980
She's the wife of Xu,

202
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,440
the chef at our cafeteria.

203
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,840
The cafeteria caused trouble for you too?

204
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,670
Xu's cooking is alright,

205
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,270
but his wife—she's no good.

206
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,400
So annoying.

207
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,030
When we were putting on a performance,

208
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,870
everyone wore a red flower on their head.

209
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,750
But her—

210
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,210
she had to wear a green one,

211
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,550
so I told her,

212
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,710
"Xiuzhen, what's the deal?

213
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,170
Does your husband have something going on?"

214
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,570
She got all upset with me.

215
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,790
Fine, get upset then.

216
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,710
Wear whatever you want.

217
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,960
Nobody cares about you.

218
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,060
I'm telling you, her whole body

219
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,920
is just filled with bad thoughts.

220
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,200
Incredibly annoying.

221
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,260
I can't even bring her up without getting irritated.

222
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,170
Mom,

223
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,070
as you've gotten older,

224
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,310
It seems like you're picking fights with everyone.

225
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,910
I just can't stand that kind of attitude.

226
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,950
At home, she could wear a pot on her head,

227
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,280
no one would talk to her when she wore a pot.

228
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,350
Alright, Mom. If you don't like her,

229
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,780
we won't share the stage with her.

230
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,100
Every year,

231
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,750
we hope you'll come,

232
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,670
but you always

233
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,230
pour all your passion

234
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,860
into the stage instead.

235
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,110
This year is good, though.

236
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,150
You're spending New Year's at our house.

237
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,470
We'll all have a good time together.

238
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,430
How about you perform for us,

239
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,030
okay?

240
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,460
I'd be so happy!

241
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,550
I'll perform "Little New Year"

242
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,510
for you all.

243
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,630
Mom, Mom,

244
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,550
since you're spending New Year's with us,

245
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,950
what about Dad?

246
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,790
I can't stand him either!

247
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,390
The doctor told him to quit smoking,

248
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,350
but he keeps doing it.

249
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,550
Fine, let him smoke.

250
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,830
He smokes. I leave.

251
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,710
Even if he smoked

252
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,270
five packs a day

253
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,030
and went to meet the King of Hell,

254
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,070
I wouldn't care.

255
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,830
Go ahead, let him!

256
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,990
Mom, your words are as sharp as ever.

257
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,470
I will

258
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,710
call Dad later.

259
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,630
We can't just let him

260
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,350
spend New Year's alone.

261
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,950
That would make people talk.

262
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,600
True.

263
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,690
Where are the kids?

264
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,870
Mom, have some water.

265
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,210
I miss them.

266
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,950
Who is it?

267
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,250
Can't you knock properly?

268
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,230
What's your problem?

269
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,240
What do you mean, "What's my problem?"

270
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,150
Why didn't you answer my calls?

271
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,790
I didn't feel like answering.

272
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,590
Are you crazy?

273
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,430
You're the crazy one!

274
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,990
Yeah, I'm crazy,

275
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,590
but at least I don't wear cartoon long johns.

276
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,150
Li Si, you're 17 and still wearing

277
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,190
a big digger on your clothes!

278
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,070
Get out of here!

279
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,110
This is an excavator, not a digger!

280
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,270
Who are you yelling at?

281
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,230
You, obviously!

282
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,390
Fine, tell me.

283
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,030
Why are you mad at me?

284
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,140
Is it because I'm spending

285
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,430
too much time with Qiang Xiaowa?

286
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,830
Are you feeling ignored?

287
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,750
Do you think I'm that petty?

288
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,310
Then what's the problem?

289
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,110
Tell me.

290
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,710
Can't I have my own troubles?

291
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,150
Can't I have

292
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,120
my own worries?

293
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,070
Si.

294
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,020
You're growing up,

295
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,500
having worries now.

296
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,240
Don't joke around with me like that!

297
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,640
I've always had worries.

298
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,010
Alright, tell me then.

299
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:14,970
I'm listening.

300
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,750
I've just suddenly realized

301
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,670
how useless I am.

302
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,710
I've been thinking about it a lot these past few days.

303
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,750
Look at Hu.

304
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,240
Since she was a kid, she's been told to study hard.

305
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,040
She aims to get into university, leave this place,

306
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,310
and later, go abroad with her older brother

307
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,910
for graduate school.

308
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,280
Zhu Chao?

309
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,270
He's just waiting to take over his dad's job

310
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,200
at the oil field.

311
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,790
Qiang Xiaowa

312
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,910
wants to go to a teacher's college in Beijing,

313
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,110
because it's tuition-free,

314
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,240
no dorm fees either.

315
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,990
After graduation, it's easy to find a job,

316
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,050
and he can bring his grandpa with him.

317
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,270
Even Wei Xue says

318
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,630
she wants to go to Qingdao University

319
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,830
to study accounting.

320
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,290
And then there's me—no plans at all.

321
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,710
I just think,

322
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,110
wherever you go,

323
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,030
I'll go too.

324
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,650
Well, that's a plan, isn't it?

325
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,020
So,

326
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,430
where are you going?

327
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,560
I haven't figured it out.

328
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,520
I just want to see what's out there.

329
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,870
Seems like we're the only ones without any big dreams.

330
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,000
Why does there have to be

331
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,200
some concrete dream?

332
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,070
People change

333
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,130
as they grow older.

334
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,030
When I was little,

335
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,840
I wanted to play the violin.

336
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,720
In middle school, I wanted to perform

337
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
in the school anniversary play.

338
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,990
In high school, I wanted to go to Hong Kong.

339
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,120
None of those things happened.

340
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,210
Now, I'm rethinking everything.

341
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,530
We're different.

342
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,110
Your dad doesn't look down on you.

343
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,630
Why do you think

344
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,390
my dad looks down on me?

345
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,310
It's just because I have no ambition

346
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,190
and I'm not successful.

347
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,260
What exactly does it mean to be successful?

348
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,590
Do you have to be a scientist,

349
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,710
a doctor, or a policeman

350
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,150
to be considered successful?

351
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,750
If everyone in the world

352
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,940
did the same thing,

353
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,030
who would sweep the streets?

354
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,270
Who would take out the trash?

355
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,390
Who would plant the trees, or work at the oil field?

356
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,050
In our local farmers' market,

357
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,790
there are people buying and selling vegetables.

358
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,990
Some want Someone wants popcorn?

359
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,990
Well, there's someone who makes it.

360
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,230
I can't even

361
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,310
make popcorn.

362
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,000
Then don't make popcorn.

363
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,220
There are so many things in the world.

364
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,590
There's bound to be something that's right for the two of us.

365
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,670
If we keep comparing ourselves to others,

366
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,790
how do we live?

367
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,230
I don't want to compare myself to others either,

368
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,560
but life just seems to get worse by the day.

369
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,090
I used to think our relationship

370
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,620
was unshakable,

371
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,490
but ever since Qiang Xiaowa came along,

372
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,490
you spend all your time helping him.

373
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,490
He's tall, handsome, smart,

374
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,850
and good at everything.

375
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,170
Compared to him,

376
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,630
I feel like an idiot.

377
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,200
I used to think

378
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,350
my family life was great

379
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,820
and my parents were loving.

380
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,590
But now?

381
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,240
My dad's first love came back,

382
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,170
and together they deceived my mom.

383
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,200
My dad's turned into a Chen Shimei.

384
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,230
How did everything

385
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,820
go wrong all of a sudden?

386
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,350
Even I feel like

387
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,750
I've become the worthless loser

388
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,080
my dad always said I was.

389
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,110
I didn't make it to Hong Kong,

390
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,110
and I feel like a failure.

391
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,470
I didn't get selected as class monitor,

392
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,450
and I feel like a failure again.

393
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,490
I tried to help Qiang Xiaowa out of kindness,

394
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,020
but he yelled at me instead.

395
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,710
It made me so angry.

396
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,630
And look at Hua'er—

397
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,630
after all the time

398
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,430
I spent trying to help,

399
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,080
now, I have no idea

400
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,030
what she's doing

401
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,670
or where she is.

402
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,350
Since high school,

403
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,630
I haven't been able to keep up with my studies.

404
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,680
At one point, I even wondered

405
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,510
if I ate something

406
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,820
that ruined my brain.

407
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,790
Cheng Yaya keeps getting better,

408
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,590
which just makes me look dumber.

409
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,960
And I feel like my mom

410
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,110
is biased towards Cheng Yaya,

411
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,440
which really annoys me.

412
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,510
My parents were getting divorced,

413
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,140
and I sided with my dad,

414
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,390
telling him not to be afraid,

415
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,150
that I'd stand with him.

416
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,190
But then my dad switched sides at the last minute,

417
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,720
and now I'm the biggest traitor in the family.

418
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,750
Tell me, is there a single thing

419
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,580
in my life that's not a mess?

420
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,990
The other day, my mom asked me,

421
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,670
"What are you running around

422
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,930
doing every day?

423
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,750
What have you actually accomplished?"

424
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,210
And when I thought about it,

425
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,990
I realized—I haven't accomplished anything.

426
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,890
It seems like the two of us have it the worst.

427
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:45,910
But

428
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,630
you know

429
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,030
how I figured things out?

430
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,380
It's because I saw Yuan Shanqing,

431
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,190
I saw Qiang Xiaowa,

432
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,470
and I saw Hua'er.

433
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,210
I realized that they are

434
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,010
the ones truly living in misery,

435
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:04,130
but they haven't given up,

436
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,730
and they never complained.

437
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,400
And then there's Hu.

438
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,020
The three of us grew up together,

439
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,230
but do we really understand her?

440
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,750
Other than that one time

441
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,530
when she tried to drown herself,

442
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,990
she never talked about her struggles again.

443
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,579
After that incident,

444
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,630
I kept wondering,

445
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,770
how has Hu managed to live

446
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,619
all these years?

447
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:34,850
Si,

448
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,950
you know why

449
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,790
we have no ambition,

450
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,950
and why we're the ones with no goals?

451
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,750
Why?

452
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,430
Because we're the luckiest ones.

453
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,250
The universe has given us

454
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,420
the best lives.

455
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,020
So,

456
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,450
we can't waste

457
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,000
this amazing opportunity.

458
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,110
Think about it—our group.

459
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,510
You're the big brother, I'm the big sister.

460
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,840
We're the backbone, the soul of the group.

461
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,390
It's not just our little group—

462
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,990
isn't Linqi No. 2 High School

463
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,470
also centered around us?

464
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,350
So, when it comes to studying,

465
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,880
let's give it our best shot.

466
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,400
Whatever we get into, we get into.

467
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,550
As for dreams,

468
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,560
what's the rush?

469
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,640
We can take our time to figure them out.

470
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,440
We've got a long life ahead of us.

471
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,740
Yeah,

472
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,910
we've got a long life ahead of us.

473
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,690
No dreams? So what.

474
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,760
Exactly. Like I'm gonna

475
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,710
look down on you for not being successful?

476
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,240
Who's looking down on whom?

477
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,460
Let me tell you something,

478
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,430
don't just casually come over to my house from now on.

479
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,090
Why not?

480
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,550
You don't want me to see that big digger of yours?

481
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,720
Excavator. It's an excavator!

482
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,540
My mom bought it for me

483
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,430
and insisted I wear it.

484
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,510
It wasn't my choice.

485
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,270
An excavator, huh?

486
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:43,880
Let me see.

487
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,150
What are you doing?

488
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,230
Are you a pervert?

489
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,190
Cheng Miaomiao!

490
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,390
Cheng Miaomiao!

491
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,790
Alright, in a few days,

492
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,110
you can go buy the train tickets.

493
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,370
We'll all go together.

494
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,630
Old friends, out on a trip.

495
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,990
That sounds great!

496
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,390
Grandma!

497
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,160
-Miaomiao.
-What brings you here?

498
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,920
You didn't tell me!

499
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,950
I've missed you so much!

500
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,070
I've missed you too!

501
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,830
But if you missed me so much,

502
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,090
why didn't you call me?

503
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,310
You're the most lively one in the family!

504
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,310
Look at my dad, he's already got gray hair,

505
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,770
but you don't have any yet.

506
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,780
Grandma!

507
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,940
-Yaya.
-I miss you so much!

508
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,270
I've missed you too!

509
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,740
When did you get here?

510
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,110
I would've picked you up if I'd known!

511
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,070
I wanted to surprise you.

512
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,890
But turns out neither of you was home.

513
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,820
I was just out for a walk with Uncle.

514
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,030
Mom.

515
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,390
I've missed you so much!

516
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,350
So annoying. Get lost.

517
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,810
I don't have a son like you.

518
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,670
Mom, why are you talking like that?

519
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,990
I was just telling my sister the other day.

520
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,950
We should pick you up and bring you over.

521
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,030
How could we celebrate the new year

522
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,510
without you? Isn't that right?

523
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,590
Well, now that I see you,

524
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,190
it's going to be hard to enjoy this New Year.

525
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,870
And it's getting hard for me

526
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,110
to get through my days.

527
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,030
Mom, after New Year, please send him away.

528
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,070
I can't leave yet.

529
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,490
I've still got big things to handle.

530
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,420
What now? Owe someone money again?

531
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,310
That was a one-time thing, alright?

532
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,110
Stop bringing it up over and over.

533
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,860
So, who's the new person you're after?

534
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,950
Exactly!

535
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,030
First, he had his eye on our English teacher,

536
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,830
Then on our director.

537
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,990
Typical of him.

538
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,190
Nonsense, nonsense!

539
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,310
Grandma, I can testify.

540
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,510
Everything my sister said is absolutely true.

541
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,230
-You two...
-I knew it.

542
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,310
Let me tell you.

543
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,510
Make sure to tell that teacher

544
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,270
to stay away from this troublemaker.

545
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,790
Mom, am I still

546
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,590
your dear son or not?

547
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,910
Can you support me just once?

548
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,630
Can I support bad people doing bad things?

549
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,160
Supporting that would make me an accomplice!

550
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,630
Mom. Did you come by yourself?

551
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,070
What about Dad?

552
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,150
Don't mention him.

553
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,960
What do you want to eat tonight?

554
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,980
Coke chicken wings.

555
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,510
-Chicken wings?
-Cola chicken wings.

556
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,140
Here, this one's for Miaomiao,

557
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,790
And this one's for Yaya.

558
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,030
Thanks, Grandma!

559
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,150
I've adored you two since you were little.

560
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,100
Such lovable kids.

561
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,750
Our Miaomiao—

562
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,230
she's pretty, kind-hearted,

563
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,760
and she's smart too.

564
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,590
Just looking at her makes you happy!

565
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,070
And Yaya

566
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,910
isn't just anyone either—

567
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,550
he's smart

568
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,670
and capable,

569
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,230
and he can handle anything.

570
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,480
So much better than

571
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,950
Zhang Dajuan's grandson.

572
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:54,830
Mom, you're always

573
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,510
comparing.

574
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,360
This and that.

575
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,040
Your life's greatest accomplishment

576
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,750
is defeating Zhang Dajuan,

577
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,550
and knocking down Wang Xiuzhen.

578
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,190
And don't forget Li Xiuxiu!

579
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,750
She's been at odds with me all her life.

580
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,270
So what if she married a deputy factory manager?

581
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,670
What's so great about that?

582
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,910
I'll tell you something—

583
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,990
she used to brag about

584
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,630
her four-piece bedding set,

585
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,030
claiming it was made of real silk.

586
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,070
But later, someone went to check,

587
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,630
and they said,

588
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,790
it's not real silk at all.

589
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,830
It's polyester!

590
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,210
You see,

591
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,950
every New Year, she gets so busy,

592
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,910
taking down the big door panels

593
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,310
to welcome guests.

594
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,110
Quite drama.

595
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,800
She retired a few years ago,

596
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,670
and no one came.

597
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,190
If we talk about disputes,

598
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,750
my mom, she's always ready with a sharp tongue.

599
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,460
About all the women at our factory,

600
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,470
when Mom gets angry,

601
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,070
she doesn't mince her words.

602
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,430
I have good relationships with people,

603
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,270
you know.

604
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,070
Unlike those relatives

605
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,260
who gossip

606
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,830
about everyone,

607
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,550
I focus on

608
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,890
just a few people.

609
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,510
Come on.

610
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,670
Dapeng, here's your wings.

611
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,560
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Mom.

612
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,280
No, it's still thanks to Daiyu for her effort.

613
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,510
Thanks, Mom.

614
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,150
I know my daughter.

615
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,870
She's not a perfect wife or mother.

616
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,200
Her grades aren't high.

617
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,090
But I've never seen anyone

618
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,790
so biased as you.

619
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,610
Look at you.

620
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,820
Let me tell you.

621
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,620
My daughter is lucky

622
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,430
to have marriedsuch a good husband.

623
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,670
You must have burned a lot of incense to get him!

624
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,300
Grandma,

625
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,060
I think having you

626
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,010
in our family is truly a blessing.

627
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,330
I love hearing that.

628
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,950
Say it again

629
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,830
when your grandfather comes.

630
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,320
Okay.

631
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,330
Stand at the door and call out.

632
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,150
Come on.

633
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:24,830
Here, wine.

634
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,580
Eat up.

635
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:43,720
Xiaowa,

636
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,110
what are you doing up there?

637
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,870
The wind was strong earlier

638
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,110
and blew the curtain open.

639
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,240
I'm nailing it back.

640
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,070
It's too dark

641
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,910
to see clearly.

642
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,150
Do it tomorrow.

643
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:54,840
No.

644
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,390
It needs to be done

645
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,660
before my brother comes back.

646
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,880
We can't let him think

647
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,190
our life isn't going well.

648
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,720
Otherwise, he'll start worrying again.

649
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,850
Alright, alright.

650
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,230
I'll help you with it.

651
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,280
Be careful.

652
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,140
Tickets are this hard to get?

653
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,350
It's Spring Festival travel season.

654
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,510
Whatever your destination is, it's hard to buy tickets.

655
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,430
Most of the teachers in this building

656
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,510
are from the oil field.

657
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,710
They've mostly left.

658
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,630
I'm going home tomorrow too.

659
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,030
So, that means

660
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,230
only Director Xiao will be alone

661
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,030
in such a big school for New Year.

662
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,190
Her family isn't from the oil field.

663
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,910
She doesn't have relatives here.

664
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,400
If she can't get tickets,

665
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,120
she might really stay here.

666
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,230
No.

667
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,090
My brother's coming back.

668
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,020
We can't let him sleep on the floor.

669
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,720
Min, listen.

670
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,850
It's okay.

671
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,590
We'll move

672
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,210
the coffee table here.

673
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,310
With this much space,

674
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,410
he can sleep.

675
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,390
He's only coming back for a short time.

676
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,990
We can't make him sleep on the floor.

677
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,790
Let's just

678
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,220
replace the sofa

679
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,550
with a big one,

680
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,810
like a sofa bed.

681
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,470
No need.

682
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,830
Listen to me.

683
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,920
It's not necessary.

684
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,830
One, your brother's only coming back

685
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,790
for a few days.

686
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:14,750
And two,

687
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,470
he's a grown man.

688
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,800
He can manage.

689
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,160
We can't let the child manage, though.

690
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,230
Min, you can sleep with me,

691
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,430
and let your brother sleep in your room.

692
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,170
And I?

693
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,590
On the sofa.

694
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,210
Right,

695
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,190
I can sleep on the sofa.

696
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,930
Why didn't I think of that?

697
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,890
Can you manage?

698
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,910
Yes, I can.

699
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,760
It'll be convenient for watching TV at night.

700
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,360
Alright, it's settled then.

701
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:42,880
Good.

702
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,240
Everyone ate pretty clean.

703
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,220
Sis, where's the small stool?

704
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,070
What for?

705
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,950
Help me find it.

706
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,550
I need it.

707
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,610
Hurry up, hurry up.

708
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,750
Don't give me the bedding.

709
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,720
I'm sleeping with my sister.

710
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,070
It's not for you.

711
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,870
I'm going out.

712
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,730
No, you don't need to go out.

713
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:08,630
I'm sleeping with Yaya.

714
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,800
Your sofa is still yours.

715
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,350
No.

716
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,870
Pengfei, don't worry about it.

717
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,470
I'm going out for something.

718
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,060
I'm telling you,

719
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,510
you can't go out and act like a hooligan.

720
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,550
What are you talking about?

721
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,460
What hooliganism?

722
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,190
What can I do

723
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,110
with a stool?

724
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,040
Did you find the small stool?

725
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,520
Here.

726
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,850
I'm not doing anything bad.

727
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,760
I'm leaving now.

728
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,990
What could he possibly do

729
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,310
with a small stool

730
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,480
and some bedding?

731
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,790
Who knows? It's your son.

732
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,530
Bai Shuang is a good person.

733
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,300
She's not as you think.

734
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,020
Your dad wronged her back then.

735
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,810
Because of this,

736
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,470
your dad felt guilty for many years.

737
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,450
Actually, he suffered more than anyone.

738
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,040
He wronged someone.

739
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,530
Why would he suffer?

740
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,150
What's the use of suffering?

741
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,890
Suffering is useless.

742
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,030
But suffering is a form of punishment.

743
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,910
I talked a lot with Bai Shuang,

744
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,990
and I found out

745
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,190
she's truly a kind and generous person.

746
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,670
She told me

747
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,430
that your dad and I

748
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,760
chose the right people,

749
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,180
and

750
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,860
chose a good life.

751
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,830
When she said that,

752
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,430
actually,

753
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,950
I felt quite ashamed.

754
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:36,870
Mom,

755
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,030
don't say that.

756
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,600
Do you still

757
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,410
blame Dad now?

758
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,110
Your dad and I have been married

759
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,510
for almost twenty years.

760
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:52,750
He has never

761
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,410
lost his temper with me,

762
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,090
always taking good care of me.

763
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,770
I remember when I was

764
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,780
eight months pregnant with you,

765
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,680
he would run home

766
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,110
from the drilling team every day.

767
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,910
Sometimes in the middle of the night,

768
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,910
with no car, he would still run home.

769
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,600
During my confinement period,

770
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,860
I was often hysterical

771
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,760
for some reason.

772
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,190
Maybe I was too pampered,

773
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,510
not used to hardship,

774
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,890
and couldn't handle taking care of you, a newborn.

775
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,310
He had to take care of you

776
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,680
and comfort me.

777
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,950
He slept in a chair

778
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,270
every night.

779
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,790
Look at my hands.

780
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,320
They look like

781
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,250
they haven't done any work, right?

782
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,530
How could I blame your dad?

783
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:44,810
Didn't he marry you

784
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,160
to climb up the ladder?

785
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,670
Many people said

786
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,670
your dad married me

787
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,200
just to become an official.

788
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,930
But that's not true.

789
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,600
After we got married,

790
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,760
your grandpa

791
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,530
wanted him to work in the office,

792
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,990
but your dad refused to go.

793
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,480
He insisted on going to the drilling team.

794
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,730
At that time,

795
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,430
he would be away

796
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,230
for two or three months at a time,

797
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,510
sleeping in the wind and rain.

798
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,110
He never complained.

799
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,830
Rheumatism and stomach problems

800
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,080
are what he got from those days.

801
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,750
You know, your dad is a proud man.

802
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,040
He was afraid people would say

803
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,780
he was trying to climb the social ladder.

804
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,840
He worked his way up

805
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,200
from the front lines, step by step.

806
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,810
Your dad may not be well-educated,

807
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,630
but he's the best oil worker

808
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,630
and the best husband.

809
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,390
Si,

810
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,130
you might think

811
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,490
your dad isn't a good father,

812
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,180
that he has many shortcomings,

813
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,650
and that his way of educating you is harsh.

814
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,340
But he loves you deeply.

815
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,940
He would risk his life for you.

816
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,750
You must believe that.

817
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,190
Do you think I'm really foolish?

818
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,870
Can't I see

819
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,090
that you both love me?

820
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:06,870
Since childhood,

821
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,470
who hasn't envied my family?

822
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,990
Your dad isn't afraid of anything.

823
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,430
He's only afraid that we might stop loving him.

824
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,580
He's a rough man,

825
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,310
but we are his soft spot.

826
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,400
Listen to me.

827
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,550
Your dad never thinks

828
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,870
you're a waste.

829
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,260
He just hopes you'll

830
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,080
understand things sooner and become talented sooner,

831
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,410
finding your own path,

832
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,520
just like he did.

833
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,840
The heart of a parent is full of sorrow.

834
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,390
Parents everywhere

835
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,750
hope their children

836
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,990
will be successful,

837
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,350
right?

838
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,650
For...

839
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,500
You're back, dear.

840
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,440
Here's tea for your dad.

841
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,230
Hurry up.

842
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,110
Dad.

843
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,470
Have some tea.

844
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,660
Why haven't you gone to bed yet?

845
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,950
I'm waiting for you.

846
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,910
You put too many tea leaves in.

847
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,590
Do you even know how to make tea?

848
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,430
I'm just handing you the tea.

849
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,510
Am I wrong to serve you?

850
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,840
Do I need you to serve me?

851
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,050
You've been going to school for so many years,

852
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,130
and still don't know how to make tea?

853
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:36,740
I went to school

854
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,670
to learn Chinese, math, and English,

855
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,300
not to learn how to make tea.

856
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,390
Can you not be so high and mighty?

857
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,150
Why do you have to stand so tall

858
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,110
when talking to your father?

859
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:41,670
Does it matter if I'm standing or not?

860
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,830
I don't need you to serve me.

861
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,470
Are you serving me tea?

862
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,470
-I…
-I think you're sending me away.

863
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,270
send me away?

864
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,070
Yaya.

865
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:51,950
Coming.

866
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,790
Grandma,

867
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,920
is this bowl okay?

868
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,870
Sure. Rice on the roof is a good omen

869
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,440
for wealth and prosperity.

870
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,700
Quick, put it up there.

871
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,830
Make sure

872
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,160
it's in the right place.

873
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,920
Come on. Be careful.

874
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,590
More to the left.

875
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,240
Left, right?

876
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,270
-A little to the left.
-Mom.

877
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,030
A little bit more.

878
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,990
What era is this?

879
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,590
You're still into superstitions.

880
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,070
Ignoring feng shui is not okay.

881
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,870
Mom, look at the mirror.

882
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,590
Is this mirror okay?

883
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,950
It has peonies on it.

884
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:15,790
Great.

885
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,910
Peonies symbolize wealth and prosperity.

886
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,830
This mirror should be hung

887
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,190
at the entrance.

888
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,350
-Okay.
-It can ward off evil spirits.

889
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,210
I'll hang it up.

890
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,870
Yaya, give me that stool.

891
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,280
Here.

892
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,340
Be careful.

893
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,590
-Cheng Pengfei.
-Let me see.

894
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,350
Let me see.

895
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:29,950
-Good.
-Look.

896
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,870
-Is it in the right place?
-You…

897
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,350
What are you doing?

898
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,190
You're

899
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:32,950
a well-educated person.

900
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,670
Why are you following along

901
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,150
with this nonsense?

902
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,290
I'm following the orders

903
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,830
from your mother.

904
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,590
What does

905
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,090
filial piety mean?

906
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,280
It means you have to go along with it.

907
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,220
If you don't like it,

908
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,470
we can take it down

909
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,470
after she leaves.

910
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,470
Come, come, come. Help me out.

911
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,670
Come on.

912
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,420
Open the door for me.

913
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,750
I'm hanging it outside.

914
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,080
I've seen other people have it hung up too.

915
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,330
Slow down.

916
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,030
What are you two doing?

917
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,190
Where have you been?

918
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,790
I was taking care of important matters.

919
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,590
What important matters do you have?

920
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,270
Where did you go?

921
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,350
You were out all night.

922
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,470
Mom, stop asking.

923
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,370
You go ahead with what you're doing.

924
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,770
If I don't care, who will?

925
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,000
What were you doing?

926
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,550
Oh,

927
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,610
and wash the duvet cover. It's dirty.

928
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,360
Tell me, what were you doing?

929
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,590
Mom, I didn't do anything.

930
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,430
Stop bothering me.

931
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,430
No, you have to tell me

932
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,510
what you were doing.

933
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,230
Hello?

934
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,300
Dad.

935
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,370
Which train?

936
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,170
Alright, alright, alright.

937
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,430
You want to talk to Mom?

938
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,430
Mom, Mom.

939
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,150
Dad's on the phone.

940
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,310
You...

941
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,410
I've already arranged it.

942
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,710
He'll be coming over by train soon.

943
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,910
Don't stop him again.

944
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,700
Why are you coming?

945
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,270
Why do you follow me everywhere?

946
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,090
-Well…
-Can you give me

947
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,540
some personal space?

948
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,400
Did you smoke again?

949
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,670
I can smell it.

950
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,370
Where's the thing?

951
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,880
This box.

952
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,920
Let Wang know about it.

953
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,030
See if there are any cars going

954
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,510
towards your place in the next few days.

955
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,390
Have them deliver it.

956
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,150
What's this?

957
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,590
New Year's goods.

958
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,350
I also got

959
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,590
two extra packs of red dates for Mom

960
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,070
to boost her health.

961
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,910
And these—

962
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,540
for which leader

963
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,230
likes what kind of liquor,

964
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,910
cigarettes, or tea,

965
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,650
I've noted everything clearly.

966
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,150
Even the names

967
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,310
are written down.

968
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,950
Nowadays, it's not just about

969
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,990
celebrating the New Year;

970
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,250
it's about maintaining relationships.

971
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,020
Gifts are not

972
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:29,870
so easily accepted now.

973
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,510
We're just giving some New Year goods

974
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,030
to show our sincerity.

975
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,350
I always feel like that little notebook

976
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,300
is like evidence.

977
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:36,840
What?

978
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,580
Alright, alright, marrying you wasn't a mistake.

979
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,310
I'm leaving.

980
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,870
Bye.

981
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,420
Wait a minute.

982
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,630
Don't tell Mom

983
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,840
it's because I didn't want to go back.

984
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,900
Just say it's because you're on duty.

985
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,720
Got it?

986
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,320
This lie

987
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,690
is very precise.

988
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,450
Okay.

989
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,300
Here.

990
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,720
Give it to me.

991
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,000
Mom, my brother is back.

992
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,900
Aunt Yue.

993
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,370
Tao, you're back.

994
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:12,989
Come in quickly.

995
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,360
Come in quickly.

996
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,050
Didn't run into your dad?

997
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,590
He said he went to buy alcohol.

998
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,750
-No.
-He wants to drink with you tonight.

999
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,310
Dad still loves to drink.

1000
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,570
Come on, come on. You should drink tonight.

1001
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,280
Your dad has been

1002
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,600
looking forward to your return.

1003
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,440
Take off your coat.

1004
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,679
It's warm at home.

1005
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,870
How's your health and Dad's?

1006
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,110
We're doing fine.

1007
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,530
Have you grown taller,

1008
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,120
Tao?

1009
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:32,980
Have I?

1010
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,429
So tall, isn't it?

1011
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,630
Tonight we'll have dumplings

1012
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,110
with your favorite lamb filling.

1013
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,239
Thank you, Aunt Yue.

1014
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,429
Go wash your hands and face

1015
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,590
in the bathroom.

1016
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,830
The dumplings will be ready soon.

1017
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,400
Okay.

1018
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,889
Aunt Yue, let me help you

1019
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,400
-Let me help you.
-No need.

1020
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,880
Go talk to your sister for a while.

1021
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,679
Rest for a bit.

1022
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,320
No, no.

1023
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,159
No need, no need.

1024
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:51,760
Let me see

1025
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,620
what nice things you've brought.

1026
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:56,699
I bought a nice gift for you.

1027
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,430
What is it?

1028
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,290
Open it and see.

1029
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,290
So delicate.

1030
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,280
Do you like it?

1031
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,490
Yes.

1032
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,420
It hurts.

1033
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,790
Open the door.

1034
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,660
[Linchuan Tonghua]

1035
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,730
Do you still want to play with this?

1036
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,460
Look.

1037
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,000
There's a longer one at Sister's place,

1038
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,140
even longer than this one.

1039
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,140
Come on, pull it.

1040
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,150
Make it shorter.

1041
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,270
It's not fun?

1042
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,870
Here, put this on.

1043
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,230
Yes.

1044
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,740
Listen.

1045
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,620
You don't need to bring anything.

1046
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,290
Grandma's here.

1047
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,750
How can I go empty-handed?

1048
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:49,910
I'll steam some buns

1049
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,570
and everyone can have a taste.

1050
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,300
I'll make a little bear for you.

1051
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,670
Brother!

1052
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,510
Grandpa, Grandpa, my brother is back.

1053
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,010
Brother!

1054
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,080
Who cut your hair?

1055
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,550
My classmates.

1056
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,700
They're much better at it than I am.

1057
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,580
Dawa.

1058
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:28,250
Grandpa.

1059
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,920
It's good that you're back.

1060
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,490
You must have suffered

1061
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,810
these past two years.

1062
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,020
Not at all. What suffering?

1063
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,100
Let me tell you, Grandpa,

1064
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,970
the house I built is really nice.

1065
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,160
It's ten stories high

1066
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,290
and has an elevator.

1067
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,790
Just press the button,

1068
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,320
and whoosh, you're on the tenth floor.

1069
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,290
Really?

1070
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,070
Of course.

1071
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,350
The wind is strong outside.

1072
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,530
Come on, let's go inside.

1073
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,200
-Let’s talk inside.
-Let’s go inside.

1074
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,880
Grandpa, how's your leg?

1075
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,140
It's good, good.

1076
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,530
As soon as you're back,

1077
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,810
everything is better.

1078
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,770
Where is Babao?

1079
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,890
He went on a blind date.

1080
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,010
Blind date?

1081
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,050
The Wei family has a little black dog,

1082
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,490
and Babao, who's so useless,

1083
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,220
keeps going over to visit them.

1084
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,000
Tonight we'll have dumplings.

1085
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,530
Okay!

1086
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,620
You bought the wrong ticket.

1087
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,560
Wrong?

1088
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,350
Isn't it Tonghua?

1089
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:26,860
Tongliao.

1090
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,380
It's my fault. I remembered it wrong.

1091
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,850
I lined up all night and didn't get it.

1092
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,680
I'll buy another one.

1093
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,350
Come back.

1094
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,570
No need to buy another.

1095
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,260
You won't be able to buy it now anyway.

1096
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,590
It's fine if it's wrong.

1097
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,910
So what? You're going to Tonghua?

1098
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,600
Why would I go to Tonghua?

1099
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,930
I'll stay here.

1100
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,880
I can celebrate New Year here as well.

1101
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,840
How much did you spend?

1102
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,440
I'll give it to you.

1103
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,570
No, no, you don't need to give me money.

1104
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,010
First, I bought the wrong one.

1105
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:49,600
Even if I got the right one,

1106
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,830
I can't accept your money.

1107
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,990
Don't say that.

1108
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,530
I can't take advantage of you for nothing.

1109
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,780
What advantage?

1110
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,110
We're friends.

1111
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,340
The main thing is that you,

1112
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,280
the pillar of the school,

1113
00:37:59,280 --> 00:37:59,740
our diligent gardener,

1114
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,570
shouldn't spend New Year alone.

1115
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,770
It would be terrible.

1116
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,890
Why don't you come to my place?

1117
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,070
My family is large, and it's very lively.

1118
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:08,950
We can celebrate together.

1119
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,130
That's inappropriate.

1120
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,100
What's inappropriate about it?

1121
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,620
The kids

1122
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,540
are familiar with you.

1123
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,700
It's just that...

1124
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,240
I haven't finished tidying up.

1125
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,210
I haven't even put up the Spring Festival couplets yet.

1126
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:17,880
That's it?

1127
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,910
Let me take care of that.

1128
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:21,640
Not a big deal.

1129
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,600
Fried chicken.

1130
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,050
I just learned it this year.

1131
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,980
It's great. It smells really good.

1132
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:30,590
Daiyu.

1133
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:31,990
Daiyu.

1134
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,660
I'm coming.

1135
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,320
Dad.

1136
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,260
Dad, you're here.

1137
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,390
Come on in.

1138
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:37,950
Here.

1139
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,420
Take these slippers.

1140
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,620
Give them to me.

1141
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,920
-Take it.
-Was the trip smooth?

1142
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,950
Yes.

1143
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,020
Good.

1144
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,400
Mom.

1145
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,190
Take off your coat.

1146
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,290
Where did she go?

1147
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,830
I'm still cooking.

1148
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,850
Pengfei, where's that old man?

1149
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,920
The bag is here.

1150
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,520
Oh my god.

1151
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,470
Are you looking for me?

1152
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,630
Who is looking for you?

1153
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,350
Move aside. I'm working.

1154
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,780
What are you doing here?

1155
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,250
What am I doing here?

1156
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,030
I came to spend New Year's with my daughter.

1157
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,100
What else would I be doing?

1158
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,380
That's my daughter.

1159
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,850
Her name is Jia Daiyu.

1160
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,700
My name is Jia Xikui.

1161
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,040
We both have the surname Jia.

1162
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,200
She's my daughter,

1163
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,220
born to me.

1164
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,790
If I were to marry someone with the surname Wang,

1165
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,470
she'd be Wang Daiyu.

1166
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,100
Which Wang would dare

1167
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,660
marry an old lady like you?

1168
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,600
Well then, why don't you divorce me

1169
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,720
and see if anyone will marry me?

1170
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,320
You...

1171
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,480
You're bringing up divorce at my daughter's place?

1172
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,720
It's New Year's Eve.

1173
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,690
Why are you talking about divorce?

1174
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:19,490
That's right.

1175
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:20,500
It's inauspicious.

1176
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,830
Let's not talk about it.

1177
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,400
Come on, Dad, take off your coat.

1178
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,330
Your mom is always involved

1179
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:25,740
in inauspicious things.

1180
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,730
He's just an unlucky person.

1181
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,060
He's always arguing with me,

1182
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,410
all day long.

1183
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,390
Mom, enough.

1184
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,020
Sit there.

1185
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,420
It's always you

1186
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,510
who starts the arguments.

1187
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,830
-Dad.
-It's you.

1188
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,910
Dad, don't be angry.

1189
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,750
It's New Year.

1190
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:39,970
Come.

1191
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:43,010
-Dad, have a seat.
-Sit down and drink some water.

1192
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,180
Water?

1193
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,500
What do you mean?

1194
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,900
You want me to drink this?

1195
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,640
Alright, Dad.

1196
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,390
Dad, let me make you some coffee.

1197
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,990
No. I want water and tea.

1198
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,670
Give me a cup of coffee.

1199
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:55,790
Okay.

1200
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:56,530
Old woman,

1201
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,600
when did you develop this habit?

1202
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,460
You can't sleep after drinking it.

1203
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,500
It's good then.

1204
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,310
I'll play with you.

1205
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,390
Play with me?

1206
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:04,470
You'll torture me.

1207
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:08,440
Is it good?

1208
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,400
Yes.

1209
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,140
Okay.

1210
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,270
Here.

1211
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,080
Give me the glue.

1212
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,570
You don't stick it here.

1213
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,930
You don't understand.

1214
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,190
This is called “seeing fortune when you look up.”

1215
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,350
Be careful.

1216
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,290
No need.

1217
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,830
I can even jump to stick it on.

1218
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:32,740
Come on.

1219
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,720
You're not even tall enough on the chair.

1220
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,340
How about this?

1221
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,340
Go take out the trash.

1222
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,160
Don't leave any trash until next year.

1223
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,880
Really? That's a thing too?

1224
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,440
Be careful.

1225
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,190
Don't worry.

1226
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,430
Baoshan.

1227
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,210
Get up!

1228
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,440
Don't touch me.

1229
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,810
Where are you hurt?

1230
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:04,840
Nowhere.

1231
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,610
Just tired, taking a rest.

1232
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,320
It's New Year's Eve again.

1233
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:14,530
Linqi Oilfield

1234
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,190
wishes all oil workers

1235
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,560
a joyful family reunion

1236
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,020
and happiness and health.

1237
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:21,280
We're sending New Year's greetings in advance.

1238
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,720
Happy New Year to everyone.

1239
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,410
Not everyone is happy

1240
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:31,320
as the New Year approaches.

1241
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,310
Some carry worries

1242
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:35,170
from the past year

1243
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,400
into the new one.

1244
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,580
We Chinese often say,

1245
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,000
that on New Year's, we should be happy.

1246
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,440
All the misfortunes

1247
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:43,490
of the past year

1248
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:44,690
seem to dissipate

1249
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,720
with the New Year.

1250
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,050
That's the meaning of the New Year.

1251
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:49,840
I always love the New Year.

1252
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,460
I never let unhappy things

1253
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,690
carry over into the new year.

1254
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:53,480
No matter how bad

1255
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,650
the past year was,

1256
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,220
It's all in the past now.

1257
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,730
We must believe that

1258
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,850
the coming year brings hope.

1259
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,130
Happy New Year. Lucky every year.
