Yes.

What's the point of being first?

31
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,180
I graduated from elementary school as the top student as well.

32
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,710
Then, when I went to middle school in the town.

33
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,310
I was always the top student in every monthly exam.

34
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,590
All my teachers praised me,

35
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,450
saying I was a promising student.

36
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,940
My grandpa worked tirelessly,

37
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,910
trying to make more money

38
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,570
so I could focus on my studies.

39
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,700
My brother even went to work

40
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,820
after graduating from middle school.

41
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,950
He said that since he wasn't good at studying,

42
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,480
having enough basic knowledge would be fine.

43
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,390
Besides, Grandpa was getting old,

and his health was not good.

45
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,840
We couldn't let him work alone.

46
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,020
If one more person earned money,

47
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,460
I could keep studying.

For you,

52
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,500
going to school is something you can do

53
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,430
just because you're the right age.

54
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,270
But for me,

55
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,360
even if we gave it our all, I might not even get a chance to study.

56
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,650
What do you mean?

57
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,670
When I graduated from middle school,

58
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,550

got that award

66
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:20,470
Yeah.

67
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,820
Because high school education

68
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,140
isn't part of the nine-year compulsory education.

there was a high school over in the oilfield in Hexi,

00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,190
it's yours.

193
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,060
There will always be a chance to take exams.

194
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,940
Studying

195
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,250
will change your fate.

196
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,840
We don't rely on anyone.

197
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,540
Just ourselves.

198
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,780
Okay?

199
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,790
Let's fight for it ourselves.

200
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,040
Okay?

201
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,020
I borrowed these textbooks.

202
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,430
Find some time

203
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,260
to cover them with paper.

204
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,930
Then I started to learn by myself.

205
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,380
I carried those books with me wherever I went.

206
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,100
I read them whenever I was free.

207
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,360
Once I made some money,

208
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,460
I would buy study materials and practice exam papers.

209
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,320
I practiced English by following along with tapes,

210
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,070
but my pronunciation wasn't quite right either.

211
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,550
So you studied on your own during your first year of high school?

212
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,230
Yeah.

213
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,510
Wow, that's impressive!

214
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,190
I go to school every day,

215
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,520
and I still don't understand everything.

216
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,630
So, why did you end up

217
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,290
coming to our school later on?

218
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,510
One day, the old principal

219
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,020
came to my house, all excited.

220
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,900
He told me

221
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,750
that he had found the newly appointed principal

222
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,310
of No. 2 Middle School on the oilfield.

223
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,430
That principal

224
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,200
took him to meet with the factory leadership.

225
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,520
After some discussions, the leadership decided

226
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,300
to give me a chance to take an exam.

227
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,590
If I passed,

228
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,050
they would offer me a spot.

229
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,210
The principal's name was...

230
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,710
Last name Qin.

231
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,500
-Yeah, that's right, Principal Qin.
-Principal Qin.

232
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,870
He had just taken over.

233
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,900
And he fully supported

234
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,290
the donation for Zi.

235
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,370
He's really a good person.

236
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,850
I took the exam

237
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,680
in his office.

238
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,910
He looked at my exam paper and said,

239
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,840
"It would be such a shame

240
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,750
not to go to school with such good grades."

241
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,020
Principal Qin praised you,

242
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,590
and you still weren't happy?

243
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,980
Why do you always

244
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,670
seem so down at school?

245
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,750
I don't know.

246
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,360
I just feel uncomfortable.

247
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,900
For me to go to school,

248
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,870
my grandpa sold everything

249
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,060
he could from home.

250
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,830
And who knows how many people the old principal begged for help,

251
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,860
lowering himself in front of them.

252
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,240
When I think about these things, it makes me sad.

253
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,580
That's not right.

254
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,100
You earned this opportunity

255
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,070
through your own ability.

256
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,490
If your grades weren't good enough,

257
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,890
Principal Qin wouldn't have accepted you.

258
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,950
Xiaowa,

259
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,470
I'm sorry.

260
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,340
I always thought

261
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,390
you were just antisocial

262
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,720
and didn't like interacting with people.

263
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,220
But I never realized

264
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,660
how hard it was for you

265
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,540
to come to our school.

266
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,830
I oversimplified

267
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,110
everything.

268
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,750
I hurt you,

269
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,720
and I want to apologize sincerely.

270
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,140
You didn't hurt me.

271
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,550
I know you meant well for me.

272
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,530
It's mainly because I...

273
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,240
Why are you saying all that?

274
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,630
Even if it's easy for you to go to school,

275
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,550
you still need to take your studies seriously.

276
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,230
Look at your grades now.

277
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,590
Can you get into college with these?

278
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,670
Why are you

279
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,350
turning this around on me?

280
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,200
Let me tell you something.

281
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,350
I've realized

282
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,420
that studying

283
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,770
requires talent.

284
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,690
I'm still digging into mine.

285
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,610
No rush.

286
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,280
You better hurry up.

287
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,590
If we both get into college,

288
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,320
we can keep each other company.

289
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,440
Xiaowa.

290
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,720
Hua'er?

291
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:08,900
Hua'er?

292
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,780
Where are your parents?

293
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,110
They're still in Guangdong.

294
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,250
I sneaked back on my own.

295
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
You're only sixteen.

296
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,800
And they sent you off to work?

297
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,340
Her parents

298
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,150
sent her to work to earn money

299
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,010
for her brother's wedding dowry.

300
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,370
There are parents like that?

301
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,400
At her age,

302
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,910
she should be in school.

303
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,190
There's no high school

304
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,550
left in our town.

305
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,300
Our school is an option.

306
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,590
I had never had

307
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,390
the feeling of being oppressed,

308
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,630
with a force bursting out like fire.

309
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,990
For today's homework,

310
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,630
please finish page 20

311
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,540
and 21.

312
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,360
Okay, class is over.

313
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,100
Stand up.

314
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,700
Goodbye, teacher.

315
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,110
Goodbye, students.

316
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,030
Goodbye, teacher.

317
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,300
Miao.

318
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,230
Miao.

319
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,220
What's going on with you and Si?

320
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,000
You haven't spoken since you got here.

321
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,540
Who knows what's gotten into him?

322
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,660
He's been like this ever since I arrived.

323
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,460
I didn't even do anything to him.

324
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,900
Where did you go after school yesterday?

325
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,460
Did you go see Qiang Xiaowa?

326
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,010
Got it.

327
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,490
Case solved.

328
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,030
He's jealous.

329
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,210
What's he jealous about?

330
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,490
Let me put it this way.

331
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,140
If you suddenly

332
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,610
started getting along better with Wei Xue than with me,

333
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,850
I'd be mad too.

334
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,100
But

335
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,590
your situation with those two

336
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,870
is worse

337
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,940
than that.

338
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,510
Don't you know Li Si?

339
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,450
He's petty.

340
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,810
If you

341
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,470
get along with any other guy

342
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,700
better than him,

343
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,870
he'll get jealous

344
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:01,650
and lose it.

345
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,230
Lose it?

346
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:11,109
Pathetic.

347
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:14,750
What's the deal?

348
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,079
I'm not looking for you.

349
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:19,780
How's Hua'er?

350
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,280
Who's Hua'er?

351
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,609
She's pretty worked up.

352
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,780
But will the school

353
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,010
even let her attend?

354
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,890
Who wants to go to school?

355
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,550
Let's ask Mr. Gao

356
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,880
and see if he can help us.

357
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,330
Alright.

358
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,550
Who's Hua'er?

359
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,920
What's all this about going to school?

360
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,060
I really can't make the decision on this.

361
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:00,710
But if she's truly

362
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,920
eager to go to school,

363
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,340
I can try my best to advocate for her with the leadership.

364
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,800
She really wants to study.

365
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,730
She went to work before

366
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,210
because she didn't have

367
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,010
a way to continue her education.

368
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,040
Her parents forced her into it.

369
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,650
Alright.

370
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,050
After school this afternoon,

371
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,070
take me to your place.

372
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,200
I'll meet her first.

373
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,910
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

374
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,110
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

375
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,030
I told you, I wasn't embarrassed.

376
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,140
Not embarrassed.

377
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm leaving. I haven't finished my homework yet.

378
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,800
Wait a minute.

379
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,900
Yuan Shanqing's been doing

380
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,990
well lately, huh?

381
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,110
He's chatting and laughing

382
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,350
with our classmates.

383
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,470
Last time, that ball

384
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,670
hit my brother straight on the head,

385
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,130
and he didn't even get mad.

386
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,230
If this had happened before,

387
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,430
would you believe it?

388
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,980
Could your brother

389
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,350
have taken a liking to Yuan Shanqing?

390
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,380
Really?

391
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,790
No way.

392
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,470
Why not?

393
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,590
Think about it.

394
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,720
What was Luo Zheng's attitude like before?

395
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,140
How many times did he

396
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,410
grab Yuan by the collar,
ready to hit her?

397
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,180
And now?

398
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,960
Their conflict got resolved.

399
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,510
I'm telling you, it's all thanks to our Cheng.

400
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,510
Single-handedly,

401
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,910
she got those two enemies

402
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,860
to shake hands and make peace.

403
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,780
Makes sense.

404
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,910
Makes sense?

405
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,390
You better watch out.

406
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,450
Don't end up resolving their conflict

407
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,230
and pushing them

408
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,490
together!

409
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:32,900
Xiaowa.

410
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,030
Let's go.

411
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,630
Who exactly is Hua'er?

412
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,950
I really don't know.

413
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,660
Do you know

414
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,270
if anyone

415
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,330
has ever been so angry that they died?

416
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,750
Zhou Yu.

417
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:18,800
Isn't it said

418
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,580
that Zhuge Liang angered him to death?

419
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,910
“If Zhou was born, why was Zhuge born too?”

420
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,050
Then I must be Zhuge Liang.

421
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,130
Mom, that notebook

422
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,130
is in

423
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,740
the inner pocket

424
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,580
of your bag.

425
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,350
Take a look.

426
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,450
I put it there.

427
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,020
Found it?

428
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,580
Don't forget to take your cough syrup.

429
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,950
I put it in your bag.

430
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,430
Alright then.

431
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,420
Hanging up.

432
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,090
Mom.

433
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,160
Did you ask about the Walkman?

434
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,350
It's always about that Walkman,

435
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,440
over and over again.

436
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,230
Did you ask or not?

437
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,350
Yes, yes, I asked.

438
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:08,890
He bought it.

439
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,660
He said this time when he went to Beijing,

440
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,190
he saw others buying one too.

441
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,870
He didn't really know much about it.

442
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,470
He just bought one randomly.

443
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,070
Well, thank him for me then.

444
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,320
Mom.

445
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,230
Do you know how much this costs?

446
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:29,870
How much?

447
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:30,600
This is

448
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,150
quite expensive.

449
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,370
How expensive could something bought randomly be?

450
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,020
At that time,

451
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,270
my academic performance was pretty good.

452
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,860
The old principal kept persuading my parents,

453
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,590
and that's how I was able to finish middle school.

454
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,940
Mr. Gao.

455
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,790
Her grades

456
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,470
were indeed quite good before,

457
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,310
but

458
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,730
because of her parents...

459
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,470
There are many more kids

460
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,910
in our village like her.

461
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,870
I'm the only one in our village

462
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,600
who is still attending school.

463
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,580
Mr. Gao.

464
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,210
I really want to continue studying.

465
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,650
I'm sure I can do well.

466
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,260
Hua'er, don't worry.

467
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,960
Mr. Gao is really kind.

468
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,390
You'll definitely be the second person

469
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,390
from your village to keep studying.

470
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,530
Why do you want to study so much?

471
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,820
I want to change my fate.

472
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,590
Brother Wa told me

473
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,560
that only through studying can I change my destiny.

474
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,000
Alright.

475
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,310
I'll talk to the leadership tomorrow.

476
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,670
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

477
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,590
These buns are wrapped nicely.

478
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,630
Did Yuan wrap them all by herself?

479
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,090
Yes, she wrapped them all.

480
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,290
You see, they're all just kids,

481
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,580
but Yuan Shanqing's buns

482
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,180
are good enough to be served.

483
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,670
And you two, you and your sister...

484
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,800
You two lazybones only know how to eat.

485
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,150
I think it's because our family conditions

486
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:03,880
are too good,

487
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,520
that's why their limbs have gotten so weak.

488
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,660
I agree with that.

489
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,860
From now on, you and your sister

490
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,020
should practice more,

491
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,180
instead of letting me do all the work.

492
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,340
What time is it?

493
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,630
Why hasn't Cheng Miaomiao come back yet?

494
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:19,950
I think it's time

495
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,420
to discipline her again.

496
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,460
She's been slacking off a bit lately.

497
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,830
She's probably at Hu's house.

498
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,380
Don't worry about her.

499
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,510
She'll be back soon.

500
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,460
How many have you eaten?

501
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,190
I thought you didn't like

502
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,250
cabbage fillings.

503
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,110
He doesn't like your cooking, that's all.

504
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,860
But you just said it was delicious!

505
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,860
Swallow

506
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:40,990
what's in your mouth

507
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,300
before you speak.

508
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,150
This road is quite well-lit.

509
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,210
You really don't need to walk me back.

510
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,700
What are you two doing?

511
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,870
You scared me.

512
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,070
What are you sneaking around for?

513
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,970
Who's sneaking around?

514
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,880
I've been waiting for you here all evening.

515
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,850
Waiting for me?

516
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,670
I'm asking you, where did you two go?

517
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,430
I'm heading back.

518
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,700
Qiang Xiaowa, don't go.

519
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:09,870
I'm talking to you!

520
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:10,510
Feeling guilty?

521
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,440
Don't walk away!

522
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,120
What's wrong with you?

523
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,750
What's wrong with me?

524
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,310
Yeah, I'm crazy.

525
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,660
I'm just a crazy person.

526
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,790
If you're sick, go to the hospital.

527
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,910
Why are you yelling at me in the middle of the night?

528
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,190
Oh, so you know it's late at night?

529
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,330
Late at night, and you're still not home.

530
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,670
Aren't I heading home now?

531
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,680
You're heading home at this hour?

532
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,820
Do you even know you have a home?

533
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,180
I don't think you want to return to the oilfield.

534
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,440
Why don't you just move to his fishing village?

535
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,990
Live on his boat and go fishing every day.

536
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,190
Forget about school.

537
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,820
You trip all the time when you walk.

538
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,350
How come you haven't smashed your mouth yet?

539
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,480
You're so annoying.

540
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,810
Fine, fine.

541
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,270
When I fall and die, I will have a tomb.

542
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,130
Just don't cry.

543
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,730
Son, you're back.

544
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,150
I saved half a roast chicken for you.

545
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,010
I don't want it.

546
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,130
Come on, Li Si, come out here.

547
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,510
Who are you throwing a tantrum at?

548
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,380
Dahai, Dahai, Dahai.

549
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,300
Who are you throwing a tantrum at?

550
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,100
What are you doing?

551
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,470
Come out!

552
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,230
Can't you tell

553
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,360
our son is not happy?

554
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,190
What's he got to be unhappy about?

555
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,190
He's got food and drink all the time.

556
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,310
Eating like a king, living like a prince.

557
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:05,820
Enough already.

558
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,820
Now he's unhappy?

559
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:07,520
Come out!

560
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,940
Why can't I be unhappy?

561
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,670
Is my whole life just about eating?

562
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,260
I've got food and drink,

563
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,260
so I can't be unhappy?

564
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,590
I can't feel miserable?

565
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,740
Am I an idiot?

566
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,350
Wasn't he just yelling at me?

567
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,300
Wasn't he yelling at me?

568
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,800
What's wrong with you?

569
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,740
What's wrong?

570
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,670
Why does my head hurt so much all of a sudden?

571
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,790
I feel so dizzy.

572
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,460
Quick, help me lie down in the room.

573
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,200
Hurry, hurry.

574
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,550
How did it come on so suddenly?

575
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,750
I don't know either.

576
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,700
Wasn't he just yelling at me?

577
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,670
Why am I feeling so out of it?

578
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,500
Don't talk.

579
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,680
I can't stand any noise right now.

580
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,510
Quiet.

581
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,330
Quiet.

582
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,470
[Unwearied in Teaching]

583
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,560
My blood pressure

584
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,830
isn't just from

585
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,880
being angry at those rascals.

586
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,210
It's because of you too.

587
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,280
Me? What did I do?

588
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,630
What did you do?

589
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,200
Your class is always causing trouble.

590
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,080
Every few days,

591
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,440
there's something new.

592
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,180
Mr. Gao.

593
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,930
I hired you at a high salary

594
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:11,870
to improve

595
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,900
the academic performance of this class.

596
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,740
But what did you do?

597
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,140
The first thing you did

598
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,460
was cancel the ranking system.

599
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,300
And then you're always

600
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,230
telling them things like

601
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,070
academic performance

602
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,330
isn't that important.

603
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,060
I didn't say academic performance isn't important.

604
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,120
I just think ranking is unnecessary.

605
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,930
What do you mean unnecessary?

606
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,750
If you

607
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,300
don't let them clearly see

608
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,630
those rankings and scores,

609
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,310
how will they have the drive to improve?

610
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,640
And now look at them,

611
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,310
each one thinks they're doing fine.

612
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,900
Even the last-place student feels no pressure.

613
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,430
But does ranking magically

614
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,680
help the last-place student improve?

615
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,530
Mr. Gao,

616
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,060
that mindset of yours is dangerous.

617
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,390
What do we

618
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,300
teachers do?

619
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,310
We're supposed to

620
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,460
crack the whip,

621
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,300
constantly

622
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,580
driving them forward,

623
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,070
just like herding sheep.

624
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,810
What do sheep know?

625
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,830
If you don't round them up

626
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,020
when it gets dark,

627
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,850
won't the wolves

628
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:04,850
snatch them away?

629
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,820
That's why,

630
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,390
Director, if you don't give me

631
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,730
this transfer slot,

632
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,980
a child really might

633
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,390
get snatched by the "wolves".

634
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,050
Mr. Gao, I have to say,

635
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,130
do you think these slots

636
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,380
are just something you can ask for and get?

637
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,950
Today you ask for one,

638
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,540
tomorrow someone else will.

639
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,020
What do you think this school is?

640
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,670
A cafeteria

641
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,070
where you fight for meal tickets?

642
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,310
Even that kid Qiang Xiaowa in your class

643
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,620
was let in because the principal

644
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,680
made an exception.

645
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:33,130
This is a school for the children of oilfield workers.

646
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,390
It's an internal school.

647
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,150
We haven't fully

648
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,480
opened enrollment yet.

649
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,470
Director,

650
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,550
I know this

651
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,280
is not a typical situation,

652
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,860
and it's not something just anyone can handle.

653
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,390
That's why I've come to you.

654
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,310
At our school,

655
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,910
it's still you who has the final say on decisions.

656
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,100
You...

657
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:50,940
That's enough.

658
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,400
If the principal hears you say that,

659
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,000
he might think I'm disloyal.

660
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,350
I was only talking about abilities.

661
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,660
I believe you're the only one

662
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,050
who can handle this matter with Li Hua'er.

663
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,400
My blood pressure is rising again.

664
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,560
The greater the ability, the higher the blood pressure.

665
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,400
What can I do?

666
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,940
I'm only thirty, and my blood pressure is already so high.

667
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,140
Where's my blood pressure medication?

668
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,920
Where's my blood pressure medication?

669
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,000
Where did I put it?

670
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:24,540
Director.

671
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,510
Let me find it.

672
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,580
-Blood pressure medication.
-Take care of your health.

673
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,580
I'll head out now.

674
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,810
Ms. Han.

675
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,590
Ms. Han.

676
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,410
What a coincidence.

677
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,440
I've been waiting for you.

678
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,760
Is there something you need?

679
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:06,710
It's about Cheng Miaomiao's

680
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,970
English grades again.

681
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:08,900
I had a serious talk

682
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,720
with her once.

683
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,940
But the child takes after her mother.

684
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,670
Stubborn.

685
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,990
She doesn't listen to anyone.

686
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,740
So I wanted to

687
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,900
ask you, Ms. Han,

688
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,520
if there's a more scientific

689
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,910
and effective method

690
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,570
to improve her English grade.

691
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,190
Honestly, as long as she

692
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,920
listens carefully in class

693
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,540
and completes her homework thoroughly,

694
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,130
her grades will definitely improve.

695
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:26,590
Really?

696
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,370
There's no need to rush too much.

697
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,890
But we have to rush.

698
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:30,410
Look,

699
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,110
she's already in her second year of high school.

700
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,220
In no time, she'll be in her third year.

701
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,480
The college entrance exam is coming up soon.

702
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,190
It's a major life event.

703
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,320
As parents and teachers,

704
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,270
shouldn't we take it seriously?

705
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,780
Yes, we should.

706
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,150
So I'd really appreciate it, Ms. Han,

707
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,220
if you could spare some time from your busy schedule

708
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,740
to guide me as an elder

709
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,860
on the methods and approaches.

710
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,590
Is that okay?

711
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,910
I've reserved a private room

712
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:50,670
at Xiaoshudu Restaurant.

713
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,270
We can discuss it over a meal.

714
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,510
Come, please get in the car.

715
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,750
No need to stand on ceremony.

716
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,230
Ms. Han.

717
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,280
Director Xiao.

718
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,010
What's up?

719
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,610
Is there something?

720
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,010
Yes.

721
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,090
So, what's the matter?

722
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,830
Actually, it's nothing major.

723
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,630
I just wanted

724
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,030
to consult Ms. Han

725
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,390
about educational matters.

726
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,030
I didn't expect to trouble you

727
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,220
to come personally.

728
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,940
Student matters are my responsibility.

729
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,200
It's no trouble at all.

730
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,870
Feel free to consult openly.

731
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,000
Since we're here,

732
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,730
why don't we order some dishes first?

733
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,750
We can discuss things while eating.

734
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,550
That's fine.

735
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,790
Don't order too much.

736
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,250
No need to be extravagant.

737
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,820
Ms. Han, come on,

738
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,940
choose what you'd like to eat.

739
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,140
I'm practically like

740
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,640
a sibling to the boss here.

741
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:45,950
Even dishes not on the menu,

742
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,880
she can prepare.

743
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,730
Miaomiao's Uncle.

744
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,350
Really, don't be so polite.

745
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,950
Let's just discuss what we need to.

746
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,550
No need to go to such trouble.

747
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:54,910
Ms. Han.

748
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,350
We're all here now.

749
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,040
The menu is right here for you.

750
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,750
Don't worry about the expense, Miaomiao's Uncle.

751
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,230
How could this be an expense for me?

752
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,940
You're being too formal.

753
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,760
Don't call me Miaomiao's Uncle.

754
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,090
Just call me Baoshan. It's easier to say.

755
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,270
Okay.

756
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:11,710
Baoshan.

757
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,110
Don't make it too troublesome.

758
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,040
No.

759
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,420
It's no trouble at all.

760
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,270
Ladies,

761
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,180
you usually eat

762
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,270
at the school cafeteria, right?

763
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,420
The cafeteria has large pots of food.

764
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,740
There's nothing much to eat.

765
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,590
It's good to occasionally have a better meal.

766
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,160
It's better for your health,

767
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,760
right?

768
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,910
Especially for you, Ms. Han.

769
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,640
You came from Shanghai.

770
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,340
You must haven't had

771
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,080
Shanghai cuisine for a long time, right?

772
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,350
Of course.

773
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,410
In this place,

774
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,970
where can she get Shanghai cuisine?

775
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,100
We can arrange that.

776
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,480
Waitress.

777
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,790
Hello, may I help you?

778
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,250
Please have the boss come over.

779
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:48,960
Okay.

780
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
I'll have the boss

781
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,630
arrange a few Shanghai dishes for you.

782
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,890
You can give them a try.

783
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,660
Director Xiao, is that okay with you?

784
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,860
I have no objections.

785
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,150
The key is, can they actually prepare it?

786
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,280
They must be able to.

787
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,770
Director Xiao, please.

788
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:06,610
Take a look.

789
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,700
Choose what you like.

790
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,870
What's wrong?

791
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,680
Ling.

792
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,710
Have the chef

793
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,350
prepare a few authentic Shanghai dishes.

794
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,230
Are you crazy?

795
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,190
This is a Sichuan restaurant.

796
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,850
We can't make those.

797
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,320
If you want to eat Shanghai cuisine, go back...

798
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,790
Director Xiao is also here.

799
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,620
Yes.

800
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,050
Baoshan

801
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,340
is consulting about a child's education.

802
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,800
He's treating us to a meal.

803
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,230
Then don't order Shanghai dishes.

804
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,220
I remember you love

805
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,390
my signature dishes here.

806
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,400
Boiled Sliced Pork.

807
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,410
Spicy Chicken.

808
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,430
Extra spicy.

809
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,190
Of course, wait for a moment.

810
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:39,990
Sorry for the trouble.

811
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,890
Don't mention it.

812
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,220
You take care of things.

813
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,350
Zhao.

814
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:44,670
Well.

815
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,180
Director Xiao, are you also familiar with Ling?

816
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:47,940
Sort of.

817
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,620
Next time, let's have Shanghai cuisine.

818
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,830
Anyway, the Director's attitude is very firm.

819
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,290
There's nothing we can do.

820
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,320
Let me think about this some more.

821
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,949
You should head home first.

822
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,460
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

823
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:16,139
Goodbye, Mr. Gao.

824
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:28,940
No.

825
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,500
I can't let Hua'er

826
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,030
suffer the same way you did.

827
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,460
I...

828
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,300
I'll go talk to Fang.

829
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:36,429
Fang

830
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:37,630
is tough on the outside but soft-hearted.

831
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,790
I'm good

832
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,830
at persuasion.

833
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,050
I'm sure I can handle it.

834
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,370
This soup is a great thing.

835
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,320
It's nutritious and good for the skin.

836
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,090
Here, Director Xiao.

837
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,070
Have some first.

838
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:54,750
-Thank you.
-You handle countless affairs every day.

839
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,500
You're so busy working. Drink more of this.

840
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,810
Ms. Han, here.

841
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,370
This bowl is for you.

842
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,880
It has white fungus in it.

843
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,790
Uncle.

844
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,400
Li Si.

845
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,400
What are you doing?

846
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,840
Why are you running away when you see us?

847
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,960
No, no.

848
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:13,860
Well.

849
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,300
I just saw

850
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,670
that you and Ms. Han were busy,

851
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,260
so I thought you might be in a meeting.

852
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,130
A meeting can be held

853
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,420
in your restaurant's private room?

854
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,060
Come in.

855
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,590
Why not?

856
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,850
You're welcome to come anytime.

857
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,570
My mom said my uncle was here.

858
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,100
She asked me to come to ask you

859
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,560
if you have seen Miaomiao.

860
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:32,630
No, I haven't.

861
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,910
I'm just discussing

862
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,940
your academic matters with Ms. Han.

863
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,010
The Director is also here.

864
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,870
I'm just listening to the advice.

865
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,990
You've never passed.

866
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,490
Why are you asking about us?

867
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,130
Nonsense.

868
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:44,970
Stop making jokes

869
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,680
in front of your teachers.

870
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,830
If you have nothing else, you can leave.

871
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:47,460
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

872
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,130
Come back.

873
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,140
It looks like you didn't learn anything

874
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,070
from being away from the oilfield.

875
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,380
You should update me

876
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,830
on your recent thoughts.

877
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,510
Well, I...

878
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,790
Since coming back from being away from the oil field,

879
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,750
I have seriously

880
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,680
reflected and learned from my experiences.

881
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,990
I've even summarized them.

882
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:07,510
Well...

883
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,690
My current thoughts are

884
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,080
to abide by the law,

885
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,550
study hard, and make progress every day.

886
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,140
I do have

887
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,180
some minor worries

888
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,390
due to academic pressure.

889
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,630
But I believe I can handle them.

890
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,190
Don't worry about it.

891
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,590
No need for you and Ms. Han

892
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,400
to be concerned.

893
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,280
If it really needs to be resolved,

894
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,440
it could be about

895
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,350
how my uncle

896
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,030
always flatters Ms. Han.

897
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:30,760
I'm leaving.

898
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:31,730
You rascal.

899
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:32,770
This...

900
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,650
This...

901
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,610
He's talking nonsense.

902
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,390
So that's what it is about.

903
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:41,650
So, I'm somewhat

904
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,050
redundant sitting here.

905
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,150
No, no, no.

906
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,150
Director, you misunderstood.

907
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,510
Did I misunderstand?

908
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,580
Yes, yes.

909
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,610
I...

910
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,800
It's like this.

911
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,550
You know Miaomiao from my family.

912
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,140
That kid is really worrisome.

913
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,800
It makes me anxious every day.

914
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:58,940
It's indeed a worry.

915
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,500
Right?

916
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:02,590
I...

917
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,550
Director, Baoshan.

918
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,550
I still have papers to grade.

919
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,170
If you have any confusion,

920
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,920
you can consult Director Xiao.

921
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,310
Director Xiao has much more experience

922
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,620
than I do.

923
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,860
No, no, no.

924
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:14,570
Ms. Han.

925
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,870
Even if you're busy with work,

926
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,590
you need to take some rest.

927
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,250
Right?

928
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,390
Ms. Han

929
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,690
is a young teacher.

930
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,260
She has a heavy workload.

931
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,600
It's great to have this mindset.

932
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,570
Don't worry, go ahead.

933
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,060
I will have a thorough discussion

934
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,720
with Baoshan

935
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,010
about Miaomiao's study issues.

936
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,100
#NAME?

937
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,470
Well.

938
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,730
Aren't you staying for a while?

939
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,640
Come on, Baoshan.

940
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,220
Let's talk about it.

941
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,330
Yes, yes, let's talk.

942
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,390
Well...

943
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,350
That...

944
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,480
Boiled Sliced Pork.

945
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,880
Look, the Boiled Sliced Pork

946
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,920
you love is here.

947
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,540
How about we eat and talk?

948
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,290
Sure, sure. Let's eat and chat.

949
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,040
Come on, come on.

950
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,010
Where else could Xiao Fang be?

951
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,430
She's not in the office.

952
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,090
She's not going back to the dormitory.

953
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,840
She's always catching people for being late or leaving early,

954
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,770
but she herself stays out at night.

955
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,470
Maybe we should

956
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,950
go to her office tomorrow?

957
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,800
Let's wait a bit.

958
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,470
She's not back at this hour.

959
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,000
She's definitely on a date.

960
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,620
I speak

961
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,590
with authority.

962
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,690
When I say no,

963
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,790
the principal has to think it over.

964
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,100
For Linqi No. 2 High School,

965
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,960
I can say I've devoted myself entirely.

966
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,720
Everyone has to acknowledge me.

967
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,070
That's the mission.

968
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,190
Did you see?

969
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,830
She was off on a date.

970
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,670
My mission is

971
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,620
to do everything for the children.

972
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,010
As long as the children are well,

973
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,620
nothing else matters.

974
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,360
The key.

975
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,030
Yes.

976
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,410
A teacher is the key

977
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,340
to a student's heart.

978
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,180
What? Your house key.

979
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,310
House key.

980
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:09,940
What about having a drink?

981
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,070
-This guy...
-You talk so much.

982
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:11,820
The greater the responsibility...

983
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,460
His style looks so familiar.

984
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,310
It's all what I should be doing.

985
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,190
It's expected.

986
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,630
I'm married to Linqi No. 2 High School.

987
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,930
Yes. Married.

988
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,490
You're finally home.

989
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,440
Home? What home?

990
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,390
♫I want a home♫

991
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:33,260
♫A place that doesn't need to be big♫

992
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,550
Stop singing.

993
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,940
Everyone's already asleep.

994
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,830
Asleep?

995
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,130
Then I'll go to sleep too.

996
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,530
You can't sleep like this.

997
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,140
Cover me with the quilt a bit.

998
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:44,750
Well, the quilt...

999
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,860
Hand out.

1000
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,760
Uncle?

1001
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,240
-Miaomiao.
-Is it really you?

1002
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,310
What are you doing?

1003
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,110
Director Xiao, goodbye.

1004
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,340
Uncle.

1005
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,830
It's not what you think.

1006
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,360
What do you think it is?

1007
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,590
An honest look.

1008
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:09,150
People should have an honest look.

1009
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:13,510
I feel like...

1010
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,240
-I have a good look.
-Miaomiao.

1011
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,610
-Don't mind your uncle.
-Don't touch me.

1012
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:20,080
[Faculty and Staff Dormitory]

1013
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,430
Don't...

1014
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,590
You don't know what's going on.

1015
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,780
-I...
-Miaomiao, Xiaowa.

1016
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,510
Uncle.

1017
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,270
What are you two doing in the middle of the night?

1018
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,530
What are you two doing?

1019
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,790
Turn around.

1020
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,830
Let me explain.

1021
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,430
You two quickly explain.

1022
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,550
What's there to explain?

1023
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,280
A single man and a single woman.

1024
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,940
It's not what you imagine.

1025
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,300
So what is it then?

1026
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,390
Mind's changed.

1027
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,490
The alcohol is kicking in.

1028
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,260
Why did you hide this from me?

1029
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,340
You two should have told me earlier.

1030
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,180
Who's hiding anything from you?

1031
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,790
It's just you overthinking things.

1032
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:48,300
Besides,

1033
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,140
what good would it do to tell you?

1034
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,030
How could it be of no use?

1035
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,870
We're a collective.

1036
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,020
I'm the soul of this collective.

1037
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,860
From now on, any major events

1038
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,340
must be

1039
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,310
reported to me, the soul.

1040
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,180
Otherwise, I'd be anxious.

1041
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,420
I even skipped a meal.

1042
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,250
Enough.

1043
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,710
Why are you so anxious here?

1044
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,510
I'm anxious now.

1045
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,660
Alright, alright.

1046
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,050
Don't be anxious, okay?

1047
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,730
Let me explain.

1048
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:04,790
-I...
-Uncle.

1049
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,020
What's there to explain?

1050
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,050
With Wang Chanchan before

1051
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:07,950
and Ms. Han after,

1052
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,310
you just...

1053
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:10,870
He was just lying

1054
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,200
on Director Xiao's bed.

1055
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,590
Are you still

1056
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,190
my dear Uncle?

1057
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:14,910
No, no, no...

1058
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,190
What you're saying isn't true.

1059
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,550
No, you... you...

1060
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,270
How can I behave

1061
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,670
if you spread such rumors?

1062
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:20,990
Uncle, you...

1063
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,340
Look, you're even stuttering now.

1064
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,070
Explanation is just cover-up.

1065
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,070
Alright, stop it.

1066
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,950
Here's Fang's bag she left at the restaurant.

1067
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:26,960
You should return it to her.

1068
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,290
Why should I deliver it?

1069
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,740
We're not that close.

1070
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:32,730
Alright.

1071
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,560
We won't tell anyone.

1072
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,520
No one will know.

1073
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,220
We won't tell Ms. Han for sure.

1074
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,050
It's not about who knows or not.

1075
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,780
This is a matter of reputation.

1076
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,160
Right.

1077
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,230
Ms. Han really shouldn't know.

1078
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,590
Because I honestly can't explain this.

1079
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,900
What's there to explain?

1080
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,670
You're not dating Ms. Han.

1081
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:50,220
Why would she care about you?

1082
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,350
How can you say that?

1083
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,310
Even if not dating,

1084
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,270
one should care.

1085
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:53,940
Yes.

1086
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,590
What Si said is right.

1087
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:56,490
Right.

1088
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,270
If Ms. Han finds out,

1089
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,500
you both need to testify for me.

1090
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,230
Enough.

1091
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,310
Stop worrying about it.

1092
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:01,820
You and Ms. Han

1093
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,790
are simply impossible.

1094
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:03,990
I think...

1095
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,540
What do you think?

1096
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,640
Uncle.

1097
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,590
Why don't you

1098
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:11,530
pursue Director Xiao?

1099
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:12,760
I think you two

1100
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,310
might be a good match.

1101
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,150
Let's go.

1102
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,510
No one can truly live

1103
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,710
in a honey pot of life.

1104
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,780
Some are unhappy

1105
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,500
because they didn't buy their favorite clothes.

1106
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,950
Some are sad because their unrequited love

1107
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:27,880
didn't work out.

1108
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,630
Some are disappointed because their efforts

1109
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,320
yielded no reward.

1110
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,590
Some people

1111
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,180
strive to overcome the difficulties

1112
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,710
on their path to education.

1113
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,950
Others even

1114
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:37,940
strive to find a way out

1115
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,710
in an effort to escape

1116
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,770
the poverty of their lives.

1117
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,060
Later, every time I think of

1118
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,150
16-year-old Hua'er

1119
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,480
and Shanqing around me,

1120
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:47,620
all my hardships

1121
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,080
and worries

1122
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,570
seem trivial.

1123
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,420
My journey to school

1124
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,550
is from home to Linqi No. 2 High School.

1125
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,560
Their journey to school

1126
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,830
is from the mud

1127
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,510
to an unreachable place.
