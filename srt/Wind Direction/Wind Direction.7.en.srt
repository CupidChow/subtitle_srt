00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,140
Stop staring at him.

190
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,620
What about our hair?

191
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,430
Move aside.

192
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,240
How am I supposed to go to work like this tomorrow?

193
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,100
Well... how about we wear a hat tomorrow?

194
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,980
Wear a hat? No way!

195
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,430
How about I remove these and wash your hair?

196
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,260
Let's wash it now.

197
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,030
Starting tomorrow,

198
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,090
you're not getting any pocket money!

199
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,540
And tonight, don't go to bed!

200
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,400
I'll just sit right here with you!

201
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,460
I think you have way too much energy!

202
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,680
Isn't that a bit much, Mom?

203
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,880
A bit much?

204
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,140
Do you want me

205
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,030
to call your dad now

206
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:51,630
and ask him to come back?

207
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,960
No, no, no need. Well...

208
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,180
I don't want any pocket money anymore.

209
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,260
I don't want any pocket money anymore.

210
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,520
You really piss me off!

211
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,450
Squat properly!

212
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,290
You young people

213
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,770
need to resist temptation

214
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,870
and stay on the right path.

215
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,160
Don't go astray.

216
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,340
So many people

217
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,790
take one wrong step, leading to lifelong regret.

218
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,040
This is all a lesson.

219
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,210
Uncle,

220
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,960
you should write that down

221
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,620
and read it from time to time when you're free.

222
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,190
Out of everyone in the family, you're the most reckless and dangerous.

223
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,300
I'm an adult.

224
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,450
I've seen the world.

225
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,700
When someone who's been through everything tells you something,

226
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,160
you have to listen with your heart, you know?

227
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,200
I...

228
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,750
Look at the time!

229
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,950
Hurry up, you two!

230
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,750
Yeah, stop dawdling.

231
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,919
Listen to your teachers at school, alright?

232
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,480
Yu.

233
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,240
I'm leaving, then.

234
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,210
When will you come back?

235
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,570
I'll be back once your mom cools down.

236
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,720
Stay for breakfast before you leave.

237
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,550
I'm too ashamed to eat.

238
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,550
See you, Pengfei.

239
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,040
Wait, take one of these too.

240
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,120
See you, my foot!

241
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,760
So heartless!

242
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,760
Let's eat.

243
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,480
I patted my chest

244
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,990
and promised Mr. Gao

245
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,280
that I could definitely help Qiang Xiaowa

246
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,100
fit in with the group.

247
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,070
But things

248
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,220
haven't gone well at all.

249
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,590
Not only did I fail to bring him in,

250
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,030
but he also had a fight with you.

251
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,080
Now, you both

252
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,490
ended up at the police station last night.

253
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,040
I thought that going through a tough time together

254
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,190
might bring us closer,

255
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,860
but it turned out that nothing changed. He's still the same.

256
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,100
Then forget it.

257
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,940
We don't have the necessary skills,

258
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,540
and he's not a delicate task.

259
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,460
Qiang Xiaowa has saved you twice

260
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,060
in critical moments,

261
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,720
Li Si.

262
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,510
You owe him so much.

263
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,540
Yesterday, the cops scolded me,

264
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,460
my mom scolded me,

265
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,740
and I spent the entire night half-squatting with a basin on my head.

266
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,580
What more do you want from me?

267
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,510
One should always repay kindness!

268
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,090
But it seems like he doesn't really need us

269
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,570
to return his kindness.

270
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,650
He has been here for many days,

271
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,700
yet he hasn't said a word to you or even looked at you,

272
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,360
and he always looks so fierce.

273
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,410
Fierce?

274
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,020
I really don't feel that way.

275
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,340
I think he just feels self-conscious

276
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,580
because he doesn't speak Mandarin well.

277
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,940
I'm running for Class Monitor next week.

278
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,570
If I

279
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,630
don't handle this well,

280
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,630
it will definitely affect my votes.

281
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,390
I've got to try everything.

282
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,470
I refuse to lose!

283
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,740
She's obsessed with becoming the Class Monitor.

284
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,820
I think so too.

285
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,560
[New semester, new beginning]

286
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,360
Qiang Xiaowa.

287
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,200
Wanna some Maltesers?

288
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,660
Steamed bun.

289
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,810
It's a meat bun, and it's so delicious.

290
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,420
The correct answer to this question is B.

291
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,950
Didn't I tell you last time?

292
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,270
And this one.

293
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,960
Look at your math problems...

294
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,560
Qiang Xiaowa,

295
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,730
why can't we choose A for this one?

296
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,700
Why did we choose B for this question?

297
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,570
It's so dirty here.

298
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,980
Let me sweep it up for you.

299
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,920
Are you doing your homework, Qiang Xiaowa?

300
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,050
Lift your foot. Let me clean it for you.

301
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,120
Want to play soccer?

302
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,030
Going to the toilet?

303
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,770
Come on, just go!

304
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,260
You...

305
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,160
Don't choke yourself.

306
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,850
Miaomiao,

307
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,220
have some water.

308
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,060
Don't be mad.

309
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,360
Have some water.

310
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Thank you, madam.

311
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,100
Boss, one for me.

312
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,900
Excuse me. Thank you.

313
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,930
-Thanks.
-Let's go.

314
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,940
Help me buy a pack of preserved plums.

315
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,140
By the way,

316
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,500
why is Yuan Shanqing late every day?

317
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,580
And as soon as the school bell rings,

318
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,710
she disappears without a trace.

319
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,240
I don't know where she went.

320
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,140
However,

321
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,980
she does seem a bit pitiful.

322
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,440
I've tried to persuade my brother.

323
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,660
Causing trouble at school

324
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,900
won't do him any good.

325
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,450
He’s just too heartbroken right now

326
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,160
and a bit irrational.

327
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,420
But hasn't his mood improved

328
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,980
a lot over the past few days?

329
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:13,900
Cheng,

330
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,900
don't always go against my brother.

331
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,900
It's not worth it.

332
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,750
There are lots of things that aren't worth it.

333
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,090
One...

334
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:23,960
-Let’s go.
-Two...

335
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,920
Three, four, five,

336
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,660
six, seven, eight.

337
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,200
Two, two, three, four,

338
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,860
five, six, seven, switch.

339
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,290
Three, two, three, four...

340
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,180
Ready.

341
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,100
Five, six, seven, eight.

342
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,180
Four, two, three, four...

343
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:46,340
Go! Go! Go!

344
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,340
Come on!

345
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:56,930
Come on! Come on!

346
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,610
Come on! Go! Go!

347
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,180
Keep going!

348
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,940
Come on, Qiang Xiaowa!

349
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,980
Come on, Qiang Xiaowa!

350
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,520
Where is Li Si?

351
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,380
I don't know.

352
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,900
Probably ran back.

353
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,190
Zhu Chao!

354
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,280
Zhu Chao! Class Monitor, come on!

355
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,470
Come on! Come on!

356
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,970
Come on!

357
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,080
Come on! Come on!

358
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,740
Come on! Come on!

359
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,610
Come on! Come on!

360
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,790
Li Si, first place!

361
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,160
Come on! Come on!

362
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,770
It's okay.

363
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,870
Come on! Come on!

364
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,830
Tone down your looks of admiration.

365
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,560
I was just performing as usual.

366
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,470
Yes, indeed.

367
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,870
I'd never mess up at a critical moment.

368
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,010
What critical moment?

369
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,110
The Olympics?

370
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
The Olympics?

371
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,340
Wait, what's with your attitude?

372
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,940
Is this how you treat the first-place winner?

373
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,350
Mr. Gao.

374
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,700
It's been a week.

375
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,640
What's wrong with Qiang Xiaowa in your class?

376
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,150
He still hasn't worn the school uniform

377
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,280
or cut his hair.

378
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,060
What should I tell the principal

379
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,120
when he comes back?

380
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,210
In the end,

381
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,540
it all becomes my fault.

382
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,650
I know.

383
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,820
What's the use of just knowing it?

384
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,350
You said you knew last time.

385
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,030
You have to solve it.

386
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,060
There's a problem with a student in your class.

387
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,020
As the class teacher, don't you

388
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,770
have a responsibility to take action about it?

389
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,410
Of course, yes.

390
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,930
Director, I've just come here.

391
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,630
You have to give me some time

392
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,870
to become familiar with my students.

393
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,500
Whether you know them or not,

394
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,740
your students must still adhere

395
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,840
to the school rules and regulations, right?

396
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,470
No one dares to break the rules.

397
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,580
They all follow the rules.

398
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,180
Qiang Xiaowa

399
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,990
is a bit special.

400
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:53,820
After all, he isn't one of

401
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,360
the children of the oil field workers.

402
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,440
You see, he wasn't

403
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,140
really bound

404
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,260
by any rules or regulations before.

405
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,390
He's just come into a new environment.

406
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,420
We should take things with him step by step.

407
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,380
I don't care

408
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,290
which village school he attended before.

409
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,100
Now that he's at the Oilfield Children's School,

410
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,670
he should be treated like everyone else.

411
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,200
Yes.

412
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,540
We had a deal

413
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,680
before he came.

414
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,700
If he's going to continue to be so uncooperative,

415
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,580
he might as well not attend school anymore.

416
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,440
Director, it's not that serious.

417
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,820
-Why is it not that serious?
-Are they going to

418
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,360
send Qiang Xiaowa back?

419
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,400
He's the only one in the school who gets special treatment.

420
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Director, please give me more time.

421
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,540
How much time do I have to give you?

422
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,900
I've already given you a week, haven't I?

423
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,300

Do you have time?

427
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,040
I'm going to get a haircut.

Let's go together. It's on me.

No.

About the school uniform,

431
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,610
I've told the school logistics department.

-They said...
-I won't buy it.

What are you up to this time?

I can't just brute force it.

440
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,010
I need to use clever strategies.

441
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,819
To completely suppress Qiang Xiaowa,

442
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,990
surpassing him in study is a good strategy.

00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,410
his grades can't possibly be good.

If I put in just a little effort,

00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,560
I can definitely outscore him.

I don't know

448
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,589
why he always acts so superior.

00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,800
Look at his looks...

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,359
Let's not talk about looks.

Let's talk about hairstyles.

452

Can his hairstyle

Besides, if we are better at studying than him,

how can he compete with us?

Did you forget that he kicked me?

465
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,820
So, kick him back.

I guess...

520
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,810
it's similar to being in a freezer.

If Zhao Min wanted to marry me,

528
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,200
I would definitely marry her.

Your dad.

535
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,740
Then the Xuanming Elders wouldn't be able to handle him.

00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,700
The only thing that can handle my dad

537
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,430
is my grandma's walking stick.

538
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,580
Personally,

539
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,630
I think Linghu Chong is better.

540
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,290
Man,

541
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,540
Linghu Chong is from "The Smiling Proud Wanderer."

Do you think

544
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,840
Linghu Chong likes Ren Yingying?

545
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,200
Of course he does.

546
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,620
Otherwise, why would he travel the world

547
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,660
with her?

548
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,040
That doesn't count.

549
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,490
I think that deep down,

550
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,830
he's still thinking about his junior Lingshan.

551
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,630
He has long over her.

552
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,220
By the end,

553
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,980
he's only into Ren Yingying.

554
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,800
You don't understand men.

556
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,420
a man's first love

557
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,710
is the most important.

558
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,200
She can stay in his heart for a lifetime.

559
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,530
That's irresponsible.

560
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,960
When you're with another woman

561
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,290
but you still think about your first love,

562
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,550
doesn't that make you worse than a beast?

563
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,890
I'm an exception.

564
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,000
I'll only marry my first love.

565
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,720
You have a first love?

566
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,720
I don't even know that.

567
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,010
How could you not know?

568
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,750
Who is it?

569
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,660
Guess.

570
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,590
Li Si,

571
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,330
are you worse than an animal?

572
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,160
We're together all the time,

573
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,220
yet you still keep secrets from me?

574
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:20,980
-No.
-You said

575
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,860
that you'd marry me when you were three.

576
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,700
Even though I didn't agree,

577
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,820
you changed your mind so quickly.

578
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,810
Let go of me!

579
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,090
When have I changed my mind?

580
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,490
I'm a real man!

581
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:29,750
I'm not my dad.

582
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,850
What's wrong with your dad?

583
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,870
Fate is cruel.

584
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,700
Fate is cruel.

585
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,290
Dad!

586
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,720
Fate is cruel.

587
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,530
You've been drinking again, haven't you?

588
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,460
Who is speaking?

589
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,620
Who?

590
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,230
Me, your son.

591
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,050
My son?

592
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,570
My son is good, my son.

593
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,410
My son is handsome.

594
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,110
My son has sparkling eyes.

595
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,350
My son needs to study diligently.

596
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,000
You can't drink.

597
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,730
Drinking...

598
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,100
will make you stupid.

599
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:00,790
Yes.

600
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,750
You are a living example.

601
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,100
Seeing you like this, I won't drink either.

602
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,730
Let's go home.

603
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,060
No... I didn't drink.

604
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,100
I did.

605
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,340
Get up.

606
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,740
Get... up.

607
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,640
Why are the stairs slippery?

608
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,060
They're so slippery.

609
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,100
Let's go home.

610
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,190
I'll open the door.

611
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,940
There is no keyhole.

612
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,350
Which one is the keyhole?

613
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,400
Insert it upwards if you can't see the keyhole.

614
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,580
The door is already open for you.

615
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,660
Let's go. Come up.

616
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,730
That's not the keyhole.

617
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,770
It's up there.

618
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,030
-Let's go.
-It's up there.

619
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,870
No, my photo.

620
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,920
Let me get it for you.

621
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,580
My photo.

622
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,060
Don't let your mom see it.

623
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,070
Is that your dad in the photo?

624
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,550
I know it's him with just one glance.

625
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,340
He looks thinner than he does now.

626
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,290
but my dad was quite handsome

627
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,290
when he was young.

628
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,140
That girl must be my dad's first love.

629
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:58,930
Her name is Bai Shuang.

630
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,060
I still remember it.

631
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,100
Then, does your mom know about this?

632
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,670
How can I tell this to her? Am I stupid?

633
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,660
Crying while holding Bai Shuang's photo,

634
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,530
what does that mean?

635
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,730
He must have done something

636
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,340
that hurt Bai Shuang.

637
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,090
So, I suspect

638
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,090
that my dad abandoned his first love, Bai Shuang,

639
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,210
and married my mom

640
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,410
solely because my grandpa is a leader.

641
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,540
I guess my dad doesn't even love my mom.

642
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,470
God works in mysterious ways.

643
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,890
Then, your dad is Linghu Chong.

644
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,690
No, he is Chen Shimei!

645
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,930
Has Luo Zheng been bullying you lately?

646
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,210
Why would he bully me?

647
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,570
I heard from Wei Xue

648
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,340
that Luo Zheng always bullies Yuan Shanqing.

649
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,890
If he were in our class,

650
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,020
I'd teach him a lesson sooner or later.

651
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,380
If he really bullies you,

652
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,890
come upstairs to find me. You hear me?

653
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,010
I don't need you to.

654
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,180
I'll help you.

655
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,900
I support you in helping Yuan Shanqing.

656
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,810
She's pitiful enough.

657
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,690
How could he push her to the edge?

658
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,790
What does it have to do with you two?

659
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,130
No need for you two to stick out.

660
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,250
If you have time for this,

661
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,490
how about focusing on studying?

662
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,130
What are you trying to show off?

663
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:16,700

Your English has improved.

676

Hello, everyone. Sit down.

Today,

was elected as the Study Monitor.

Next,

For the position of Sports Monitor,

701
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,710
I recommend Luo Zheng.

702
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:21,410
Luo Zheng?

703
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:22,650
Why him?

704
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,810
Luo Zheng's sports performance

705
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,340
has always been excellent.

706
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,890

Our class leaders' election

710
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,370
doesn't necessarily have to be

711
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,170
based on academic performance.

712
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,250
Different class leaders

713
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,850
will serve different roles.

714
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,340

716
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,530
is elected as Sports Monitor,

00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,330

718
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,250
he can lead

What are you three doing?

747
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:23,890
Let's run.

748
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,530
Coming. Coming.

749
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,310
[Zhu Chao, Xu Wenwu, Cheng Miaomiao]

750
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,310
[Class Monitor]

751
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,460
Miaomiao.

752
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,070
Don't...

753
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,450
Let me explain, okay?

754
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:36,770
Miaomiao!

755
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,540
Why aren't you even attending PE class anymore?

756
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,620
I don't even want to go to school anymore.

757
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,100
Miaomiao, let me explain.

758
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,380
Forget it.

759
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,790
It's all in the past.

760
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,080
The past is like a vanishing mist.

761
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,450
It's not that I didn't choose you...

762
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,300
Well, even if I had chosen you,

763
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,180
you'd only have two votes.

764
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,060
It's still useless.

765
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,540
Even so, you shouldn't have voted for Zhu Chao either.

766
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,610
I didn't vote for Zhu Chao.

767
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,740
I voted for Xu Wenwu.

768
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,130
Miaomiao, it's okay.

769
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,180
We don't need to be the Class Monitor.

770
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,090
Big deal.

771
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,120
Don't be upset.

772
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,680
I'm upset now,

773
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,620
not because I wasn't elected as the Class Monitor,

774
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,480
but because... I can't figure out

775
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,840
why even Xu Wenwu got higher votes than me.

776
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,050
His study is not that much better than mine.

777
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,060
Has he ever done anything

778
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,510
for this class?

779
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,830
Has he ever placed in any sports meets?

780
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,480
Have we not placed either?

781
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,370
In the tug-of-war last semester,

782
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,330
didn't I play

783
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,450
a decisive role?

784
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,490
Without my strategy,

785
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,530
could our class have won?

786
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,660
Our class relies on me for many things!

787
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,620
Which one relies on you?

788
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,610
There are too many. I...

789
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,620
I don't even want to list them all.

790
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,530
Let's not talk about the past.

791
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,140
Let's talk about the new student, Qiang Xiaowa.

792
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,330
Which of them

793
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,210
has genuinely wanted to help him?

794
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,170
Wasn't it I

795
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,210
who took on this important task?

796
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,820
Aren't you helping him

797
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,500
just because you wanted to become the Class Monitor?

798
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,220
Wrong! I'm just grateful

799
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,060
and can't tolerate seeing our new classmate

800
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,740
being bullied!

801
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,970
I'm kind!

802
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,410
Is Zhu Chao as kind as I am?

803
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:03,330
Is Xu Wenwu as kind as I am?

804
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,290
-No.
-Absolutely not.

805
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,550
No, neither of them is.

806
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,430
You'd better stop talking.

807
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,010
The most despicable one is you.

808
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,780
You changed your sides at the last minute.

809
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,290
You said she was a traitor before;

810
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,410
what does that make you now?

811
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,650
Shut up.

812
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,420
Miaomiao,

813
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:17,610
I absolutely support you

814
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,050
in my heart.

815
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:19,820
But look,

816
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,570
just the two of us supporting you

817
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,140
isn't enough, right?

818
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,650
Don't be angry, okay?

819
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,290
Okay?

820
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,650
Qiang Xiaowa!

821
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,450
Didn't you promise to vote for me?

822
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,690
Why didn't you do it?

823
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,140
I didn't promise.

824
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,310
You didn't say no either, did you?

825
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,880
Not refusing is the same as agreeing.

826
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,150
How do I usually treat you?

827
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,630
How have I helped you?

828
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,420
You can't confuse friends and foes!

829
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,340
Right, ever since you came,

830
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,000
we've always been good to you.

831
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,130
This behavior is really not right of you.

832
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,010
You're right.

833
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,510
Then why did she have only one vote?

834
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,220
Are you trying to sow discord between us?

835
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,130
Fine if you didn't vote for her!

836
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:54,970
I don't care!

837
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,780
Qiang Xiaowa!

838
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,540
What's wrong with you?

839
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,430
Why haven't you worn your school uniform today?

840
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,410
Director Xiao has already told you.

841
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,740
You should put on your uniform

842
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,330
and get your hair cut as soon as possible.

843
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,060
What does it have to do with you?

844
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,550
I'm the Class Monitor now.

845
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,170
So what if you're the Class Monitor?

846
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,940
I have the responsibility of leading the whole class.

847
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,710
You...

848
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,820
put on your uniform earlier,

849
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,860
just like everyone else.

850
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,290
Why should I be like you?

851
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,250
I...

852
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,730
You...

853
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,260
I heard that you didn't even attend PE class

854
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,360
and cried in the classroom

855
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,090
because you weren't elected as Class Monitor.

856
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:47,890
I didn't.

857
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,250
Do you know

858
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,100
why only one person in the whole class

859
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,610
voted for you?

860
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,890
What?

861
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,090
It means

862
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,260
that only one person in the whole class

863
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,500
thinks you can be the Class Monitor.

864
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,500
It also means

865
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,630
that you're not suitable for the role.

866
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,090
So what if

867
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,150
you were to become the Class Monitor?

868
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,610
What's so great about it?

869
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,100
Can it give you three heads and six arms?

870
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,780
Or

871
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,130
can it help you graduate directly from high school?

872
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,100
Isn't it just

873
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,980
a nicer title to show off?

874
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,510
Is that what you care about?

875
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:28,730
Of course not.

876
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,470
Don't you love reading martial arts novels?

877
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,580
You know Qiao Feng, right?

878
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,350
Did he ever say

879
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,850
he was the leader of the martial arts world?

880
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,100
No.

881
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:44,810
Did he ever claim

882
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,140
that he was the number one in martial arts?

883
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,450
No.

884
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,970
But he was a great hero,

885
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,230
a true man of honor,

886
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,450
and a good person.

887
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,820
Stop thinking you're talented

888
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,600
just because you're clever in small ways.

889
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,060
And don't always think...

890
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:08,060
-Why are you crying again?
-I’m not.

891
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,690
I just think

892
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:14,389
that Qiao Feng had it so tough.

893
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,850
I just think there are many things

894
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,730
that you can do in your youth.

895
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,050
You should set your sights

896
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,650
on the wider world out there.

897
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,820
Mr. Gao,

898
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,010
have you been to Shanghai?

899
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:38,409
What's it like?

900
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,290
It looks different in everyone's eyes.

901
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,889
Just go and see for yourself.

902
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,929
Cheng Miaomiao,

903
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:48,570
did you help Qiang Xiaowa

904
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,880
just to become the Class Monitor?

905
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,310
Of course not.

906
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,330
All right.

907
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:01,900
Don't cry.

908
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:04,970
I don't care

909
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,530
whether I'm the Class Monitor or not.

910
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,740
But I still want to

911
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,630
continue to help Qiang Xiaowa.

912
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,650
You two... need to help me with this.

913
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,300
Why?

914
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,580
Just tell me whether you'll help me or not.

915
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:19,410
I will.

916
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,180
I will.

917
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,130
Mr. Gao is good.

918
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,700
What did he say to her?

919
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,900
Why did she suddenly let it go?

920
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,490
Well,

921
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,260
what does this have to do

922
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,790
with helping Qiang Xiaowa?

923
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,530
She said she'd help, so let her.

924
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,530
She's hurt right now,

925
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,660
so go along with her.

926
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,970
It's just that it's difficult to help Qiang Xiaowa.

927
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,900
He's just a prickly troublemaker.

928
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,130
A "prickly" troublemaker?

929
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,810
I'll have him get a haircut first.

930
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,410
Prickly troublemaker, huh?

931
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,950
Tell me if you have any difficulties.

932
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,940
I don't have any.

933
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,330
I know we have some grudges,

934
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,710
no, misunderstandings.

935
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,100
But they're all in the past.

936
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:09,610
Right?

937
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,780
You left your hometown to come here.

938
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,090
My home is right here.

939
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,970
Yes, you live here.

940
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:16,170
But don't you have to cross the bridge to get here?

941
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,810
Since you're here, you're a guest.

942
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,290
And since Cheng Miaomiao considers you a friend,

943
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,370
I will too.

944
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:21,340
From now on,

945
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,780
if you need anything, just let me know.

946
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,380
At the whole No. 2 High School...

947
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,810
No, at the entire Linqi Base,

948
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,070
my words carry weight.

949
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,390
Didn't you say

950
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:30,420
that none of the families on your side are doing well?

951
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,060
I didn't mean that.

952
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,140
I mean,

953
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,090
I know an uncle

954
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:37,020
who is really good at cutting hair,

955
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,630
and he does it for free.

956
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,660
See? I told you. I should be the one to do it.

957
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,660
I could move him through emotions and reason with him logically.

958
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,700
At least I could make some progress.

959
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,160
It's better than sending that big fool over.

960
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,580
He came to him and said that his family was poor. That's it.

961
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,820
We've messed up again.

962
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,750
You really can't blame me for this.

963
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,490
I went

964
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,530
with the genuine intention of helping him,

965
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,530
but he's just too sensitive

966
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,780
and thought I was insulting his family.

967
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,490
I didn't mean it that way at all.

968
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:01,930
Don't you know

969
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,260
what kind of person I am?

970
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,090
Let's not talk about our class;

971
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,570
let's talk about the entire grade.

972
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,190
Who hasn't eaten the snacks I bought?

973
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,620
Who hasn't drunk the beverages I bought?

974
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,970
Whose birthday have I not given a gift to?

975
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,490
But on my birthday, who gave me a gift?

976
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,830
Have I ever looked down on anyone?

977
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,560
How can you look down on anyone?

978
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,850
You sound like you're doing charity

979
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:17,890
by playing with them.

980
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:18,730
Your family

981
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:19,810
earns a lot

982
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,330
because your mom runs a restaurant.

983
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,290
What does that have to do with you?

984
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:22,970
When have I or Hu ever

985
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,300
missed giving you a gift on your birthday?

986
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,560
The transformers, game cartridges

987
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,410
my brother bought,

988
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,450
and even his belt—

989
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,650
I gave them all to you.

990
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,020
Vivian Chow, Charlie Yeung,

991
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,810
Faye Wong, A-Mei,

992
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,680
Sammi Cheng, and Gigi Leung—

993
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,810
which album by them have I not bought for you?

994
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,580
9.8 yuan per album, all official versions.

995
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,660
Over the years, my monthly allowance

996
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,730
went from five yuan to twenty,

997
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,610
and every penny you spent chasing your celebrity crushes

998
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,130
came from my pocket.

999
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,920
Yes. Yes.

1000
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,210
That's why,

1001
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,580
apart from my mom and grandma,

1002
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,170
you two are the closest people to me in the whole world.

1003
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:58,140
That's why the three of us are an inseparable trio.

1004
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:58,820
If anything happens

1005
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,090
to you in the future...

1006
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,290
No, no matter what happens to you,

1007
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,820
I'll be the first to step up.

1008
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:07,170
Then go help Qiang Xiaowa until the end.

1009
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,160
I just don't get along with him.

1010
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,090
We'd better stay away from each other.

1011
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,730
I can't let Mr. Gao think

1012
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,050
that my words don't count

1013
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:15,780
just because I didn't

1014
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,970
become the Class Monitor.

1015
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,650
I have to prove to him

1016
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,480
that I didn't do this

1017
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,130
to become the Class Monitor.

1018
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,540
Do you know Qiao Feng?

1019
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,140
He was always generous to everyone.

1020
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,470
That's a hero's spirit.

1021
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,300
Wait,

1022
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,840
what does this have to do with Qiao Feng?

1023
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,930
You wouldn't understand, even if I explained.

1024
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,770
But even if Qiao Feng were here,

1025
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:34,940
it wouldn't help.

1026
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:37,290
Qiang Xiaowa is just so stubborn.

1027
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:40,410
We're just trying to be friends with him, right?

1028
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,100
There's no bad blood.

1029
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,550
It's not like we have a crush on him

1030
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,290
or want to date him to be his girlfriend,

1031
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,820
so why does he act like that?

1032
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,620
Exactly. He's so full of himself.

1033
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,740
We're all just trying to be nice...

1034
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,910
but he acts like someone has a crush on him.

1035
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,070
If he keeps this up,

1036
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,330
I bet Fang will return him

1037
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,610
to his old school sooner or later.

1038
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,900
Miaomiao, don't blame yourself for that.

1039
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,340
Why should I?

1040
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,440
It's not like it's my fault if he gets returned.

1041
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,690
Yaya, follow me later.

1042
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:18,010
I'll teach you the essentials of being a referee.

1043
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,010
-Okay.
-Pengfei.

1044
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,600
Come on.

1045
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,760
-Come on!
-Daiyu.

1046
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,650
Chen!

1047
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:25,980
Okay, thank you, Daiyu.

1048
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,340
Mom,

1049
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,410
can I have a bottle of this,

1050
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,180
please?

1051
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,220
These are for adults.

1052
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,500
They have artificial coloring.

1053
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,340
I've never heard that artificial coloring

1054
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,020
is only harmful to kids.

1055
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:36,810
You drink this.

1056
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:37,980
Put that back.

1057
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,010
I'm too old

1058
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,360
to still drink this.

1059
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,680
What's Cheng Yaya doing over there?

1060
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,140
Your dad's explaining referee stuff to him.

1061
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,290
Why didn't he explain it to me?

1062
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,900
I want to be a referee too.

1063
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,790
Do you think you'd understand?

1064
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,520
Li Si is here.

1065
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,570
Auntie.

1066
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,060
Where are your parents?

1067
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,050
My mom... My mom's at the restaurant.

1068
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:56,890
My dad...

1069
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,400
Isn't he over there?

1070
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,200
Do you want it?

1071
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:00,810
Good.

1072
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,200
We should organize more of these events.

1073
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,370
Your staff hospital

1074
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,570
really excels in this kind of activity.

1075
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,120
Yes.

1076
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,630
Your frontline

1077
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,210
mainly has too many tasks, right?

1078
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,340
The work is intense,

1079
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,290
and time is always tight.

1080
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,130
It's not easy for you

1081
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,330
to organize an event.

1082
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,480
The frontline work is tough.

1083
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,250
Look at the weather.

1084
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,220
And we're already wearing long sleeves in the mountains.

1085
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,570
It’s cold in the middle of the night, freezing.

1086
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,540
Really? You have to take care of yourself.

1087
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,180
Dr. Cheng,

1088
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:25,570
we'll start

1089
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,340
in ten minutes.

1090
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,180
Okay. Okay.

1091
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,050
It's... It's about to start.

1092
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:29,890
There's still time.

1093
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,350
Why don't you warm up a bit?

1094
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,490
I don't know how.

1095
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,110
Fine, fine.

1096
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,180
Pick up the thumbtack there, or it could hurt your feet.

1097
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,710
Where is there a thumbtack?

1098
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,220
Nice!

1099
00:40:59,130 --> 00:40:59,810
Let me.

1100
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,180
Catch it. Catch it.

1101
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,800
[Red Team 6]

1102
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,800
[Blue Team 9]

1103
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,300
Nice play!

1104
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:11,530
Nice play!

1105
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,250
Good!

1106
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:27,580
Catch it!

1107
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,470
Nice shot!

1108
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:43,930
Over there.

1109
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:45,900
Miaomiao.

1110
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,230
Something has happened to Hu Qiumin.

1111
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,870
Let's go.

1112
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:51,960
Nice!

1113
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,650
Li Si, Hu Qiumin, and I

1114
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,100
first met

1115
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,490
when we were three years old.

1116
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,260
Hu always says

1117
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:29,930
we've been together even earlier,

1118
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:30,930
since we were two.

1119
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,030
The elderly say

1120
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,390
that kids can't form memories before the age of three.

1121
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:34,760
So,

1122
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,010
from age three onward, our memories,

1123
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:38,530
apart from family, are of each other.

1124
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,010
All the little things,

1125
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:41,290
and running all over the place.

1126
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:42,490
We've fought,

1127
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,130
argued,

1128
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:45,620
and threatened to end our friendship countless times.

1129
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,100
But none of us ever really left the others.

1130
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,780
Once, our Chinese teacher

1131
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,010
assigned us to write a composition about friendship.

1132
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:52,800
I wrote,

1133
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,180
"steaming hot."

1134
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:55,500
The teacher said

1135
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,850
that's how you describe food,

1136
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:58,180
like a bowl of hot rice.

1137
00:42:58,570 --> 00:42:59,330
Yeah.

1138
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,970
Our friendship is like rice,

1139
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,180
steaming hot.
