[Summer 1987]

4
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,320
Your son was born in the Year of the Snake?

5
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,320
He was born in the Year of the Dragon.

6
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,389
In 1954.

7
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,910
I was born in 1954.

8
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,570
He was born in 1976.

9
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,280
He's four years older than your daughter.

10
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,720
I was born in the Year of the Dog.

11
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,630
You're four years older than me as well.

12
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,310
I know.

13
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,310
Auntie Man told me

14
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,310
you'll get promoted soon?

15
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,090
Yes.

16
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,800
I'm going to work on the sea next month.

17
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,500
Your presence at home in a year

18
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,760
can be counted on the fingers of one hand.

19
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,829
What we do

20
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,829
is surely not as easy as you guys working in the labor union.

21
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,890
But we're better than

22
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,190
ordinary workers.

23
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,350
Basically in a month,

24
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,910
we work on the sea

25
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,940
for 20 days

26
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,590
and take ten days off.

27
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,990
What matters is the great benefits.

28
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,070
What about your child

29
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,050
while you're out working for 20 days?

30
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,110
Yeah, that's a problem.

31
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,810
So...

32
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,430
Why...

33
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,510
Why did you get divorced?

34
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,630
We didn't get along.

35
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,140
What about you?

36
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,310
The same as you.

37
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,120
We didn't get along.

38
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,310
I think you are nice.

39
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,990
You're, too.

40
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,430
Explain it to me.

41
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,030
What did your mom mean?

42
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,150
How many times have I explained it to you?

43
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,750
My mom didn't mean that.

44
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,190
She's kind yet sharp-tongued.

45
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,070
Forget it. Forget it.

46
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,990
No!

47
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,750
You think killing someone with a sharp tongue

48
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,870
will not be seen as murder?

49
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,630
I'm your wife,

50
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,380
part of the Yang family.

51
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,870
Why can't she treat me as part of the Yang family?

52
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,750
Everyone treats you as part of the Yang family!

53
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,630
How can a family

54
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,820
have two household registration booklets?

55
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,310
We don't have time to get it done!

56
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,750
We'll find time!

57
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,710
If I don't mention it,

58
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,510
you'll never have time!

59
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,909
Can you stop making trouble for me?

60
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,630
I beg you!

61
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,070
No, I can't!

62
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,060
Explain it to me!

63
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,030
Explain what?

64
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,470
What's there to explain?

65
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,750
Explain why we have two household registration booklets!

66
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,430
What do you mean two?

67
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,510
We've had two household registration booklets since the very beginning!

00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,590
In your mom's heart...

69
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,790
We're one.

00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,990
You have me.

71
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,909
You still don't admit it!

72
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,750
How can I admit it?

73
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,750
Admit what?

74
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,710
What were you doing earlier?

75
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,110
Can you stop making trouble for me?

Min.

80
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,190
I bought you a dress.

81
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,790
Look how beautiful the color is.

82
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,550
A little girl like you will look pretty in it.

83
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,110
Come on.

84
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,610
Try it on and let me see.

85
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,510
I don't wear dresses.

86
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,350
I'm not a little girl.

87
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,510
I'm 17, Mom.

88
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,910
So what?

89
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,950
Even if you are 70,

90
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,310
you're a woman as well.

91
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,700
Who says a woman must wear a dress?

92
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,760
I won't wear it.

93
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,980
That's weird.

94
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,990
When you were little,

95
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,840
you liked wearing dresses.

96
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,909
Why have you changed

I want to have my hair cut.

100

Have it cut short just like you do.

101
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,670
Nonsense!

102
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,070
Why should a girl have her hair cut short?

103
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,790
Why not?

104
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,300
Your hair is so short.

105
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,430

you're quite willful.

Can't you bring honor to me?

112

Don't let them laugh at us.

113
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,510
Do they laugh at us

114
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,590
because I don't wear dresses

115
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,540
and I want to have my hair cut short?

Close the door for me.

Shouldn't you

120
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,060
come back yesterday?

121
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,110
Why didn't you come back?

122
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,730
New equipment came.

123
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,220
I couldn't walk away.

124
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,740
Then why didn't you tell me?

125
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,790
I paged you,

126
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,010
but you didn't reply.

127
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,700
My pager is out of power.

128
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,430
Did you drink?

129
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,820
Yes, a little.

130
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,460
Did you get new equipment

131
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,909
or go for a drink?

132
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,190
Who did you drink with?

133
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,270
What's her name?

134
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,470
Do I need to report my work to you?

135
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,400
You won't tell me, right?

136
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,870
Fine, I'll go ask them one by one.

137
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,390
I don't believe I can't get what I want.

138
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,650
What do you mean by asking them one by one?

139
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,790
Listen.

140
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,680
Hu Yue, don't make trouble for me.

141
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,720
I will make trouble for you.

00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,900
What have I done?

145
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,910
You know it clearly.

146
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,830
I don't.

Who is Ge Juan?

148
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,670
Did you go out

149
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,470
with Ge Juan for a drink?

150
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,040
Why are you mentioning Ge Juan?

151
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,820
We worked together more than ten years ago.

152
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,700
So what?

153
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,280
You won't admit it, right?

154
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,400
-Fine. -Admit what?

155
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,909
I'll go to Ge Juan tomorrow.

156
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:33,590
I'll ask her.

157
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,720
Why will you ask her?

158
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,980
Listen, Hu Yue.

159
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,670
Don't you feel ashamed?

160
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,690
But I do.

161
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,150
In fact, I don't.

162
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,250
But if you want to protect her,

163
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,270
I'll give my consent.

164
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,530
I'll go to your leader.

165
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,510
I'll ask your leader to help settle the argument.

166
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,370
Why will you...

167
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,360
Hu Yue!

168
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,170
Are you out of your mind?

169
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,300
I am!

170
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,470
Are you? We can go crazy together.

171
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,430
Are you going to piss me off too?

172
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,080

00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,580
don't take it too hard!

174
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,940
Yeah, you're still young!

175
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,670
It'll be too late when you regret doing it!

176

Whose kid is this?

No, she's not.

179
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,510
She's not a biological one.

180
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,370
She's not a biological one.

00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,490
Come down, girl. Come down!

182
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,920
Come down! Come down!

183
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,630

Hu Qiumin, what are you doing?

187
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,159
Don't come over!

188

Hu, what are you doing?

189
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,480
Can you swim?

Oh no. I didn't mean

195
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,350
to be sworn siblings

196
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,470

People get drowned in the river every year!

206

You have a warm family atmosphere.

215

Mine is different from yours.

00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,910
my parents finally got divorced.

232
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,350
I thought

233
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,400

However,

235

my mom got married again.

236
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,500
She fights and argues every day

He didn't come back home once in a month.

240
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,180
He acted like a leader when he got back,

241
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,190
shouting at us.

242
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,280
My mom asked me

I'm not his biological daughter!

246

Why would two people who don't love each other

249
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,170
Why would they build a family together?

Why was I born

00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,450
I would have been a swimmer.

380
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,750
I know how to swim.

381
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,960
Your clothes are ruined.

382
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,590
I should at least give you a silk banner to thank you for what you did.

383
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,100
I'll buy you some clothes later.

384
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,550
No need.

385
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,870
If it weren't for you,

386
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,490
something bad would have happened.

387
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,350
I'm not the only one

388
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,190
who saved them.

389
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,490
A student in my class also helped them.

390
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,300
Right, the student.

391
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,510
Seems that he sent them here

392
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,500
and left within seconds.

393
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,700
I haven't had an opportunity to thank him.

394
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,900
It's okay. It's okay.

395
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,600
Mr. Gao, do you have a girlfriend?

396
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,420
Do you have a girlfriend?

397
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,140
Not yet.

398
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,600
That's great.

399
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,630
Well...

400
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,640
My cousin is 23 years old.

401
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,130
She's my third aunt's daughter.

402
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,250
She's also single.

403
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,550
My third aunt called me

404
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,030
two days ago,

405
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,180
asking me to arrange this for her.

406
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,440
Yan graduated from a nursing school.

407
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,240
She's working in the county hospital now.

408
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,080
You two.

409
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:38,970
One is a teacher,

410
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:39,990
and the other is a nurse.

411
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,530
You two would be a perfect match.

412
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,480
Thank you, Madam.

413
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,330
There... There's no rush.

414
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,390
I... I'm leaving.

415
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:45,860
No. No.

416
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,320
It's not about the rush!

417
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,470
-I have no intention of that. -Gao.

418
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,550
Which year were you born in?

419
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,260
I was born in 1970.

420
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,660
I'm going to find Yang Songbai.

421
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,100
Sister.

422
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,770
It has nothing to do with Yang.

423
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,000
Why will you go to him?

424
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,860
Min is childish and easily loses her temper.

425
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,710
I get it.

426
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,830
But I wonder why you did such a thing.

427
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,660
If you are not wronged,

428
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,390
how could you

429
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,660
jump off the bridge without hesitation?

430
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,480
We understand you wanted to scare Min

431
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,620
and prevent her from jumping off the bridge.

432
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,620
But why did you

433
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,770
jump off the bridge?

434
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,100
I was pissed off by Min.

435
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,120
I acted on impulse

436
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,990
without thinking twice.

437
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,340
It really has nothing to do with Yang.

438
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,330
Really.

439
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,020
Don't go to him.

440
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,150
Isn't that embarrassing enough?

441
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,600
You're such a loser.

442
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,040
All right, I'm fine.

443
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,120
You should go home.

444
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,960
Go home.

445
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,750
Fine. We're leaving.

446
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:09,670
Let's go.

447
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,290
Call us if anything happens.

448
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,750
No matter how late it is.

449
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,390
Fine. We're leaving.

450
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,140
-Have a good rest. -Go home.

451
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,470
I'm fine.

452
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,329
Go in and be with your mom.

453
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,950
You're leaving?

454
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:27,700
Forget it.

455
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,910
Just wait and see!

456
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,960
Why are you crying?

457
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,430
I think I should be the one crying.

458
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,870
Enough. Enough. Stop crying.

459
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,450
Or you'll be laughed at by others.

460
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,480
All right, stop crying, okay?

461
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,310
Look at you.

462
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,390
Min was messing around.

463
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,230
But why did you follow suit?

464
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,530
Min is immature.

465
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,920
You're an adult.

466
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,740
But you behaved impulsively

467
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,010
and irrationally.

468
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,310
Yang Songbai!

469
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,780
Why do you say my mom behaved

470
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,230
impulsively and irrationally?

471
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,840
I... I...

472
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,990
In your eyes,

473
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,150
dignity is more important

474
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,430
than my mom's life, right?

475
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,270
No.

476
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,030
Why don't you think about

477
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,210
why she didn't hesitate

478
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,360
to jump off the bridge just now?

479
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,310
How can you say that now given what happened?

480
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,920
Are you still a man?

481
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,020
Min.

482
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,180
It's true!

483
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,190
He and his family

484
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,570
look down on us!

485
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,510
It's fine that you look down on me.

486
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,120
I'm not your biological daughter anyway,

487
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,720
right?

488
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,330
But why do you look down on my mom?

489
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,430
My mom serves you every day,

490
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,090
as if she serves an elder man!

491
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,280
How could you

492
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,380
shout at her for so many years?

493
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,360
You treat her like she's your subordinate!

494
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,370
Is my mom your wife

495
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,430
or your maid?

496
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,260
Min.

497
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,110
How could you

498
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,090
talk to me like this?

499
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,160
Why couldn't I?

500
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,350
Let me tell you.

501
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,230
I've had enough of you

502
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:24,870
being so overbearing at home

503
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,240
all these years!

504
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,710
You're not that capable.

505
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,370
But when you get home,

506
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,850
all you do is pick holes!

507
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,670
Since you are so capable,

508
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,750
go out and order others around.

509
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,880
You're not a man if you can only be unreasonable at home!

510
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,280
Min, stop it!

511
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,060
Mom!

512
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,590
You've been tolerant of him for so many years.

513
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,870
It's enough!

514
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,930
You're still afraid of me confronting him.

515
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,960
I am confronting him today!

516
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,540
What can he do?

517
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,530
Hu Qiumin!

518
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,980
I've raised you for so many years.

519
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,260
I'm one of your elders,

520
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,100
right?

521
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,510
You're disqualified from making comments

522
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,090
on what's going on between adults!

523
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,120
I'm making comments on you!

524
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,530
Listen!

525
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,030
This is my mom!

526
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,670
If my mom is wronged,

527
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,130
I will show no politeness no matter who it is!

528
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,780
Do you hear me?

529
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,000
Okay.

530
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,260
Mom.

531
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,420
Do you think

532
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,640
there's a family where there are no fights

533
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,870
in this world?

534
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,840
No.

535
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,270
Only strangers

536
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,240
won't quarrel.

537
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,310
Then, in your view,

538
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,590
is divorce a bad thing or a good thing?

539
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,430
Is it something you should think about?

540
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,450
Why, Dad?

541
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,970
Why can't I think about it?

542
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,850
Divorce

543
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,840
is not a good thing,

544
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,090
but it's not a bad thing as well.

545
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,150
It's just a choice made in one's life.

546
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,570
Will you two get divorced?

547
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,370
You still expect me to get divorced?

548
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,390
-Look at her! -Well.

549
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,190
She's discussing it

550
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,470
with us,

551
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,030
right?

552
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,340
Don't get so emotional.

553
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,790
Let's have a discussion. Come on.

554
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,190
What's there to discuss?

555
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,150
These kids

556
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:29,750
are too young

557
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,230
to discuss the matter of divorce.

558
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:31,450
No. No.

559
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,570
Isn't it too early?

560
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,630
-Step aside. -Look. Look.

561
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,430
Divorce

562
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,710
is a matter of a family.

563
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,350
They

564
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,850
are part of our family.

565
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,380
So they also have the right

566
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,750
to say something, right?

567
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,670
And I think

568
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,910
they now

569
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,050
want to

570
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,600
seriously discuss this matter.

571
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,230
It means they're experiencing personal growth.

572
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,230
They've grown up.

573
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:47,950
Yes.

574
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,520
I think,

575
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,910
if getting a divorce

576
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,880
had been a matter

577
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,550
between parents,

578
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,830
Hu Qiumin

579
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,270
wouldn't have wanted to jump into the river today.

580
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,430
She lives in a blended family.

581
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,890
That's different.

582
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,480
Yang Songbai

583
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,520
is not a good man.

584
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,910
Hu Yue has a child.

585
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,250
He also has a child.

586
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,250
It's even hard for people

587
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,420
to treat their biological kids fairly.

588
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,770
It'll get worse if they deal with non-biological kids.

589
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,500
Well, look.

590
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,670
This is exactly why such a problem would occur,

591
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,200
given your way of thinking.

592
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,820
Right?

593
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,930
Well, a married couple

594
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,430
doesn't share the same blood.

595
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,840
Objectively speaking,

596
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,600
they

597
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,670
are totally strangers,

598
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,340
right?

599
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,630
But how can they

600
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,680
build a family together?

601
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,600
How can they love each other?

602
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,180
It depends on how you treat each other.

603
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,360
Yes.

604
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,070
Dad, I think

605
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,880
you have a philosophical perspective.

606
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,160
Philosophical?

607
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,390
Philosophers

608
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,670
only know about theories.

609
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,550
They're good at lying.

610
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,950
They're equal to liars.

611
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,970
Dad, Mom.

612
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,040
If you two plan to get divorced,

613
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,370
I just have one request.

614
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,950
What is it?

615
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,910
We'll stay together.

616
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,120
See?

617
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,880
It's the magic of sharing the same blood.

618
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,990
Because I'm afraid

619
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,830
Cheng Miaomiao

620
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,010
will be beaten up no matter where she stays.

621
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,130
Get out of my face.

622
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,010
Here, have some water.

623
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,590
People

624
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,430
have to make so many choices

625
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,550
in their lives.

626
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,730
Look, your mom and I

627
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,770
have chosen each other.

628
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,590
In the future,

629
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,480
you'll also have the right

630
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,860
to choose your own life.

631
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,190
But the most important thing

632
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,320
is to be responsible for your own life.

633
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,400
Only by doing so

634
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,760
can you be responsible

635
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,350
for your future partner.

636
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,130
Understand?

637
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,660
Life. Life.

638
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,080
Living your life earnestly

639
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,680
is the most important thing.

640
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,070
Your mom is a woman of great wisdom and knowledge.

641
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,760
Seriously.

642
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,670
Well said. She's totally right.

643
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,900
Your dad and I

644
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,880
will never get divorced

645
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,810
in this life.

646
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,080
You two

647
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,790
don't ever think about leaving each other in your lives.

648
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,780
Our family structure

649
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,250
is like the back mountain

650
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,510
which still stands even after 100 years.

651
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,170
Mom,

652
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,990
I heard that the back mountain will be blown up.

653
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:01,830
Cheng Yaya!

654
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,250
How could he say that?

655
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,720
Hit him! Now! Go!

656
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,620
I'll spank you.

657
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,330
Hit him, Dad! You go too!

658
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,680
Shouldn't you stop me?

659
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,330
Mom.

660
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,750
I'll have some more sleep.

661
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,670
Don't forget

662
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,580
to ask for leave from school for me.

663
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,110
By the way,

664
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,680
especially don't forget

665
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,760
to tell the school leaders

666
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,160
about me being brave.

667
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,640
Mom, you should have some sleep too.

668
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,770
You didn't sleep well in the hospital.

669
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
I can't sleep.

670
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,040
Don't worry about me.

671
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,840
I'm fine.

672
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,520
I'm not worried about you.

673
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,050
I'm worried about your dad.

674
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,910
By the way,

675
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,460
where is my dad?

676
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,270
Didn't you tell him

677
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,660
something bad happened to me yesterday?

678
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,630
He didn't come back

679
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,400
even though something terrible happened to me.

680
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,030
Am I not

681
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,160
his biological son?

682
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,160
Something happened on the front line.

683
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,160
Your dad went there last afternoon.

684
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,800
What happened?

685
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,510
Some thieves stole oil.

686
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,780
It has attracted great attention.

687
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,910
Your dad has gone to catch the thieves.

688
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,920
How dangerous it is!

689
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,500
Of course!

690
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,670
Those thieves

691
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,200
are equipped with weapons.

692
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,950
I'm so worried.

693
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,580
He hasn't even called me yet.

694
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,350
When your dad worked on the front line before,

695
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,870
I was always worried.

696
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,390
He's a leader now,

697
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,390
and he can work in his office.

698
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,150
I didn't expect

699
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,920
he would always go to the front line.

700
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,110
You two

701
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,330
just won't stop making me worried.

702
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,750
I'll go and burn incense

703
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,430
to pray for your father's safety.

704
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,090
Should I burn incense for him?

705
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:10,960
Are you your father's son?

706
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,640
Yes.

707
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,410
Let's go.

708
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,390
Get some water?

709
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,890
Min.

710
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,030
Find time

711
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,070
to go to Uncle Jun's place

712
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,430
to trim your hair.

713
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,370
It's a mess.

714
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:30,990
Here, Mom.

715
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,340
Eat it while it's hot.

716
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,480
I've asked for leave from school.

717
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,410
So I can take care of you these days.

718
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,120
Here.

719
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,400
Have you had your meal?

720
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:42,950
Yes.

721
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:43,460
Really?

722
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,090
Really.

723
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,240
Eat it.

724
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,640
Is it good?

725
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,720
I cooked it.

726
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,200
Delicious.

727
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,510
[Xiaoshudu Restaurant]

728
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,830
Yan

729
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,110
has always been shy since she was little.

730
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,370
She doesn't talk much.

731
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,620
Girls should be gentle.

732
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,090
Am I right, Mr. Gao?

733
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:27,930
Yes. Yes.

734
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:29,720
Yan.

735
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:30,870
Mr. Gao

736
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,530
is not an ordinary teacher.

737
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,780
He's from Beijing.

738
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,690
Shanghai.

739
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,880
Shanghai.

740
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,230
Shang...

741
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,880
Shanghai. Shanghai.

742
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,970
Why do I always remember you're from Beijing?

743
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:44,950
It's the same. It's the same.

744
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,900
They're both international metropolises.

745
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,530
Those from the cities are all top talents.

746
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,380
Why did you

747
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,710
choose to teach here?

748
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,310
W-We got our house because of the Oilfield.

749

My parents work in the No. 3 factory.

750
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,250
What a good kid.

751
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,480
You're capable now.

752
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,740
And you still remember

753
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,220
to serve the Oilfield.

754
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,290
-It's nothing. -Where can we

755
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,750

Come on. Come on.

757
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,470
Have some. Have some.

758
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:06,990
Thank you.

759
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,270
I can do it myself.

760
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:08,830
I can do it myself.

761
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,750
By the way, to be honest...

762
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,770
Yan was born into a rich family.

763
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,330
My third uncle,

764
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,430
Yan's father,

765
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,830
is a leader

766
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,310
who just retired.

767
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,040
Her family is well-educated.

768
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,430
My third aunt

769
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,110
is a leader of the Oilfield.

770
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,180
They have strict family rules.

771
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,640
Now, many men

772
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,310
are targeting my third uncle.

773
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,310
They all want to climb up the ladder.

774
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,450
In the future,

775
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,000
if you're really with Yan,

776
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,950
the job and the house

777
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,630
won't be any problems, right?

778
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,500
No, I have my own dorm.

779
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,860
I also have a nice job.

780
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,860
You're young with low requirements.

781
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,600
Will you be satisfied with low requirements in the future?

782
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,560
Teachers like you

783
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,900
will have professional title evaluations, right?

784
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,710
Can you make it

785
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,680
if you don't have some personal resources?

786
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,830
Actually, I can.

787
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,490
You're still young.

788
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,520
Then, you'll have to

789
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,730
pursue an official career, right?

790
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:06,520
Perhaps,

791
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,670
you and Yan

792
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,350
will build a family together.

793
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:09,880
Ling,

794
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,980
your family called.

795
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,510
They want you to go back now.

796
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,750
Okay, got it.

797
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,520
Leave us.

798
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,170
Okay.

799
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,760
I've got so many family affairs to deal with. Well...

800
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,160
Mr. Gao, I'm sorry.

801
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,600
I can't stay with you two.

802
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,240
Both of you are young people.

803
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,210
You should

804
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,880
talk more and get to know each other, okay?

805
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,980
I'll get going then.

806
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,930
There's good wine in the cabinet.

807
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,000
Pour whatever you want.

808
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,660
I won't drink.

809
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,640
I'll have to prepare lessons tonight.

810
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,400
No worries.

811
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,170
Tell Zhao whatever you want to eat,

812
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:36,760
okay?

813
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,340
Do you hear me?

814
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,350
Don't be so reserved.

815
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,250
Don't worry, Cousin.

816
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,240
Okay, okay, you two go on.

817
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,910
Help yourselves.

818
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:42,680
Help yourselves.

819
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,070
Make yourselves at home.

820
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,390
Okay, bye.

821
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,730
Okay, enjoy your meal.

822
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,670
D-Do you like spicy food?

823
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,350
Diced Chicken with Spicy Chilli?

824
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,410
I don't eat spicy food.

825
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,770
It's all right.

826
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,480
I like spicy food.

827
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,210
It is spicy.

828
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,070
What do you mean?

829
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,790
You mean you can't solve it,

830
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,470
right?

831
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,150
Lijuan, can you let me go?

832
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,510
Today... Today, kill or be killed!

833
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,640
Are you trying to force my whole family...

834
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,030
-To die? -Huang Lijuan!

835
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,290
Huang Lijuan, let go!

836
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,170
What are you doing, Huang Lijuan?

837
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:40,930
Calm down!

838
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,030
Don't hit him!

839
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,530
Did you get hurt?

840
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,450
It's not my fault!

841
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,700
Why do you keep pestering me?

842
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,860
Who else can I find?

843
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,470
You fired Liu Gang!

844
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,050
What happened?

845
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,700
His man, Liu Gang,

846
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,850
stole oil in collusion with outsiders.

847
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,070
You saw him stealing oil?

848
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,790
What evidence do you have

849
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,790
to prove Liu Gang stole oil?

850
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,370
Did you see it with your own eyes?

851
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,390
Calm down, Lijuan.

852
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,380
Lijuan, how about this?

853
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,030
Well, let her go.

854
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,550
Let her go.

855
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,420
I don't believe this won't work.

856
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,850
Let's talk calmly.

857
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,240
Can the report from the front line

858
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,370
be seen as evidence?

859
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,190
Liu Gang

860
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,230
didn't do this for the first time, right?

861
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,640
Others stole oil and Liu Gang stood guard,

862
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,240
right?

863
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,700
Liu Gang sold the pipe wrench

864
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,870
to them, right?

865
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,700
How dare you

866
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,250
make a scene here?

867
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,760
You think there's nothing we can do

868
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
if you keep denying it?

869
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,090
Are all leaders stupid?

870
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,980
Sometimes,

871
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,840
it may not

872
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,040
lead to a bad end.

873
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,950
At least he hasn't been sent to the police station,

874
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:31,590
right?

875
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,820
The police haven't filed a case yet.

876
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,670
This is

877
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,290
how the organization

878
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,440
takes care of Liu Gang in his best interest.

879
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,270
Take care of?

880
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,570
All these years,

881
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,910
have you ever taken care of us?

882
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,650
Liu Gang has worked on the front line

883
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,760
for more than ten years!

884
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,270
At this age,

885
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,360
he still works hard on the mountain!

886
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,570
Maybe he hasn't made any contributions,

887
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,440
but he has always played a part in it.

888
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,090
Yes.

889
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,270
Juan, actually...

890
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,400
I talked

891
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,840
to Liu Gang before.

892
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:03,420
I said

893
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,990
he could report to the leaders, right?

894
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,250
To get himself transferred from the front line.

895
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,160
He refused.

896
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,390
That's easy for you to say!

897
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,250
Our whole family

898
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,780
are relying on him to make money to support us!

899
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,210
Calm down, Lijuan.

900
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,740
They'll take care of it.

901
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:18,010
He is the only breadwinner in my family.

902
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,060
As his wife,

903
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,050
I don't have much income.

904
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,470
Why are you sitting on the floor?

905
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,670
There are stools.

906
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,080
Use it as a cushion.

907
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,950
Don't sit on the floor.

908
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:34,830
No.

909
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,710
I just want

910
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,740
him to make more money on the front line.

911
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,900
If you lay him off,

912
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,610
how can we support our lives?

913
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,640
My parents are still sick now.

914
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,980
No one would do such a thing

915
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,300
if they lead a rich life!

916
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,910
Alright, stop crying.

917
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,130
Crying won't solve the problem.

918
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,030
Dahai,

919
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,400
why don't you defer your decision?

920
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,730
Expelling him from the factory is such a big deal.

921
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,790
Why don't you discuss it again?

922
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:13,740
What do you know?

923
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,250
Discuss?

924
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,390
Liu Gang didn't make mistakes

925
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,450
for the first time!

926
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,840
Do you forget what happened last year?

927
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,650
How could you forget

928
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,470
that someone got severely injured and ended up in the hospital?

929
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,970
The factory has made a decision!

930
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,760
It's not my own decision!

931
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:26,800
Zero tolerance for it!

932
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,730
He must be fired!

933
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,240
Then I'll go to the factory manager tomorrow!

934
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,100
I'll let everyone see

935
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,960
how badly we end

936
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,290
because of the factory!

937
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,660
-Lijuan. -Lijuan.

938
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,670
Lijuan, you should keep your temper under control,

939
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,340
all right?

940
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,120
Your bad temper

941
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,510
has something to do with the poor condition of your family!

942
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,530
Stop it.

943
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,740
What should I do?

944
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,970
[Linqi No.2 High School Registration Form for Students Late to School]

945
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:51,820
Ms. Han,

946
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,430
please sign your name here.

947
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,420
Okay, thank you, Ms. Han.

948
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,080
Thank you.

949
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,460
Come with me to the office.

950
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,580
Yuan Shanqing,

951
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,570
you've been constantly late to school

952
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:16,630
so many times

953
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,130
since the school started.

954
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,190
Did anything happen at home?

955
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,560
Or,

956
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:22,469
do you

957
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:24,070
experience any discomfort?

958
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,420
No.

959
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,330
I hope you can tell me directly

960
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,860
if anything happens to you,

961
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,980
so that I can know how to help you.

962
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:35,290
I won't be late again.

963
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,440
I always said

964
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:37,750
I wanted to pay a home visit,

965
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,949
but you didn't agree.

966
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,949
Now you're constantly late, saying nothing happened.

967
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,090
In your student information form,

968
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,469
the information about your parents is empty,

969
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:46,520
and so are your parents' phone numbers.

970
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,440
I know.

971
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:51,370
Your family is experiencing some special circumstances.

972
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:52,790
But I really

973
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,090
want to help you.

974
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,630
Ms. Han,

975
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,180
my family is quite normal.

976
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,850
I promise

977
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,080
I won't be late again.

978
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,320
Did anyone in your class

979
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,730
bully you?

980
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,010
No.

981
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,260
[Wanted Criminal]

982
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,770
Luo Zheng, you've gone too far!

983
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,780
Have I?

984
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,470
You're a class leader.

985
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,630
Given what you've done,

986
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,430
other classmates

987
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,890
will only look down on you.

988
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,810
I can quit being a class leader.

989
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,720
Get ready for the class first.

990
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,550
Where did you have your hair cut?

991
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,670
It looks great.

992
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,730
It's cool this way.

993
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,910
You've gone too far.

994
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,800
You're so mean.

995
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,490
Yeah.

996
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,720
Stop crying.

997
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,840
Stop crying.

998
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,240
You're so mean.

999
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,500
You're so mean.

1000
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,570
Exactly.

1001
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,370
Well, what do you mean?

1002
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,220
As if my whole family

1003
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,320
bullied your family.

1004
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,350
Your dad bullied us!

1005
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,810
Your dad must see himself great!

1006
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,060
He can fire anyone at his will!

1007
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,680
How did my dad bully you?

1008
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,040
He bullied us!

1009
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,230
You, stop shouting.

1010
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,690
And you, don't be like this.

1011
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,930
Well, what he said is ridiculous.

1012
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,230
My dad bullied your family?

1013
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,870
How could your dad get fired if he hadn't made mistakes?

1014
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,310
Don't you know what your dad did?

1015
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,990
Li Si, stop it.

1016
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,180
Under this circumstance,

1017
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,720
what's the point of saying this?

1018
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,780
Sit down. Sit down.

1019
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,230
His father is the only breadwinner in his family.

1020
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,780
How can they carry on with their lives?

1021
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,200
How can he get the chance to go to school?

1022
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,240
That's right.

1023
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,750
Why don't you

1024
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,630
talk to your dad after you're home?

1025
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,580
He's really pitiful.

1026
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,980
His mother has no income.

1027
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,580
Stop looking!

1028
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,180
Go back to your classes!

1029
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,680
Alright. Alright.

1030
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:32,850
Go back to your seats.

1031
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,030
Stop looking. Stop looking.

1032
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:34,920
All right. All right.

1033
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,810
There will be a way out.

1034
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,530
Where do you live?

1035
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,280
North District.

1036
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,350
It's not that far.

1037
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,140
But I often see you late to school.

1038
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:00,750
Is it because...

1039
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,950
I won't be late again.

1040
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,460
There's a sentence

1041
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,430
from a book I read before,

1042
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,340
saying

1043
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,730
a real strong person

1044
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,070
does not care about the dirty tricks...

1045
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,100
-Of rats. -Thank you.

1046
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:17,900
I'm fine.

1047
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,630
I'm sorry.

1048
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,700
[Wanted Criminal]

1049
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,620
Give me another bowl of soup, please.

1050
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:01,790
Well,

1051
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,160
our factory

1052
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,960
has never fired anyone.

1053
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,400
It has to be subject to

1054
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,650
the rules.

1055
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,100
Or what should Dahai do?

1056
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,350
Now,

1057
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,830
everyone

1058
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:14,450
scolds Dahai instead.

1059
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,170
It's not fair, right?

1060
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,470
In my view,

1061
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,540
the factory

1062
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,640
is getting worse.

1063
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,140
What should you do if that's the case?

1064
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,670
You can't steal oil, right?

1065
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,060
Just because each factory doesn't do well,

1066
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,780
everyone should do evil?

1067
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,180
Well, in your view,

1068
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,010
does anything happen to the factory?

1069
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,630
I heard that several units

1070
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,800
have advanced the retirement age.

1071
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,640
What's their intention behind this?

1072
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,220
Do they want us to retire early

1073
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,340
without earning too much money?

1074
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,080
Don't listen to the stupid gossip

1075
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,780
or spread it.

1076
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,000
I didn't.

1077
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,450
I'm just talking to you.

1078
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,970
Do you hear what I said?

1079
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,100
I'm full.

1080
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,120
You're going to be unable to have adequate meals.

1081
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,940
Come on, study harder.

1082
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,480
I can't eat anymore as well.

1083
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,140
Let's use it to make porridge tomorrow morning.

1084
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,070
You two...

1085
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,250
Don't listen to your mother.

1086
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,910
After dinner,

1087
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,810
go back to your room and do your homework.

1088
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,540
I'll have to be on duty tonight.

1089
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,790
Liu Junbao in my class

1090
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,670
cried all day.

1091
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,440
Li Si was scolded because of this.

1092
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,300
What does it have to do with him?

1093
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,350
It makes him

1094
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,170
become an evil son of some landlord all of a sudden.

1095
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,320
He's just like Yuan Shanqing

1096
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,120
in your class.

1097
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:39,210
What they can only do is hit someone when he's down.

1098
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,150
What does adults' business

1099
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,610
have to do with their kids?

1100
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,540
When one family member becomes a wanted criminal,

1101
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,280
the whole family

1102
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,010
seem to have committed a crime.

1103
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,890
You mean Yuan Shanqing?

1104
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:53,830
Dad.

1105
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,280
Where is sandpaper?

1106
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,330
You may find it in the toolbox.

1107
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,870
Why do you need sandpaper?

1108
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,170
I still need 30 yuan.

1109
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,090
I really have no money.

1110
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,480
Where are your parents?

1111
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,650
Ask them to come quickly.

1112
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,560
Miss,

1113
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,410
can you give my sister an injection first?

1114
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:50,970
Please.

1115
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,600
I'll make up for it tomorrow.

1116
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,400
I'm sorry.

1117
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,870
I'm not allowed to do it.

1118
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,790
Go and borrow money from others.

1119
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:00,310
Okay.

1120
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,720
I'll do it now.

1121
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,670
What happened?

1122
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,890
Can you lend me 30 yuan?

1123
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:09,650
Now.

1124
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,240
Hu didn't jump off the bridge.

1125
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,500
But her mother did

1126
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:24,730
without hesitation.

1127
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,080
It was the first time we had realized

1128
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,140
adults

1129
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,490
would also experience so many sad things.

1130
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:31,400
I know

1131
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,360
they are digesting them silently.

1132
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,440
We can make many choices

1133
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,560
in our lives.

1134
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,380
But there's one thing

1135
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,140
we can never choose.

1136
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:42,270
What kind of family we'll be born into

1137
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,260
and what kind of parents we'll have

1138
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,720
are not what we can decide.

1139
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:47,840
Back then,

1140
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,870
there was no such word

1141
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,270
called original family.

1142
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,070
But

1143
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,030
if parents

1144
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,880
can't be their air-raid shelter,

1145
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,160
every danger

1146
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,430
will bring gunfire.

1147
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,500
Many people

1148
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,520
will spend their lifetime

1149
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:01,870
healing those wounds

1150
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,870
caused by the gunfire.
