Why?

00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,970
You don't like yolks.

picked out the yolk and refused to eat it

18
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,080
because the yolk was dry

19
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,120

It was just a haircut.

119
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,750
Did that make him a good person?

120
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,230
It's too subjective.

121
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,150
But he looks better than before.

134

How dare you say she's in the clear?

158
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,110
Does going to the police station

159
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,310
make her a criminal?

160

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,670
Bad guys will be punished sooner or later.

193
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,910
A person like you who can't tell right from wrong

194
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,310
and always helps the bad guys won't end up well.

195
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,950
The fact that the police came to arrest her

196
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,030
speaks volumes.

197
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,550
Let's see how long

198
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,480
you can help her.

199
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,870
The police will clarify

200
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,330
whether she is a criminal.

201
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,760
You have no right to put the blame here.

202
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,520
Fine.

203
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,350
Now I want to ask all of you.

204
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:44,870
Yuan Yong's child

205
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,730
has been taken away by the police.

206
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,160
Who still wants to be in the same class as her?

207
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,090
Raise your hand.

208
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,790
-Who wants to be in the same class as her?
-Cheng.

209
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,710
The police did come.

210
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,370
Don't get yourself involved.

211
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,230
See?

212
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,830
No one wants to be in the same class as her,

213
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,270
except you, freak.

214
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,140
Don't stir up trouble here.

215
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,200
Her father is a fraudster.

216
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,950
It's reasonable for the police to come to her.

217
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,750
You're going against the class

218
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,670
for her.

219
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,000
What's your intention?

220
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,590
Is it because she's good-looking or what?

221
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,030
I'm not against anyone

222
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,310
in the class,

223
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,990
and I'm not doing this for any personal gain.

224
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,150
I just don't want to be a villain

225
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,270
who kicks someone when they're down.

226
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,930
Who are you calling a villain?

227
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,140
We just don't want to get involved with a wanted criminal,

228
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,430
but now we've become villains.

229
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,860
Exactly. You'd better get off your high horse.

230
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,910
After she came,

231
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,710
our class has been

232
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,670
in a tremendous mess.

233
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,110
No one wants to come to our class.

234
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,570
They all think it's a jinx.

235
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,990
In the future, the police will definitely

236
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,430
come to our school more often.

237
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,780
That's right.

238
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,320
What's on your mind?

239
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,910
Can any of you guarantee that Yuan Shanqing

240
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,540
was arrested

241
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,690
for a crime?

242
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,600
Did you hear the police say she committed a crime?

243
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,810
Did you hear that?

244
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,100
Did you hear that?

245
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,580
Did the school say she'll be expelled?

246
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,430
Did they?

247
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,900
The school and the police

248
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,550
haven't confirmed anything yet.

249
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,510
Why are you

250
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,910
putting the blame on her?

251
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,510
You criticized her

252
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,060
at will.

253
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,670
Where is the evidence?

254
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,980
Show me.

255
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,250
What's the use of saying this now?

256
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,550
It's obvious now.

257
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,000
Your argument doesn't hold water.

258
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:47,790
What are you doing?

259
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,670
Class begins.

260
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,870
Go back to your seats.

261
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,510
Hurry up.

262
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,680
There is no escape from the long arm of the law.

263
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,150
Why did you tell the police

264
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,910
you went to the hospital alone?

265
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,910
Yuan Shanqing.

266
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,590
You can't lie.

267
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,750
Tell us

268
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,750
if you have a skeleton in the closet.

269
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,840
I went there alone at first.

270
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,380
Then I saw Cheng Yaya.

271
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,750
I didn't want to implicate him.

272
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,830
I know

273
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,350
you received a lot of criticism

274
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,870
because of your dad.

275
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,190
It's reasonable that

276
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,210
you don't want to implicate others.

277
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,470
But in the current situation,

278
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,160
you can't hide anything.

279
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,600
Do you understand?

280
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,390
I didn't hide anything else,

281
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,480
really.

282
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,670
I never

283
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,820
saw Yuan Yong again.

284
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,040
Why doesn't everyone trust me?

285
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,550
After all,

286
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,390
you're the only one

287
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,030
who can contact your father now.

288
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,310
The police can only

289
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,310
understand the situation from you.

290
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,530
Am I right?

291
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,790
All right.

292
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,470
These are the wounds Yuan Yong inflicted.

293
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,670
I won't cover for him.

294
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,990
I want him to be caught soon.

295
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,360
As long as he's still outside,

296
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,350
my sister and I

297
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,880
will never have a good life.

298
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,470
What happened?

299
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,090
Tell me.

300
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,540
Dad, I really don't know.

301
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,870
No.

302
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,200
Give it to me.

303
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,590
I didn't take it, Dad.

304
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,510
What did I do wrong

305
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,710
to have two daughters?

306
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,440
It's no use at all.

307
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,040
Stop yelling.

308
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,980
Stop yelling.

309
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,070
Why are you crying?

310
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,360
So exhausting

311
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,320
to raise you!

312
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,410
I can't even afford you.

313
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,770
Yet I have to raise the little bastard.

314
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,560
What are you looking at?

315
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,990
Is he Yuan Yong?

316
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:03,780
Yes.

317
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,140
He committed two assaults

318
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,220
in other places.

319
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,060
Both cases were for robbery.

320
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,330
The one in the photo,

321
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,330
he used a brick.

322
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,930
Before that,

323
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,070
he cut another victim with a dagger.

324
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,190
This guy's already considered

325
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,110
crazy.

326
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,000
If we still can't catch him,

327
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,860
nobody knows what else he will do.

328
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,280
Did anyone see

329
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,710
him back in the Oilfield?

330
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,950
Yes, we received a report that

331
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,640
someone saw a man like him

332
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,220
at a coach bus station,

333
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,750
but they're not sure.

334
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,790
However, two days ago,

335
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,890
a coach bus driver

336
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,320
chatted with

337
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,310
a few truck drivers

338
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,970
at a motel beside the highway.

339
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,430
Those truck drivers

340
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,150
provided

341
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,510
a very important clue.

342
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,070
They met Yuan Yong.

343
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,030
Yuan Yong said he was too tired outside

344
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,480
and wanted to get some money from home.

345
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,360
We've been trying

346
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,310
to track him down.

347
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,730
These two clues

348
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,160
can be connected.

349
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,810
Yuan Yong is very cunning.

350
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,850
He's always

351
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,160
hiding in seclusion.

352
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,410
It's hard to find him.

353
00:15:58,950 --> 00:15:59,640
But

354
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,530
judging from the feedback,

355
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,170
we don't think he's ever been far

356
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,450
from Oilfield.

357
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,160
Just wandering around.

358
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,810
So we suspect

359
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,250
he might come back

360
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,690
to find his daughter.

361
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,050
I see.

362
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,730
So,

363
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,210
he'll definitely come back for Yuan Shanqing.

364
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,930
Yuan Yong has nowhere to run.

365
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,610
So we're worried

366
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,480
he'll do something

367
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,490
outrageous.

368
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,370
Mr. Jiang,

369
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,900
I have something to report.

370
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,610
I hope your school

371
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,810
can cooperate with us.

372
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:36,930
If there's anything unusual,

373
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,260
inform us immediately.

374
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,070
We can't give Yuan Yong a chance to flee.

375
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,070
Of course.

376
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,730
We will do our best to cooperate.

377
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,370
Our priority

378
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,970
is to protect Yuan Shanqing.

379
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,090
Thank you.

380
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,200
Can I leave now?

381
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,910
Yes. I'll take you home.

382
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,120
[Wancheng Road Police Station]

383
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,180
Where are you going?

384
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:16,319
Who is it?

385
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,130
Granny Chen.

386
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:24,260
Hello, Uncle. I'm here to pick up my sister.

387
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,770
Didn't you pick her up long ago?

388
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,220
She was picked up?

389
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,300
Who picked her up?

390
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,130
I just came home from work.

391
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:32,980
How would I know?

392
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,780
Your sister was not home when I came back.

393
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,730
What about Granny?

394
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,650
Is she at home?

395
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,210
She went to the hospital to get the medicine.

396
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:38,950
If you're in a hurry,

397
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,880
just go to her.

398
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,640
I told her

399
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,010
not to meddle in these things.

400
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,210
It's too much of a hassle

401
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:44,810
to deal with

402
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,010
your family affairs.

403
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,180
I'm really sick of it.

404
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,410
Go back first.

405
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,550
I'll follow her.

406
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,440
Did Granny Chen come here today?

407
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
I don't remember.

408
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,110
Thank you.

409
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,970
Have you seen Granny Chen?

410
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:14,720
No idea.

411
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:15,930
Thank you.

412
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,090
Hello.

413
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,510
Have you seen Granny Chen?

414
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,000
Sorry, I didn't see her.

415
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,090
What's wrong with you?

416
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,740
Don't cry.

417
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,150
Tell me what happened.

418
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,170
My sister is missing.

419
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,330
I don't know

420
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,680
who picked her up.

421
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,870
She was picked up?

422
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,710
Could it be...

423
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,500
Call the police.

424
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,850
I'll go make a phone call.

425
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,650
Stay here and don't go anywhere.

426
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,400
Yuan?

427
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,160
Yuan Shanqing.

428
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,380
You're finally quiet.

429
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:17,770
Zi,

430
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,920
I'll get you some cookies,

431
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,490
okay?

432
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,280
Zi.

433
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:45,760
I'll go out for a while.

434
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,570
Be good.

435
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,090
Be quiet.

436
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,030
Mom.

437
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,660
You're home.

438
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,500
I saw the light in your room wasn't on.

439
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,220
I just changed the light bulb.

440
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,290
Yuan Shanqing was arrested by the police.

441
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,050
Do you know?

442
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:08,890
Come here.

443
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,350
She's Yuan Shanqing's...

444
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,330
Rumor has it that she has a child.

445
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,290
It's true.

446
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,650
Don't talk nonsense.

447
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,010
This is her sister.

448
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,340
Her name is Yuan Shanzi.

449
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,370
Dad knows it.

450
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,770
Why did you

451
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,030
bring her sister here?

452
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,930
Where is Yuan Shanqing?

453
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,360
-Yuan Shanqing is not here today.
-Yaya.

454
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,620
-Mom is coming.
-Yaya.

455
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:37,440
-What do you...
-Mom.

456
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,970
What do you want for dinner?

457
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,140
Anything.

458
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,810
Mom,

459
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,560
please go out first.

460
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,570
Cheng Miaomiao and I

461
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,530
have something...

462
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,250
What's the matter...

463
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:46,770
To discuss.

464
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:47,560
You go down first.

465
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,330
-We'll...
-Hold on.

466
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,040
-Go down for dinner later.
-I'm just asking you.

467
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,610
Well...

468
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,700
Mom, don't go there.

469
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,730
Listen, Mom.

470
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,980
Look how cute she is when she smiles.

471
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,550
Mom.

472
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,200
What's going on?

473
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,390
Well...

474
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,930
She's Zi,

475
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,610
almost three years old.

476
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,210
Am I asking you how old she is?

477
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,490
I'm asking what's going on

478
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,800
between you and Yuan Yong's daughter.

479
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,170
We are just classmates.

480
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,770
You two are deskmates too.

481
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,610
Shut up.

482
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,180
Mom, there's nothing between us.

483
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,680
It's just I went to see Yuan Shanqing today,

484
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,810
but she wasn't home.

485
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,010
I saw Granny Chen

486
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:52,890
holding Zi.

487
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,170
Granny Chen, Zi.

488
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,170
Why are you here again?

489
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,570
Where's Qing?

490
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,600
Did she not come to pick up Zi?

491
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,170
No.

492
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,090
Didn't she go to school?

493
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,180
She's on leave for something.

494
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,860
I was too old to be mindful.

495
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,930
I lost the key to her house.

496
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,070
So I can't go in.

497
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,460
But I need to go to the hospital in a while.

498
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,210
Granny.

499
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,770
Why don't you leave Zi to me first?

500
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,030
I'll wait for her here.

501
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,410
Can you do it?

502
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,530
Don't worry, Granny Chen.

503
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,520
I can take care of her.

504
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,410
Here, Zi.

505
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,280
-Go to Big Brother.
-Come, let me hug you.

506
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,320
Be good.

507
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,610
-Let's say goodbye to Granny Chen.
-I'll be back soon.

508
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,280
Bye, my dear.

509
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,930
Goodbye.

510
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,710
Granny Chen didn't bring her key.

511
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:42,920
So I picked up Zi

512
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,120
and brought her back.

513
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:45,690
Anyway,

514
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,950
that's what happened.

515
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,840
She's so young.

516
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,620
I can't just leave her alone.

517
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:51,810
Exactly.

518
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,610
She is only three years old.

519
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,670
For her, it's dangerous everywhere.

520
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,810
We have to help her.

521
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,690
You should take stock of the situation even if you want to help.

522
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,330
You...

523
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,770
Now you get involved

524
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,300
with Yuan Yong's daughter,

525
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,170
it's not just a matter

526
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,610
of helping.

527
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
Please be considerate of

528
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,810
your parents.

529
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,140
Yuan Yong is a bad guy.

530
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:14,970
Do you know?

531
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,600
It's not good to get involved with him.

532
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,330
Ask his daughter

533
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,650
to take this little girl away.

534
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,180
Don't cause trouble for us.

535
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:21,930
Mom.

536
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,150
She might not be able to make it today.

537
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,760
She was arrested

538
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,940
by the police at school today.

539
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,530
They didn't arrest her but took her.

540
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,720
If she was taken away by the police,

541
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,320
that means she was arrested.

542
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,610
Her father was wanted.

543
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,100
She was arrested by the police.

544
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,620
What was your purpose

545
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,780
in bringing her sister back?

546
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,780
Are you going to raise her yourself?

547
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,790
It's hard to explain.

548
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,050
Even if she broke the law,

549
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,050
it has nothing to do with her sister.

550
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,920
Such a young kid,

551
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,060
I can't let her starve to death at home.

552
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,570
And there was nothing to eat.

553
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,900
She was crying just now.

554
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,850
What are you doing, Mom?

555
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,570
I'll go get her some milk.

556
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,890
Why are you so quiet?

557
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,930
Why are you so quiet?

558
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:13,650
Cheng Yaya.

559
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,690
Can't she talk?

560
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,460
Call me Sister.

561
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,800
Call me Sister.

562
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,450
Zi.

563
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,160
This is the best you can get

564
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,640
in our family.

565
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,400
Look how skinny she is.

566
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,120
She's not taken care of well.

567
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,810
What a sin. Come on.

568
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,050
Mom.

569
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,490
I knew you were

570
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,830
sharp-tongued but tender-hearted.

571
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,990
You're the kindest.

572
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,430
Stop flattering me.

573
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,610
What does this

574
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,610
have to do with you?

575
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,090
You don't listen to me,

576
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:52,850
do you?

577
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,260
If others find out,

578
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,570
we'll be Yuan Yong's accomplices.

579
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,080
Helping a fraudster

580
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,280
to feed his daughter.

581
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,160
Both of you, listen to me.

582
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,690
Don't let anyone know about this.

583
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:05,760
Do you hear me?

584
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,000
Do you hear me?

585
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,120
I'm talking to you.

586
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,290
I heard it.

587
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,610
Who else can I tell?

588
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,130
I just called

589
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,690
your dad.

590
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,890
When your dad gets off work,

591
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:15,810
ask him

592
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,470
to send this little girl away.

593
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,370
Here, Mr. Gao.

594
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,400
No need to change your shoes.

595
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,200
Come on in.

596
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,730
Just come in.

597
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,460
Just come in.

598
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,090
Sister.

599
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,410
This is

600
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,530
Miaomiao's homeroom teacher,

601
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,170
Mr. Gao.

602
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,290
Mr. Gao.

603
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,200
Come on.

604
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,370
Have a seat.

605
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,450
Do you miss your sister?

606
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,450
I heard

607
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,970
Miaomiao has a new homeroom teacher.

608
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,970
You didn't pick her up,

609
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,410
so I took her home.

610
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,130
-Last time, your...
-Thank you.

611
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,650
Your heroic act

612
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,610
was really touching.

613
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,340
Are you okay?

614
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,680
I knew you were

615
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,920
-a role model for the kids.
-I'm fine.

616
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,730
As parents, we're relieved

617
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,640
to leave our children in your hands.

618
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,810
Get Mr. Gao some water. Hurry up.

619
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,160
Are you here today

620
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:54,030
because Miaomiao made another mistake?

621
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,250
No.

622
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,300
I was sending my student here.

623
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,940
This is Yuan Shanqing, Yaya's classmate.

624
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,830
-Auntie.
-Yuan Shanqing.

625
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,610
Hello.

626
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,570
Mr. Gao,

627
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,300
how's Miaomiao's result?

628
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,990
I'm concerned about it.

629
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,560
Does she raise her hand when answering questions in class?

630
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,000
Yes, this girl.

631
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,370
-She's good.
-Why are you coughing?

632
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,130
She's improved.

633
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:18,770
She's improved?

634
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,650
That's good.

635
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,770
Mr. Gao,

636
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,330
it'd be so great

637
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,210
-if you stayed for dinner.
-Yeah.

638
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,570
-I cook fast.
-No need.

639
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,100
-That's right.
-It's okay.

640
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,490
Sorry for causing the trouble.

641
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,850
Thank you, Uncle and Auntie.

642
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,650
-No worries.
-Don't mention it.

643
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,370
How about I

644
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,570
drive you home?

645
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,160
No need.

646
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,490
I'll drive them home.

647
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,190
Mr. Gao, come again when you're free.

648
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,540
Don't bother to see me out.

649
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,460
Take care.

650
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,450
Don't bother to see me out.

651
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,250
Goodbye, Mr. Gao.

652
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,270
-Bye.
-Goodbye, Mr. Gao.

653
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,510
Shanqing, see you.

654
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,710
Shanqing

655
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,800
is really gentle.

656
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,170
But she has a bad origin.

657
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,650
She is a good child.

658
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,970
What do you mean?

659
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,130
You three know her?

660
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,240
Did you meet her too?

661
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,810
No, I...

662
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,520
I...

663
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,130
What?

664
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:10,730
Tell me.

665
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,370
Have you seen her too?

666
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,970
I'll change my shoes first.

667
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,950
If you have any difficulties in life,

668
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,320
just tell us.

669
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,650
We will help you.

670
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,130
Thank you, Mr. Gao, for helping me today.

671
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,130
Ms. Han.

672
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,810
You're finally back.

673
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,190
I was so worried.

674
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,420
Why are you here?

675
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,010
I have to make sure

676
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,050
you're all okay.

677
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,880
If not, how can I rest assured?

678
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,170
This little girl is...

679
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,750
Her name is Zi.

680
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,580
She is Yuan Shanqing's sister.

681
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,090
Why did you

682
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,210
do that?

683
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,890
Yuan Shanqing is right here.

684
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,090
Can't you see?

685
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,780
If she really broke the law,

686
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,780
would the police let her out?

687
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:53,760
Are you guys

688
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,090
better than the police?

689
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,020
You can even convict her without evidence?

690
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,610
Do you really have to make up stories

691
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,360
and bully

692
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,290
a girl like this?

693
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,320
Don't you feel ashamed?

694
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,750
Cheng Yaya, I think

695
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:09,830
you're possessed.

696
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,880
Do you know that

697
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,370
a child is supposed to pay their father's debts?

698
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,520
Yuan Yong cheated money and killed my grandma.

699
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,700
I only asked her to get out of this class.

700
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,500
Is it too much?

701
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,730
Yes, that's right.

702
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,720
A wanted criminal.

703
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,730
She's not welcome in Class 1.

704
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,340
Yuan Shanqing.

705
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,670
Yuan Shanqing!

706
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,600
Why did you run?

707
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,260
You're not a fraudster.

708
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,180
I know I'm not.

709
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,690
But who would believe me?

710
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,530
I believe you.

711
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,410
What about them?

712
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:51,930
Maybe I'm not supposed

713
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,970
to be here.

714
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,860
If you leave like this,

715
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:57,570
they will think

716
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,570
they are right.

717
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,810
You'll always be a fraudster

718
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:00,760
like they said.

719
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,630
Yuan Shanqing.

720
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:14,880
I don't know

721
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,140
what you're afraid of.

722
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:18,930
Tell them

723
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,230
why the police came to you.

724
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,370
Tell them

725
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,230
you're different from Yuan Yong.

726
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,380
Tell them

727
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,160
you have the right

728
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,620
to stay in this classroom.

729
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,010
Why don't you go to another class?

730
00:31:59,320 --> 00:31:59,970
Yes.

731
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:03,230
My dad, Yuan Yong, is a fraudster.

732
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,280
He hurt many families.

733
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:12,040
But I won't apologize on behalf of him.

734
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,950
Because he doesn't deserve it.

735
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,370
The police will punish him

736
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,970
for the crimes he committed.

737
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,620
But I've never committed crimes.

738
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,880
I just want to study in peace.

739
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,480
You can dislike me,

740
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,070
hate me,

741
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,970
and make up stories about me.

742
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:36,730
But you have no right

743
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,590
to ask me to leave this classroom.

744
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,060
As long as the school doesn't expel me,

745
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,110
I will continue to study here.

746
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,130
Class begins.

747
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,370
Stand up.

748
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,050
Good morning, teacher.

749
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,680
Good morning, boys and girls.

750
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,770
Sit down, please.

751
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,970
Thank you, teacher.

752
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,330
Today we're going to talk about a new lesson.

753
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,850
Please turn to page 180.

754
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,050
I believe all of you know

755
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,890
the story of Helen Keller.

756
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,930
Because of illness,

757
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:52,810
she became deaf, dumb, and blind at a very young age.

758
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,690
But fortunately,

759
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:57,280

the right amount of persistence
