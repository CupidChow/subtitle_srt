00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,500
Yuan Shanqing!

191
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,270
Yuan Shanqing!

192
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,100
Yuan Shanqing!

193
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:25,780
Mom!

194
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,160
Mom.

195
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,450
Son!

196
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,230
Where is Yuan Shanqing's seat?

197
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,030
Mom, she's not in the classroom.

198
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,669
Not in the classroom?

199
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,510
Fine!

200
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,120
I know. I know.

201
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,070
Let's not cause a scene in class.

202
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,270
Not in the classroom?

203
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,110
I don't believe she'll skip class forever!

204
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,390
If she doesn't come today,

205
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,720
we'll just wait here!

206
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,630
Yes! Yes!

207
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,350
What are you doing here?

208
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,120
Get out!

209
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,800
This is a school!

210
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,760
This has nothing to do with you two!

211
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,470
If Yuan Shanqing doesn't show up,

212
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,700
we're not leaving today!

213
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,420
Yes, we won't leave!

214
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,560
Calm down, everyone.

215
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,000
Parents, parents,

216
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,790
we can't solve anything

217
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,750
like this,

218
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,390
right?

219
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,680
Let's go find somewhere

220
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,720
to sit down and talk.

221
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,300
It's just an internal conflict among us.

222
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,230
We can settle this peacefully.

223
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,070
Calm down.

224
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,490
Open the door.

225
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,630
Miaomiao!

226
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,670
-Hu is here.
-Open the door.

227
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,510
Open the door.

228
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,270
Stop shouting!

229
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,550
Coming.

230
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,870
Be quiet.

231
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,610
What's going on?

232
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,850
They're still causing a scene.

233
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,030
I've asked Mr. Gao and Ms. Han

234
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,190
to go deal with them first.

235
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,870
Ms. Han said

236
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,160
that we wouldn't let Yuan Shanqing go with them.

237
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,090
What about Fang?

238
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,100
What did she say?

239
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,440
I didn't catch it.

240
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,780
When I saw what was happening,

241
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,450
I hurried here

242
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,530
to inform you.

243
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,430
As for Fang's character,

244
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,010
she is so cunning.

245
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,320
Let me tell you.

246
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,530
She wouldn't dare offend the parents.

247
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,850
I just heard the parents talking about

248
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,930
getting Yuan Shanqing expelled.

249
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:51,760
Oh no.

250
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,590
Fang easily yields under pressure.

251
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,090
I don't want to drag the school into this,

252
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,240
or you guys either.

253
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,150
If it comes down to it, I'll just go with them.

254
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,110
Are you stupid?

255
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,110
Where would you go?

256
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,790
What could you possibly do?

257
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,930
Can you arrest your dad?

258
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,300
You just stay here.

259
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,350
Don't worry.

260
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,240
Nobody knows

261
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,220
you're here except us.

262
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:13,900
Yes.

263
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,060
If the school is trying to expel you,

264
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,190
I'll go to the principal

265
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,390
and the factory manager.

266
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,460
We'll all go.

267
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:19,990
Yes.

268
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,510
My dad is a leader.

269
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,390
He really knows the factory manager.

270
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,990
I'll ask him to take us to him.

271
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,630
Everyone inside, come out!

272
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,430
Come out.

273
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,370
It's... Mr. Gao!

274
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,270
I'll go.

275
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,930
You... you go...

276
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,230
Mr. Gao?

277
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,770
Mr. Gao.

278
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,460
Mr. Gao.

279
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,360
How do you know that we are here?

280
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,710
Li Si told me.

281
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,150
You guys have found a good place.

282
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,540
Playing hide-and-seek here?

283
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,910
What's the point of attending class?

284
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,510
She's going to be taken away.

285
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,950
With me here, who would dare to take you?

286
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,750
We've driven them away.

287
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,680
Go back to class.

288
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,470
Mr. Gao,

289
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,590
is the school not going to expel her?

290
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,070
Expel who?

291
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,000
Who has the right?

292
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,090
That's good.

293
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,030
We were almost scared to death.

294
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,480
What are you three doing here?

295
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,400
What does this have to do with you?

296
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,320
Yes, he is my brother.

297
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,550
Real brother. We've been taking care of him since he was little.

298
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,030
Yeah.

299
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,230
We can't just stand by

300
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,290
and watch someone bully our brother.

301
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,670
Cheng Yaya,

302
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,480
has anyone bullied you?

303
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,490
But someone bullied her.

304
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,190
All right.

305
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,500
It's all over.

306
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,700
Go back to class.

307
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,420
Everyone,

308
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,620
you've seen

309
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,950
what happened just now.

310
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,190
Why on earth

311
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,630
could this happen?

312
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,140
Why?

313
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,590
Director,

314
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,840
it's not Yuan Shanqing's fault.

315
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,950
Of course not!

316
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,500
It's those people who have gone too far!

317
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,160
They even dared to come to the school to cause trouble

318
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,110
and demanded

319
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,070
that I hand her over!

320
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,190
What do they take our Linqi No. 2 High School

321
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,830
for?

322
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,730
What do they think this place is?

323
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,060
How dare they act so presumptuously here?

324
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,550
I've already

325
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,590
reported this to the principal,

326
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,940
and we will not

327
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,150
expel any students.

328
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,150
Everything will be handled

329
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,080
according to Linqi No. 2 High School's regulations.

330
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,910
Also,

331
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,230
I'll speak

332
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,090
with our security department later.

333
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,810
If this happens again,

334
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,790
anyone who lets even one person in

335
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,270
will be severely punished!

336
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:39,260
Good, good!

337
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,390
Director, calm down.

338
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,920
I didn't work up, actually.

339
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,190
I just want to let them know

340
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,190
that while our teachers

341
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,100
are educated and law-abiding,

342
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,300
it doesn't mean we can be pushed around!

343
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:58,750
Yuan Shanqing.

344
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,320
For your safety,

345
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,460
I've decided

346
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,030
to clear out a room

347
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,030
in our teachers' dormitory for you.

348
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,030
From now on, you'll be staying next door to me.

349
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,550
Let's see who dares to come here

350
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,550
and bully you again.

351
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,110
If one comes, I'll deal with one.

352
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,020
If two come, I'll deal with them both!

353
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,670
Great!

354
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,530
Great!

355
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,340
Director!

356
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,290
Your bottle is leaking!

357
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,140
How did my bottle get broken?

358
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,260
It was a gift from my first love.

359
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,150
All 11th-grade homeroom teachers,

360
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,150
please go to the Academic Affairs Office.

361
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,590
All 11th-grade homeroom teachers,

362
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,920
please go to the Academic Affairs Office.

363
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,720
It wasn't me who asked my mom to come.

364
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,740
I didn't know she would come.

365
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,980
Cheng,

366
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,140
my brother

367
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,780
was the first to rush in

368
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,310
and try to hold my aunt back.

369
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,430
They all saw it.

370
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,620
Thank you.

371
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,110
Cheng,

372
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,230
my brother is definitely going to get beaten by my aunt

373
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,690
when he gets home tonight.

374
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,750
But my aunt

375
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,210
really went too far today.

376
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,240
Your brother is not that bad.

377
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,530
I've always known it.

378
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,320
Li Si!

379
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,740
Xu Wenwu.

380
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,470
You all got your papers, right?

381
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,670
If there's nothing else, class is over.

382
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,540
I've never gotten

383
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,540
such high scores.

384
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,810
105, Chinese.

385
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,300
English, 97.

386
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,710
Math, 138.

387
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,320
Qiang Xiaowa didn't guess his answers.

388
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,480
By the way,

389
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,630
there'll be a parent-teacher meeting tomorrow at 5 p.m.

390
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:49,860
I'm done for.

391
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,030
I'm screwed.

392
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,670
My...

393
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,890
My total score is over 500.

394
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,030
How am I going to explain

395
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,800
such a big improvement to my parents?

396
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,040
Just tell them...

397
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,660
that it's the result of your hard work.

398
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,140
Even I wouldn't buy that.

399
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,109
Then just say

400
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,430
that the God of Wealth was blessing you.

401
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,390
Your mom will probably be overjoyed.

402
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,430
That excuse might fool my mom,

403
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,869
but my dad's an atheist.

404
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:10,990
He'll definitely think that I cheated.

405
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,069
He will kill me.

406
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:13,630
Then why didn't you change any answers

407
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,030
when copying his papers?

408
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,500
His answers were so long that I didn't even want to copy them.

409
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,339
Besides,

410
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,339
how was I supposed to know that he got all the questions right?

411
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,520
Maybe I should just run away from home.

412
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,190
Well,

413
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,599
do you have any money to lend me?

414
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,140
I'm going to my grandma's tonight.

415
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,010
That's not running away from home

416
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,270
if you're going to your grandma's.

417
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,910
Doesn't your dad know

418
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,390
where she lives?

419
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,050
Then... what should I do?

420
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,090
How about I jump into the river?

421
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,780
Hu jumped into the river at that time

422
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,310
to try to save the marriage.

423
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,030
My mom jumped into the river.

424
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,830
And it didn't save her marriage.

425
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,120
Then...

426
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,220
None of these ideas can work.

427
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,030
But I can't just die young.

428
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,670
If anything were to happen to me,

429
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,420
what about you two?

430
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,420
What would you do?

431
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,560
I'd live on bravely.

432
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,870
Got any unfulfilled wishes?

433
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,610
We'll help you to fulfill it

434
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,700
while we're at it.

435
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,500
How can you say that?

436
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,180
Cheng Miaomiao, your situation

437
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,240
isn't good either.

438
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:05,740
86?

439
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,720
When have you ever scored 86?

440
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,960
Changed it from 56.

441
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,210
Look at the pen color.

442
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,650
It's different.

443
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,900
It wasn't like that a moment ago.

444
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,420
Why did the color change?

445
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,350
You two really

446
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,210
are more clueless than the other.

447
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,420
You did well;

448
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,150
of course, you're not worried.

449
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,600
I can't believe you got that question right too.

450
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,690
Amazing, Xiaowa.

451
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,590
This one. This one.

452
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,630
What question? Question 22.

453
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,750
The second part of Question 22.

454
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,750
You know this too?

455
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,050
Oh my god, you're amazing.

456
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:32,800
Oh no.

457
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,110
My first-place ranking is slipping through my fingers.

458
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,280
Every day,

459
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,430
I went out of my way to help him,

460
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,540
and it turns out he was hiding his talents all along.

461
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,790
So scheming.

462
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,500
You can't let these things

463
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,760
distract you anymore.

464
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,430
Your studies are your own business.

465
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,220
If it really affects

466
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,930
your grades

467
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,860
or your chances of being accepted into college,

468
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,100
it won't be worth it.

469
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,980
Can I really get into college?

470
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,230
Why not?

471
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,670
The college entrance exam is the fairest competition.

472
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:12,930
Son,

473
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,640
we're back.

474
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,630
Welcome home.

475
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,850
Si, what are you doing?

476
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,270
I'm mopping the floor.

477
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,770
You must've caused some trouble, huh?

478
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,650
What trouble could I have possibly caused?

479
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,710
Why do you always

480
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,090
say unpleasant things like that?

481
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,150
Our son's mopping the floor voluntarily,

482
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,490
yet you immediately assume he's caused trouble.

483
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,520
-Dad.
-Come on, let me do it.

484
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,120
It's okay.

485
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,760
Dad, Mom is right.

486
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,310
You really did jump to conclusions this time.

487
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,190
What are you looking around for?

488
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,630
What did you sell of mine this time?

489
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,790
What did I sell of yours?

490
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,520
Everything's right here. Can't you see?

491
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,720
All I know is to sell you stuff, alright?

492
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,350
Let me say this first.

493
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:56,950
You see.

494
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,580
I've worked so hard

495
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,910
to mop the entire house,

496
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,240
including the balcony.

497
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,780
I've put in so much effort,

498
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,070
making our house

499
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,250
spotless,

500
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,130
giving my youthful labor.

501
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:08,990
Also, for this family...

502
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,910
What exactly have you done?

503
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,080
Just say it! Stop stalling!

504
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,880
Talk nicely.

505
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,220
Can't you talk to him nicely for once?

506
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,230
Well, t-t-tomorrow...

507
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,300
there's... a parent-teacher meeting.

508
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,300
Last place again.

509
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,050
Definitely.

510
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,670
Si, do you not feel any stress

511
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,900
about being at the bottom of the class

512
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,030
every semester?

513
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,630
Mom, it's not like that.

514
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,790
But I'm feeling a bit stressed right now.

515
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,940
You feel stressed?

516
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,200
Shouldn't I be the one stressed?

517
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,580
Li Si, my good son,

518
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,330
can't you make me proud just once?

519
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,410
Can't you help me save face?

520
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,400
Enough.

521
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,250
Doesn't that hurt, hitting your face?

522
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,210
I'm such a proud man!

523
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,580
You don't inherit

524
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,870
my strengths, and I've come to terms with that.

525
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:55,510
Really.

526
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,470
But Li Si, you know what?

527
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,880
The foolishness...

528
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,960
is oozing from your eyes.

529
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,110
Seriously.

530
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,910
I'm afraid to look at you for too long now.

531
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,840
I-I-I'm scared it'll rub off on me.

532
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,460
Dad,

533
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,640
biologically speaking,

534
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,110
a child's intelligence

535
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,030
primarily depends on

536
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,070
their parents' genes.

537
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,240
It's a congenital thing.

538
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,000
So, if I'm giving off foolish vibes,

539
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
well, then that means you're a fool.

540
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,880
What's wrong?

541
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,260
My heart rate jumped to 200 beats just now.

542
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,240
That Qiang Xiaowa,

543
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,330
isn't he from a local village?

544
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,060
Yeah.

545
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,470
How could their village

546
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,270
possibly have any good schools?

547
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,690
Can't he even

548
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,250
speak proper Mandarin yet?

549
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,000
How did he manage to get ahead of you this time?

550
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,500
We don't know why either.

551
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,060
We're all puzzled by it too.

552
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,990
You should reflect on yourself.

553
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,670
What could possibly be wrong with me?

554
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,200
I just performed normally.

555
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,030
Besides, Mom,

556
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,800
I can't be first every time.

557
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,950
You certainly know how to take things lightly.

558
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,590
Listen.

559
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,510
The fact that you didn't score well this time

560
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,910
is a wake-up call for you.

561
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,710
Don't be content with just

562
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,960
being the top student at the oilfield school.

563
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,270
You're still far from enough

564
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,460
to get into a top university, got it?

565
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,790
You need to work harder.

566
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,000
That's the level of the oilfield school here.

567
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,010
What level?

568
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,270
Didn't Tao

569
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,970
go from our oilfield?

570
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,350
How did he

571
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,850
get into a university in Shenzhen?

572
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,020
I'm telling you.

573
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,350
No matter what,

574
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,670
you have to score higher than he did.

575
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,430
Got it?

576
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,350
Otherwise, I won't be able to hold my head up

577
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,790
in front of your Uncle Yang.

578
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,310
I really don't get it.

579
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,220
Why do you always

580
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,630
compare me to my brother?

581
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,990
What's the point?

582
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,190
We're all one family.

583
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,390
One family?

584
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,000
Did I give birth to you and him?

585
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,490
See?

586
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,610
That's what annoys me about you.

587
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,620
From the bottom of your heart,

588
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,710
you never truly think about us

589
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,440
living together as one family.

590
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,550
If you really can't do it,

591
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,890
just leave Yang Songbai. Divorce him.

592
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,270
I can accept it.

593
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,830
You accept it? What's there for you to accept?

594
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,800
If I get divorced again, I...

595
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,180
Fine, I'm telling you...

596
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,290
It's useless even if I tell you.

597
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,900
Forget it. Let's eat.

598
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,180
If it weren't for you...

599
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,910
Mom, let's just eat.

600
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,550
The parent-teacher meeting is coming up, huh?

601
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,830
If I hadn't asked,

602
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,060
you wouldn't have brought it up, would you?

603
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,950
I would have.

604
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,880
I just didn't get the chance yet.

605
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,460
How many subjects did you fail this time?

606
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,860
Only two.

607
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,580
Is that so?

608
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,130
Four.

609
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,140
Cheng Miaomiao.

610
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,940
If your brother hadn't told me,

611
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,910
were you planning to change your grades secretly again, right?

612
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,790
I'm not going to embarrass myself by going to the meeting.

613
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,790
Ask your dad to go.

614
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,630
I'm old.

615
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,720
I'm nearing menopause.

616
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,310
Let me live for a few more years.

617
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,510
What menopause?

618
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,760
That doesn't start until women reach their fifties.

619
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,800
Cheng Miaomiao, don't you get it?

620
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,700
You've made me so angry

621
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,880
that you've brought on my menopause early.

622
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,330
I'll go to your brother's meeting,

623
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,390
and you can ask whoever to go to yours.

624
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,510
It would be better if you did not go.

625
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,500
Yuan Shanqing.

626
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,640
Are you really not going to move into the teacher's dormitory?

627
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,090
I still have to take care of Zi.

628
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,150
It's more convenient to stay at home.

629
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,670
But what if they come looking for you

630
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,400
at your home?

631
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,380
Actually, I have an idea.

632
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,470
Stop talking. The parents are all here.

633
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,200
Alright, I'll run now.

634
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,190
If something happens to me,

635
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,110
remember to bring me something to eat

636
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:02,980
at the arch of the bridge tonight.

637
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,260
My dad has surgery to perform today,

638
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,560
and you know how my mom is.

639
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,710
Let's go to the arch of the bridge tonight too.

640
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,910
You buy some food and bring it to us.

641
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,640
Shouldn't we observe the situation first?

642
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,630
Don't rush off.

643
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,650
Wait for me.

644
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,890
Are you sure?

645
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,010
I want to give it a try.

646
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,350
If I keep staying silent,

647
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,620
no one will ever know

648
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,700
the truth.

649
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,390
It only takes one person

650
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,070
to say that I'm in cahoots with Yuan Yong,

651
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,800
and everyone will think so too.

652
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,390
As you said,

653
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,360
it's hard for an innocent man to retain his clean name without explanation.

654
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,890
I still need to explain what I have to explain.

655
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,930
I'm mainly worried

656
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,950
that they'll be unreasonable because there are too many of them.

657
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,010
At least in school,

658
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,270
you're safe,

659
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,620
and everyone is on your side.

660
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,840
Xiao Fang has also taken a stand.

661
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,650
You don't need to worry so much.

662
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,670
I'm really grateful to Director Xiao

663
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,870
and everyone else,

664
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,750
but we can't keep having groups of people

665
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,820
coming to the school and causing trouble like this.

666
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,820
Everyone is affected

667
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,900
because of me.

668
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,330
I don't want that.

669
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,670
Okay.

670
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,120
Do it.

671
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,670
Even if only one

672
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,880
out of ten people believes you,

673
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,140
then it means working.

674
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,710
You wait for me here.

675
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:24,970
No more "You go, I go."

676
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,510
I'll go with you.

677
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:28,790
When they come out,

678
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,670
watch their expressions.

679
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,600
We'll run immediately if their expressions are off.

680
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:33,920
It's still early.

681
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,180
Every parent-teacher meeting

682
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,790
lasts at least two hours.

683
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,270
Why don't we

684
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,230
go buy some food?

685
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,340
Prepare in advance, just in case.

686
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,970
No, no.

687
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,550
I've got a bad feeling. I'm leaving.

688
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,890
They're coming out?

689
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,590
It shouldn't be.

690
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,850
It's only half an hour.

691
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,900
My dad is out too.

692
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,430
Something's not right.

693
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,100
Miaomiao,

694
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,760
do you think my dad's smiling?

695
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,780
My mom is smiling too.

696
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,300
The atmosphere is joyful.

697
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,090
Why am I feeling so scared?

698
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,100
Uncle Lin, I'm sorry.

699
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,650
You still dare to come here?

700
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,150
How did I help Yuan Yong?

701
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:37,910
-Watch out.
-Dad.

702
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:38,550
I lent him 200 yuan

703
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,430
for one sentence of him.

704
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,580
Calm down. Relax.

705
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,590
We just wanted to apologize,

706
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,310
nothing more.

707
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,350
Think about it!

708
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,690
Over the years, how much money have you spent?

709
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,990
Now you're denying it?

710
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,030
What am I denying?

711
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,740
You were the one who said to invest,

712
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,950
and that's why I trusted Yuan Yong!

713
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,150
Now you blame everything on me

714
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,190
and deny everything?

715
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,430
How dare you hit me?

716
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,390
-Uncle.
-How dare you hit me?

717
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,670
-I'll kill you!
-Calm down.

718
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,230
Calm down!

719
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:56,710
Uncle, aunt!

720
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,340
I'll kill you!

721
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,310
Calm down!

722
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:03,830
Grandpa, Grandma,

723
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,080
my dad did wrong and broke the law.

724
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,080
But the law will punish him.

725
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,010
I'll definitely not cover for him.

726
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,940
I'm also a victim.

727
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,120
Please believe me.

728
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,760
Darling,

729
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,940
the girl is really pitiful.

730
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,180
We believe you.

731
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,590
How did this

732
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,420
happen to you?

733
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,620
Well... who is your father?

734
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,350
You...

735
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,570
Coming, Ms. Zhang.

736
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,060
I was just looking for you.

737
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,450
Aunt Wang, I'm sorry.

738
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,260
Actually, about Yuan Yong...

739
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:50,900
Run!

740
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,410
You two little brats,

741
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,770
you dare to come here yourselves?

742
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,850
You better run.

743
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,410
Run! Keep running!

744
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,020
What the heck!

745
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,540
[Danger; Please Stay Away]

746
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,570
Maybe we were both thinking too simply.

747
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,550
It's okay.

748
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,930
At least, I've faced them.

749
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,020
Let's go.

750
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,170
Here, Grandpa, have some water.

751
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,000
Mr. Gao.

752
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,580
It's okay.

753
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,750
Please sit.

754
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,350
Mr. Gao, you see.

755
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,470
I can't read or write.

756
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,260
I also don't know

757
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,650
what you wrote on the blackboard

758
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,290
or the things

759
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,210
you put on your desk.

760
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,280
I was too embarrassed to ask in class.

761
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,350
I was afraid that people would laugh at me.

762
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,110
We wouldn't.

763
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,650
If you have anything you want to know,

764
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,810
just ask me.

765
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,850
How did Qiang Xiaowa do on the exam this time?

766
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,760
What rank did he get?

767
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,690
This time,

768
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,600
he's first in our class.

769
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,110
He...

770
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,070
My Xiaowa is first this time?

771
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,550
This brat,

772
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,870
why didn't he tell me?

773
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,800
I-I-I was just looking around

774
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,220
to see where the ranking was posted,

775
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,570
but I couldn't find it.

776
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,610
We didn't post the rankings in our class this time,

777
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,620
nor did I announce

778
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,500
the rankings in the class either.

779
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:01,310
I think the ranking isn't important.

780
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,790
What's important is

781
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,990
that the children are really learning

782
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,980
knowledge

783
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,960
and staying passionate about their studies.

784
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,800
Yes. Yes.

785
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,130
You're right.

786
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,170
You're right.

787
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,430
How does he behave

788
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:12,950
in school?

789
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,690
He didn't cause any trouble, did he?

790
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,880
You can rest assured.

791
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,260
Xiaowa is very well-behaved.

792
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,140
He's doing very well in school.

793
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,860
That's good.

794
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,700
I was

795
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,830
feeling a bit anxious earlier,

796
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,850
worried that he might

797
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,670
cause some trouble for the school.

798
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,600
You know

799
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,350
that we folks from the countryside

800
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,120
don't know the proper manners.

801
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,940
What countryside?

802
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:34,830
We're all from Heping Town,

803
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,930
aren't we?

804
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,470
Come over here more often if you have the time.

805
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,310
Let Xiaowa show you around

806
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,480
our school.

807
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,100
The food in our school cafeteria

808
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,010
is quite good.

809
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,780
I've got meal tickets.

810
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,690
My treat.

811
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,600
-Come on.
-Okay.

812
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,350
Take it, Grandpa.

813
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:47,990
Okay.

814
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:49,090
No.

815
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,230
How can I

816
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,290
let you pay for my meal?

817
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,840
Please take it. It's okay.

818
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:53,530
I...

819
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,080
I don't know what to say.

820
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,170
Mr. Gao.

821
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,180
Thank you for everything.

822
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,030
Don't be like this.

823
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,500
It's my duty as a teacher.

824
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:09,850
Mr. Gao.

825
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,400
In my heart, Xiaowa...

826
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,260
Here, Mr. Gao.

827
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,180
I caught the seafood myself.

828
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,340
It's not worth much.

829
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,750
Please try it.

830
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,800
Hope you like it.

831
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,190
Qiang Xiaowa.

832
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,690
Mr. Gao.

833
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,990
I bought some seafood from your grandpa.

834
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,350
But I forgot to give him money

835
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,150
while a parent was talking to me.

836
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,740
Take the money to him for me.

837
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,680
My younger brother isn't in good health.

838
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,880
My mom says that seafood is nutritious.

839
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,560
From now on, I'll buy 50 yuan worth of seafood

840
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,220
from your family every month.

841
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,970
You have set some aside for me.

842
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,100
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

843
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:16,850
Mr. Gao...

844
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,840
Keep moping.

845
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,070
Don't just eat meat. Have some vegetables.

846
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,630
Okay.

847
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,640
Some units have already begun

848
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,570
implementing the "suspension of salary but retention of position" policy, right?

849
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,650
We have to follow the rules to do it.

850
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,440
It's not like whoever wants it and can have it.

851
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,130
So, what's the current policy

852
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,100
at your unit?

853
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,230
Why did you ask?

854
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,880
Don't you know Ms. Wang?

855
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,370
Her husband asked me to see

856
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:50,870
if it's possible to retain her position.

857
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,200
This woman is so annoying,

858
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,660
always trying to pull strings

859
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,190
and get special treatment.

860
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:58,930
What's wrong, Si?

861
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,140
Why don't you eat?

862
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,790
I'm eating.

863
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,720
Don't like the dishes?

864
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,780
No, no, I like them.

865
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,610
Have some tofu.

866
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,990
Get some protein.

867
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,860
You can't play me like this.

868
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,940
It's too scary.

869
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:12,330
What's scary about having dinner?

870
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,210
What are you afraid of?

871
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,909
No, it's just... at a time like this,

872
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:16,280
how can we just eat?

873
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,250
Don't you have anything to say to me?

874
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,440
What, do your mom and I need to

875
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,440
involve you when we talk about work?

876
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,130
No, well...

877
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,469
Well...

878
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,820
Well, today...

879
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,120
The parent-teacher meeting, right?

880
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,280
Your teacher told me.

881
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,560
He said that your grades...

882
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:35,870
have improved,

883
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,840
but there's still room for more improvement.

884
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,310
Son, you have to keep up the good work

885
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,170
and not give up.

886
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,340
I won't give up.

887
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,110
Keep studying hard.

888
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:43,750
I will.

889
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,010
I didn't really study that hard.

890
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:46,780
Mostly, I...

891
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,100
The God of Wealth has blessed me this time.

892
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,540
I'll go light some incense for him.

893
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,139
What incense!

894
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,550
Just focus on making progress.

895
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,310
Burn incense?

896
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,030
Don't be so superstitious

897
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,969
like your mom,

898
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:56,590
got it?

899
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:57,950
Okay.

900
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,160
Let me summarize.

901
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,520
The improvement in your grades this time,

902
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,760
I don't think...

903
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,200
it's a coincidence.

904
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,220
To a large extent,

905
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:09,980
I think this is a reason.

906
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,700
I think you've already

907
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,180
that... that...

908
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,670
started inheriting my genes.

909
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,390
Really?

910
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,160
Your IQ is increasing now.

911
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,260
But...

912
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,280
you can't settle for that.

913
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,090
Right?

914
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:26,900
An innate advantage will eventually become a disadvantage

915
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,430
if you don’t put in the effort.

916
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,630
-You can only rely on yourself.
-Listen carefully.

917
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,890
There are no shortcuts

918
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,530
to achieving success.

919
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,470
-Good!
-Good.

920
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,050
Good.

921
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,640
Mom.

922
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:07,770
I was too strict with you before.

923
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,290
I apologize.

924
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:19,770
Miaomiao,

925
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,560
do you know

926
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,840
the difference between growing up and achieving success?

927
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,990
You're all supposed to have a clear idea

928
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,900
about the results of the baseline test this time.

929
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,320
The rankings aren't important,

930
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,050
but if you didn't do well, you just didn't do well.

931
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,270
Failing a subject comes with consequences.

932
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,510
For whichever subject you failed,

933
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,480
you should copy that test paper ten times.

934
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,790
After you finish, hand it over to Zhu Chao.

935
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,250
I'll personally check it.

936
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,420
What?

937
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,440
Ten times.

938
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:55,130
Li Si,

939
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,650
you copy all the test papers ten times

940
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,910
and the textbook once.

941
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,610
Mr. Gao,

942
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,430
I didn't fail any subject.

943
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,270
Don't you like

944
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,880
learning from your deskmate?

945
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,810
Copy your deskmate's answers ten times

946
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,930
to keep learning.

947
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,830
From now on, anyone in our class caught cheating on an exam

948
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,760
will receive the same punishment.

949
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:15,620
Copying this much...

950
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,820
When will it ever end?

951
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,730
My hand's going to be crippled.

952
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,790
Your workload is nothing.

953
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,050
When will I ever finish copying?

954
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,130
For the first time in my life,

955
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,480
I had the thought

956
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,900
that failing an exam is truly frightening.

957
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,430
God,

958
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,350
please bless me.

959
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:40,030
Please bless me to pass the next exam.

960
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,610
Please bless my hand.

961
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,330
What's the use of relying on God?

962
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:45,130
We should rely on ourselves, Si.

963
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,630
I thought God had favored me this time

964
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,750
by helping me escape Li Dahai's beatings,

965
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,410
but I didn't escape Gao Feiyang's punishments.

966
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,680
Well, what exactly

967
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,830
did Gao Feiyang say to our parents

968
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,020
at that parent-teacher meeting?

969
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,300
I don't know either.

970
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,980
I graduated from university just three years ago.

971
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,260
I know many of you

972
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,300
are worried about this.

973
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:10,390
[A Warm Welcome to the Parents of 11th Grade]

974
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,380
You're worried that I don't have enough experience

975
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,910
and won't be able to teach your children well.

976
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,210
I wasn't exactly

977
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,040
a good student myself back then.

978
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,800
The reason I went to a teacher's college was simple,

979
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,150
and that's that it didn't charge tuition.

980
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,260
Our family relies on a single income,

981
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,590
and I have a younger brother

982
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,990
who has been sick often since he was little.

983
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,830
I just wanted to

984
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,660
lighten the financial burden on my family.

985
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,810
A teacher

986
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,270
can achieve success

987
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,730
through years of experience,

988
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,980
but I hold myself to a different standard:

989
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,640
effective teaching methods.

990
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,640
Mr. Gao,

991
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,750
given the limited educational resources

992
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,950
here in the oilfield,

993
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,710
what methods

994
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,100
can be truly effective?

995
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,550
That's right. What are they?

996
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,290
Let the kids know

997
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,080
the meaning of learning.

998
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,760
Actually, studying

999
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,930
is incredibly dull

1000
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,870
and boring.

1001
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,460
It's hard.

1002
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,720
But it's also

1003
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,840
one of the few things in this world

1004
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,550
where, if you invest effort,

1005
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,110
you can see results.

1006
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,860
It's fair

1007
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,510
and valuable.

1008
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,510
The meaning of learning

1009
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,470
is not about getting perfect scores

1010
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,730
or being ranked first.

1011
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,110
It's about

1012
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,210
that learning allows you to acquire knowledge and wisdom,

1013
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,590
to abandon your ignorance and stubbornness,

1014
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,860
and to see that this world

1015
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,090
is full of diversity.

1016
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,920
As teachers and parents,

1017
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,690
we can't

1018
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,000
just push our children

1019
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,660
to study.

1020
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,380
Instead, we should

1021
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,430
make accompanying them in learning

1022
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,690
a part of their growth.

1023
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,870
We should clarify their dreams,

1024
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,140
understand their hopes for the future,

1025
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,080
find the directions of their lives with them,

1026
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,050
and guide them

1027
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,790
step by step

1028
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,700
toward where they want to go.

1029
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,290
We were all once children,

1030
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,050
but let's not forget

1031
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,910
the essence of what a child is.

1032
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:55,930
A child's growth

1033
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,390
shouldn't only revolve around homework and exams,

1034
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,470
nor should it just be

1035
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,630
about indulgence

1036
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,760
and being pampered.

1037
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,550
Figuring out

1038
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,980
what kind of person they want to become

1039
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,910
is also a crucial lesson in their growth.

1040
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,040
But Mr. Gao,

1041
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,620
the test results

1042
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,880
are the standard for evaluation, aren't they?

1043
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,160
Right? -Right.

1044
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,960
We can only say that it's one of the standards.

1045
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,550
I know you are here today

1046
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,030
to see your children's

1047
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,880
exam results.

1048
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,130
That's right.

1049
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,810
But I don't intend to announce them.

1050
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:28,880
One exam

1051
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,270
doesn't mean anything.

1052
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,330
Rankings are meaningless.

1053
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,820
For someone to come in first,

1054
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,550
someone else must come in last.

1055
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,510
But the child who comes in last

1056
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,640
still deserves to have their own life.

1057
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,720
Growth is growth.

1058
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,950
It doesn't mean success.

1059
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,680
They are two different things,

1060
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,120
yet we often mistake them for being the same.

1061
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,780
For the students who didn't do well this time,

1062
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,310
I won't let them off easily.

1063
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,260
I won't go easy on them.

1064
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,060
This is my job

1065
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,980
and my duty.

1066
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,860
But I hope that when they go home,

1067
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,510
they feel relaxed and happy.

1068
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,990
Because there has to be a place

1069
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,530
where they can let go

1070
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,450
of all the burdens of this world.

1071
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,050
In school,

1072
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:06,820
they are students.

1073
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,050
They can't be late or leave early,

1074
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:12,110
and they have to give their best effort to learn.

1075
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,470
But when they get home,

1076
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,070
they are your children.

1077
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,080
So, as children,

1078
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,190
they should have

1079
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,220
the nature and the rights of a child.

1080
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,600
I think

1081
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,760
that not all teachers are qualified,

1082
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,370
and

1083
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,270
so are parents.

1084
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,670
So, I hope

1085
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,010
that we can trust each other.

1086
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,110
Please trust me.

1087
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,530
I will be a good teacher

1088
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,380
and take responsibility for your children.

1089
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,680
And I trust that you

1090
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,220
will be good parents

1091
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,450
and treat my students well.

1092
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,620
Thank you, all parents,

1093
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,650
for attending the parent-teacher meeting of Grade 11, Class 1.

1094
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:57,210
That's all for today's meeting.

1095
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,700
[trust each other; achieve each other]

1096
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,110
We all found out much later

1097
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,570
that this particular parent-teacher meeting

1098
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,200
would turn out to be like this.

1099
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,560
That was also our first time to encounter a parent-teacher meeting

1100
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,630
where no exam papers were handed out

1101
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,430
and no rankings were announced.

1102
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,730
Parent-teacher meetings were always a nightmare

1103
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:25,930
when we were kids.

1104
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,990
You never knew

1105
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,360
what the teacher would say to your parents,

1106
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,620
because none of us were

1107
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,340
the kind of kids

1108
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,740
who never made mistakes.

1109
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,930
Gao Feiyang

1110
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,620
had a certain magic about him.

1111
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,860
He could always make you realize, in the coolest way,

1112
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,260
that there's another way to look at things.

1113
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,670
He could tell you those grand principles

1114
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:45,210
in a gentle and touching way.

1115
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:46,850
Gao Feiyang became

1116
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:47,620
the biggest backer

1117
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,790
of our kids.

1118
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,180
We were willing to trust him

1119
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:52,390
because we knew

1120
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,970
he cared about us deeply.

1121
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,530
But we were also all terrified of him.

1122
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:58,050
We were afraid

1123
