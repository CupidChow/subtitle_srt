00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,280
Is 20 enough?

198
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,550
Be careful.

199
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,110
What's wrong with him?

200
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,170
Is he deaf-mute?

201
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,080
It can't be.

202
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,300
Didn't he send us

203
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,400
to the bridge?

204
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,660
Maybe...

205
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,690
He can hear you but can't speak.

206
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,750
Stop nagging, sisters.

207
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,960
If I don't get to the hospital,

208
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,510
I'm doomed.

209
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,550
Hold him.

210
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,250
I'll carry you.

211
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,260
No need. No need.

212
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,940
I can still hold on...

213
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,630
What happened?

214
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,360
Why's your face so swollen?

215
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,510
Were you hit by a car?

216
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,740
Oh no.

What's wrong?

224
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,910
Someone just called

225
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,150
to say Li Si was hit by a car.

[Oilfield Staff Hospital]

232
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:25,750
He's fine.

233
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,350
Calm down

234
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:26,870
and listen.

235
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,860
He was just stung by a hornet.

236
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,010
Swelling for a short period

237
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,090
is normal.

238
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,770
He'll be fine.

239
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,060
What do you mean he's fine?

240
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,820
How is he fine?

241
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,670
This will

242
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,050
affect his future.

243
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,830
My son is only 17 years old.

244
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,390
If he can't get married

245
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,240
and have children,

246
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,110
what should I do?

247
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:44,870
It's okay.

248
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,870
Calm down.

249
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,110
The wound area

250
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,480
is a little sensitive.

251
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,540
It hurts,

252
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,790
but he's fine.

253
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,870
It won't affect

254
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,570
his marriage and conception plans.

255
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,900
Can you guarantee that?

256
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,430
All I saw you doing was just

257
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,460
disinfecting it.

258
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,010
It...

259
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,920
It's so swollen.

260
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,400
It's been hours,

261
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,060
but the swelling hasn't gone down.

262
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,650
My son is only 17 years old.

263
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,790
What if it affects him

264
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,700
getting married and having babies?

265
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,510
It's all my fault!

266
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,950
If I hadn't

267
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,870
urged you to go to Hong Kong,

268
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,020
Li Si wouldn't have been hurt.

269
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,510
If it really affects him

270
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,870
getting married and having babies,

271
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,240
what should I do?

272
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,810
I'm so guilty!

273
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,030
It's okay. It's okay.

274
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,630
Didn't the doctor say it's fine?

275
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,470
Don’t think too much.

276
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,290
What if he gets worse?

277
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,550
Cheng Yaya.

278
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,490
Comfort your sister.

279
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,740
She's so upset.

280
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,580
Don't cry.

281
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,990
Si is fine.

282
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,390
Just an external injury.

283
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,240
Then why did you make it

284
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,290
sound so serious?

285
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,000
I was just teasing him.

286
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,630
Really?

287
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,640
Yes.

288
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,920
Luckily, nothing happened.

289
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,350
What'd we do if something

290
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,010
went wrong?

291
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:21,860
Kids nowadays

292
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,990
are so bold.

293
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,810
How dare they run away together?

294
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,520
Yes, w-well...

295
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,020
We were negligent.

296
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,960
Who would've

297
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,090
expected this?

298
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,180
They even tried to fool me.

299
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,590
I knew something was off

300
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,540
when I saw their bags.

301
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,030
They've even

302
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,180
bought their train tickets.

303
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,040
Isn't it scary?

304
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,670
Yes, Principal.

305
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,930
It's all our fault. Us parents.

306
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,730
We

307
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,870
have been

308
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,790
focused on

309
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,860
the frivolous stuff

310
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,470
of the performance.

311
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,380
That's why our kids

312
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,580
took advantage of it.

313
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,640
Why don't you come to my office

314
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,730
for some tea?

315
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,750
Sure.

316
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,720
Take a look

317
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,470
at my ear.

318
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,650
I just got it pierced.

319
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,780
It seems to be inflamed again.

320
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,990
No problem.

321
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,040
They told me many times

322
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,060
about going to Shenzhen to find Tao.

323
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,190
Listen.

324
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,050
I understand.

325
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,960
It must be Min.

326
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,630
It must be Min's idea

327
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,790
to take them there.

328
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,350
Cheng Miaomiao

329
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,750
must've had the idea first.

330
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,430
She's been wanting

331
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,890
to run away since forever.

332
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,110
I'm sure

333
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,630
she planned this long ago.

334
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,380
She must've brainwashed Yaya.

335
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,030
I'll

336
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:18,720
teach them

337
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,870
a huge lesson tonight.

338
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,280
Calm down.

339
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:21,950
They're all...

340
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,390
Over there.

341
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:22,920
This way.

342
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,150
Young man.

343
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,090
Young man?

344
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,630
What's wrong with you?

345
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,470
Examine him again.

346
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:47,870
Okay.

347
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,330
He can't have any sequelae.

348
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,320
Calm down. Calm down.

349
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,350
It shouldn't be a big problem.

350
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,750
Good boy, stop sleeping.

351
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,830
Son.

352
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,380
The director is here. Hurry.

353
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:56,830
How is it?

354
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,300
Get up and let him take a look.

355
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,850
Let the director check...

356
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,950
Wait. Careful.

357
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,470
Careful.

358
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,080
What is this?

359
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,640
Careful.

360
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,910
Let the director examine you again.

361
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,270
Here.

362
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,110
Examine him again.

363
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,840
Examine what?

364
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,830
Didn't he just do it?

365
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,390
This is the director.

366
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,150
He's finally free.

367
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,540
No way. Even if it's the principal!

368
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,130
If everyone

369
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:11,960
looks at it,

370
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,800
how can I live?

371
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,170
Be good.

372
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,300
No, I want to go home.

373
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,120
Don't move.

374
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,470
The wound will get worse.

375
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,490
Don't touch it!

376
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,120
Young man, don't be nervous.

377
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:19,910
Dr. Liu

378
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,150
told me everything.

379
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,170
Relax. Relax.

380
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,960
Let's check

381
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:23,750
the wound again

382
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,840
to reassure your mom.

383
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,250
Yes.

384
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,480
Son, be good.

385
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,390
Relax. Relax.

386
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,380
Just a look.

387
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,270
It won't hurt.

388
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,030
Come on.

389
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,180
I'm here.

390
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,840
Please look away.

391
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,000
Please excuse us.

392
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,040
Thank you.

393
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,390
I'll take a look.

394
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,290
I'll just take a look.

395
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,980
Okay.

396
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,240
It's okay. It's okay.

Mom! Mom! Mom!

402
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,230
Stop hitting him!

403
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,390
Stop hitting me, Mom.

404
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,270
Listen to me.

405
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,830
It's not what you think.

406
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,750
You were plotting

407
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,230
behind my back,

408
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:00,750
right?

409
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,230
No, no, no.

410
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,560
It's not what you think.

411
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:03,590
Stop there!

412
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,990
Wait.

413
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:04,870
How dare you run?

Mom.

415
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,170
How dare you run?

416
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:06,870
Mom, you...

417
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,710
Don't hit my brother.

418
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,470
It has nothing to do with him.

419

-It’s not what you think.
-If I don’t beat you up today...

420

Let me explain.

421
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,180
I'll let the Cheng family down.

It's really not what you think.

424
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,830
Explain what?

425
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,830
What's there to explain?

426
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,990
Stop hitting him!

427
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,510
Yang Tao, listen.

428
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,140
You're mainly

429
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,430
responsible for this.

430
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,630
You were instigating them!

431
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,750
Min is young and immature.

432
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,470

Do you still respect your parents?

435
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,350
You don't care about our family

at all!

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,890

Honey, you're here.

00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,240
You're capable now, huh?

440
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,790
What do you mean?

Where is the tire?

443
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,780
What tire?

444
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,420
Where is it?

Seriously! It's just a stupid tire!

464
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,070
Is it more important

465
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:51,780
than our lives?

466
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,320
What about what he did?

Have you?

00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,600
Since he was a kid,

00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,230

00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,790
my dad wanted to

501
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,840
send me to the police.

502
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
Can I forgive him?

503
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,390
I must stay at

this bridge cave till daybreak,

505
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,290
then I'll catch a train.

I must run away from home!

00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,320
How

509
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,280
serious is your injury?

510
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,140
Yeah, Si.

511
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,440
Let us see your wound.

512
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,360
Go away!

513
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:26,870
What's there to look at?

514
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,000
What's there to look at?

515
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,590

516
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,750

517
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,780
is all gone!

518
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,150
Listen.

519
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,570
It's not about how serious it is,

520
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,840
but that it was humiliating.

521
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,140
Now, the entire Linqi Oilfield

522
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,030
knows I'm injured

523
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:43,810
thanks to my mom's yelling.

524
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,340
How can I hold my head up now?

525
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,240
If they don't find you tonight,

526
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,720
they'll call the police tomorrow.

527
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,830
With the police chasing you,

528
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,560
it'd be a different situation.

529
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,940
Darling.

530
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,650
I ran away from home,

531
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,490
sold my family's car tire,

532
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,640
and was stung by a bee while peeing.

533
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,500
How've I offended the police?

534
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,920
I'm not afraid of anyone!

535
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,560
Yaya.

536
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,800
Protect me this time.

537
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,790
Support me.

538
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,950
I don't trust your sister.

539
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,330
She betrayed me many times.

540
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,500
I only have you now.

541
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,510
Si.

542
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,810
Did you watch the news today?

543
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,230
Si's injury is

544
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,220
even on the news?

545
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,310
No.

546
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,270
The news today said

547
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,640
a wanted man

548
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,960
fled here.

549
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,270
Yuan Yong fled here?

550
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,720
Not Yuan Yong.

551
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,920
It’s a big case in Qu County.

552
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,950
They said it was a gang robbery.

553
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,050
He's on the run now.

554
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,070
He fled to our area?

555
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,920
I think so.

556
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,420
Gosh, Cheng.

557
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,780
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

558
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,430
Being out

559
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,090
in the middle of the night

560
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:50,920
is too dangerous.

561
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,680
Yes!

562
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,960
If it's a gang crime,

563
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,560
it must be quite a few of them.

564
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,950
Cheng.

565
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,580
Why don't we go home first?

566
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,500
You...

567
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,030
Si.

568
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,630
Ya...

569
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,880
We have to be brave

570
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,560
and fight against criminals.

571
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,750
But in this situation,

572
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,230
we are outnumbered.

573
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,290
So we've to

574
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,840
prepare for the battle.

575
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:15,930
How about this?

576
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,670
Hide in

577
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,790
this cave for now.

578
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,740
Just in case,

579
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,830
we'll get you some weapons

580
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,380
so you can defend yourself.

581
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,350
Yes, yes.

582
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,070

00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,950
Nothing went well.

775
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,350
My mom looks at me

776
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,110
with flames in her eyes.

777
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:44,870
I have lost

778
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,000
all say in my family.

779
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,600
Be content.

780
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,920
Yang came back

781
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,170
just for two days.

782
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,700
We didn't say a word.

783
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,180
I really wanted him to scold me.

784
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,330
A biological father

785
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,350
would scold you

786
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,440
or even beat you up.

787
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,060
But until he left,

788
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,440
he just ignored me.

789
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,880
He didn't even look at me.

790
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,260
Look at you.

791
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,660
You're upset you weren't

792
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,780
scolded or beat up?

793
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,070
I envy your status

794
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,170
in your family.

795
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,610
No one dares lecture you.

796
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,100
As if.

797
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,420
It's that no one cares.

798
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,340
Go on.

799
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,070
Let me see...

800
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,550
Don't look at me.

801
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,950
It's okay. Let him see.

802
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,260
What's wrong, Si?

803
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,720
Did the wound crack?

804
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,110
What crack?

805
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,400
Can you stop talking about my wound?

806
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,350
I'm fine.

807
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,200
I told you not to come,

808
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
but you insisted.

809
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,490
I'll stink if I didn't.

810
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,650
The nozzle is broken.

811
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,400
A bunch of men

812
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,930
were fighting for it naked.

813
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,340
What do you want to eat?

814
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,540
As usual.

815
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,470
Well,

816
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,280
why won't the bathhouse

817
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,770
make adjustments?

818
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,140
It only opens for three days a week.

819
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,240
It's nerve-racking.

820
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,100
It'd be nice if it were open daily.

821
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,100
I heard

822
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,080
they'll be installing solar water heaters

823
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,400
for households.

824
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,100
It's charged by the sun.

825
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,020
Installed in the bathroom.

826
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,330
We can shower every day then.

827
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,330
When is that?

828
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,340
I don't know.

829
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,670
What are you doing?

830
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,800
What are you doing?

831
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,040
Hey! What are you doing?

832
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:09,980
You...

833
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,360
A-A-Are you crazy?

834
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,510
Don't go too far!

835
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,560
-Are you crazy?
-Stop it!

836
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,670
Zhu Chao’s father?

837
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,730
How dare you!

838
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,470
I... I...

839
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,200
-Don’t look.
-Don’t look.

840
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,440
Take your stuff and go!

841
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,600
Let's go back.

842
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,300
Let's go.

843
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,850
I didn't see anything.

844
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:27,950
Did you see anything?

845
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:28,950
See what?

846
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,010
Did you hear Wei Fangyong?

847
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,950
Who?

848
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,130
Wei Xue's father.

849
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,980
A place of trouble.

850
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,790
Let's go.

851
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,420
Let’s go.

852
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:43,840
Miaomiao.

853
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,820
Miaomiao, wake up.

854
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,100
Wake up!

855
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,700
The steakhouse is open.

856
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,650
Let's go eat.

857
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:53,950
Let's go.

858
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:56,570
Come on!

859
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,490
Go out!

860
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,350
Okay.

861
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,370
I'll wait for you outside.

862
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,540
Close the door!

863
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,460
[Haoxianglai Steakhouse]

864
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:25,770
This ribeye.

865
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,160
Three portions.

866
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,420
And this,

867
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:29,480
and this.

868
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,310
I want all of this.

869
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,710
Okay, sir.

870
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,280
How do you want the steak cooked?

871
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,410
I want it all cooked.

872
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,540
I...

873
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,760
80% cooked.

874
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,030
Okay, sir.

875
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,480
We have the options of

876
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,530
70% and 90% cooked.

877
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,930
I suggest 70%.

878
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,570
Then I'll have 70%.

879
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,930
For all three of us.

880
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,700
Okay, please wait a moment.

881
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,350
Thank you.

882
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,900
Isn't 70% half-cooked?

883
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,080
Is it edible?

884
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,370
Half-cooked?

885
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,270
We'll have diarrhea.

886
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,510
Look at your ignorance.

887
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,300
Steaks...

888
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,750
are eaten half-cooked.

889
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,360
It's the vibe.

890
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,690
Your steaks are all here. Enjoy.

891
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,290
Thank you.

892
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:44,890
Come on.

893
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,050
Please enjoy.

894
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,930
I'll teach you.

895
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,610
Knife on the left; fork on the right.

896
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,520
Come on.

897
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,510
Fork it down.

898
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,410
Saw it.

899
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:16,960
Si.

900
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,540
Are we doing it wrong?

901
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,090
Everyone has their knife in their right hand.

902
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,300
They're wrong.

903
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,429
This knife...

904
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,110
The blade isn't sharp enough.

905
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,400
I can't cut it.

906
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,139
This isn't easy.

907
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,219
How about...

908
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,239
Waiter.

909
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,340
Three pairs of chopsticks.

910
00:34:59,210 --> 00:34:59,870
Yummy.

911
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,890
What are you doing here alone?

912
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,230
Dad.

913
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,560
I'm fine. I just pulled a muscle.

914
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,470
Sit there.

915
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,190
Gosh.

916
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,350
How did I pull a muscle?

917
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,850
Move the box onto the bike.

918
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,710
Mr. Zhang will take it later.

919
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,340
Okay.

920
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,320
I'll go.

921
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,230
Put it on top?

922
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,090
It's heavy.

923
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,050
Dad, are you okay?

924
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,370
I'm okay. I'm okay.

925
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,190
You have white hair.

926
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,180
I'll pluck it for you.

927
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,510
Don't... Don't pluck it.

928
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,740
I'm full of white hair.

929
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,420
I'd be bald

930
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,700
if you pluck them all.

931
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,550
Why were you sitting here alone?

932
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,680
What's on your mind?

933
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,660
I just think...

934
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,850
growing up is boring.

935
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,160
Are you unhappy?

936
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,030
More and more unhappy.

937
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,870
I used to think

938
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,190
I'm quite capable.

939
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,740
Now I think...

940
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,660
I can't do anything well.

941
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,640
Are you like this too?

942
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,980
How are we the same?

943
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,730
Well, as your father,

944
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,720
I feel the same.

945
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:02,910
Sometimes I think

946
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,390
I'm pretty capable.

947
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,870
You do whatever

948
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,880
I tell you to.

949
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:08,330
Your brother does

950
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,620
whatever I tell him to.

951
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:10,590
But sometimes,

952
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,760
I think I can't

953
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,610
do anything well.

954
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:14,660
You two never

955
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,690
do as you're told.

956
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,130
It's normal

957
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,210
to feel differently.

958
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,710
The only thing

959
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,550
that's constant in this world

960
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,850
is change.

961
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,980
You once asked me

962
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,810
why I've stayed in this oil base

963
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,770
for such a long time,

964
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,710
that it's boring, right?

965
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,000
Actually,

966
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,530
I asked myself that before.

967
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,700
But then,

968
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,630
I gradually

969
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,860
accepted it.

970
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:51,960
Why?

971
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,080
Because I have your mom,

972
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,630
you,

973
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,760
your brother,

974
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,170
and this home.

975
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:01,780
Miaomiao.

976
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,260
You've

977
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,820
never been one

978
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,660
to follow the rules.

979
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,340
You have a lot of ideas.

980
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,270
You're really smart

981
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,700
and always

982
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,730
so energetic.

983
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,340
You want to do this today

984
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,590
and do that tomorrow.

985
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,330
Actually,

986
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,240
you still haven't figured out

987
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,740
what you want to do.

988
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,330
So when you succeed,

989
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,730
you're happy.

990
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,230
When you don't,

991
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,310
you're unhappy.

992
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,360
Right?

993
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:37,060
This is really similar

994
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,720
to your mom when she was young.

995
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,240
I found the source.

996
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,040
I got it from my mom.

997
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,850
And your mom...

998
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,610
When she was your age,

999
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,280
she struggled even more.

1000
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,450
She had

1001
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,620
800 dreams.

1002
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,780
None of them came true.

1003
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,420
Your mom was more agonized

1004
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,510
than you are now.

1005
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,700
Look at her now.

1006
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,020
Zero agony.

1007
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,220
She just nags all the time

1008
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,140
and acts domineeringly at home.

1009
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,100
You spoiled her.

1010
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,450
She said to go out

1011
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:09,440
to have a look

1012
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,270
and carve a path in society.

1013
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,310
But she doesn't support me in anything.

1014
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,070
She also said

1015
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,190
I'm never serious about anything.

1016
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:17,910
I think adults

1017
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,340
are also problematic.

1018
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,410
Look

1019
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,590
at Li Si.

1020
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:22,820
Li Si's dad

1021
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,580
always says he's useless.

1022
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,080
Hu's mom

1023
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,780
emotionally blackmails him.

1024
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,820
My mom...

1025
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,040
is so uncultured.

1026
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,640
Don't say that about your mom.

1027
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,210
Sorry, sorry.

1028
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,100
We adults

1029
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,610
have all been young

1030
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,720
like you.

1031
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,680
So we know where the pits

1032
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,050
and ditches are

1033
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,270
as you grow up.

1034
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,500
We just want to

1035
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,610
inform you quickly

1036
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,130
because we love you.

1037
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,710
Right?

1038
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,740
But

1039
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,580
you

1040
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,820
16 or 17 year olds

1041
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,090
don't believe us.

1042
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,780
Even if we fill up

1043
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:58,820
the pit for you,

1044
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,180
you must dig it open

1045
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,020
to see for yourself if it's a pit.

1046
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,970
No, no, no.

1047
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,540
I didn't mean that.

1048
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,080
Actually, it's normal.

1049
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,290
We were like this when we were young too.

1050
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,640
Then tell me...

1051
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,200
how can a dream...

1052
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,500
come true?

1053
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,380
All my life,

1054
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,700
I've never fulfilled any great dream.

1055
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,270
But if you're talking about wishes,

1056
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,030
I had

1057
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,900
a small wish of mine come true.

1058
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,360
When I was 14,

1059
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,820
I watched a Soviet movie.

1060
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,340
It was set in

1061
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,300
the European battlefield during World War II,

1062
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,980
where a young doctor

1063
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,080
saved many people.

1064
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,980
After watching the movie,

1065
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,220
I told your grandpa

1066
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:45,810
that

1067
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:48,140
I wanted to be a doctor.

1068
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,010
I wanted to be like him

1069
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,580
and save people.

1070
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,870
That made your grandpa very happy.

1071
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,550
Actually, back then,

1072
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,940
I just thought

1073
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,170
doctors looked cool

1074
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,260
in white coats.

1075
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:03,130
It was for this white coat

1076
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,850
that I learned medicine...

1077
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,970
There are mosquitoes.

1078
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,340
Let's take a walk.

1079
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,060
Let's take a walk.

1080
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:09,630
Later...

1081
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,990
-Is your back okay?
-I should move around.

1082
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,520
I think I'm fine now.

1083
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:15,520
Where were we?

1084
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,930
Doctor. Becoming a doctor.

1085
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,140
Later,

1086
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,010
I joined the army.

1087
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,060
I thought I'd

1088
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,210
broaden my horizon

1089
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,820
in the great rivers and mountains

1090
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,460
of our motherland.

1091
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:29,450
But after

1092
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:30,200
leaving the army,

1093
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,350
I barely got around

1094
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,030
and ended up in this oilfield.

1095
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,980
Anyway, dreams

1096
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,450
are

1097
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,980
serious things in life.

1098
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,570
It's not like

1099
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,730
the body's metabolism.

1100
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:42,620
Things aren't

1101
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,220
automatic like metabolism.

1102
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,630
Focus on a goal.

1103
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:46,970
Then even if you fail,

1104
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,840
as long as you persist in it,

1105
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,260
opportunities will arise.

1106
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,190
Then you must muster all your might

1107
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,510
and charge forward

1108
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,290
in your best state.

1109
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,480
Charge forward

1110
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,570
until the dream comes true.

1111
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,400
Got it?

1112
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,600
Dream!

1113
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,420
I'm coming!

1114
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,750
There's a ditch there!

1115
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,050
See? What did I say?

1116
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,320
Did you sprain your ankle?

1117
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,660
It'd take us a long time

1118
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,940
to realize

1119
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,660
there aren't

1120
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,820
60% and 80% cooked steaks,

1121
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,570
and that forks go on the left

1122
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,140
and knives on the right.

1123
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,700
We didn't get to Hong Kong in the end.

1124
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,930
We failed to shine in

1125
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,150
the performance too.

1126
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,540
But

1127
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,530
we've grown up.

1128
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:32,800
From bathing together

1129
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,370
in the bathhouse

1130
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,660
to realizing men and women are different,

1131
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,110
we stumbled in our youth.

1132
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,770
It'd be far into the future

1133
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,580
that we'd witness

1134
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,180
the beauty around the world.

1135
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:49,230
We'd also learn a lot about dining etiquette

1136
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,260
and become respectable adults.

1137
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,230
But we'd realize

1138
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,260
nothing is more interesting

1139
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,150
and livelier

1140
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:59,090
than youth.
