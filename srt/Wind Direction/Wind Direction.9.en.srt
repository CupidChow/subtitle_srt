Madam.

166
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,170
What kind of dog bit her?

167
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,990
A stray or a pet?

168
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,820
If it's rabies,

169
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,130
it's untreatable.

170
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,950
You're still 30 yuan short.

171
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,770
I really don't have money.

172
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,150
Where are your parents?

173

Get them here quickly.

can you give my sister an injection first?

175
00:10:58,770 --> 00:10:59,690
Please.

176

No,

I really can't help you.

179
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,510
Go and borrow money from others.

180
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,540
Okay, I'll go borrow it now.

181

What happened?

185

Did you get bitten?

186
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,210
You need an injection if you got bitten.

187
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,090
You can't ignore it.

188
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,640
It's okay. I don't need it.

189
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,260
It's okay. We'll go home after the injection.

190
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:41,920
Don't cry.

191
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,420
Be good, Zi.

192
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,350
Don't let her eat

Don't let the wound touch water.

195
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,190
Come to the hospital if anything happens.

196
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,510
Okay, thank you.

197
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,160
Let's go home.

198
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,270
She's bitten by a dog and didn't get an injection.

199
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,530
If something happens,

200
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,790
it'll be serious.

201
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,000
She had no money to pay just now

202
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,600
and begged me for a long time.

203
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,390
Isn't she

204
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,030
the scammer's daughter?

205
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,110
You're right.

206
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,840
Both of them are surnamed Yuan.

207
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,790
So why does the retribution

208
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,230
fall on his daughter?

209
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,550
Ying, where is the girl?

210
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,670
Yaya.

211
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,070
She left.

212
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,390
Thank you.

213
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,470
Zi, it's okay now.

214
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,480
We're done with the injection.

215
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,480
Let's go home now.

216
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,020
It won't hurt anymore.

217
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,650
We've finished the injection.

218
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,910
It won't hurt anymore.

219
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,940
Yuan Shanqing.

220
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,110
Come, let's go for the injection.

221
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,080
It's okay.

222
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,390
I'm sorry.

223
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,870
How old are you?

224
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,600
Can you have some common sense?

225
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,630
Do you know that people die

226
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,630
can be fatal?

227
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,150
I don't want to owe money anymore.

228
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,750
You've already borrowed it.

229
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,210
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

230
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,150
I... I mean,

231
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,290
you've borrowed the money anyway.

232
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,690
You can borrow some more.

233
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:21,630
You can't

234
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,090
treat your body like this.

235
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,550
Besides, I've paid the money,

236
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,230
and it can’t be refunded.

237
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,230
Cheng Yaya.

238
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,010
Dad.

239
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,720
Such a deep wound.

240
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,670
It doesn't hurt?

241
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,110
Don't let the kid see this.

242
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,830
Turn around.

243
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,350
Okay.

244
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,710
You like bear?

245
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,440
You must pay attention

246
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,030
to your arm wound.

247
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:17,810
Don't wet it,

248
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,240
or it might get infected.

249
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,450
Also,

250
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,590
avoid any strenuous exercise

251
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,590
with your arm.

252
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,250
Thank you.

253
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,950
Thank you.

254
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,100
Well,

255
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,230
I'll pay you back soon.

256
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,270
I'll withdraw the money tomorrow.

257
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,730
No, that's not important.

258
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,830
You must remember

259
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,830
the time for the next few injections.

260
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,830
Don't forget.

261
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:39,450
Okay.

262
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,530
Come.

263
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,030
Let's go home.

264
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,290
Be careful.

265
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,270
Did you borrow money from me

266
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,630
just to help her?

267
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,710
Kindness is admirable.

268
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:04,890
I won't dedcut it

269
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,480
from your pocket money.

270
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,870
Thank you, Dad.

271
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,830
She's a girl and injured,

272
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,200
carrying her sister

273
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,280
home so late.

274
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,650
What should you do as a gentleman?

275
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,860
Send her home.

276
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,290
Yuan Shanqing.

277
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,090
Yuan Shanqing.

278
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:26,990
Is it fun?

279
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,380
What's her name?

280
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,160
Zi.

281
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,830
Yuan Shanzi.

282
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,010
Yuan Shanzi.

283
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,950
Nice name.

284
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,230
Yuan Shanzi.

285
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,960
I didn't expect

286
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,620
you have such a little sister.

287
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,450
Are we almost there?

288
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,800
Just ahead.

289
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,840
Give her to me.

290
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,550
It's okay.

291
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,720
We're almost there.

292
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,270
Let's go.

293
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,820
Yuan Shanzi.

294
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,990
Why do you have to ask this?

295
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,690
Would your dad tell you this?

296
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,960
I've been criticized in the class.

297
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,470
I have to ask him when he comes back.

298
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,030
How do you plan to ask him?

299
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,070
How?

300
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,660
Who are you calling at this hour?

301
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,440
You don't study.

302
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,810
Let me see if it's Li Si.

303
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,550
Li Si,

304
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,440
have you finished your homework?

305
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,990
Why are you staring at me?

306
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,150
Drinking soda again?

307
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,210
Why is it so good to drink that stuff?

308
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,750
You don't have anything serious to do.

309
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,270
What do you mean?

310
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,790
I've studied at school all day.

311
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,590
Isn't that serious?

312
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,030
Yes, you are at school,

313
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,790
but your mind is miles away.

314
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,390
I know you too well.

315
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,430
Go back to your room and study.

316
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,240
Put it down.

317
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,630
Put it down.

318
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:55,870
Daiyu.

319
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,510
Why are you making the sound?

320
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,040
I'm talking to you.

321
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,390
Enough.

322
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,640
The whole neighborhood can hear you yelling.

323
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,280
You...

324
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,319
It's late.

325
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,900
Don't be mad.

326
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,829
I've had enough during the day.

327
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:11,670
Listen,

328
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,150
she doesn't study at night,

329
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,609
just holding a soda bottle

330
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,190
and chatting

331
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,020
on the phone.

332
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,619
She'll keep talking back when I say something.

333
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,950
Aren't you on duty?

334
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,839
Why are you back?

335
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,839
I came back to get a reference book.

336
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,839
Why are you going back?

337
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,750
Who will go to the hospital at night?

338
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,550
Don't go back.

339
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,870
What time is it?

340
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,110
It's so late.

341
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,840
Why hasn't Yaya come back yet?

342
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,150
Yaya just ran into a classmate

343
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,070
at the hospital

344
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,400
and they left together.

345
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,020
What classmate?

346
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,050
Is it a boy or a girl?

347
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:40,850
A girl.

348
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,140
Who is the girl?

349
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,990
How would I know?

350
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,470
Everyone here

351
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,350
knows the way.

352
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,590
Why go with her?

353
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,810
I'm asking you.

354
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,750
Why are you

355
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,950
so concerned about him?

356
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,750
He's my son. Of course I'm concerned.

357
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,310
You...

358
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,910
How can you be a dad like this?

359
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,980
Seriously.

360
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,800
Look at that.

361
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,090
Let's go home.

362
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,310
What is it?

363
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,220
Good girl.

364
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,090
Thank you for today.

365
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,280
You're welcome.

366
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,810
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

367
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,260
[Scammer! Screw you! Pay back!]

368
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,500
No rush.

369
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,560
Go back now.

370
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,780
Zi, come here.

371
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,590
What happened...

372
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,910
Nothing.

373
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,430
I came out in a hurry

374
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,510
and didn't clean up.

375
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,430
Go back now.

376
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,090
Bye!

377
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,250
-Okay.
-Let's go, Zi.

378
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,050
Let's go home.

379
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:20,270
[Scammer! Go die!]

380
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,230
Tell me,

381
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,160
why did you fire

382
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
Liu Junbao's dad?

383
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,590
Do I need to report it to you?

384
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,150
You're just a kid.

385
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,510
What does it have to do with you?

386
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,870
Why not?

387
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,460
I'm upholding justice.

388
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,810
Let me tell you,

389
00:19:58,810 --> 00:19:59,830
in the oil field's...

390
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,510
in the oil field's history,

391
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,070
they've never fired anyone.

392
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,110
If you say he stole oil,

393
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,790
you need evidence.

394
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,330
You can't wrongfully accuse people.

395
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,150
Are you with the police

396
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,680
or the investigation team?

397
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:08,790
Li Si,

398
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,250
remember,

399
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,070
use your spare time

400
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,830
to study,

401
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,510
got it?

402
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,960
Don't worry about adult affairs.

403
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,520
How can I not worry?

404
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,590
The whole class is criticizing me.

405
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,710
They say Liu Junbao's dad

406
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,590
offended you before.

407
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,650
You're the leader now,

408
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,390
using your power for personal revenge.

409
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,430
It's affecting

410
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,550
my reputation in class.

411
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,230
What reputation do you have?

412
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,590
Revenge?

413
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,630
Tell me who said it.

414
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,760
I'll go talk to them.

415
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,200
Stop acting all high and mighty,

416
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,050
Director Li.

417
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,270
Do more good deeds

418
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,910
instead of holding me back.

419
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,950
[Linqi Oilfield No. 2 High School]

420
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,580
Morning, Si.

421
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,330
Morning.

422
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,800
What's wrong?

423
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,150
What's wrong?

424
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,950
It's obvious he's been beaten by his dad.

425
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,740
I told you not to ask, but you didn't listen.

426
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,060
Can't I ask?

427
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,270
How could he hit me?

428
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,880
You're just a blabbermouth.

429
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,740
I'm speaking out for justice.

430
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,560
Can't you just leave it?

431
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,140
Do more exercises,

432
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,110
read books

433
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,550
and worry about yourself.

434
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,790
With your grades,

435
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,470
I'm so worried.

436
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,830
You're worried

437
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,670
about my grades?

438
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,890
How can I learn?

439
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,200
There are always things disturbing me.

440
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,400
Liu Junbao, let's be clear.

441
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,630
I'm in a bad mood today.

442
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,870
Your dad's issue has nothing to do with me.

443
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,130
Don't take it out on me.

444
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:53,590
Si,

445
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,020
I know it has nothing to do with you.

446
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,780
I just want to ask you a favor.

447
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,910
What can I do for you?

448
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,780
Can you tell your dad

449
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,310
not to fire my dad for now?

450
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,110
My dad was forced by them.

451
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,650
Ask them to investigate further.

452
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,210
It won't help even if I tell him.

453
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,710
It's the factory leader's

454
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,240
decision.

455
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,550
My dad is just a small director

456
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,870
with limited power.

457
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,630
But

458
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,190
your dad is still a leader.

459
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,710
His words will be helpful.

460
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,310
Yesterday, I got beaten at night

461
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,350
for your dad's issue.

462
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,870
My back is bruised now.

463
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,340
Junbao,

464
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,900
he really can't help you.

465
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,750
Besides,

466
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,950
his father can't decide on this

467
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,050
alone.

468
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,160
Junbao,

469
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,710
my dad said last night

470
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,950
it was the factory leader's decision.

471
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,510
It wasn't his choice

472
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,910
to fire your dad.

473
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,150
Of course.

474
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,010
His dad can't make the decision.

475
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,990
The position wasn't even

476
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,630
won by his dad himself.

477
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,080
What decision can he make?

478
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,520
Now that he's in charge,

479
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,120
he starts taking revenge.

480
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,260
What's the point?

481
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,760
Wei Xue, say that again.

482
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:57,870
What's a big deal

483
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,230
of being a leader?

484
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,110
You're just like your dad.

485
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,870
Your dad bullies employees,

486
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,950
and you bully classmates.

487
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,260
Who's bullying classmates?

488
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,830
Come on.

489
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,830
What does it have to do with Li Si?

490
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,790
Why not?

491
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,710
Will you stop it?

492
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,470
I'm gonna beat you up.

493
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,990
Si, Si, Si.

494
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,270
Si, please.

495
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,270
My dad is the only employee in our family.

496
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,470
If he really offended your family,

497
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,750
I'll apologize on his behalf.

498
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,270
Get up.

499
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,030
If he loses his job,

500
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,870
my whole family has to leave.

501
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,570
I can't go to school here anymore.

502
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,730
I'm begging you.

503
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:25,790
Get up.

504
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,680
Don't touch me.

505
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:27,920
Bao,

506
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,320
I'm begging you too.

507
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,460
I'll say it again.

508
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,310
This has nothing to do with my family.

509
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,670
I beg you.

510
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,710
Bao, I'll kowtow to you.

511
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,790
Me too.

512
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,510
I'll kowtow to you.

513
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,310
What are you doing?

514
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,150
Aren't you ashamed?

515
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:38,990
Get up.

516
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,910
Zhu Chao! Zhu Chao!

517
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:41,670
Where is Zhu Chao?

518
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,190
Get up.

519
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:42,590
Coming.

520
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,590
You're the class monitor.

521
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,510
Will you handle it?

522
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,480
Yes. Come on.

523
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,550
-Get up.
-What…

524
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,710
What's going on here?

525
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,720
Are you worshipping the heavens?

526
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,630
Zhu Chao!

527
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,000
Get up, both of you.

528
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,110
Get up.

529
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,490
Or I'll report this to the teacher.

530
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,820
Come on, get up.

531
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,470
You'd be in trouble if Gao Feiyang came.

532
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,200
Gao Feiyang.

533
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:58,980
Li Si.

534
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,030
Forget it.

535
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:01,940
You shouldn't have expected anything

536
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,180
from someone like him.

537
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:03,790
Exactly.

538
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,130
People like him don't have sympathy.

539
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:05,830
Stop looking.

540
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,090
-Sit down and go to class.
-Stop looking.

541
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,500
The author conveys emotions through scenery,

542
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,510
combining colorful natural elements

543
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,630
with a passion

544
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,790
for our country

545
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,790
and life,

546
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,770
which inspires progress.

547
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,990
Alright, students.

548
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:42,750
This article can be

549
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,070
divided into four parts.

550
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,230
Your homework

551
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,640
is to summarize each part

552
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,830
in one sentence.

553
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,760
Class dismissed.

554
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,300
Stand up.

555
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,390
See you, Sir.

556
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,010
Cheng,

557
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,780
Yuan Yong's child hasn't shown up all morning.

558
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,980
Did she drop out?

559
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,030
Why would she

560
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:07,950
drop out?

561
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,830
I got some news yesterday.

562
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,070
Last night,

563
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,510
He Erbo from our neighberhood

564
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,570
went to Yuan Shanqing's house to collect debts.

565
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,590
Yuan Shanqing

566
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,830
went crazy

567
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,450
and chased them with a knife.

568
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,560
I didn't expect her to be so crazy.

569
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,830
I think

570
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,850
something is wrong with her brain.

571
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,120
Cheng, where are you going?

572
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,030
Do I need your permission

573
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,290
need your permission?

574
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,470
Well,

575
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,020
why is he angry?

576
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,750
Could it be that Cheng

577
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,550
has a crush on Yuan Yong's child?

578
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,700
Forget it.

579
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,830
Who would dare to have a crush on her?

580
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,300
Then why?

581
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:58,870
In all these years,

582
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,870
I've never seen him

583
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,470
stay silent for two classes.

584
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,470
I'm not going home for lunch.

585
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,490
Tell Mom and Dad for me.

586
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,620
Where are you going?

587
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,930
Where is Li Si going?

588
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,060
He's not going home?

589
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,270
Me neither.

590
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,130
Go to my house and tell my parents.

591
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,750
Both of you.

592
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,780
I also don't want to go home.

593
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,570
Si, where are you going?

594
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,270
I'm talking to you. Can't you hear?

595
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,160
Stop it. I'm upset.

596
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,910
What's the point?

597
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,310
It has nothing to do with you.

598
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,030
Let them talk if they want.

599
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,630
Why care about them?

600
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,950
I just feel wronged.

601
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:38,990
It's an adult's affair.

602
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,630
What does it have to do with us kids?

603
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,510
They said I'm just like

604
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,310
my dad.

605
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,910
My dad bullies employees,

606
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,670
and I bully classmates.

607
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,030
Taking revenge and such.

608
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,030
I don't believe my dad would do that.

609
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,800
Do you know about Yuan Yong?

610
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,910
Yes.

611
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:54,350
Everyone knows him.

612
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,410
Isn't he a scammer?

613
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,920
Let me tell you,

614
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,100
my mom almost got scammed

615
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,590
if my dad hadn't stopped her in time.

616
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,250
He came to our house several times.

617
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,550
My mom almost got tricked.

618
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,110
Then...

619
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,550
do you know how Yuan Shanqing is treated

620
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,470
in her class?

621
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,900
I bet it's not good.

622
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,870
Those who got scammed

623
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,070
will bully and insult

624
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,710
her.

625
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,230
And those who didn't

626
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,430
will still make snide remarks.

627
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,110
Everyone just joins in.

628
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,150
So what does that have

629
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,430
anything to do with her?

630
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,440
Nothing.

631
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,670
Her dad scammed people,

632
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,710
not her.

633
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,710
Everyone's just making a fuss without reason.

634
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,790
How do you know

635
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,470
her dad's scam doesn't involve her?

636
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,590
I heard

637
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,750
she might have

638
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,410
helped her dad hide the money.

639
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,350
Yeah,

640
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,550
I also heard that

641
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,580
Liu Junbao's dad

642
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,870
offended Li Si's dad,

643
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,950
so Li Si's dad took revenge,

644
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,430
reported him for stealing oil,

645
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,750
and got him fired.

646
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,230
So,

647
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,880
everyone's just

648
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,160
repeating what they've heard,

649
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,550
saying what they want.

650
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,160
They're making a fuss

651
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,390
just because

652
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,630
a scammer's daughter is here,

653
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,670
or because

654
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,200
a leader's son is here.

655
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,070
Are they

656
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,310
really bad people?

657
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,190
Nobody knows,

658
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,630
but it's said to be.

659
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,390
So they just start criticizing.

660
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,550
What should I do?

661
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,800
Should I just accept being insulted?

662
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,790
Let them be.

663
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,470
What good

664
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,920
does it do them?

665
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,110
Anyway, I think

666
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,790
we should find a way

667
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,710
to help Liu Junbao.

668
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,640
Do what we can.

669
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,570
After all, we're classmates.

670
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,430
As a martial arts novel says,

671
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,910
in the martial arts world,

672
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,150
there are many grudges and troubles,

673
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,680
and few can stay with you

674
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,830
to the end.

675
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,790
You have your parents

676
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,350
and us, your good friends.

677
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,910
You should care about us.

678
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,670
Why worry about them?

679
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,440
Well, you...

680
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,790
you're getting older

681
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,350
and even smarter now.

682
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,520
You know nothing.

683
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,630
Since I was three,

684
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,470
my IQ has always been the highest.

685
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,600
Otherwise, our team wouldn't be where it is today.

686
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,490
As for where the team is now,

687
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,020
it's not impressive to me.

688
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,020
It's you guys dragging me down.

689
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,830
You're either fighting

690
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,590
or jumping into rivers.

691
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,990
None of you are reliable.

692
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,850
Can't you

693
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,400
listen to me more?

694
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,590
I've listened to you

695
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,790
since I was three.

696
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,590
Has it helped?

697
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,970
I should beat you up.

698
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:08,160
[Pay back]

699
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,560
Yuan Shanqing.

700
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:09,850
Yuan Shanqing.

701
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,640
Yuan Shanqing.

702
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,090
Yuan Shanqing, I'm Cheng Yaya.

703
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,290
Open the door.

704
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,690
Yuan Shanqing.

705
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,470
Are you okay?

706
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,680
I'm fine.

707
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,130
Why are you here?

708
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,020
You have a fever.

709
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,630
Let's go. I'll take you to the hospital.

710
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,010
How are you? Feeling better?

711
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,670
Is Zi okay?

712
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,920
Don't worry. She's a good girl.

713
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,020
Granny Chen is teaching her to draw.

714
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,190
-What? Are you stealing my food?
-Dad.

715
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:28,710
How is it?

716
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,830
You're sweating.

717
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,550
How did it go?

718
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,680
It's not serious.

719
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,350
It's just

720
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,870
a common reaction

721
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:36,950
after the vaccine.

722
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,860
But your

723
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,990
are too low

724
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,110
are too low,

725
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,590
probably due to long-term

726
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,450
malnutrition.

727
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,190
Did you hear that?

728
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,300
Eat well.

729
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,310
The key is what you eat.

730
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,150
You're still

731
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,150
growing.

732
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,190
Make sure you get at least

733
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,710
one egg and one glass of milk every day.

734
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,350
Okay?

735
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,390
I know.

736
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,750
Your temperature is a bit high,

737
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,950
38.9°C.

738
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:00,790
You

739
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,310
take her

740
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,110
to get an anti-fever injection.

741
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:03,870
Here.

742
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,790
Give it to me.

743
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,190
Eat the stuffed buns.

744
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:33,670
No, thanks.

745
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,830
Take it and eat it while it's hot.

746
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,030
Don't leave any left.

747
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,530
Thank you.

748
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,310
How many times have you thanked me?

749
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,040
Haven't you thanked me enough?

750
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,550
Alright,

751
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,910
I'm going to class.

752
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,710
Tell my dad if you need anything.

753
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,820
By the way,

754
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,630
finish all the milk.

755
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,510
Don't waste it.

756
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,910
The school will definitely not

757
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,710
stop Liu Junbao from attending

758
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,310
because of his father's job loss.

759
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,270
I can guarantee that.

760
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,110
Mr. Gao.

761
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,310
Anything else?

762
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,390
And about Li Si...

763
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,300
This has nothing to do with him,

764
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,340
but everyone is targeting him.

765
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,750
I don't think it's fair.

766
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,350
You are really warm-hearted,

767
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,130
taking care of everyone's business.

768
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,100
We are classmates.

769
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,110
Shouldn't we help each other?

770
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,090
I know.

771
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,320
Go back to class.

772
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,870
Take the paper back.

773
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,350
Goodbye, sir.

774
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:14,350
Alright,

775
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,010
that's it for today's class.

776
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,040
We have a few minutes left.

777
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,100
I'd like to talk to you.

778
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,240
It seems like things have

779
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,300
been unsettled in the class lately.

780
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,030
I haven't been here for long.

781
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,630
Many things

782
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,310
are beyond my expectation.

783
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:32,960
Good things,

784
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,310
bad things,

785
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,230
and some

786
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,030
quite extreme.

787
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,150
I guess someone

788
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,590
might regret it too.

789
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,310
I often wonder,

790
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,750
as a teacher,

791
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,030
what can I really teach

792
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,670
you?

793
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,750
Textbook knowledge

794
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,310
is just there.

795
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,500
Anyone can teach it well.

796
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,780
But what about the principles of life?

797
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,430
To be honest,

798
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,380
I'm 27 years old.

799
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,030
In many elders' eyes,

800
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,310
I'm still

801
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,510
an immature child,

802
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,070
just like

803
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,000
you.

804
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,270
So, after thinking about it,

805
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:17,310
I realize the first thing

806
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,310
I can teach you

807
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,670
is these two words.

808
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,260
[Be yourself]

809
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,310
I don't know how

810
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,590
you see these words,

811
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,510
but in my view,

812
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,639
most people spend their lives

813
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,630
struggling to be themselves,

814
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,780
always following others,

815
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,909
going with the flow

816
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,580
or trying to attach their lives

817
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,960
to something else.

818
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,210
I can tell you

819
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:53,510
to stop gossiping

820
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,710
and not bring irrelevant things

821
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,480
to school,

822
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,910
but will you really listen?

823
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,900
Such commands are useless.

824
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,750
You are 17 years old now.

825
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,950
Those who go to school late

826
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,970
are even 18 years old,

827
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:08,900
already adults.

828
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,880
But have you ever thought about

829
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,830
what kind of person

830
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:14,810
you want to be?

831
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,230
Your appearance,

832
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,220
your background,

833
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,630
your parents and family,

834
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,430
these things will

835
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,750
influence your life.

836
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,580
But what we can do

837
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,140
is to make our lives

838
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,790
go our own way,

839
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,270
not to just follow

840
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,930
or depend on others.

841
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:36,950
The world

842
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,590
allows us

843
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,070
to not follow the crowd

844
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,070
and to not

845
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,710
live under shadows.

846
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,110
You're not just tools

847
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,590
without insight

848
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,740
and independent thought.

849
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,270
So,

850
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,190
if you have to be

851
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,230
someone

852
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,550
or make a difference,

853
00:35:58,830 --> 00:35:59,730
I hope it's a choice

854
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,030
from your heart

855
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,670
and you'll take responsibility,

856
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,590
risk your understanding

857
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,700
and dignity,

858
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,710
and not just follow

859
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,550
what

860
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,300
others say.

861
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,350
I hope you all

862
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,430
become the best version

863
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,390
of yourselves.

864
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:21,990
Class dismissed.

865
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,670
Stand up.

866
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,990
Goodbye, teacher.

867
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:27,750
Bye.

868
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,160
Did you give it to him?

869
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,180
Yes.

870
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,750
I tried to persuade him at first,

871
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,910
but he refused.

872
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,270
Then I had no choice

873
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,440
and said

874
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,930
it's the allowance from the drilling team.

875
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:01,930
So he accepted it.

876
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,240
Alright,

877
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,670
as long as he accepted it.

878
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,870
You've already

879
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,530
given him three months' salary of yours.

880
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,810
You did your best.

881
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,570
Don't worry about it anymore.

882
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,540
Thank you. Study hard.

883
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,340
Take care.

884
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:24,090
[Linchuan]

885
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,170
Junbao. Thank you.

886
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,830
This is from Li Si.

887
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,390
Remember to write to us when you arrive.

888
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,620
Li Si is too shy to come himself.

889
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,710
Don't blame him.

890
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,040
But I can assure you

891
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,310
he and his dad

892
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,310
are really good people.

893
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,520
They would never seek revenge.

894
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,270
I'm going back to my hometown anyway.

895
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,580
You don't have to say that.

896
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,380
Even though you're coming back,

897
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,670
you still need to study hard.

898
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,140
Thank you.

899
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,130
Go back now.

900
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,720
Goodbye.

901
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,910
Bye.

902
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,710
Bye.

903
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,220
Take care.

904
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,220
-Good luck.
-Bye.

905
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,160
Bye.

906
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,360
Remember to write a letter.

907
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,380
Go back.

908
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,730
Go back.

909
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:10,990
Bye.

910
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,910
Bye.

911
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,090
Junbao, remember to write a letter.

912
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,240
I heard that

913
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,490
our oil field

914
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,150
is getting less profitable.

915
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,070
If our parents

916
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,070
can't work here anymore,

917
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,570
will we have to leave

918
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,630
like them?

919
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,070
My dad said,

920
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,510
"Born an oil field worker,

921
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,840
die an oil field ghost."

922
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,950
Even though we have to live a hard life,

923
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,150
we must stick to the oil field business

924
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,750
till the end.

925
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,470
But that's what my dad said.

926
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,750
I'm fine with anything.

927
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,610
I'll see where you're going then.

928
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,180
Look at you.

929
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,890
You'd better stay in the oil field.

930
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:06,490
If you leave, you won't even have enough to eat.

931
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,840
You should go to that village

932
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,400
and experience life there.

933
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,080
Experience what?

934
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,510
What's wrong?

935
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,870
You're not

936
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,770
helping Qiang Xiaowa these days?

937
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,710
What do you mean?

938
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,250
It's cooperation.

939
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,390
Really?

940
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,830
He's not willing to do it

941
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,750
and ignoring you, huh?

942
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,390
Whatever.

943
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,210
I've got a lot of things to do.

944
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,770
Let's leave him alone.

945
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,820
There's

946
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,110
a new cook

947
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,740
at my mom's place today.

948
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,550
Let's go try the food.

949
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,530
Okay, I'll go get Hu.

950
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,620
-Okay.
-See you later.

951
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,110
Okay.

952
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:53,690
Let's go.

953
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,240
Okay.

954
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:58,470
You're here

955
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,390
to find me

956
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,260
to have dinner

957
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,760
with Li Si later,

958
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,010
right?

959
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:05,520
What's this?

960
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,250
Four yuan for half kilo of fish.

961
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:09,930
Four yuan?

962
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,270
Let me check something else.

963
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,720
Alright, take your time.

964
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,650
It's beautiful.

965
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,710
So pretty.

966
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:16,940
Do you want it?

967
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:21,790
Xiaowa,

968
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,150
help me move that gas canister

969
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,350
over here.

970
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,030
Okay.

971
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,040
You naughty boy.

972
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,530
Also, check on Liu Zhibo for me.

973
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,360
No problem.

974
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,330
Leave it to me.

975
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:35,960
Here.

976
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,090
Thank you.

977
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,060
Can you read?

978
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,270
Solid geometry.

979
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,610
Solid geometry.

980
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,270
Geo.

981
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,030
Geo.

982
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,630
Geo.

983
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,030
Popcorn. Miaomiao, hurry.

984
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,550
It’s okay.

985
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,190
Come on. What else?

986
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:48,870
I can hold you up high.

987
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:49,870
There's popcprn.

988
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,330
Up.

989
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,150
Up high.

990
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,090
Up high to sell fish.

991
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,180
Look at how big this fish is.

992
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,110
The new chef is really different.

993
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:15,040
This spicy chicken is delicious.

994
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,110
Miao, why aren't you eating?

995
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,830
I can't give up on helping Qiang Xiaowa.

996
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,230
I want to help him again.

997
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,240
At least

998
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,090
once more.

999
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,120
Doggy, here.

1000
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,150
Here, here, here.

1001
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:50,570
Take it.

1002
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,040
Let's be friends.

1003
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,580
Come on, doggy.

1004
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,340
Do you want a sausage?

1005
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,460
Babao.

1006
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:02,880
Doggy, here,

1007
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:04,600
Here.

1008
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,110
In this world,

1009
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,420
some people eat steamed buns,

1010
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,680
some eat salted fish,

1011
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,350
some eat spicy chicken,

1012
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,640
and some go hungry.

1013
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,390
Some bear blame,

1014
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,860
some face criticism,

1015
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,180
some take advantage of others,

1016
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,550
and some fight alone.

1017
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,250
But no matter what, it's all part of life.

1018
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,170
What matters is

1019
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,580
we need to be ourselves.

1020
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,550
Gao Feiyang told us

1021
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:34,080
how to be ourselves

1022
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,430
and make the right choices

1023
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,550
with conviction.

1024
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,000
Everyone's answer is different.

1025
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:40,630
I...

1026
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,810
I want to help Qiang Xiaowa again.

1027
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,600
I'm determined

1028
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,510
to be someone

1029
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,910
who reaches out to help.

1030
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:49,310
Never be afraid of

1031
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,750
what others think of you.

1032
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,060
You have to believe that

1033
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,000
no matter how strange you might be,

1034
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,030
there will always be people

1035
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,070
who stand by you.

1036
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,550
No matter how unfair

1037
00:42:58,630 --> 00:42:59,550
the world is,

1038
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:02,050
never let the light in your heart go out.
