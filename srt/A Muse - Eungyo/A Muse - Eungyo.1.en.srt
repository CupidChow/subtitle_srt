00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,460
A JUNG JIWOO FILM PRODUCTION

2
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,170
LET'S FILM PRODUCTION

3
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:49,180
EUNGYO

4
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,180
I have never seen a moon so beautiful.

5
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,180
I believe she was watching the same moon.

6
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,880
But to her

7
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,250
The moon wouldn't have looked so beautiful.

8
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,550
Every person sees a different vision
of a same object.

9
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,570
Who are you?

10
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,170
Who are you?

11
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,470
I'm Eungyo.

12
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,670
How did you get in here?

13
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,180
There's a ladder by the fence.

14
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,360
I've always wanted to
sit in a chair like this.

15
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,460
Does it belong to you?

16
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,370
You came down from the woods?

17
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,370
Where do you live?

18
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,870
Next to the laundromat.

19
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,570
I'll get going now.

20
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,780
Good bye.

21
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,260
The term 'National Poet' sounds crude.

22
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:04,570
It is such a blessing to be able to
learn from such a great teacher.

23
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:10,570
I don't think age matters
once you're past 20.

24
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,870
I'm too old to be called a prodigy.

25
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:23,090
In my case,
I think I'm just the right age

26
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,060
To present Heart to the world with confidence.

27
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,860
I will try harder in the future

28
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,170
And there will be much suffering involved.

29
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,590
Too salty?

30
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:52,770
Now you can write your own stories.

31
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,300
The Heart is topping charts everywhere!

32
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,860
By the way,
I've been commissioned a story.

33
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,870
What?

34
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I've been commissioned a story.
I would like to concentrate on that, so...

35
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:50,160
Remember the girl who was sleeping on your porch?

36
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,970
I gave her a ride
from her school by chance

37
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,570
And she was looking for a part-time job.

38
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,380
Isn't she in high school?

39
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,880
She said that she does
all the housework at home.

40
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,250
Tell her to come this Saturday afternoon.

41
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,870
Hello.

42
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:01,660
Sorry!

43
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,170
It's okay.

44
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,460
Let me do it.

45
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,970
- No, it's fine. I'll do it.
- No, I'll do it.

46
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,050
Don't worry.

47
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,070
Be careful.

48
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,460
Bummer!

49
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,260
What does 'bummer' mean?

50
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:44,660
Uh, it means thank you very much.

51
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,270
And your name is...

52
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,680
It's Seo Eunpa.

53
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:05,750
- Thank you, Eunpa.
- Now can I get a hug?

54
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,860
Of course.

55
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,760
Thank you very much.

56
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,870
When I clean the top window,
my fingers go wriggly.

57
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,580
Reminds me of dance lessons...

58
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,580
I use to take dance classes
until 7th grade.

59
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,350
Can you tighten it some more?

60
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,260
How are you going to breathe?

61
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:26,560
And the skirt?
This short?

62
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,770
Shorter.

63
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:38,280
They'll be able to see your panties!
All right, this much...

64
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:56,860
Grumpa, Your pencils are all stumpy.

65
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,770
Would you like me to sharpen them?

66
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,670
Let them be.

67
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,470
Sharp pencils are woeful.

68
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,680
What's so woeful about them?

69
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,180
What do you think?

70
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,960
Grumpa.

71
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:37,170
If pencils are sad
because they're sharp...

72
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,380
Does that mean
all sharp pencils are sad?

73
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,780
Is that...

74
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,380
Poetry?

75
00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:00,650
Images one derives from an object...

76
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,770
ls often as far apart as heaven and hell.

77
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,870
When I think of pencils

78
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,570
I see a boy running to school.

79
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,900
He loved the sound of his pencil case
rattling inside his school bag.

80
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:39,170
When the boy couldn't afford
to go to school any more

81
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:46,470
The rattling sounded
as if the pencils were crying.

82
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,180
Soto me,
the pencils means tears.

83
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:59,750
When you say
'Grumpa, please sharpen my pencil'

84
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,760
I hear this instead.

85
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:13,760
'Grumpa, please wipe away my tears.'

86
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,960
Grumpa?

87
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,760
It's me, Eungyo.

88
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,360
Grumpa.

89
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,570
What are you doing here
at this time of night?

90
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:37,880
Can't you see I'm wet?
Scolding me first...

91
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,170
Grumpa

92
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,670
Can I stay the night?

93
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,080
What?

94
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:14,050
Please let me stay.
I can't go home tonight.

95
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,760
Let me see your face.

96
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,570
Let me see your face.

97
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,370
Someone has slapped you.

98
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,780
Who is it?

99
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,990
Is it someone you know?

100
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:43,990
My mom.

101
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,460
Your mother?

102
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:55,360
She does that sometimes.
But only to me...

103
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:02,170
I usually go to my friend's house
when something like this happens.

104
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,680
Let's get you changed first.

105
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,970
Follow me.

106
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,080
Grumpa.

107
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,680
Can I tell you something?

108
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,150
I'll take you home
when the rain stops.

109
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,160
Can I tell you something?

110
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,560
Can I?

111
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,370
What?

112
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,070
I said, can I tell you something?

113
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,470
Yes.

114
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,570
I remembered.

115
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,780
Your poem in the textbook.

116
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,180
'Camellia ', right?

117
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,660
A little bird by the camellia grave.

118
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,560
A sad bird with red beaks.

119
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:14,060
A little bird who left crimson tear marks.

120
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,470
It was in my last exam.

121
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:31,750
By the Way

122
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,250
For me...

123
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,050
Pencils remind me of mom.

124
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,860
When I was young,

125
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:55,880
She used to shave her heels
with my pencil knife.

126
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,080
Crouching...

127
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:05,560
She doesn't do it any more
Now that she works in a public bathhouse...

128
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,760
Now it's running sore

129
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,660
So you have to use a dryer.

130
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,660
I don't know what's worse.

131
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:22,760
That's why I think
the pencil sharpener is sad.

132
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,470
Or is it the heel sad?

133
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,480
That's poetry.

134
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,760
Sad pencil...

135
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,160
Sad heel...

136
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,400
Grumpa!

137
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,470
What do you think about my feet?

138
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,080
Bummer!

139
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,080
Bummer?

140
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,250
You are thanking me
For dropping your blouse?

141
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,870
Grumpa...

142
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,370
Let's have breakfast.

143
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,050
Hello.

144
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,450
What are you wearing?

145
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,360
It's Grumpa's. .
Very comfortable.

146
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,470
Where is he?

147
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,170
I don't know.

148
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,470
Is he in the study?

149
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:37,880
Grumpa! Did you sleep well?

150
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,380
He doesn't eat bread.

151
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,350
I said he doesn't eat bread.

152
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,550
There is some in the freezer.

153
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,950
It's mine.

154
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,360
I think he'll want to eat it.

155
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,460
What do you know?

156
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:25,460
Then you think
you know him that well?

157
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,470
Of course.

158
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,470
Really?

159
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,080
Grumpa.

160
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,350
Ta-da!
Home-made club sandwich.

161
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,650
Looks good, doesn't it?

162
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:57,760
Stuff in the refrigerator
turned into work of art.

163
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,570
Try it.

164
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,670
Yes.

165
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:05,770
Sir, you don't eat bread.

166
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,080
This isn't bread.
It's a sandwich.

167
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,890
I'll bring some coffee.

168
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:36,360
Sir, she's a high school girl.

169
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,770
Yes she is.

170
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,170
What's wrong with that?

171
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,650
What?

172
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,750
No, nothing...

173
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,160
The roll of thunder was deafening.

174
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,260
How could you be so calm?

175
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,560
I was scared to death.

176
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:08,360
You must have a lot on your conscience.

177
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,970
That's why I was hiding in.

178
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,480
I found you near my waist in the morning.

179
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,480
Not much of a place to hide...

180
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:27,760
By the way,
I saw the tattoo below your neck.

181
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,550
Fascinating.

182
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,960
You mean the henna?

183
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,160
It's not a tattoo?

184
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,060
It rubs off after a few days...

185
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,380
You can stop coming to his house now.

186
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:54,680
Why?

187
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,380
I won't be paying you any more.

188
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,660
That's strange.
He asked me come twice a week.

189
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:01,850
What?

190
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,050
He gave me the key to the front gate
because the ladder's too dangerous.

191
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:28,280
Hey!

192
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,450
My mirror!

193
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,050
Clumsy girl.
Why do you need a mirror in the woods?

194
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,160
It's an Anna Sui princess mirror!

195
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,660
Anna Sui? What's that?
I'll buy you a new one just like it

196
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,470
Mom gave it to me on my birthday.

197
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,770
I'll buy you one.
I'll buy you the same one.

198
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,970
It's not the same!

199
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,370
What the...

200
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,880
It may look the same to you
But to me,

201
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,780
It's as different as heaven and hell.

202
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,540
It was her first birthday present to me!

203
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,060
The same one isn't the same!

204
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,360
What are you talking about?
Why shouldn't it be same?

205
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,570
Sir?

206
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,270
Sir!

207
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,170
Sir, be careful!

208
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,870
Watch your feet!

209
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,480
Under your foot! Right there!

210
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,690
- Do something!
- Slowly... slowly...!

211
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,660
Right there! Under your foot!
Be careful!

212
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,060
That's it, sir!

213
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,070
Sir, put the mirror in your pocket.

214
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,580
In your pocket! Your pocket, sir!

215
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,160
sir!

216
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,250
Slowly, slowly...

217
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,950
Take my hand, sir.

218
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,480
Here you go.

219
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,280
Your mother gave it to you..
It must be precious.

220
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,650
Why did you do that?
You could have been hurt!

221
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,170
Grumpa.

222
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,380
Grumpa 1

223
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,380
Remember what you've asked me before?

224
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:14,680
What?

225
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,280
About the henna on my chest.

226
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,580
Uh, yes.

227
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,960
I knew then that you want to try it.

228
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,460
No, no.

229
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,860
You don't mean what you say!

230
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:34,660
You are curious about teenagers' activities,
As I am about grown-ups'.

231
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:37,770
- I really don't want to.
- Come on.

232
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,970
Lie down.

233
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,860
Rest your head on my leg.

234
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,250
Your leg?

235
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,160
How else would I draw?

236
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,080
Unbutton your shirt. One...

237
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:27,750
Two, three.

238
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,780
Grumpa. Your chest is really smooth.

239
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,250
LS it?

240
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:15,460
Stop moving.
I can't draw properly.

241
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,170
Close your eyes.

242
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,680
All right.

243
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,850
I guess grown ups are ticklish as well.

244
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,950
I have ticklish ankles.

245
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,960
Just below the ankle.
You know the shallow part.

246
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,470
Don't...

247
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,570
Don't...

248
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,680
I could easily wrap my fingers
around Eungyo's ankle

249
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:24,180
Her heel slipped between my fingers

250
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:33,250
And she giggled.

251
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:53,380
Her fragrant head rested below my chin

252
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:59,050
And my lips were already buried
in her hair.

253
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:07,360
She sighed like a pair of bellows.

254
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:53,470
Grumpa, you can open your eyes now.

255
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:16,460
Look. It's the same one as mine.

256
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,760
So it is.

257
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,870
I held you close in my arms

258
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:32,170
I caressed your hair,
your shoulders, your waist

259
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:37,080
And I put my ear to your chest
listening to your heart beating.

260
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:44,840
You were so heanbreakingly beautiful.

261
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:40,370
Can you do me a favor, Eungyo?

262
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,170
No, I think I have the ﬂu.

263
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,550
Can you bring me some medicine?
Just some aspirin.

264
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,650
Hello?

265
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:08,970
Anybody here?

266
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:23,980
How is your flu?

267
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,960
You!

268
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,160
What are you doing to him?

269
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:35,860
What?

270
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:39,260
He isn't who you think he is, okay?

271
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:40,970
He's a noble person!

272
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,570
How do you know
what he means to me?

273
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,570
What are you saying?
What did I do?

274
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,080
How do you know
what he means to me?

275
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:56,280
Jerk off, you motherfucker.

276
00:46:56,610 --> 00:47:00,850
What did you say?
Jerk off?

277
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,250
Did you call me motherfucker?

278
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,360
What did you call me?

279
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,650
I could just...

280
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:10,760
You are putting him in danger.

281
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:12,270
In danger?!

282
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:16,570
If you hadn't messed around
with that mirror,

283
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:17,760
Yes, the mirror!

284
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,480
If you hadn't cried over that mirror
He wouldn't have risked his life.

285
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,370
You were the reason I dropped it!

286
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:30,580
What's so special about that mirror?
It's just one of thousands from a factory.

287
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:34,160
You can buy the same one over and over.
What's all the fuss about?

288
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,660
I told you it was
a birthday present from Mom!

289
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:37,750
So what?!

290
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,660
You think it's filled with
her love or something?

291
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:03,180
Here.

292
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:25,360
I'd forgotten you were an engineering major.

293
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,770
Engineering major?

294
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:31,180
He told me about the first time you two met.

295
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,480
What did he say?

296
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:41,050
It took you 10 years to realize
that all stars aren't the same.

297
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,750
What do you think 'that' means here?

298
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:49,360
Yes?

299
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:58,170
A star.

300
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:07,170
This is the best example which illustrates
modernity and self-sufficiency of modern poetry.

301
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:13,650
It's meaningful that this poem
emphasizes originality especially.

302
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,460
Sir.

303
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:23,160
Comparing something as beautiful as a star

304
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:29,060
to a goose feed or prison wall

305
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:32,170
is considered poetic sentiment?

306
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,670
Do I know you?
I don't believe we've met.

307
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:44,380
My name is Seo Jiwoo.
Sophomore, department of inorganic engineering.

308
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,350
I don't know who told you
that stars are beautiful.

309
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:59,960
Stars aren't beautiful or ugly.
Stars are just stars.

310
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:07,770
To lovers, stars may look beautiful
But to a hungry person

311
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,280
It may look like a tasty snack.

312
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:18,950
If you are in inorganic industry,
The star may seem full of pesticide.

313
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,350
Sir...

314
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:27,160
Inorganic means materials
like ceramics and minerals.

315
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,850
Not inorganic food.

316
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:37,370
What else he tell you?

317
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,070
About the time he went to prison.

318
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,380
How he learned to fix cars in there.

319
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:52,850
He can take a car apart
And put it together again.

320
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,950
What did he tell you about me?

321
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:02,560
I don't know.

322
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:06,960
Is there something I shouldn't hear?

323
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,080
Or something you want me to hear?

324
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:24,190
So this is The Heart.

325
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:31,950
I want to read it.
Can I borrow it?

326
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:00,350
Hey, did you... read it?

327
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:01,650
What?

328
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,150
I mean The Heart.

329
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,160
Your novel?

330
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:11,470
No, I've been busy with mid-term exams.

331
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:20,870
Don't read it if you haven't started yet.
It's just a vulgar commercial novel.

332
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:33,050
Hey, hey!
What do you think you're doing?

333
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,760
What's the fuss?

334
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:38,760
He puts his writings in here.
It's too far.

335
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,760
You've seen him writing?

336
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:47,770
It's hard for him to go back and forth.
This is the perfect spot.

337
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:50,770
No, don't, don't!

338
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:53,070
He hates it when things are out of place.
He doesn't like changes.

339
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,970
What's the use of wasting this pretty chest?

340
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:03,070
It's been there since before you were born.
It's older than you!

341
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,550
So what if it's older than me?
Help me move it. It looks better there.

342
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,960
Go away.

343
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:15,160
Move!

344
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:23,160
You think I won't do it?
Don't! What the...

345
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:27,070
Go away, now.

346
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,480
Move, I said!

347
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:36,580
Go away, now.

348
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:37,680
Don't.

349
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:38,950
I told you to move.

350
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,250
What's wrong with you?

351
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:46,060
I warned you!
Go away!

352
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,660
Here he is!

353
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:52,470
Get away from there
Now, move!

354
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,270
Grumpa!

355
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,960
Grumpa!
I cleaned your library all day.

356
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:35,470
- You did?
- Yes, I didn't do much...

357
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,080
Grumpa, about that chest...

358
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,980
I wanted to move it for your convenience
But he won't let me.

359
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,250
What are you doing?

360
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:54,660
Eungyo, let it be.

361
00:54:55,790 --> 00:55:02,760
Every wooden furniture
likes to take root in a certain place.

362
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:05,570
It's been there since before you were born

363
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,070
It won't do to uproot it.

364
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,770
I'm sorry.

365
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,580
Sir, the meeting date
has been set.

366
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:19,750
It'll be on Monday over lunch.

367
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:24,350
I made a reservation
at your favorite restaurant.

368
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,650
Who's coming?

369
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:31,460
County officials and people
from Camellia Literature Museum.

370
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:33,760
I want to go as well.

371
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:38,770
May I please come?

372
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,870
Now you are pushing it too far.

373
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,480
Why shouldn't I come?

374
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:50,380
I can go after school
And you can give me a ride.

375
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,950
- It'll be around six.
- Yes!

376
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,480
They have great food there.

377
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:01,660
Really?
Let's go, just you and me.

378
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:09,760
By the way...
Have you read The Heart ?

379
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:11,670
The Heart?

380
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,070
You read it?

381
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,170
Yes.

382
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,180
How did you like it?

383
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,380
I was pleasantly surprised!
It was good.

384
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:24,180
How about you?

385
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:32,860
It's a genre novel but not just that.

386
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:34,860
It's poetic, and shows

387
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:38,460
-deep introspection of human being.
- Sir...

388
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:45,970
But I don't think he likes it.
He called it a vulgar commercial novel.

389
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,870
I didn't mean that, sir.

390
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,780
A parent never discards his off springs,
No matter how troublesome they may be.

391
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,850
Have a drink.

392
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:09,050
Maybe you'd like to say a word...

393
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:16,770
Do you know how old
the girl from Camellia was?

394
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:23,600
You mean the girl
who saved you from the communists?

395
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:31,350
She was seventeen...
Just seventeen.

396
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,650
About the Literature Museum, sir.

397
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,360
I'll get going now.

398
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:43,760
You haven't eaten at all.

399
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:47,260
Are you leaving already?
Where are you going?

400
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:49,460
This dinner is in your honor...

401
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:54,370
Is it something urgent?
Perhaps meeting your girlfriend?

402
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:56,970
Shall I show you something?

403
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,070
Here, sir?

404
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:04,480
Sir, you got a tattoo?

405
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:08,450
Still trendy and stylish.

406
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,950
Wow, that's cool.

407
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:14,650
Wait till I'm dead
if you want to build that literary museum.

408
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:19,160
But you'll have to wait a long time.

409
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:22,070
Thank you for coming, sir.
I'll call you soon.

410
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:23,470
Good bye, sir.

411
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:29,170
They just cant wait for me to die.

412
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:34,380
You don't build a museum
about a living person.

413
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:36,180
I'm leaving.

414
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:41,950
Why does Seo Jiwoo follow him
around like a dog?

415
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,550
- What do you mean?
- What does he hope to get from him?

416
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,750
Recognition! Just Recognition.

417
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:48,980
Recognition?

418
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:50,160
What else does he need?

419
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:23,260
Grumpa!

420
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:31,460
There's still 20 minutes left...
You've been waiting for me?

421
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,670
Well...

422
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,270
Have you been to a place like this?

423
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,070
No.

424
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,480
This is a great place to hang out.
It's divided into different themes...

425
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,480
Excuse me.

426
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:17,580
Who ordered quince tea?

427
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:18,740
- I did.
- Grumpa did.

428
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,160
Bummer!

429
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,660
Sorry? ls something wrong?

430
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:31,970
Just saying thanks.

431
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:33,570
Thanks?

432
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:37,670
Yes, there's nothing wrong.

433
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:39,360
- Thank you.
- You're welcome...

434
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,770
Have a good time.

435
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,180
Grumpa!

436
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:50,380
'Bummer' is an expression we use

437
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:56,350
When we are surprised or amazed,
startled or astonished.

438
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,880
That's when we use it.

439
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,260
It doesn't mean thank you?

440
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:01,760
No...

441
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:06,870
Bodhi!

442
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:14,870
It's a Buddhist expression
meaning you have been enlightened.

443
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,470
Bodhi.

444
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,800
Why? Have you been enlightened?

445
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:24,270
This is how a teacher scolds his student
when she tries to test her teacher.

446
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:27,860
Whatever.

447
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:48,970
What the hell...

448
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:14,460
Is he home?

449
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:27,870
Sir, are you here?

450
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,880
You didn't answer the phone.
I have some news.

451
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:41,160
We decided to call it
Camellia Memorial Hall.

452
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,050
We took out 'Literary Museum'
from the title.

453
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:51,560
And they want to display
your handwritten manuscript...

454
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:55,260
Fine.

455
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:59,170
The county office people will be thrilled.

456
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:05,280
Is Mr. Seo Jiwoo here?

457
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:12,940
Bestselling authors are always busy.
So how well is The Heart selling?

458
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,650
Over 800,000 copies.

459
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:20,060
Mr. Seo made a tidy sum from the royalties.

460
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:21,860
800,000 copies.

461
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:28,170
We printed 30,000 copies more last week,
So it's 830,000 copies to be exact.

462
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:35,470
Usually popularity and seriousness don’t mix.

463
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:41,480
But fortunately I think Mr. Seo
has managed both.

464
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:50,850
You know about his latest short story?

465
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:52,860
A short story?

466
01:04:56,890 --> 01:05:05,470
It's one of his best writings.
The literary circle is buzzing about it.

467
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,580
It's that good?

468
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,370
What's the title?

469
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,680
You should read it.

470
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:18,650
The title is Eungyo.

471
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:21,760
Eungyo?

472
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:26,650
It's the name of a high school girl.

473
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:35,260
Sir, I'll get going now.

474
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,380
Sir, good to see you.

475
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,080
Where are the literary magazines?

476
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:23,380
It's over there
at the New Arrivals sections.

477
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:26,950
They're really popular for some reason.

478
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:30,450
Yes, right there.

479
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,960
Sir, I'm here.

480
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:04,850
Would you like a cup of tea?

481
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,850
I'm afraid that
you might have poisoned it.

482
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,280
Do you have anything to say?

483
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:41,750
I did it because...

484
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:47,060
It was too beautiful.

485
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:52,960
What?
You did it because?

486
01:08:54,190 --> 01:09:03,080
The moment I saw your manuscript,
I couldn't let such beauty waste in the chest.

487
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,980
I had to let the world know...

488
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,580
You call that an excuse?

489
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:17,360
How dare you, a thief, mention beauty!

490
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,860
You are the one
who made me who I am.

491
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:21,260
What?

492
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:26,460
You were the one who offered
to ghostwrite The Heart.

493
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:30,270
You wanted to do it.

494
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:33,970
You wrote it for fun!

495
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,870
I considered it your salary.

496
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:39,680
You have no talent
but you kept me company

497
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,580
So I wrote it for you as gift.

498
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:48,850
Are you regretting it now
that it's become a bestseller?

499
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,150
You want to tell everyone
that you wrote it?

500
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,160
The tension is driving me crazy.

501
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:59,360
I don't know who I am any more.
Am I Seo Jiwoo or Lee Jeokyo's mask?

502
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:03,670
What did I ever get, living as your mask?

503
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:07,300
Money?
You want it back? The royalties?

504
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:08,870
Shut your mouth!

505
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:12,270
Why should this one
be any different from The Heart?

506
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,780
- Stop it!
- People won't understand

507
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:22,450
The relationship between a 70-year-old man
and a high school girl isn't love. Never!

508
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:25,950
It's a scandal, sir...

509
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:29,060
A dirty scandal!

510
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:32,390
You know you won't be able to
publish it under your name.

511
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:33,770
You know it!

512
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:39,760
A story about a national poet
having sex with a minor?

513
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,570
Dirty scandal?

514
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,780
- Sir, you are an old man.
- You say it's dirty?

515
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:50,080
Why won't you admit it?

516
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:51,740
Son of a bitch.

517
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:53,850
Never show your face here again.

518
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:58,950
Your eyes are frightening.
I feel sick listening to your voice.

519
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:01,050
You are a thief.

520
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:08,060
You never had any potential.

521
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:15,970
I never liked that look
in your eyes, like a wolf.

522
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:19,180
What are you staring at?
I'll gorge your eyes out.

523
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:22,680
You dare to call it dirty?

524
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:25,140
You say this is a dirty scandal?

525
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:30,950
You bastard!

526
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,580
I know you're in there.

527
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,850
I don't know
why you won't let me in.

528
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:13,560
I can't concentrate on my studying,
and I'm going to mess up my exams...

529
01:13:18,290 --> 01:13:22,570
Why does it hurt so much?

530
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,380
I don't know
why it hurts so much...

531
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:19,750
I could easily wrap my fingers
around Eungyo's ankle.

532
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:24,550
Her heel slipped between my fingers

533
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:26,850
And she giggled.

534
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:31,660
Her fragrant head rested below my chin

535
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:35,770
And my lips were already buried
in her hair.

536
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:43,370
She sighed like a pair of bellows.

537
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,880
I held you close in my arms

538
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:54,450
I caressed your hair,
your shoulders, your waist

539
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:59,250
And I put my ear to your chest
listening to your heart beating.

540
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:06,460
You were so heanbreakingly beautiful.

541
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:28,050
Did you read it?

542
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:40,570
Eungyo reads Eungyo.

543
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:43,770
Do all writers do this?

544
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:49,270
Stealing other people's stories,
using names without permission.

545
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,270
I'm sorry.

546
01:16:57,410 --> 01:16:59,040
Did you really write this?

547
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:06,750
How did you find out his henna?

548
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:11,660
He told me about that.

549
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:14,470
He told you?

550
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:18,570
He told you about it?

551
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,770
You two don't keep secrets
from each other?

552
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,270
What is he to you?

553
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:36,060
My beloved and respected teacher.

554
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:41,050
A father figure.

555
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:52,960
Then you tell him
everything as well?

556
01:17:58,700 --> 01:17:59,480
Yes.

557
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:12,560
I am so pretty in the story.

558
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:15,160
Thank you.

559
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:34,170
Why are you doing this?

560
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,870
You are doing this
because you like me?

561
01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:02,170
I'm lonely, that's why.

562
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:20,850
Will you tell him about this?

563
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,460
It's about time they called...

564
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:07,160
They will never pick a genre novelist
or a best-selling author.

565
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:10,170
Finally!

566
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,670
Winner of annual Literary Award

567
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,780
Eungyo by Seo Jiwoo!

568
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:27,750
Really?

569
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,350
Really. Eungyo is the winner.

570
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:33,950
I won the annual Literary Award?

571
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:36,350
I told you would win.

572
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:38,260
The judges have gone to dinner.

573
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:40,570
Wow...

574
01:21:42,990 --> 01:21:48,670
Has Mr. Lee Jeokyo read Eungyo?

575
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,380
Yes.

576
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,480
What did he say?

577
01:21:59,170 --> 01:22:00,950
He told me this.

578
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:11,160
'It's like you went through my mind...'

579
01:22:14,690 --> 01:22:15,670
'It's scary.'

580
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:47,560
I thought he couldn't make it?

581
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:49,090
What's going on?

582
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:49,970
He's here.

583
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:57,370
Look.

584
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:40,950
The 35th Literary Award winner is
Eungyo written by Mr. Seo Jiwoo!

585
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:57,570
lam honored to introduce
a special guest today

586
01:23:58,490 --> 01:24:02,070
He is here to give
a congratulatory speech.

587
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:06,970
I believe this is
his first public appearance.

588
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:11,010
Mr. Seo Jiwoo has called him
a father-figure

589
01:24:11,010 --> 01:24:18,150
He is known for aesthetic combination of
lyric poetry with realism.

590
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:23,060
The true poet of his generation!
Mr. Lee Jeokyo.

591
01:24:54,080 --> 01:25:00,260
I, Lee Jeokyo, am an old man.

592
01:25:00,690 --> 01:25:05,470
Roethke referred to getting old...

593
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:14,680
as wearing the leaden weight of
what I did not do.

594
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:24,350
Just as your youth is
not a prize for your efforts

595
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:34,960
My agedness is not
a penalty for my faults

596
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:59,750
Eungyo is like sweet rain upon a dry land.

597
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:07,560
It will be hard to
write a story more beautiful,

598
01:26:09,090 --> 01:26:15,870
more truthful, or more replete.

599
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:02,080
Happy birthday, Grumpa!

600
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:16,350
I got you a cake and a present.

601
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:50,660
Grumpa, your windows are so dirty.

602
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:55,360
Would you like me to clean it
as a birthday present?

603
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:08,380
Eungyo's here.

604
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:14,540
You don't seem happy to see me.

605
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:22,960
Of course
I'm glad to see you.

606
01:29:57,090 --> 01:29:58,160
Grumpa.

607
01:30:01,890 --> 01:30:02,870
Here's salt.

608
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:05,970
Looks really good.

609
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:12,780
Look at this, Grumpa!

610
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,970
Looks good.

611
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:18,050
I've also brought candles.

612
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:21,250
Let's just light one.

613
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:23,350
What?

614
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:25,750
Light just one candle

615
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:29,050
Okay.

616
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:47,470
Our famous writer is here.

617
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:51,950
Sir...

618
01:31:04,890 --> 01:31:07,560
Happy birthday.

619
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,980
I'll get going now.

620
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:34,250
He's diabetic.
He can't eat cake.

621
01:31:41,290 --> 01:31:42,360
Mr. Seo!

622
01:31:45,890 --> 01:31:47,570
Come here.

623
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:49,870
Have a drink before you go.

624
01:32:48,290 --> 01:32:49,460
Try it.

625
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:52,260
Let's see..

626
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:00,670
How's my salad, my soup?

627
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:03,280
It's very good.

628
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:05,040
It is, isn't it?

629
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:12,150
Grumpa, do you know
when they started drinking wine?

630
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:20,360
A 4,000-year-old wine bottle
was found in Georgia.

631
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:23,260
It's almost as old as human race.

632
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:28,870
Why do you keep asking him
questions instead of me?

633
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:30,680
Don't bother him.

634
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:34,770
You never have good answers.

635
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:37,950
It's easier when he explains things.

636
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:42,750
You are too... loose.
A typical engineer!

637
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:45,260
I don't know
how he became a writer, do you?

638
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:49,960
What's wrong with majoring in engineering?

639
01:33:51,690 --> 01:33:56,660
Did you write poetry like him?
Like Grumpa?

640
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:05,670
I wanted to write poetry.
I desperately wanted to.

641
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:08,970
You started writing novels
because you couldn't write poems?

642
01:34:10,510 --> 01:34:12,350
Then poetry is the highest level?

643
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:20,450
Poetry is higher.

644
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:37,380
Did you know that

645
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:43,370
Me, Seo Jiwoo the genre novelist,

646
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:51,350
People scorned me

647
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:54,960
But now they worship me.

648
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:58,860
Just because I won a prize.

649
01:35:00,990 --> 01:35:06,770
The mighty critics
who never once called me

650
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:12,570
Now can't get enough of me.

651
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:15,670
So you are noble, so what?

652
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:22,940
So you are a national poet, sir,
So what?

653
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:30,050
The key is to succeed.

654
01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:31,460
No matter what!

655
01:35:33,290 --> 01:35:37,670
I'm no longer a mask.

656
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:41,070
I'm Seo Jiwoo and...

657
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:48,370
I'm really going to succeed, sir.

658
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:53,850
I have a quiz for you.

659
01:35:56,680 --> 01:36:00,350
I want you to be
my student in next life.

660
01:36:04,090 --> 01:36:06,960
Why do you think I do?

661
01:36:07,690 --> 01:36:08,960
That's the quiz?

662
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:13,870
To make him
do my laundry and cooking.

663
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:29,650
I'm drunk.
I'll go to bed now.

664
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:32,850
Eungyo should go home now.

665
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:37,160
Didn't you say you have
breakfast meeting tomorrow?

666
01:36:37,890 --> 01:36:38,860
Go to bed.

667
01:36:40,690 --> 01:36:42,070
It's not a breakfast meeting...

668
01:36:42,290 --> 01:36:44,270
It's a lecture...

669
01:36:45,390 --> 01:36:47,070
Yes, sir, good night.

670
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:56,070
I can do without some sleep.
I'm still young.

671
01:36:56,700 --> 01:36:58,340
Sir, thank you very much.

672
01:37:00,170 --> 01:37:04,350
You turned an engineer into a writer

673
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:12,360
Who didn't know anything about stars.
Thank you, sir.

674
01:37:20,190 --> 01:37:23,660
Happy birthday Grumpa.

675
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:36,950
Good night.

676
01:38:22,290 --> 01:38:23,560
I should go to bed.

677
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,750
Good night, Eungyo.

678
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:58,050
Here? This shallow pan?

679
01:41:58,170 --> 01:41:59,240
You are ticklish here?

680
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:04,650
Here, and here...

681
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,350
Don't...

682
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:54,460
How much do you care for me?

683
01:43:55,690 --> 01:43:58,070
How much...

684
01:46:14,190 --> 01:46:17,870
Do you know why
teenage girls have sex?

685
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:21,780
Because you care for me...

686
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,640
You came back
because you care for me.

687
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:47,170
I'm lonely, too.
That's why.

688
01:50:05,690 --> 01:50:07,760
Who fiddled with the engine?

689
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:11,370
The handle has no control.

690
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:13,480
You are lucky to be alive!

691
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:15,980
Is it because the car is old?

692
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:17,280
No...

693
01:50:17,970 --> 01:50:19,450
Someone loosened it.

694
01:50:19,570 --> 01:50:20,240
Loosened it?

695
01:50:20,370 --> 01:50:21,050
Yes.

696
01:50:21,780 --> 01:50:27,850
If someone loosened it,
it means he did it on purpose.

697
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:30,660
If he did,
he meant to kill you.

698
01:50:31,290 --> 01:50:33,160
Who messed with this car?

699
01:50:33,890 --> 01:50:35,760
And it's fairly recent.

700
01:50:36,590 --> 01:50:41,470
Look here, no oil marks.

701
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:48,970
See how dangerous
an amateur job can be?

702
01:50:49,700 --> 01:50:54,050
People think internet is
all they need to fix a car.

703
01:51:05,590 --> 01:51:10,360
Did you think I'd let
that old man get to me?

704
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:25,140
I can see inside your head!

705
01:51:25,670 --> 01:51:28,150
I know all about it, old man.

706
01:51:43,490 --> 01:51:44,560
Fuck...

707
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:14,560
My beloved, respected teacher

708
01:52:15,390 --> 01:52:19,170
How could he do this to me?

709
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:23,070
After all I've done...

710
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,780
No son could have been more loyal.

711
01:54:13,070 --> 01:54:19,050
You have one new message.

712
01:54:25,090 --> 01:54:26,160
I...

713
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:37,070
killed... Seo Jiwoo.

714
01:57:46,990 --> 01:57:48,060
Grumpa.

715
01:57:52,890 --> 01:57:53,670
You are wasted.

716
01:58:18,690 --> 01:58:19,960
My mom...

717
01:58:25,290 --> 01:58:27,570
Her heels are cracking again

718
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:31,970
like a tree bark...

719
01:58:40,970 --> 01:58:45,950
she's shaving it
with a knife again.

720
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:51,950
Crouching down.

721
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:56,560
I was watching her

722
01:59:00,490 --> 01:59:02,470
When it suddenly came back to me.

723
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:22,050
Remember the night
I came here?

724
02:00:00,490 --> 02:00:01,860
That moment...

725
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:07,160
That air...

726
02:00:08,900 --> 02:00:09,870
That temperature...

727
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:11,370
That humidity...

728
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:14,880
That warmth...

729
02:00:17,870 --> 02:00:24,950
Some things can never be felt
no matter how hard you tell.

730
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:32,280
Even if you had told someone,
a third person can never describe it.

731
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:48,770
An engineer...
Who thinks all mirrors are the same...

732
02:00:49,100 --> 02:00:50,580
How could he know...

733
02:01:03,380 --> 02:01:05,760
Eungyo belongs to you...

734
02:01:12,590 --> 02:01:17,170
You wrote Eungyo...

735
02:01:26,070 --> 02:01:27,450
Thank you...

736
02:01:32,380 --> 02:01:34,650
Thank you for making me
so pretty in the story.

737
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:48,460
I didn't know I was so pretty.

738
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:56,570
I had no idea.

739
02:02:09,180 --> 02:02:11,360
I didn't know anything
like an idiot.

740
02:02:13,090 --> 02:02:17,160
I was just a big-headed idiot.

741
02:02:21,090 --> 02:02:23,070
I was so stupid.

742
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,880
Good bye, Grumpa.

743
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:09,870
Good bye

744
02:04:12,070 --> 02:04:13,350
Eungyo...
