00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:09,880
Viewer discretion is advised)

3
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,440
Kunakorn

4
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,360
Please don’t do this.

5
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,880
The Prince didn’t know anything about this.

6
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,960
If you are going to be angry,…

7
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,840
You should be angry at me.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,519
Tidarat

9
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,240
This is a matter between me and him.

10
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,360
You should stay back.

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,600
No, my lord.

12
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,760
This time, Tidarat won’t leave you again
no matter what.

13
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,000
You lying bitch!

14
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,960
How dare you say that?

15
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
A deceptive woman like you,…

16
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,800
Does not deserve to be with you, my lord.

17
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,520
Put the gun down.

18
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,920
So we can talk nicely.

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,479
You want to talk nicely?

20
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
How many time…

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,240
Did you ever talk nice to me, my lord?

22
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,759
After all,…

23
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,600
You always see me as an evil thing
that gets in the way of your love.

24
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,680
You never know…

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,800
That what I’ve done…

26
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,960
I wanted you to know…

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,440
This woman is not as good person as you think.

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,000
She doesn’t deserve you, my lord.

29
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,400
You are misunderstanding.

30
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,520
Misunderstanding

31
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,000
by what you made up in your own head.

32
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,079
No!

33
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
I never misunderstood.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,960
I never misunderstood anything.

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,480
Not even the fact that I...

36
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,040
My lord!

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,079
I love you... my lord.

38
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,360
Are you alright, my lord?

39
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,520
Cut.

40
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,240
(Prince of Love)

41
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:54,560
(Be Mine Superstar)

42
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,120
Hey, Vorra?

43
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,840
Your lead actor, Muang…
Is he handsome?

44
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,760
Hmm...

45
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,440
Bitch! You think you’re so famous?

46
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,800
Preaw

47
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,240
Nice to see you.

48
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,800
‘Tle...

49
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,840
Why don’t you greet Wan?

50
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,080
You’re being rude, you know?

51
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,200
Hello, Wan.

52
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,920
Good to see you.

53
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,360
It’s okay if you don’t greet me.
I don’t mind.

54
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,240
Unlike some people…

55
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,360
Acting all high and mighty,…

56
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,880
Wanting everyone to pay respect.

57
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,760
I don’t know if she’s a shrine or something?

58
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:24,800
‘Tle.

59
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,320
Let’s go do your makeup.
Or you’re going to be late.

60
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,200
Yeah.

61
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,080
Hello.

62
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,240
What a luck?

63
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,000
Being a manager for the network’s lead actress too?

64
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,240
This time,

65
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,080
it would be like killing two birds
with one stone, as usual.

66
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,720
When the opportunity present itself,

67
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,200
You should seize it, obviously.

68
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,000
Unlike some people.

69
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,520
So stupid!

70
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,440
For keep trying to push an old actor.

71
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,920
An old actor is better than a new face.

72
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,440
New face every month.

73
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,880
New eyes, new noses, new lips.

74
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,720
The series can’t continue

75
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,160
And giving producer all the headache.

76
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,880
Amen.

77
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,640
I hope she gets 5 or 6 boobs.

78
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,920
So, her manager can show her in a circus

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,600
- For extra income.
- Wan! You bitch!

80
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,680
Shut your fucking mouth!  You…

81
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,080
What? Why are you talking shit
to me like that?

82
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,560
You talked shit to me and my boy first.

83
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,360
When did I talk shit to you?

84
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,480
Did I mention any name?

85
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,640
- You don’t want to mention names.
- Enough.

86
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,080
- It was just idle talk.
- Enough.

87
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,120
You wanted everyone to hear it.

88
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,160
- I was just talking out loud.
- Enough!

89
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,040
Wan

90
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,080
Preaw

91
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,960
I will pretend that you two

92
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,480
Were just idle talking
and I didn’t hear anything, okay?

93
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,520
Alright, everyone.

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,159
If you’re done with your makeup and hairdo,

95
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,120
Please come outside.
We will take a little photo.

96
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,720
Yes.

97
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,720
Come on, Vorra.

98
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,040
Let’s go outside.

99
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,200
In here…

100
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,880
Is so full of disgusting flies. So annoying.

101
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,080
No, thanks. It’s too hot.

102
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,440
Your coffee, my lord.

103
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,160
Thank you.

104
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,919
I should be the one to thank you.

105
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,320
If it wasn’t for you helping me…

106
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,600
By now...

107
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,679
There would be nothing left for my life.

108
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,720
If there’s anything I can help you,…

109
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,200
I will do it.

110
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,720
I just wish you would stay here and be happy…

111
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,880
That’s enough for me.

112
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,880
Yes.

113
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,920
I will remain humble as I am.

114
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,960
Did someone say anything to you?

115
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,800
It’s nothing.

116
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,920
Nothing at all.

117
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,400
Ashi, are you seeing this grandma? Ashi?

118
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,520
Ashi, Ashi, Ashi. Ah-huh

119
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,120
If you want me to be happy…

120
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,600
You must tell me the truth.

121
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,480
Well,...

122
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,600
This morning,…

123
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,600
Your grandmother stopped by to visit.

124
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,240
Don’t worry about that.

125
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,320
I can explain to grandmother.

126
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,080
Not only your grandmother…

127
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,640
Lady Rapeeponpun was here too.

128
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,920
My lord…

129
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,880
Ashi, Ashi, Ashi. Hmm… You’re so cute.

130
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,600
Punn, wake up!

131
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,000
Pai, you…

132
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
What’s wrong with you?

133
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,880
Today is my day off.

134
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,720
Who told you to be a sleepyhead?

135
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,560
You...

136
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,720
You...

137
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,800
You what?

138
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,000
- Pai, you little shit!
- What?

139
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,120
Let Ashi see, please?

140
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,760
Did little Punn just got broken in two?

141
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,920
Give him back right now.

142
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,760
No, I won’t.

143
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,080
Give him back, Pai.

144
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,960
Give him back now, Pai!

145
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,480
Give him back.

146
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,320
You want this?

147
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,480
Come on!

148
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,760
Take it!

149
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
Pai, you!...
Did your parents ever teach you?

150
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,880
They did. But I never learn.

151
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,040
Also, my parents are your parents.

152
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,360
Pai!

153
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,320
I will get you!

154
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,720
You’re so cute and cuddly, my Ashi.

155
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,160
- Hmm… My little boy.
- Grandma!

156
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,160
Don’t run away from me.

157
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,160
- Grandma!
- Pai!

158
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,360
Grandma, help me!

159
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,520
- Pai!
- Grandma!

160
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,520
Help me, please.

161
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,360
- What’s wrong, boys?
- Pai! Come here!

162
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,240
- Wait. Wait!
- Come here!

163
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,800
You’re gonna hit your head on something.

164
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,600
What is it? What’s the matter with you?

165
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,360
- What are you playing at? Stop it.
- Come here if you dare.

166
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,000
- Come on. Don’t fight.
- You come here.

167
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,440
Don’t do it.

168
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,960
Hey... Stop. I said stop.

169
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,320
Pai just destroyed my property in my room.

170
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,880
I’m not going to let him live!

171
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,120
Hey, hey!

172
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,360
Come on. You’re all grown up now.

173
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,720
Enough. What’s wrong?

174
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,800
Alright, alright.

175
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,400
Keep it down, boys!

176
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,600
Be considered of your grandma, please.
Mom. I’m so sorry.

177
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,800
You two… All the times.

178
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,480
I’m sorry, mom.

179
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
How did you raise your kids, huh?

180
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,000
They’re so grown up
that a dog can’t lick their asses any more.

181
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,680
Why are they still playing like children?

182
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,120
Well, these two
are always playing around like this.

183
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,080
Hey! No can do. You’re a mother.
You should teach them, right?

184
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,720
Or do you want me to do it for you?

185
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,600
No, mom. No.

186
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,800
It’s fine, mom. I don’t wanna bother you.

187
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,480
Come on.

188
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,800
Apologize to grandma. Both of you.

189
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:30,920
Umm

190
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,120
- Sorry, grandma.
- Sorry, grandma.

191
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,600
Good.

192
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,040
Enough of this.

193
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,120
I better go check on Phu.
Don’t know what he’s gonna eat for lunch.

194
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,360
Alright.

195
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,240
Watch your step, grandma.

196
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,080
Yeah, yeah.

197
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,280
Well, well, well…

198
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,240
Grandma doesn’t even leave the room yet.

199
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,760
I told you so many times.

200
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,120
Be careful. Grandma is going to stay with us
for many days, understand?

201
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,760
- Phu?
- Yes, mom?

202
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,840
What do you want to eat for lunch?
I’ll cook for you.

203
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,520
It’s fine, mom. I’ll have Sorn to it.

204
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,960
You’re walking around like this,
you’re gonna complain that you’re tired again.

205
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,920
Come on. I have great food supplement.

206
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,000
It’s helps with my muscle mass and bones.

207
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,560
You can have me walking around ten more times,
I won’t get tired that easily.

208
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,160
Hmm… Now you’re bragging.

209
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,040
Just a bit.

210
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,160
No. It’s almost lunch time.

211
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,800
Does Sorn has time to cook for you?

212
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,680
She has to take care of the cafe

213
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,360
And stop your sons
from fighting each other too.

214
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,320
He bullied my Ashi again, mom.

215
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,760
You again, Pai?

216
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,360
I just don’t want to see him

217
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,920
Chase after some false hope.

218
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,080
No matter how hard he tries,
he just can’t reach it.

219
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,880
Stop looking down on me, you prick!

220
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,920
Hey, Punn.

221
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,480
- Be nice to your little brother.
- Uh

222
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,440
You two are giving me headache.

223
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,840
But… but he belittles me again, mom.

224
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,920
Just you watch…

225
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,920
I will make Ashi mine.

226
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,040
Sure. I’m waiting to see that for 9 years.

227
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,680
Amen.

228
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,680
- Phew! - Hey!
- Pai!

229
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,800
You’re not gonna stop?

230
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,280
Go now. Go...

231
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,560
Don’t push your brother.

232
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,000
Go. You go upstairs now.

233
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,080
And you… And you…

234
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,240
You know he loves that person so much.

235
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,440
You still keep teasing him all the time.

236
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:13,880
Oh-oh.

237
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,600
But right now,…

238
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,960
Grandma left.

239
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,560
Punn left.

240
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,440
Only you, Pai. Go help me at the cafe.

241
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,120
- Just the two of us.
- Let’s go.

242
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,480
Let’s go, my boy.

243
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,240
And don’t fight him next time.

244
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,800
Don’t worry, mom. Sorn knows what to do.

245
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,520
You don’t have to worry about me.

246
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,680
Wait, wait, wait.

247
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,960
Does that mean all these time,
whatever she cooked for you,…

248
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,440
- You just ate all of it?
- Yeah.

249
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,480
Human,…

250
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,840
We eat to survive, isn’t that right?

251
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,080
Don’t make excuse for her.

252
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,760
I don’t care.
I already told her that I’ll cook for you.

253
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,440
What do you want to eat?

254
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,160
- Really?
- Yes.

255
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,760
Anything you do.

256
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,560
- Ah-huh
- It’s all delicious.

257
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,920
Stop praising me.

258
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,080
- Beautiful.
- Nice.

259
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,600
Vorra. Smile, please?

260
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,960
- Beautiful.
- Good.

261
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,960
This camera, please.

262
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,800
Yes.

263
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,840
Ashi. Can you get a little closer to Vorra?

264
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,200
Great. Nice shot.

265
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,040
Vorra. This camera, please.

266
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,440
- This camera, please.
- Yes.

267
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,080
- This camera too.
- Nice.

268
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,800
I would like to say to all the press.

269
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,480
Please help promote our Prince of Love as well.

270
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,280
And to the viewers at home, on this season…

271
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,520
It will be more entertaining than the last one,
I guarantee it.

272
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,320
Both behind-the-scene crews
and all the actors,…

273
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,400
We all put our heart to this project.

274
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,960
We’re happy to do so.

275
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,640
Please support all of our actors.

276
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,480
This time, it’s not about just romance
and feel-good.

277
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,680
Find out how funny
and naughty they will get on this season.

278
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,200
Do anyone have more question?

279
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,640
Can we take photo of just the hero and heroine?

280
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,280
Oh… And just Mingmuang as well.

281
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,280
Of course. Of course.

282
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,040
Yes.

283
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,040
Come on.

284
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,760
What a shame?

285
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,440
He turns to play villain for the first time

286
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,960
But the press doesn’t care.

287
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,480
Fail to stole the scene.

288
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,400
What would I be ashamed of?

289
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,480
Great opportunities are still yet to come.

290
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,240
Alright, press.

291
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,440
May I excuse Ashi and Mingmuang?

292
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,240
Because they have a product launch event
with Title this afternoon.

293
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,000
Well, it’s been a while
since these 3 are all together, right?

294
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,640
Really, Preaw?

295
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,600
Of course.

296
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,240
Who want to find out more?

297
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,320
- You can follow us to the hotel.
- Oh, of course, we will.

298
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,160
Yes.

299
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:38,800
Come on.

300
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:40,920
Go.

301
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:41,800
Let’s go.

302
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,080
See you there.

303
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,200
- We will.
- Yes.

304
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,160
What’s the meaning of this?

305
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,440
Why I didn’t know about this?

306
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,280
What? You didn’t know about this?

307
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,520
But I already told miss Koi.

308
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,120
Wan…

309
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,600
Well, I was busy with the ceremony
so, I didn’t tell you.

310
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,160
But...

311
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,000
Preaw has already asked for my permission

312
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,920
And I think it will benefit the series.

313
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,680
If Wan not comfortable having her actors
go to the event

314
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,760
Then it’s fine. I will just…

315
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,440
Make a phone call to apologize the event organizer.

316
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,440
They might complain a bit or…

317
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,240
Fine.

318
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:15,880
Next time,…

319
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,760
If you have anything, don’t go through Koi.

320
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,119
You can tell me directly.

321
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,240
Don’t be mad at Preaw.

322
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,200
We all know each other.

323
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,320
Everyone…

324
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,000
You can follow us to the hotel
for press conference.

325
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,360
Go take a lot of photos.

326
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,760
Why would they go now?
They’re taking photos of me.

327
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,720
Oh. You’re shooting the lead actress?

328
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,840
Sorry, sorry. Go on. Go on.

329
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,000
- Look at this camera, please.
- This camera too.

330
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,360
Oops. That one. That one.

331
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,760
Nice.

332
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,600
- Great. So lovely.
- Nice shot.

333
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,600
- This camera, please.
- This one too.

334
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,720
Beautiful.

335
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,080
Great, This one, please.

336
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,760
(Suea)

337
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,600
Yeah, I know.

338
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,760
I’m hurrying.

339
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,600
Why do you have to be so late?

340
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,720
Um.

341
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,360
You don’t have to tell me twice.

342
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:37,920
Guys...

343
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,840
Tell him to bring Pai here too.

344
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah. Punn…

345
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,040
Gus said bring Pai here too.

346
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,400
Nope.

347
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,880
Never.

348
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,680
The things we’ll be talking about…

349
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,000
Has nothing to do with Pai at all.

350
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,640
Punn says no.

351
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,640
What?

352
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,240
But I want to see Pai.

353
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,600
I haven’t seen him for so long.

354
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,080
You should turn on your speaker from the start.

355
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,800
If you want to see him,
Just go to Punn’s mom’s cafe.

356
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,800
I won’t. It’s too far away.

357
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,640
Suea. Just hurry him up, will you?

358
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,280
Punn. Did you hear that?

359
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,880
Your “dad” just told me to hurry you up.
(Punn)

360
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,760
Yeah. I’m hanging up now.

361
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,120
I’m heading out now.

362
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,560
Heading out?

363
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,840
Dear Ashi.

364
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,760
Please pray for me that I’ll meet you someday.

365
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,400
Are you shy?

366
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,520
Look after me.

367
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:11,920
I'm gone.

368
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,440
Let’s cut to the main question.

369
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,400
If the Twitter doesn’t post
those old pictures when you were wearing short shorts,

370
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,000
We would never have guessed that you three
were friends before.

371
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,240
Three of us
used to work under same modelling agent

372
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,240
So, we are quite close.

373
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,200
And why did you separated
and go different ways?

374
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,440
Well, the staffs that took care of us

375
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,760
Had went separate ways
to open their own modelling agency.

376
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,240
Preaw took me under her wings.

377
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,520
So, I’m here with Preaw.

378
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,880
So, that’s mean Miss Makamwam is the one…

379
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,320
Who brought Mr. Ashi and Mr. Mingmuaeg
to stardom, am I right?

380
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,560
That’s right.

381
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,480
Does that mean this drama
is the first time ever…

382
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,200
That all three of you came back
to work together?

383
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,200
That’s correct.

384
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,560
Please stay tune for our series,…
Prince of Love.

385
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,240
Alright, before we unveil our new product,…

386
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,280
The trio would like to perform some show for us.

387
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,960
Please give them some time to prepare first.
This way, please.

388
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,280
If I would have known,
I would go see the event first.

389
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,880
What event?

390
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,040
What?

391
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,360
You didn’t know why Gus invited us here?

392
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,680
I don’t know.

393
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,360
Gus told Punn to tell me…

394
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,480
That we’ll be meeting here.

395
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,720
Gus is Ashi’s fanboy.

396
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,520
Today, Ashi has an event here.

397
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,920
A wanker?

398
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,600
Event not a wanker!

399
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,240
Sorry.

400
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,040
It is my great honor…

401
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,120
To meet this two noble knights,…

402
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,160
Whose travelled both rivers and seas,…

403
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,800
Both north and south…

404
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,600
Just to see me.

405
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,720
Your flattering us too much.

406
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,680
The honor is mine…

407
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,080
To visit such civilized capitol…

408
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,760
And met a great knight like you, Shirashi.

409
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,560
The man who’s as beautiful as sculpture.

410
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,000
My gracefulness…

411
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,400
They’re no one can compare.

412
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,440
I know that well.

413
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,720
What’s the meaning of this?

414
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,040
This is a treasure…

415
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,320
That I got as a tribute from my hometown.

416
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,280
This is...

417
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,560
The treasure that I’ve been
keeping it secret for so long.

418
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,440
You’re blaming me?

419
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,440
I’m blaming Gus.

420
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,360
Why are you blaming me?

421
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,800
I like what I like.

422
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,160
Same as you being an otaku.

423
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,840
Huh? Are you an otaku?

424
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,760
Hey!

425
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,480
Sugar Sugar Rune.

426
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,040
Your heart come to me.

427
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,520
Hey!

428
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,720
You go blame Punn for coming so late.

429
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,000
Keep us waiting.

430
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,480
He’s floating in.

431
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,200
- Hmm…
- Hmm…

432
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,320
This is my third coffee waiting for you.

433
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,480
What are you smiling about?

434
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,680
None of your business.

435
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,880
- What?
- What?

436
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,560
Suea was just asking you nicely.
You little shit.

437
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,560
Right.

438
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,600
You’re here to talk about internship,
wasn’t it?

439
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,480
Go on.

440
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,440
Yeah.

441
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,720
Three of us already got places
to work internship job.

442
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,360
You’re the only one who didn’t send
the replies letter to professor.

443
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,680
He asked me to warn you.

444
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,240
So what?
Where will you work internship?

445
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,960
Thank you so much, Miss Preaw.

446
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,760
Today event was a great success.

447
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,440
And thanks all of you…

448
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,040
For coming here and entertain our guests.

449
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,960
Don’t mention it.

450
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,200
Next time, if you need me and the kids,

451
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,960
you can call us anytime.

452
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,920
That’s only applied for Title.

453
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,880
As for Ashi and Mingmuang,
you can contact me.

454
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,720
As for today’s fee, you can pay through me

455
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,200
and not through Preaw.

456
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,520
I don’t want to bother her.

457
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,200
Or else, she would have to do taxes
for my two boys.

458
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,640
It’s not fair for her.

459
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,960
Sure things, miss Wan.

460
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,520
Yes.

461
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,160
I will have my accountant contact you later.

462
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,360
Yes. Thank you very much.

463
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,200
Thank you.

464
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,880
Go change.

465
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,520
See you, Title.

466
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,480
Sure.

467
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,720
So, what is it, Punn?

468
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,480
Yeah…

469
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,400
I’ve already sent my...resume.

470
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,600
Still waiting for…their replies.
Their replies…

471
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,560
Why don’t you call and ask them?

472
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,480
So, you’ll find out
whether they’ll let you in or not.

473
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,800
Yeah.

474
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,880
They might be busy, alright guys?

475
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,200
They might reply to me when they have time.

476
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,680
If they’re free next year,…

477
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,840
Does that mean you’ll get the job next year too?

478
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:49,920
Yeah.

479
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,400
We called you here because we want to help.

480
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,920
What kind of job do you like?

481
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,960
Where you want to work? Just tell us.
We’ll help with the contact.

482
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,320
Just so we can finish college
and graduate together.

483
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,760
Or do you want to graduate with med students?

484
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,680
6 years, perhaps?

485
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,160
So, which company did you sent your resume?

486
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,120
Well, I…

487
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,760
Sent it to...

488
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,640
- Huh?
- To...

489
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,080
Gus. It’s you!

490
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,120
What are you doing here?

491
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
Hello, Film.

492
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

493
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,040
I just invited my friend here
to talk about internship.

494
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,960
What are you doing here, Film?

495
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,880
Oh. I’m here to shoot Ashi’s, Mingmuang’s
and Title’s photos in that event.

496
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,480
I really want to see Ashi.

497
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,000
But because this shithead coming so late…

498
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,200
Go find me at the filming set
if you want to see him.

499
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,960
I can get you to take photos with him too.

500
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,080
What filming set?

501
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,360
Prince of Love. I work there.

502
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,480
Really?

503
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,280
Yes.

504
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,240
Gus…

505
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,000
I sent my resume to this filming set.

506
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,760
Can you speak with her for me?

507
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,640
Punn…

508
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,560
What are you getting me into this time?

509
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,840
Come on. Sugus, the most handsome.

510
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,920
Help me, please. I really want to work there.

511
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,480
Help me, please.

512
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,920
Yeah, yeah. I’ll ask her about it.

513
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,200
Erm…

514
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,040
Film?

515
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,360
- Huh?
- Do they accept intern at the set?

516
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,040
I don’t know about that.

517
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,720
Why?

518
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,640
Well, Punn here…
He told me he sent his resume

519
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,960
to your film set.

520
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,680
Really?

521
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,080
That’s right.

522
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,320
I sent it months ago.

523
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,440
- Oh.
- Huh?

524
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,480
If so, I’ll ask HR about it.

525
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,960
I’ll have Koi take a close inspection on you.

526
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,320
I’ll call you back if you get accept or not.

527
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,720
I’ll go order my coffee now.

528
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,160
See you.

529
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,160
- Bye.
- Bye.

530
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,360
Bye bye. Yes!

531
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,000
- Yes!
- Hey!

532
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,560
I got a place to work.

533
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,960
You guy’s jealous of me?
You guy’s jealous of me?

534
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,200
Yeah, yeah.

535
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
You’re giving me headache.

536
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,240
- Yeah.
- Thanks so much. Gus, my friend.

537
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,920
Wan shouldn’t told the organizer like that.

538
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,040
Why?

539
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,040
You’re afraid that he wouldn’t hire you two?

540
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,760
It’s not that.

541
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,280
I just feel bad for Preaw.

542
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,560
Why would you feel bad for her?

543
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,960
She never feels bad for us.

544
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,760
She always sticks on us for success.

545
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,320
I don’t know if her past life
was a leech or not?

546
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,840
Here. You too.

547
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,800
What are you laughing at?

548
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,200
Don’t you remember
what she did to all 3 of us?

549
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,120
What’s the meaning of this, Preaw?

550
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,320
What is it this time?

551
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:40,960
Where did you get this?

552
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,640
Who did you talk to?

553
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,240
Why did you use my name to ask
for a fee raise?

554
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,840
And you took 50 percent of it too.

555
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:48,920
So what?

556
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,840
Wasn’t that a good thing?
Our kids get more money, right?

557
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,680
Are you sure you did it for them? Huh?

558
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,040
Everything I do right now…

559
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,000
Is for the kids in our agency, Wan.

560
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,880
Wan. Why didn’t you transfer our payment in full?

561
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,640
What payment?

562
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,360
That advertisement we did.

563
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,560
You told us that you would transfer us 20,000

564
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,880
But you only sent 10,000.

565
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,720
Get out. I’ll clear things up for you.

566
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,320
What does this mean, Preaw?

567
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,240
The thing earlier too.

568
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,680
If I don’t take some of their payment,

569
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,000
you would get nothing too.

570
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,000
So what?

571
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,960
I already explained everything.

572
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,400
You are such a liar, Preaw.

573
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,680
What? Wan, you bitch!

574
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,480
How dare you say that to me?

575
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,280
Why? Why can’t I say that to you?

576
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,040
What’s happen?

577
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,920
You asked them for a raise then pocketed most of it.

578
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,120
Why did you do that?

579
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,400
Why not?

580
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,760
Why can’t I do it?

581
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,760
What are you gonna do?

582
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,560
This is my modelling agency!

583
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,920
How can you say that?

584
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,960
How can you say that? You bitch!

585
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,800
- You’re calling me a bitch? Wan!
- Huh?

586
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,640
I’ll get you today!

587
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,960
I’m gonna slap you in the face!

588
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Oh really?

589
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,600
Wanna slap me? Come get some!
Wan, you bitch!

590
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,360
- Try me, bitch!
- Come here and slap me!

591
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,080
- Come on! Come on!
- You come here!

592
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,560
Come on! Come on!

593
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,920
Come on! Wan!

594
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,080
- A person like you!
- Let’s go.

595
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,600
Come here if you dare!

596
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,600
Get back here!

597
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,120
Get back here if you dare!

598
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,600
So… you are a coward!

599
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,600
Do you think I...

600
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,840
I’m back, bitch!

601
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,080
- I’m gonna slap you!
- Enough already!

602
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,720
Stop it!

603
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,920
- Wait a minute!
- Huh? Preaw!

604
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,760
Enough! Get her out of here. Go!

605
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,560
This will be the office
for our modelling agency.

606
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
I think it’s okay.

607
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,240
Small but cozy.

608
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,560
It’s great, sis.

609
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,120
Next to BTS too.

610
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,960
I don’t want you two
having trouble with travel.

611
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,120
It’s a shame about Title.

612
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,360
Because that bitch
is the one who took Title in first.

613
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,200
What’s he gonna do?
He has to follow her order.

614
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,680
But you two don’t be worry.

615
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,520
You guys just trust me.

616
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,360
I trust you, sis.

617
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,040
I trust you too, sis.

618
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,120
Thank you.

619
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,080
Thank you so much.

620
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,800
How many bloods and sweat did we shed
just to reach this point?

621
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,760
I will never let Preaw destroy us.

622
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,520
Don’t think too much about it.

623
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,120
Preaw wouldn’t do such a thing.

624
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,560
I know her for decade.

625
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,080
I know her true nature.

626
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,040
She’s jealous of you two.

627
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,080
Because she can’t make Title as famous as you.

628
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,440
How do you measure who’s more famous than who?

629
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,680
Muang. Don’t be so innocent.

630
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,120
If the sequel didn’t get Vorra as a lead,

631
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,160
Title would never get the role for this drama.

632
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,800
Title is a great actor.

633
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,440
Everyone would want to work with him

634
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,720
Don’t talk in their favor.

635
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,120
I don’t have any bias against Title.

636
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,920
But I don’t like the way she does things.

637
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,760
Like she just stepped over my head.

638
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,680
Come on. Go change your clothes. Let’s go.

639
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,800
Hey. Little pup.

640
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,760
I will get a chance to meet my Ashi now.
Are you happy for me?

641
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,640
Yay!

642
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,200
I’m going to meet my Ashi.

643
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,240
What are you so happy about, Punn?

644
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,880
I’m going to meet my Ashi, mom.

645
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,280
Hey, really?

646
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,120
Yes.

647
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,520
Are you day-dreaming again?

648
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,040
I’m telling the truth.

649
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,240
I got the job as an intern
at Ashi’s filming set.

650
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,600
Oh.

651
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,360
Yeah, yeah.

652
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,680
Congratulations!

653
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,640
But next time,
tell people first then tell the dogs.

654
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,080
At least,

655
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,440
the dogs are more honest to me, right?

656
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,440
Whoa.

657
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,640
Are you talking about me?

658
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,280
I’m your brother, dammit!

659
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,360
Isn’t that true?

660
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,840
- Stop it, both of you!
- Hmm

661
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,440
You’re always fighting.

662
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,360
You too, Punn.

663
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,080
You just came back.
Go take a shower first.

664
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,880
You look rough.

665
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,560
Yes.

666
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,760
Wah! Got scold by mom. Wah!

667
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,760
Look at him, mom.

668
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,159
Pai. Pai.

669
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,199
You too.

670
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,719
You tease your brother every day.

671
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,920
Don’t you get tired of it?
Every day.

672
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,120
Right?

673
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,600
I’m so tired of you.

674
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,320

I guarantee…

691
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,160
That Ashi will fall for me for sure.

692
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:04,920
Can’t do that.

693
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,320
I’m so cool.

694
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:13,920
Let’s go.

695
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,400
Handsome and nerdy. Totally my type.

696
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:54,800
Good evening.

697
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,480
May I sit with you?

698
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,520
Are you here by yourself?

699
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,320
I’m heading out to clinic now.

700
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,040
Please tell the patient to wait for a moment.

701
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,120
I’ll be there in ten minutes.

702
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:27,880
Yes.

703
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,120
I’m off for now.

704
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,240
Hey. Wait a minute.

705
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,280
You...

706
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,480
Is there something wrong?

707
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,960
Can I have your number?

708
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,800
I want to see you again.

709
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,440
You’re a movie star, right?

710
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:06,960
I think

711
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,800
we don’t need to see each other again.

712
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,280
I’m a movie star, so what?

713
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,840
Why can’t we meet again?

714
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,480
It’s because

715
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,400
I prefer one-night stand.

716
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,720
Besides, I...

717
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,440
Don’t want to date someone
I had one-night stand with.

718
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,880
If you excuse me.

719
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,040
Wait a minute.

720
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,560
You... Wait.

721
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,520
Good morning.

722
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,400
- Mr. Ming.
- Hey.

723
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,360
(Ashi)

724
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:13,920
What’s up? Ashi.

725
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,520
Hello.

726
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

727
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,320
What’s so urgent?

728
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:36,960
Alright,

729
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,920
let’s get straight to the point.

730
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,920
I want you three to work with Preaw…

731
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,960
Without condition.

732
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:21,760
(Be Mine Superstar)

733
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,200
Did I really get an internship
at Prince of Love’s filming set?

734
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,280
Ashi. Please dance with me for a song.

735
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,360
Tell Ashi when he’s done shooting.

736
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,280
Yes. Yes.

737
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,440
My lord…

738
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,240
Tidarat is pregnant with our child.

739
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,360
Kunakorn!

740
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,360
You can wear my helmet.

741
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,240
It has more protection.

742
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,480
Is there something wrong?

743
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,360
I don’t know how to put it on.
