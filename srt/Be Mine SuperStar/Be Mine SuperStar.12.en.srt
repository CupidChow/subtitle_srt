(Business? Love? Stealing lover?)

8
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,300
From the eyes of someone who have a crush...

00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,090
(Kenichi's eyes have changed.
These are the eyes of someone in love.)

10
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,820
To the eyes of someone in love.

11
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,180
Punn...

12
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:18,930
Punn.

13
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:22,390
Punn.

14
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,789
Do you hear what I say?

15
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,340
What?

16
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:27,930
Yeah.

17
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,000
Sua. Help me.

18
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:31,970
Explain to him.

19
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,259
Your Mr. A didn't send you food support today?

20
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,070
Punn...

21
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,630
I have something to talk with you.

22
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:48,650
Who's this?

23
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,690
Dad. If you want to talk about him...

24
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,070
Then, I'm not talking.

25
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:54,960
It's not about him.

26
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:55,900
It's about someone else.

27
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,390
Who is he, Punn?

28
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,140
Yeah. Who is he?

29
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,320
Your dad doesn't look like this.

30
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,700
He's Muang!

31
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:12,890
Muang who?

32
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,890
Yeah. I am his dad.

33
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,900
And you, you and you.

34
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,640
Should remember that well.

35
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,840
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

36
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,270
Punn...

37
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,570
Follow me.

38
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,360
Go on.

39
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,220
Your dad's calling you.

40
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,010
Go.

41
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:39,740
Go.

42
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:41,970
Alright.

43
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:47,970
What was that about?

44
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,070
Come here, come here.

45
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,420
Do you think Muang is Mr. A?

46
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,460
How can he be Mr. A?

47
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,970
Muang should be Mr. M , right?

48
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:58,600
Why not?

49
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,730
Muang has an "A" too.

50
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,880
M. U. A. N. G.

51
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,050
I mean his initial...

52
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,870
Not how to spell it.

53
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,410
Oh...

54
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,470
Enough. Both of you.

55
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,730
Muang can't be Mr. A.

56
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,330
He's obviously a top.

57
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,630
And Punn is a top too.

58
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,850
- Huh?
- Huh?

59
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:18,530
What's a top?

60
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,230
Top.

61
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,600
I want you to tell me
who did you learn that from?

62
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,930
What do you have to gain by knowing it?

63
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,100
Is he someone close to me?

64
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,720
That's why you don't want to tell me.

65
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,410
You can tell me.

66
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,470
I promise I won't get mad at him.

67
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,570
Alright.

68
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,090
Title is the one who told me.

69
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,280
He said someone sent him that picture before hand.

70
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,430
And you believe
that someone really sent that to him?

71
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:12,940
Think about it.

72
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,000
The only people whose went in
and out of Ashi's room before he went to Japan...

73
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,240
Was only you and Title.

74
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,910
Do you still think there's someone else?

75
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,510
He's obviously tried to sabotage your relationship.

76
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,159
Tle is your friend too.

77
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,210
How can you say that to him?

78
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,230
He's not my friend anymore, doc.

79
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,510
You promised not to get mad.

80
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,150
It's doesn't matter if Title took the photo...

81
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,930
Or someone sent it to him.

82
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,960
But the truth is the truth, no matter what.

83
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,260
I don't want to get hurt because of him again.

84
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,290
He told you himself, wasn't he?

85
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,030
That he will not love anyone.

86
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,360
Forget about it.

87
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,090
It's over.

88
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,520
It maybe over for you

89
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,360
but not for Ashi.

90
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,560
That's up to him.

91
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,080
If you will excuse me.

92
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,770
Goodbye.

93
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,930
See? It's really was him.

94
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,540
I knew he's a snake.

95
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,460
I will talk to him.

96
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,250
He must take responsible for what happened.

97
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,010
At least, Ashi and Punn can clear things up.

98
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,850
Um. I hope it will go that way.

99
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,200
But if you can't handle him,
I'll deal with him myself.

100
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,890
People like Title...

101
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,760
Are the same kind of that bitch Preaw.

102
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,010
A corpse and a rotten coffin,
what a perfect match?

103
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,050
If I got anything, I'll tell you first.

104
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,140
Tle...

105
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,190
You're done.

106
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,240
Hello, Miss Koi.

107
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,210
(Title)

108
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,650
Thank you so much, Miss Koi.

109
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,610
Commit to the role.

110
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,190
Of course.

111
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,550
I will never let you down.

112
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:40,909
Good.

113
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,430
I have to go check the camera now.

114
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,370
Yes, ma'am.

115
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,290
(Title)

116
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,320
What's up, Muang?

117
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,790
Are you free tomorrow?

118
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,590
Of course.

119
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,410
See you, man.

120
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:25,760
Ashi.

121
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:29,610
Ashi.

122
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:31,990
Ashi.

123
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:33,920
Ashi!

124
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,320
Oh?

125
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:41,870
It's you.

126
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,740
You're not going to work at all?

127
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,870
I already asked Miss Wan for a break.

128
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:49,860
I get you.

129
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,230
But you have to understand Miss Wan too.

130
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,680
She's worry about you.

131
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,630
You need to get yourself up...

132
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,770
And move on from here.

133
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,880
What happen between you and Punn...

134
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,010
Was Title's doing.

135
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,150
Title sent photo of your note to Punn.

136
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:12,940
How do you know that?

137
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,420
Punn told me about it.

138
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,730
And how is Punn doing?

139
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,150
Is he alright?

140
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,840
Don't worry about him.

141
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,680
Punn might told you as well...

142
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,760
That he doesn't want to talk about me.

143
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,200
Punn must hate me by now.

144
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,320
He wouldn't want to see me again.

145
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,330
Or he doesn't hate me?

146
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,200
Am I overthinking?

147
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,610
Punn...

148
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,050
He surely hates me.

149
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,920
My heart hurts.

150
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,680
All of them...

151
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,530
Go on. What is it?

152
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,710
How about your surprise first?

153
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,970
I got the main role in Mr. Da's drama.

154
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:10,930
Congratulations.

155
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,350
See?

156
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,300
You work with Miss Wan not so long ago.

157
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,210
Now, you already got main role
from famous director.

158
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,480
What about you?

159
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,480
Do you know...

160
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,840
That Ashi and Punn was dating?

161
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,170
Um.

162
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,280
Can I ask you for real?

163
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,930
Why did you do that for?

164
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:34,870
Did what?

165
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,170
About Ashi's note.

166
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,230
You were the only one who saw it.

167
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,770
Ashi is your friend.

168
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,880
Punn is like a brother to you.

169
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,430
I'm the only child. I have no brother.

170
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,050
Ashi never has ill-will toward you.

171
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,820
He always caring and wishing you the best.

172
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,580
You're one of his beloved friend.

173
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,700
But I never thought of him as friend.

174
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,820
I always love him.

175
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,610
But he never notice my affection.

176
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,710
- Love is something that...
- Enough.

177
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,400
I don't want to listen to anyone teaching.

178
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,940
If Ashi doesn't want my love...

179
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,810
Then, he doesn't deserve love from anyone.

180
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,740
Title.

181
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,290
Let me be frank.

182
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,540
Do you really believe...

183
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,650
That Ashi truly love that kid?

184
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,680
You should know your friend well.

185
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,020
I know my friend well.

186
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,980
Even though, he said he will not love anyone...

187
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,460
But that doesn't mean
he's not able to change his heart.

188
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,510
Human can't escape love in the end.

189
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,130
But you...

190
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,610
You never love anyone.

191
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,350
And you...

192
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,880
Never even love yourself.

193
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,460
I love myself.

194
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,760
Everything that I've done...

195
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,470
Was for myself.

196
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,600
Suit yourself then.

197
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,610
But I'm done being your friend.

198
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,900
I really can't accept that.

199
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,330
So sore.

200
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,440
- What are you doing, mom?
- I'm doing yoga.

201
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,500
Why are you doing it right now?

202
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,770
Well, I have to take care
of the cafe during the day.

203
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,580
It was so busy today.

204
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,260
What's wrong, honey?

205
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,130
Nothing.

206
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,650
Then, you should go to bed.
I'm almost done here.

207
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,340
After this,
I'll go take a shower and sleep too.

208
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,610
Goodnight, honey.

209
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,770
Yes, mom.

210
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,110
Come on.

211
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,120
Let's go.

212
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,100

Thank you so much. Goodbye.

244
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,610
Miss Wan.

245
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,440
Why did you do that to me?

246
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,960
Why can't I do that to you?

247
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,130
This is just the beginning.

248
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,210
But you're an adult.

249
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,670
You should use your brain to separate...

250
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,099
What is work and what is personal matter.

251
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,750
And why should I do that?

252
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,650
You yourself can't even separate
what is right and what is wrong.

253
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,030
You destroyed one of your friend's life.

254
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,750
So, I will make you know...
What it feels like to be destroyed.

255
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:33,490
Wan, you bitch!

256
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,800
Now you call me bitch?

257
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,290
So, this is your true nature.

258
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,080
You would bring shame to this business
if you're still here.

259
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,020
There. You're free now.

260
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,530
And I do hope...

261
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,160
That you will do as well as your manager.

262
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,960
Don't even think...

263
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,880
That you can do that to me.

264
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,860
Why can't I do that to you?

265
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,130
For once, I pulled you from a lead role.

266
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,670
And after this...

267
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,340
I will tell everyone...

268
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,250
What your true nature is really like.

269
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,320
Go on.

270
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,430
Hit me.

271
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,890
Hit me if you dare.

272
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:24,930
Hit me hard.

273
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,970
You see security cam over there?

274
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,280
Come on, hit me.

275
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,850
Hit me. Do it.

276
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,420
Do it. Hit me hard.

277
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,370
Hit me.

278
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,100
Damn lucky. He didn't hit me for real.

279
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,370
What if he did?

280
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,520
My face is expensive.
I spent million on that.

281
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:49,740
Oh!

282
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,410
Hit me.

283
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,210
Hit me hard. Do it.

284
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,150
Hit me.

285
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,600
- Hit me. Hit me.
- It is that bad.

286
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,410
- Hit me if you dare.
- What is it?

287
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,670
- Hit me.
- Look at this.

288
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,010
- You see security cam over there?
- People are retweeting it.

289
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,660
Come on, hit me.

290
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,940
- Hit me.
- Uh-huh.

291
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,750
Hit me hard.

292
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,980
- Come on, hit me.
- Did Tle really want to hit Miss Wan?

293
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,640
This is too scandalous.

294
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,960
Title can't get away with it.

295
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,590
Miss Wan must have leak this clip to ruin him.

296
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,410
I thought you ended your friendship with him.

297
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,400
Do you still care about him?

298
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:26,900
No.

299
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,490
I just pity him.

300
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,160
But he did that to himself.

301
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:35,500
It can't be help.

302
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,390
Let's not talk about other anymore.

303
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,530
Let's talk about us.

304
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,260
What is it with you?

305
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,920
That wasn't enough?

306
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,130
Ashi. Mr. Tanada has confirm.

307
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,280
You need to go to Japan
to promote your film next week.

308
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,780
And do I still have any ongoing project?

309
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,990
Since you told me that day...

310
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,880
I never accept any gig for you.

311
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,230
In that case,

312
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,590
after I finished promoting the film in Japan...

313
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,770
I would like to take some rest.

314
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,810
And fully take care of my heart.

315
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,670
And about work.

316
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,200
I'll have Kevin help me find agency.

317
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,630
And I... will work there for a while.

318
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,940
Would that be fine by you, Miss Wan?

319
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,350
Are you sure about this?

320
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,320
I have to try.

321
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,720
If it's work, I'm gonna stay there long term.

322
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,800
I understand.

323
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,480
And I won't stop you.

324
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,440
But if you decide to take up job in Thailand...

325
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,550
I must be the one to take care of you, alright?

326
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,350
Alright.

327
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,660
No problem.

328
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,470
I know that you still can't move on from Punn.

329
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,480
But you don't have to do this.

330
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,650
I think long distance separation...

331
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,370
Might help me feel better.

332
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,380
Suit yourself.

333
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,990
But we'll be waiting for you here. No matter what.

334
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,210
And don't you want to go say goodbye
to Punn one last time?

335
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,750
He might stopped being mad at you by now.

336
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,110
Hmm.

337
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,600
I agree.

338
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,840
Go say goodbye to him one last time.

339
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:38,980
Maybe you return.

340
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:52,470
Dream.

341
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:53,720
Wait.

342
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:58,730
I'm sorry.

343
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,690
I love you, Dream.

344
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,390
Cut. Cut.

345
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,370
What?

346
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:30,800
What's wrong with you?

347
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,610
Diaw. Pai.

348
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,650
Can I have one more take?

349
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:35,050
Huh?

350
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,540
Why did you freeze just now, Pai?

351
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,240
Because Diaw kissed me for real.

352
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,630
I was into my character.

353
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,870
That was my first kiss too.

354
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,540
Really?

355
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,830
What are you smiling about?

356
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,910
Nothing.

357
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,350
Alright, alright.

358
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,450
One more. One more.

359
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,210
Can I kiss you one more time?

360
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,120
Oi! I'm done. Not worth it.

361
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,470
- Come on. Just help us.
- Let's go. Let's go.

362
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,670
Come on, Pai. Just one take.
Go, go.

363
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,980
I'm ready to be your brother-in-law, Punn.

364
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,060
Go.

365
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,180
Go.

366
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,510
My brother-in-law... I mean...
Diaw, return to your spot.

367
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:13,720
Action.

368
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,160
Dream. Wait.

369
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:27,800
I'm sorry.

370
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:43,870
Hello, mom.

371
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,060
Oh,Ashi. Hi.

372
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,470
I have to apologize...

373
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,410
To make Punn sad.

374
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,030
I know it's a terrible thing that can't be forgive.

375
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,990
It's okay, Ashi. I understand.

376
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,530
Sometime, you can be confused...

377
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,960
Between your work and personal life.

378
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,580
Can I see Punn one last time...

379
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,890
Before I move to Japan.

380
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,030
I'm not sure about that.

381
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:16,530
Punn went out to shoot short film with Pai today.

382
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,040
I'm sorry, mom.

383
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,090
It's okay, Ashi.

384
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,590
It's okay. It's okay.

385
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,010
Hey. Punn.

386
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,290
May I?

387
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,960
Go. Go.

388
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:56,560
Hmm...

389
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,680
Do you think I should follow them?

390
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:03,870
That's no good.

391
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,820
Help me with the tray.

392
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:07,680
Follow me.

393
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:09,830
Quick.

394
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:20,790
Punn...

395
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,420
Just listen to me.

396
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,290
I need to talk to you.

397
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,350
I know you will never forgive me.

398
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,520
But what I wrote...

399
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,370
It truly came from my heart.

400
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:46,920
I love you, Punn.

401
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:49,880
I love you all these time.

402
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,930
You always in my heart.

403
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,770
You always in my mind.

404
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,310
When I'm in the scene with Kevin...

405
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,510
I feel like...

406
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,860
You were the one who's there with me.

407
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,500
Because that was my true feeling
from my heart.

408
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,500
I'm sorry.

409
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,910
Sorry for thinking that way.

410
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,880
I just can't stop my feeling.

411
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,070
I never use your affection...

412
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,450
To trick you.

413
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,430

(JAPAN)

435
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,320
I understand you, Ashi-san.

436
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,880
But if you still can't move on from Punn-san.

437
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,800
After we're done with movie premiere...

438
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,030
You should go back to see Punn-san.

439
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,920
That won't be possible now.

440
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,460
Thing between me and Pun...

441
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,090
Is already over.

442
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,040
Life is a gamble.

443
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,670
And we...

444
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,510
Are the one who choose our own path.

445
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,090
In the end, no matter what is the result...

446
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,050
We should accept it.

447
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,970
And move on with our life.

448
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,420
My dad taught me that.

449
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,670
If you still love him...

450
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,960
Why can't you forgive him?

451
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,940
I know that you're still love him.

452
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,640
And your love toward him...

453
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,800
Must have no end, right?

454
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,780
Ashi said...

455
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,220
When he was acting with Kevin...

456
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,540
He always saw Kevin as Punn.

457
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:43,850
That's mean when he shows his love
to anyone else,...

458
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,270
He doesn't want his loves...

459
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,230
Belongs to anyone else but you.

460
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,810
You must understand him, Punn.

461
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:06,210
And right now, all decision is up to you.

462
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,340
Keep fighting.

463
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,110
And have you talk you Punn?

464
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,780
Since Ashi move to Japan...

465
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,070
I never talk to him.

466
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,590
We meet and we part.

467
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,560
That's the way of life.

468
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,710
And what about you and your Doctor Ning?

469
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,040
He decided to move in with me in my condo.

470
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,680
Congratulations to you.

471
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:40,080
Finally, you have found your soulmate.

472
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,890
Hello.

473
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:55,560
What did you say?

474
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,250
Punn wants to go to Japan?

475
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,800
You're not mad at Ashi anymore?

476
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:01,650
Yes.

477
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,950
That's why I'm asking you for a favor.

478
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,300
Of course.

479
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,740
Are you sure?

480
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,170
Can you accompany Punn to Japan?

481
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,060
Huh?

482
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,280
Mmm...

483
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:14,670
I'll go by myself.

484
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,870
No can do. I'm worry about you.

485
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,980
You're acting like I've never been there.

486
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:23,730
Daddy Muang.

487
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,520
I guess I'll have to take urgent flight again.

488
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,470
I might have to ask you one more...

489
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,570
I know what you're going to say.

490
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,860
You still haven't pay me from last time.

491
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,290
Do it for friend or your son.

492
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:41,960
Can you do that, Daddy Muang?

493
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,350
Alright.

494
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,410
It's always me.

495
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,130
So...

496
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:51,960
Is that a yes?

497
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,050
Don't you want to tell Ashi first?

498
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,970
Something like this has to be a surprise.

499
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,300
Ashi will be please.

500
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,790
It was a long way for them to be together again.

501
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:37,890
But when two people loves,
they will always find each other.

502
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,400
When they're together,
the world seems more vibrant for them.

503
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,200
And people around them can feel the joy too.

504
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,900
Are you saying you're not happy with me.

505
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,820
Who said I'm not happy.

506
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,510
I'm so happy I'm about to burst.

507
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,530
I'm very happy too.

508
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,450
I wish all the obstacle in our life...

509
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,540
Will be the things of the past.

510
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,620
I wish to fall in love with Ashi...

511
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,680
agian.

512
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,900
Even though, I'm in Japan...

513
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,750
But my feeling of missing Punn...

514
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,300
Is very much all the same.

515
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:59,360
It's only get stronger everyday.

516
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,520
I wish to all things that holy...

517
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,420
Please help me fall in love...

518
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,160
Like before.

519
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,820
I love Punn.

520
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,350
I love Punn...

521
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,430
With all my only heart.

522
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:31,440
