00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,770
I don't think I'll have another chance to be close to Ashi.

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,070
If you don't, create your own chance.

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,640
It's you

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,000
who rode a motorcycle to send Ashi off last evening.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,730
Tell your mom

she truly knows me well.

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,190
You've got more than a fan crush on Ashi, don't you?

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,760
You have to do whatever I tell you to.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,800
I heard Ming goes to the bar every night.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,610
He wants to date out of his league.

12
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,760
Were you mocking me with your grilled meat?

13
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,330
I don't think he bought it.

14
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,040
He probably made it himself.

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,500
How did you know?

16
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,160
The texture is bad.

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,870
The thickness of the meat is not even.

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,580
The meat is even burnt.

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,680
He put a band-aid on his finger.

20
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,989
I think he was cut by a knife.

21
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,460
You're good at observing and analyzing.

22
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:08,810
I'm smart.

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,130
That's what you think idea.

24
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,690
Who would make grilled meat himself?

25
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,750
I think it was bought nearby.

27
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,730
You made the grilled meat, didn't you?

28

You don't have to do this.

29
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,780
Don't force yourself if you can't do it in the future.

30
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,270
Look, you hurt yourself.

You're so stubborn.

34
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,940
Does it hurt a lot?

35
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,130
A little.

I don't like him.

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,010
I think he's trying to get close to us.

46
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,350
No way.

47
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,079
He seems very sincere.

48
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,040
He shows it clearly.

00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,680
Can't you see?

50
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,250
Be careful. Don't ruin your reputation because of him.

51
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,030
You have a huge prejudice against him.

52

81
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,730
I don't think so.

the reason why he's good to us and Ashi

157
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,299
is because

158
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,390
he wants to use Ashi to get famous.

the bandage will get wet,

179
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,450

00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,800
or am I dreaming?

192

What's wrong? Does your wound hurt?

193

No.

194
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,200
Don't listen to Mingmuang too much next time.

195
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,890
He always teases people.

196
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,390

I'm hungry too.

213
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,780

Eat.

What are you looking at?

229
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,560
I think it's inconvenient for you to use chopsticks.

It's okay.

234
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,600

It was like a dream.

348
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,560
I think Ashi allowed you to go to his house

349
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,240
because he's seen your sincerity.

350
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,360
I'm not afraid to do anything for Ashi.

351
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,070
But I don't know what the people around him will think,

353
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,550
She's Ashi's manager.

00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,170
Yeah.

If it were me,

356
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,490
I'd tell Ms. Wan directly.

357
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:42,740
“Ms. Wan, I like Ashi.

Do you want me to help you as your brother?

363
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,570
It's none of your business.

00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,680
It's your brother's business.

365
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,140
He has to say it himself.

366
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,670
And you, my child,

367

I think you did a good job.

368

You just need to show him your sincerity, right?

369
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,050
Then let it be.

370
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,910

00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,840
This job will make you famous.

379
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,210
I'm tired enough just reading the script for the TV show alone.

380
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,760
What do you mean?

381
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,660
Don't tell me you're discouraged.

382
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,610
It's not like that.

383
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,810
It's not like that? Then what is it?

384
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,480
Don't tell me someone said something to you.

385
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,560
You're getting further off-topic.

386
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,760
No one said anything to me.

387
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,180
I want to talk to people every day now,

388
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,360
but I can't say anything.

389
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,000
Title, where are you going?

390
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,630
Let's make this clear, Title.

391
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,840
Do you think you'll get anything if you don't listen to me?

392
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,230
Calm down.

393
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,850
I think he's just under too much pressure.

394
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,780
Everyone has pressure.

395
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,250
I'm stressed too, but I never give up.

396
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,550
But isn't there still some time

397
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,110
before the director comes to Thailand?

398
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,290
Yes.

399
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,670
Give him some time.

400
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,470
But I can't lose to Ms. Wan this time.

401
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,780
Besides,

402
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,990
if he becomes the leading actor of this Japanese movie,

403
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,930
he can pave the way for your future.

404
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,000
No, Ms. Preaw.

405
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,540
As long as I'm pretty in Thailand,

406
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,690
the rich guys will line up to pursue me.

407
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,910
I see. That's how short-sighted you are.

408
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,360
Isn't this what you taught me

409
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,530
before my debut?

410
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,550
Who taught you?

411
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,270
I didn't teach or say anything.

412
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:54,010
Someone said she'd introduce me

413
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,470
to wealthy businessmen,

414
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,050
but I haven't seen any of them.

415
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,820
[All you think about is men]

416
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,790
Why did you call me here in a mysterious way?

417
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,210
Hello?

418
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,940
What's wrong with you?

419
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,750
Daddy Mingmuang,

420
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,190
give this to Ashi for me.

421
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,040
Why don't you do it yourself?

422
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,710
[I'm going to bed, Grandma]

423
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,420
[What are you here for?]

424
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,930
[Please give this to Ashi]

425
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,800
[Don't say it's from me]

426
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,030
[Don't open it]

427
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:34,950
[It's a secret]

428
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,330
[Okay]

429
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,050
My grandma asked me to give this to Ashi

430
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,080
after she found out he was the leading actor.

431
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,230
She also told me many times not to tell anyone that it was from her.

432
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,130
Your grandma must be a fan of Ashi too.

433
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,520
She never watches dramas.

434
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,140
She only watches the news.

435
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,280
Thank you, Daddy Mingmuang.

436
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,760
Take Ashi home today.

437
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,410
Take care of him.

438
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,440
Okay.

439
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,030
Good boy, my son.

440
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:12,970
Yeah.

441
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,920
Can Ashi get used to

442
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,640
riding a motorcycle often?

443
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,980
He can hug my waist again.

444
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,680
No need to explain.

445
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,200
Go back and find Lady Rapeeponpun.

446
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:39,910
I'm just a useless woman.

447
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,600
Let me explain.

448
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,460
Cut.

449
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,500
Okay, let's change the scene.

450
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,700
Ms. Film,

451
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,570
I'm done with my scene, right?

452
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:16,760
Yeah.

453
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,840
I'll go back then. Bye.

454
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,810
Bye, Mr. Pol.

455
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,170
OK. Bye.

456
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,150
Ms. Wan.

457
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:23,860
Let's go.

458
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,020
Where are we going?

459
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,410
To the event site.

460
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,110
What? I thought you said you were going alone.

461
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,970
I didn't drive here.

462
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,420
You have to drive me there,

463
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,090
or I'll be late. Hurry.

464
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,360
What about Ashi?

465
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,910
Let's not worry about him.

466
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,380
Worry about me first.

467
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,350
Go ahead.

468
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,350
I can go by myself.

469
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,190
-Let's go. -Okay.

470
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,940
Let's go.

471
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,750
Why are you in such a hurry?

472
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,650
Hurry up. We're going to be late.

473
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,650
Aren't you going to change?

474
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,190
It's okay. I told the costume department.

475
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,250
Wait, are you planning something?

476
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,780
What plan?

477
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,840
You know I have an event.

478
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,930
It's the plan to make Pun take Ashi home, right?

479
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,520
If I wanted Ashi and Pun to go together,

480
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,960
I would have told you.

481
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,990
I don't believe you.

482
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,590
I saw you talking to him secretly.

483
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,130
We were just chatting.

484
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,700
I know you're helping him.

485
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,270
I just want to give him a chance.

486
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,350
If you believe that Ashi won't be swayed by love,

487
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,610
he will give up by himself.

488
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,010
Or...

489
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,460
Are you scared?

490
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,740
I'm not.

491
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,970
I've never been afraid of anyone.

492
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,960
Okay, it's settled then.

493
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,780
Give him a chance to prove it.

494
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,270
Let's go. We're going to be late.

495
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,230
Let's talk in the car.

496
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,740
Thank you, Pun.

497
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,130
I cause you trouble again.

498
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:22,860
It's okay.

499
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,430
You can always order me around.

500
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,930
Are you serious?

501
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,490
Yes.

502
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,270
Then, help me do the laundry,

503
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,500
clean my house,

504
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,870
wash the dishes and the toilet,

505
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,590
and change my bed sheets. Is that okay?

506
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,770
Do you really want my help?

507
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,590
I don't think you're good at it.

508
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,590
I've never done it before.

509
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,750
My mom does it for me.

510
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,340
You're so lucky.

511
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,280
You have your mom by your side.

512
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,110
I'm sorry for reminding you of your mom.

513
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,840
It's okay. I miss her all the time.

514
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,830
I think your mom must be proud of you.

515
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,380
Thank you.

516
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:19,500
You're welcome.

517
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,040
I'll go back first.

518
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:29,890
Give it to me.

519
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,250
A new helmet?

520
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,180
I bought it for you.

521
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,430
I'm sorry.

522
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:15,950
Pun.

523
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:18,610
Grandma.

524
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,250
You're still up?

525
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:20,920
Yeah.

526
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,150
What did Ashi say?

527
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:24,990
What is it?

528
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,140
About the thing I told you to give to him.

529
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,420
I don't know either.

530
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,490
What?

531
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,420
You told me not to tell him whom it was from.

532
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,490
I just want to know

533
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:40,210
how he reacted when he received it.

534
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:44,230
Was he excited or did he peep?

535
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,240
Excuse me.

536
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,200
Hello.

537
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,760
Are you home?

538
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,310
Ashi.

539
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,320
I am. What's wrong?

540
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,160
I received the thing you gave to me.

541
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,310
A scarf.

542
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,680
I like it.

543
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,360
How did you know?

544
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,120
Mingmuang told me that you gave it to me.

545
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,650
But it wasn't from me.

546
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,170
It doesn't matter whom it's from.

547
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:30,480
For me, every gift is precious.

548
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,410
Okay.

549
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,560
I won't bother you anymore.

550
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,670
That's it.

551
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,870
Okay, bye.

552
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,940
Ashi said he liked it.

553
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,000
Every gift is precious to him.

554
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,330
Oh, really?

555
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,160
Yes.

556
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,410
I'll go upstairs now.

557
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:50,870
Okay.

558
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,070
I'm so happy.

559
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,040
Yes. Yes. Yes.

560
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,300
Ashi, I'm going to bed.

561
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:08,770
Good night.

562
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,870
[Hello]

563
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,030
Ashi.

564
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:36,550
[I want to order a cup of coffee tomorrow]

565
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,630
[No problem]

566
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,560
No problem.

567
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,420
Same as before.

568
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:46,950
[Same as before]

569
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,540
Good night.

570
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:09,990
[Good night]

571
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,410
Ashi.

572
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,220
Kiss.

573
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,920
See? They're always together.

574
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,480
Pun picks up Ashi every day,

575
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,260
and Ashi sits on the back of the motorcycle.

576
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,890
It's very dangerous.

577
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,540
I'm afraid I'll have to prohibit it.

578
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,320
Ashi is not a child anymore.

579
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,410
You can't prohibit it just because you want to.

580
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,190
But I don't think it's appropriate.

581
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,950
Understand? Inappropriate.

582
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,820
You're afraid that your treasure will be stolen, right?

583
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,660
Are you crazy?

584
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,270
Who would think that?

585
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,850
But I know you think so.

586
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,730
Don't worry.

587
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,180
I think he has a sense of boundaries

588
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,380
and takes good care of Ashi.

589
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,780
But you know how Pun feels too, right?

590
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,770
It's better to be loved than to be hated.

591
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,110
Pun doesn't ask for anything in return.

592
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:13,370
You're blindly siding with him.

593
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,449
Who doesn't ask for anything in return,

594
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:16,610
especially from people like us?

595
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,820
A lot of people want to gain benefits from us.

596
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,240
Delivery is here.

597
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,600
I'm here to deliver food.

598
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,710
I'm coming in.

599
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,710
I only ordered coffee and dessert.

600
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,840
Why did you buy so much?

601
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,570
I thought you might be hungry,

602
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,620
so I bought some food you like at the market.

603
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,250
Then I'll only pay for coffee and dessert.

604
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,360
The rest has nothing to do with me.

605
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,650
It doesn't matter.

606
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,330
I could have treated you anyway.

607
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,990
Go eat.

608
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,650
Eat with me.

609
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,810
Which one do you want to eat first?

610
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,740
There are Kuey Teow in Tom Yum Soup, chicken rice,,

611
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,520
fried noodles with soy sauce and dessert.

612
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,120
Oh.

613
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,390
You know what I like to eat?

614
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,390
I think you must want to eat grilled meat and sticky rice.

615
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,240
Don't tell me you made it yourself too.

616
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,590
I can't make it.

617
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,520
I bought it from the best restaurant in the market.

618
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:16,910
Which one do you want?

619
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,030
Then I'll have grilled meat and sticky rice.

620
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,440
Okay, hold on.

621
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,540
The meat is here.

622
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,440
Aren't you eating?

623
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,490
You can eat first.

624
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,890
I'll get you some coffee.

625
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,860
Here's your coffee.

626
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,660
It'd be nice

627
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,100
if someone takes care of me like this every day.

628
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,130
Doesn't Ms. Wan take care of you?

629
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:28,080
She's my manager, not a nanny.

630
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,740
She doesn't do everything.

631
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,770
I saw she always picked you up.

632
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,380
I thought a celebrity's manager

633
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,380
had to take care of all the celebrity's business.

634
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,340
She only takes care of the important parts.

635
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:45,100
She won't interfere in my private matters.

636
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,590
I'm sorry.

637
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:01,660
What's wrong?

638
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,260
I forgot my mom asked me to buy something.

639
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,900
I'm going to buy something for her.

640
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,810
You eat. I'm leaving.

641
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,640
I don't believe

642
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:36,490
love does exist.

643
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,820
Title, can't you remember these few lines?

644
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,350
Of course, I can.

645
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,080
I'm just not confident.

646
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,610
Give me the script.

647
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,400
Focus. Say it again.

648
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:51,900
Come on.

649
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,370
I don't believe…

650
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,160
I don't believe...

651
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,160
I don't believe love does exist.

652
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,970
That's just a lie.

653
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,570
Hey, what's going on?

654
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:09,860
Why can't you memorize it?

655
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,290
Why are you putting so much pressure on me?

656
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,760
Can you give me some time?

657
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,870
I'll give you time.

658
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:17,610
I'll give you time.

659
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,210
I've given you a lot of time.

660
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,760
When will you be ready?

661
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,910
When can you beat Ashi?

662
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,760
Didn't you say I was more suitable for this role?

663
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,620
I have a better chance than Ashi.

664
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:33,080
That's right,

665
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,980
but I also said

666
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,990
you had to memorize the lines

667
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,460
and perform well.

668
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,780
Only that will do.

669
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:42,090
But you're still afraid that I'll lose to Ashi.

670
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,570
Who am I doing this for?

671
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,820
Isn't it for you?

672
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,360
No.

673
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,560
You want to beat Ms. Wan.

674
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,260
Title.

675
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,650
I'm leaving. Bye.

676
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:53,940
Title.

677
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,280
[Hello, Ms. Preaw]

678
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,800
[What can I do for you?]

679
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,210
Ban, are you free tomorrow?

680
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,880
[I thought a celebrity's manager]

681
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,800
[had to take care of all the celebrity's business]

682
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,090
[She only takes care of the important parts]

683
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,830
[But she won't interfere in my private matters]

684
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,810
Pun, why are you back so early?

685
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:02,220
Did something happen?

686
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,760
I thought you were going to stay at his place.

687
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,190
I don't know why I feel guilty.

688
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,060
What happened? Tell me.

689
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:17,190
I forgot who Ashi is.

690
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:21,380
The person I know is the person he wants me to know.

691
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,770
He just met me too.

692
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:25,930
I think

693
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,900
I seem to have disturbed his private life.

694
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,330
Did he get tired of you, kid?

695
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:34,930
No.

696
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,590
I just think so.

697
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,990
I think you think too much.

698
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,670
It's nothing.

699
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,020
Are you overthinking this?

700
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:47,330
Mom, Ashi is a public figure.

701
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,600
He wants his own private space too,

702
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,670
but Pun broke into that space.

703
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,250
It's good that he didn't send him home.

704
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:56,700
No way.

705
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,820
If he wanted to drive Pun away,

706
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,800
I think he would have done it long ago.

707
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,220
He wouldn't have let your brother go in and out of his house.

708
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,060
Right, kid?

709
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,060
He's a celebrity.

710
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,620
Of course he has to build his persona.

711
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,060
You, Paii,

712
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,240
do you have to make things worse?

713
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,500
I'm telling the truth.

714
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,480
Only then can Pun see the truth

715
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,630
instead of being immersed in a wonderful fantasy world.

716
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,060
Excuse me.

717
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:30,000
[Ashi]

718
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:04,990
[Be Mine. Superstar]

719
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,430
Oh, Ashi.

720
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,040
Ashi.

721
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:12,400
Let's sleep together.

722
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,170
[Sleep together?]

723
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:20,340
I can tell you there will be a surprise

724
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:21,700
at tomorrow's audition.

725
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:25,370
Come on, Ashi.

726
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,570
I still feel the same.

727
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:29,320
I still love you like I used to.

728
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:33,480
It's been nine years and I'll keep loving you.
