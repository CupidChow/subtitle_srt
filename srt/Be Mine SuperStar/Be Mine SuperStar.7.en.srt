Do we have to finish it?

00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,740
Yes.

00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,340
Hey.

Pour me some liquor.

Stop drinking.

Enough.

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,970
Your brother is out of control.

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,690
Pour it up. Hurry up.

15
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,070
Okay, I'll do it for you.

16
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,370
Fill it up.

00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,050
-Fill it up. More. -Okay.

18
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,460
Okay, fill it up.

19
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,210
It's full.

20
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:38,510
Here.

21
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,580
Drink it.

22
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:40,760
It's full.

23
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,130
-Enjoy it. -It's my business.

24
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:43,950
It's spilling.

25
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:44,950
Hey.

26
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,580
Why are you drinking so fast? You'll get drunk.

27

28
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,620

29
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:03,500
I've been watching him for nine years.

30
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,530
But it's meaningless.

31
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,039
Hey.

32
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:12,980
Luckily it wasn't full.

33
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,020
Are you taking a shower?

34
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,289
Who is he talking about? I want to know.

00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,550
Who made my friend so sad?

36
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,420
Are you asking me?

37
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,640
-Yes. -Yes.

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,060
You know it best.

39
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,270
Tell us.

00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,810
Are you kidding me?

41
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,930
You're his friends. If you didn't know it,

42
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:33,860
how would I know?

43
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,539
Goodness.

44
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,750
How could you not know?

45
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,840
You know it best.

46
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,590
Cut it out.

47
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,330
Tell us, who hurt him?

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,710
Say something.

If I want to date you,

52
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,590
is that okay?

53
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,110
Hey, Mingmuang.

54
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,160
Where are you?

55
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,060
I have something to do.

56
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,980
What is it?

57
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,250
Is it convenient for you to talk now?

58
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,610
Sure, go ahead.

59
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,780
I want to know

60
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,480
how it feels

61
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,390
for a boy to like a boy?

62
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,680
I can't answer it.

63
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,720
I just like him.

64
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,110
This is different from liking cats and dogs.

65
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,510
I can tell why I like him.

66
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,900
But I think,

67
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,520
you need to open your heart first.

68
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,470
How do you feel

69
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,350
when you like Dr. Ning?

70
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,670
To be honest,

71
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,830
I liked

72
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,740
being intimate with him,

73
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,750
because that was the feeling I'd been looking for

74
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,590
and he gave me a good reaction,

75
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,070
which made me no longer horny.

76
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,060
He made me want to be intimate with him only.

77
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,100
The more I meet him, the more I know him,

78
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,100
I know

79
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,230
he's the person I've been looking for.

80
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,400
I want to stay by his side all the time.

81
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,410
It's a kind of reassuring.

82
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,700
Although he looks cold,

83
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:35,290
and doesn't show any emotions,

84
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,290
I want to do everything to make him happy.

85
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,159
I don't know if this is love.

86
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,520
Thank you for telling me this.

87
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,530
What about you? Do you feel the same about Pun?

88
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,640
Go on with your work.

89
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,160
I won't disturb you.

Okay, see you.

I don't know.

92
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,320
He broke up when I saw him today.

93
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,650
I don't believe it.

94
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,250
Tell us who dumped him.

95
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,710
A friend, a senior or a junior?

96
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,460
Why are you keeping it a secret?

97
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,570
Well, I can tell you.

98
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,710
Yeah, he's a senior. Are you satisfied?

99
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,670
S senior?

100
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,500
From where he went?

101
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,400
No, not from where he was an intern.

102
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,600
I didn't even say it was.

103
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,500
He had a crush on a senior during his internship.

104
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:43,980
Really?

105
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,040
Which senior?

106
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,330
If you don't tell us,

00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,530
Don't, Gus.

110
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,030
Take pity on him.

111
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,830
Then tell us.

112
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,970
-Tell us. -Huh?

113
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,970
I have to answer the phone first. It may be Mom.

114
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:03,780

Right.

117
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,470
Are you trying to buy time by answering the phone?

118
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,140

Where is Pun?

126
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,890
He's drunk.

127
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,810
Send me the address.

128
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,580
I'll pick him up.

129
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,620
Okay.

130
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,810
I'll send it to you right now.

131
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,630
What's wrong with him?

132
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,380
Gus, Seu, Diyao.

133
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,120
I'll take him home.

134
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,010
-What? -Mom came to pick him up.

135
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:54,580
What?

136
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:56,990
-Let's go home. -What?

137
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,409
-Paii. -Get up.

138
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,060
You can pay first.

139
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,300
He's drunk.

140
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,340
Wait.

141
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,430
You invited us here and asked us to pay?

142
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,180
As if this is the first time.

143
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,340
I'll ask him to pay you

144
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,540
when he sobers up.

145
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,440

146
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,250
-Okay. -Bye.

Yes.

-Yes. -Yes.

152
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,800
-It wasn't his mother. -Should we go follow them?

153
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,410
-Let's go. -Hurry.

154
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,250
Excuse me, we'll pay later.

155
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:28,730
Go.

156
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:31,810
Huh?

157
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,630
Oh.

158
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,920
Paii, where are you taking me?

159
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,280
Ashi is coming to pick you up.

160
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,870
Be careful.

161
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,430
Don't mention this name again.

162
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,490
I want to forget him.

163
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,380
He's here.

164
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,680
Let's get in the car.

165
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,920
How are you going back?

166
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,550
Do you want to go with me?

167
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,390
No.

168
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,550
Take him back to calm down.

169
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,120
Paii.

170
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,080
Here, Ashi.

171
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,380
This is his phone.

172
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,910
Why does the taxi driver smell

173
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,960
like Ashi's shampoo?

174
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,140
You can take him wherever you want.

175
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,390
But if you and my brother get together and abandon him,

176
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,700
I won't let you go.

177
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,100
Hey.

178
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,880
Hey.

179
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,220
Where are you going?

180
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,000
Who was that?

181
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,940
That was my mom.

182
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,400
-No. -You're drunk. Go back and drink.

183
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,980
We saw it. It's not your mom.

184
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,470
Go back and drink.

185
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,260
-I haven't paid yet. -Go and pay.

186
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,860
Pay me.

187
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,850
-Look over there. -What?

188
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,630
Stop.

189
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,990
Come back and pay the money.

190
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,580
Hello?

191
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,200
If today

is a new beginning of something,

193
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,610
I want to start over with someone,

194
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,320
Someone special

195
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,670
who has been with me

196
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,960
at every moment of my life.

197
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,340
I want to follow my heart.

198
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,840
Just this once.

199
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,050
Huh.

200
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,410
Ashi.

201
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,400
Ashi.

202
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,240
Are you ready to listen to my answer?

203
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,140
Yes.

204
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,620
♫I've been here for you♫

205
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,920
♫If you turn around, you'll know♫

206
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,260
♫Everything I've been trying so hard♫

207
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:44,120

♫Do you hear that?♫

213
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,200
Is this true?

214
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:48,880
Am I dreaming?

215
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,170
Pun.

216
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,850
It's true.

217
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,340
Pun.

218
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,540
It's really your perfume.

219
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,140
Thank you.

220
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:06,600
♫I want to thank Destiny for bringing you to me that day♫

221
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,920

00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,840
♫I've been in love for a long time♫

00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,390

Do you love me?

227
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:29,840
If I didn't,

228
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,850
why would I do this?

229
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:38,150
♫I don't know if there will be such a good chance♫

230
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,110

♫Do you hear that?♫

241
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,210
Are we here for our honeymoon?

242
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,330
No.

243
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,270
We're just here for a date.

244
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,160
We need to wait for our honeymoon.

245
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,980
Can't we celebrate them at once?

246
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,280
Ashi.

247
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,180
From now on, don't call me brother.

248
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,030
Why?

249
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:15,570
To bring us closer.

250
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,970
No.

251
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,310
You don't want to look old.

252
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,620
As if you know what I think.

253
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,420
Are you teasing me?

254
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,840
Are you?

255
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,600
Are you?

256
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:34,890
Are you teasing me?

257
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,310
Do you give up?

258
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,280
Where's Ashi?

259
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,410
He didn't come with me.

260
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,360
Sister, don't call him.

261
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,740
He went on a date with Pun out of Bangkok.

262
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,490
What? Why didn't I know?

263
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,810
How would you know?

264
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,130
If neither he nor I told you about it,

265
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,620
how would you know?

266
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,650
How could you do this to me?

267
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,210
Why are you in such a good mood this morning?

268
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,280
Dr. Ning and I

269
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,280
have decided to date.

270
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,300
I thought most medical students

271
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,280
were nerds.

272
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,320
Why?

273
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,040
Can't doctors drink or hang out?

274
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,720
I thought actors like you

275
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,180
would be role models for the public.

276
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,630
You don't come out to play or drink.

277
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,120
-Nor do you… -Oh, doctor.

278
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm human too.

279
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,790
Doctors are humans too.

280
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,380
So we can do what others can,

281
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,150
as long as it's proper.

282
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,350
The more I talk to you, the more I like you.

283
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,670
You said that without thinking.

284
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,670
I'm serious. I thought about it.

285
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,860
Let me ask you.

286
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:05,230
Do you hate me since we met?

287
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,630
Then can you date me?

288
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,170
You want to date me

289
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,490
because of sex, right?

290
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:16,980
Yes,

291
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,110
because it's a part of a couple's life.

292
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,690
If we're sexually incompatible,

293
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,530
we won't be able to be a good couple either.

294
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,730
But that's not everything.

295
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,140
You have a lot of things I like about you.

296
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,230
Since I met the right person,

297
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,730
I don't want this chance to slip away.

298
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,600
Have you ever thought about asking me?

299
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,450
Are you the right person for me?

300
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,030
If you don't forgive me,

301
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,330
I'll kneel here forever.

302
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,920
Stop acting.

303
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,370
I'm not acting with you.

304
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,560
I'm not acting.

305
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,340
I'm serious.

306
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,170
I don't care what others think of me,

307
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,740
because

308
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,100
my whole heart belongs to you.

309
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,380
Then get up.

310
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,220
I'm not getting up. Please forgive me first.

311
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,130
About what?

312
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,720
My heart hurts.

313
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,270
Are you mad at me for a lot of things?

314
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,660
Wait, Doctor.

315
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:40,460
Doctor.

316
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,100
Do you hate me that much?

317
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,660
I hate you now,

318
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,560
because you don't respect me.

319
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:52,980
I'm sorry.

320
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,710
You should know

321
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,450
I may not be a reputable doctor.

322
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,520
It's just

323
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,390
that no one has ever criticized me,

324
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,820
because I didn't hurt anyone's interests

325
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,910
or hurt anyone's feelings.

326
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:16,670
But if we decide to date in the future,

327
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,200
someone will be sad

328
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,450
and unwilling to let us date.

329
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,910
If that day comes

330
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,890
and my past is revealed,

331
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,240
can you accept everything that happened?

332
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,310
Don't forget that you're a public figure.

333
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,140
You have to pay for everything.

334
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,940
If I could hold your hand,

335
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,360
I will never let you go.

336
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,180
Gosh.

337
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,000
You two can't date at the same time.

338
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,680
Love doesn't wait, sister.

339
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,980
You'll understand when you're in a relationship.

340
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,650
To me,

341
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,710
only money can buy everything.

342
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,250
Only money can make me fly higher.

343
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,510
And you have to

344
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,550
make money for me.

345
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,630
My gosh.

346
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,770
You just go to the club

347
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,460
with the money we earned, right?

348
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,590
That's my business and my happiness.

349
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,420
I can give the money to anyone.

350
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,250
I can pay anyone with the money.

351
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,550
Your job is to make money for me, okay?

352
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,960
I miss that feeling.

353
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:53,100
I should have called the three of you.

354
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,070
Paii.

355
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,700
Why did you let your brother leave like that?

356
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,040
I thought that was his chance.

357
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,870
I know, but you have to tell me first.

358
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,860
It was late last night.

359
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,080
Besides, Pun is an adult.

360
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,630
I know.

361
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,560
But shouldn't you tell me first

362
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,560
if you were going out?

363
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,360
If you're worried, call him.

364
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,540
Why should I?

365
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,070
You call him.

366
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,520
No, you call him.

367
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,880
No, I'm busy.

368
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,120
No, I won't call him. You do it.

369
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,700
You don't know anything.

370
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,950
I'll do it.

371
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,230
Goodness.

372
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,560
We have a new order.

373
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,290
Two cappuccinos

374
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,500
and an Americano without ice.

375
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,610
Can you help me?

376
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,460
We have a new order.

377
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,980
Hurry up.

378
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,520
No, I'm done, Pun.

If the chance comes, I have to seize it.

565
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,790
But this character is Ashi's bodyguard.

566
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,790
He's just an extra.

567
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,790
Maybe he's just a minor role.

568
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,980
Did you read it?

569
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,810
I can guess the story without reading it.

570
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,140
Forget it.

571
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,600
Even if it's a minor role,

572
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,600
I'll take this as my chance

573
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,190
as long as I'm playing with Ashi.

574
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,980
I don't understand what you're thinking.

575
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,190
It's good that you don't understand.

576
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,320
This is between Ashi and me.

577
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:52,390
Anyway, thank you

578
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,930
for letting me be in this drama.

579
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,510
I have to say yes.

580
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,490
Think of it as a free trip to Japan.

581
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,190
If you can get a hit from someone

582
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,890
in the industry over there for this drama,

583
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,600
that's lucky.

584
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,790
Maybe you can get some other work.

585
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,240
I'm glad you think so.

586
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,420
I can feel relieved.

587
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:14,630
I gotta go. Bye.

588
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:28,640
Hello, Grandma.

589
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,740
Hello, Uncle and Aunt.

590
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:34,970
Hello, kid.

591
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,900
I'm here today

592
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:51,490
to tell you

593
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,960
that I'm dating Pun.

594
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,250
I want to tell you this in person

595
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,770
to show my sincerity.

596
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,480
Thank you, Ashi,

597
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,630
for caring about my son.

598
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:23,830
But...

599
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:26,810
But...

600
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,430
What should we do?

601
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,080
Mom may not be able to accept it.

602
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,290
I'm sorry, Grandma.

603
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,420
I know you may not be able to accept this,

604
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,450
but I want to tell you

605
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:50,650
that Pun and I love each other.

606
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,500
Yes, Grandma.

607
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,650
I'm sorry for hurting you.

608
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:01,580
But I've loved Ashi for a long time.

609
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,790
Please give me a chance

610
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,090
so we can prove…

611
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:07,780
Enough.

612
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,400
Have you known about this for a long time?

613
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,750
It means you've been hiding it from me.

614
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,510
My grandson has had a crush…

615
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,890
It's not like that, Grandma.

616
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,090
I didn't mean to hide it.

617
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:32,700
It's just

618
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,460
that I wasn't sure

619
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,980
if I could date Ashi.

620
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,940
But now,

621
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:43,580
my dream has come true.

622
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,840
That's great, kid.

623
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:51,380
It's great that you dare to tell the truth.

624
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:54,540
I'm so happy.

625
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,930
I didn't expect

626
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:58,230
that I now have Ashi as my grandson.

627
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:01,280
You are my beloved baby.

628
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,070
Come here.

629
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:11,850
I'm relieved.

630
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:15,210
You're so cute, kid.

631
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,360
I'm so happy.

632
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,880
Thank you for giving me a chance.

633
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,030
I can give you anything.

634
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:28,230
If Pun upsets you,

635
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:29,170
tell me.

636
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,380
I'll handle it.

637
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,120
As for you,

638
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:35,130
if you let him join our family,

639
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,220
you have to take care of each other

640
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,610
and don't leave each other behind, okay?

641
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,070
Yes, Grandma.

642
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,580
So cute.

643
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,790
Look at that.

644
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,430
All right.

645
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,430
Since you two decided to date,

646
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,880
you should understand each other

647
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,960
no matter what happens.

648
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,860
Understand?

649
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:04,720
No matter what happens,

650
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,260
you have to talk face to face

651
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,160
and tell the truth.

652
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:10,180
Don't ever lie.

653
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:10,790
Okay?

654
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:12,690
Yes, Grandma.

655
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,140
You're so handsome, kid.

656
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,530
I see you on TV every day.

657
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:18,370
But you look better in real life.

658
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:20,330
Look, your skin is so tender.

659
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:21,670
You have a nice nose too.

660
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:22,850
-Your mouth… -Did you see that?

661
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:23,920
I told you

662
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,450
Grandma was Ashi's fan.

663
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,470
No one believed me.

664
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:27,080
Paii.

665
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:28,670
What fan?

666
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,630
Earlobes or appendicitis?

667
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:32,890
You're a fan, Grandma.

668
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:35,170
Those who are obsessed with celebrities

669
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,650
are called fans.

670
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,710
Really?

671
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,750
Oh my.

672
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:42,270
I finally realized that I'm a fan of Ashi.

673
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,080
Cutie.

674
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:46,840
Cutie pie.

675
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,200
I should hug you again.

676
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,260
That's for sure.

677
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,390
Great.

678
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:54,010
Come on, kid.

679
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,450
I'm so happy.

680
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:00,270
You've never hugged me like this.

681
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:02,810
Then come here.

682
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:03,650
Really, Grandma?

683
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:04,530
Yes.

684
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:06,480
-Okay, Grandma. -Come on.

685
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,100
You're so jealous.

686
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,190
You've grown up.

687
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:25,270
What will happen to them?

688
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,540
What should I do to you, Pun?

689
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,200
Hello, Koi.

690
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,160
Hello, Wan.

691
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:45,860
I want to ask how Pun is doing.

692
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:49,200
Much better. Don't worry.

693
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,070
I'm relieved.

694
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:54,530
Let's start shooting next week.

695
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,880
As for the case,

696
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,280
you don't have to worry.

697
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,540
The police are tracking down the murderer.

698
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:05,080
They'll send someone to the crew to protect us.

699
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,520
That's great, Ms. Koi.

700
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:08,420
That way, the crew will feel at ease.

701
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,420
Oh, right, Ms. Koi.

702
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:12,710
I have something to discuss with you.

703
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:14,310
Go ahead.

704
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,830
About the intern named Pun,

705
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:20,200
what do you think of his looks?

706
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,120
He's good-looking.

707
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:25,120
You like him too?

708
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,730
What do you mean?

709
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,100
I heard from my agent

710
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,580
that someone recommended him to Mr. Dai.

711
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:33,480
Mr. Dai seems to pay attention to him too.

712
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,150
If you want to make him famous, make arrangements.

713
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:37,600
Otherwise, I can't make sure other agencies

714
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,360
won't take the lead.

715
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:40,040
Okay, Ms. Koi.

716
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,740
Thank you.

717
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,830
See you next week.

718
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:45,710
Okay, bye.

719
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,830
Did anyone recommend Pun to Mr. Dai?

720
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:52,330
Who is it?

721
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,140
Sabana,

722
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:58,260
you know I don't like this.

723
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:01,850
You have to tell me what you're going to do.

724
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:02,430
Grandma.

725
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:03,930
Why should I tell you?

726
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,150
This is my life.

727
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,500
Ashi is going back.

728
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,310
Really?

729
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,260
Ashi.

730
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,930
In the drama of “Sabana's Scheme”,

731
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,940
Mr. Dit is quite cunning.

732
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:16,230
It's just based on the script.

733
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,660
The drama is one thing.

734
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,210
Reality is another thing.

735
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:21,880
Don't mix it up.

736
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:22,900
Okay.

737
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:26,720
Your cooking is so good.

738
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,310
Really?

739
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,130
Yeah.

740
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,160
I haven't eaten something like this in a while.

741
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,310
Then come often,

742
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:33,880
so I can cook for you.

743
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:36,720
Are you going to stay long here?

744
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:39,890
If Ashi is here, I have to stay here.

745
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,390
Hey, Grandma.

746
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,180
I'll get going.

747
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,010
Okay, kid.

748
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,550
-Bye. -Bye.

749
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:50,520
Bye.

750
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,440
Come on, kid.

751
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:54,580
Be careful.

752
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,070
Okay.

753
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:55,860
Go.

754
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,770
Go see him off.

755
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,380
Okay, I'll see Ashi off.

756
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:03,530
Let's go.

757
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,380
As soon as you came to my house,

758
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:18,450
you won over the most powerful person in my family.

759
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,350
You know? You're lucky

760
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:25,480
to have understanding grandma, dad,

761
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,560
and younger brother.

762
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:28,470
And they support you to do anything.

763
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:33,340
I'm who I am today because of them.

764
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,800
I won't make them sad.

765
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,000
That's good.

766
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:41,110
Family is the most important.

767
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,560
Now

768
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:47,230
you are also my family.

769
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:53,510
I'm happy to meet you

770
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,880
and have these good experiences.

771
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,180
I feel relieved and happy

772
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,170
to be

773
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:07,270
your boyfriend.

774
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:13,640
Then,

775
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:16,810
you can move in with me,

776
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,780
and you'll be happy every day.

777
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,200
That day will come, Pun.

778
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,300
Wait for me.

779
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:29,910
I'll wait no matter how long it takes.

780
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:53,950
I'll get to do this every day at that time.

781
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,330
Drive safe.

782
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:16,650
The toad Pun.

783
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:20,110
I'm no longer a toad who wants to eat swan meat.

784
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:25,670
I'm going in.

785
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:45,020
Grandma.

786
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:46,250
What is it?

787
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,440
Thank you for treating Ashi.

788
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,570
I'm happy as long as you're happy.

789
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:05,490
Aren't you sad? You can't have a great-grandson.

790
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,650
Don't burden me.

791
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,180
I'm going to age in peace,

792
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,240
do what I've never done,

793
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,080
eat what I haven't eaten,

794
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,340
and go where I've never been.

795
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:22,050
It's time to return happiness to life.

796
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,670
I think other grandparents

797
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:29,970
like having children and grandchildren.

798
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:34,650
Everyone's happiness is different.

799
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,450
At this moment, I am very happy.

800
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:40,920
No matter what happens in the future,

801
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:43,020
you have to be strong.

802
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:47,670
Don't forget you'll always be watched over.

803
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,720
No matter what you do, think it through

804
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,010
and always stay rational.

805
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:52,710
Understand?

806
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,140
I'll do my best.

807
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:55,970
Good, kid.

808
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,840
Take your time to think about it.

809
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,230
If you can understand life,

810
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,540
you can understand the world.

811
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:03,380
Okay, Grandma.

812
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:06,200
Thank you.

813
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,450
I love you, my child.

814
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:08,730
I love you too, Grandma.

815
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:18,150
[Dragon's Desire]

816
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,540
Don't worry.

817
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,620
I'll act like before.

818
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:48,650
Only the way I look at you will change.

819
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:56,070
[His looks changed. That's the look of a lover]

820
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,920
Is that possible?

821
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,510
I'll no longer look at you as your admirer,

822
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:12,050
but as your lover.

823
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:44,350
[Be Mine. Superstar]

824
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,020
Did you just call me brother?

825
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,840
No.

826
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:49,550
Then you should be punished.

827
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:51,630
What punishment?

828
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:52,710
Pun.

829
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:53,900
All right.

830
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,330
Is that your fan?

831
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,880
I almost fell off.

832
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,890
Put it on when you go to Japan.

833
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,000
Put it on

834
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,660
when you miss me.
