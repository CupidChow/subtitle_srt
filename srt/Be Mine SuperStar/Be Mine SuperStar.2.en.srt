00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,360
Hello, Ms. Preaw.

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,460
Hello, Ms. Wan.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,850
Paii!

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,470
Wait and see.

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,840
He's so cute, Ashi.

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,690
If you want me to be happy,

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,800
you must tell me the truth.

9
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,600
As for today's fee, you can pay through me.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,130
Not through Preaw.

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,310
I don't want to bother her.

12
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,930
Yeah! I got an internship!

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,230
You're jealous of me, aren't you?

14
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,900
I will never let Preaw hurt us.

15
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,110
Thank you, Ms. Koi.

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,080
Thank you for your understanding.

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,200
I did all this for everyone's benefit.

18
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,440
I just hope one day

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,610
Wan can understand me as she used to.

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,310
Thank you, Ms. Koi.

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,040
Bye.

22
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:01,960
Ms. Preaw,

23
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,730
the more you do this,

24
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,070
the angrier Ms. Wan gets.

25
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,880
That's good.

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,110
So let her be angry.

27
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,280
The angrier she gets, the better.

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,000
Let her be so angry that her blood pressure rises

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,960
and her brain blows up.

30
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,940
Then she can die.

31
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,730
Don't you think Ms. Wan might take revenge on you?

32
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,770
Wan is very arrogant.

33
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,539
She can't act like me.

34
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:26,770
Stop daydreaming.

35
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,180
She might humiliate you again like last time.

36
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,000
What's wrong with you?

37
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:31,500
You keep talking about her.

38
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,320
Do you think I will let her humiliate me again?

39
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:35,670
This time,

40
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,080
I talked about the price rise.

41
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:39,870
It's much higher than theirs.

42
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,610
That bitch!

43
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:31,430
[Be Mine. Superstar]

44
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,620
Ms. Koi ties us down like this,

45
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,329
and Ms. Wan can't do anything.

46
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:42,900
I want you three to cooperate with Preaw unconditionally.

47
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,430
What can we do?

48
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,680
After all, they seem to really want the sponsor

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,460
to support our drama.

50
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,160
Where are you going?

51
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,980
I'm going back to the apartment.

52
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,970
I just slept for a little while last night.

53
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,670
You didn't go home last night.

54
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,010
You're so nosy.

55
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,900
You're wearing the same outfit as yesterday.

56
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,260
Besides,

57
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,740
I'm not the only one who knows.

58
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,990
Ms. Wan and Ms. Koi know that too.

59
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,870
Okay, I made a mistake.

60
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,430
So,

61
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,190
who were you with last night?

62
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,250
Why do you want to know that?

63
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,250
I just did what single people would do.

64
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,060
I'm also single.

65
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,530
I don't play around like you.

66
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,140
Now you're asking for a beating.

67
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,760
I can't be like you.

68
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,690
Otherwise, you won't have the role of a young master

69
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,160
with a property of trillions of dollars.

70
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,260
I'm just worried about you.

71
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:56,850
Don't worry about an unfamous actor like me.

72
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,550
It's fine as long as there're no photos or videos of you

73
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,050
entering a hotel or someone else's apartment leaked.

74
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,590
There are no such photos or videos.

75
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,210
Don't worry.

76
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,670
Okay?

77
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,960
Still waiting for his email?

78
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,060
You all submitted it, right?

79
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,700
-Right? -Yes.

80
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,570
I did.

81
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,160
Yes.

82
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,290
You submitted it, right?

83
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:20,779
There's still…

84
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,500
You all did, right?

85
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,230
I did.

86
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,640
What did the professor say?

87
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,920
The professor said I must hand in the letter from the place of my internship to him

88
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,240
within next week.

89
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,540
Otherwise...

90
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:44,850
Enough.

91
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,909
We know what will happen to you.

92
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,140
May the Buddha bless you.

93
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,140
[Monk]

94
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,080
Gus!

95
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,100
Please help me. Please.

96
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,860
-Punn, stop it. -Please.

97
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,610
Please help me. OK? OK?

98
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,660
I'm sorry I didn't see you.

99
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,470
Please help me.

100
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,030
I allow you to touch my head.

101
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,760
-Look. Touch it like this. -This is my head!

102
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,530
Help you with what?

103
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,300
Well...

104
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,340
Ms. Film.

105
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,490
Give her a call for me.

106
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,830
I dare not.

107
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,070
You should call the HR Department

108
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,000
so that you can know

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,290
if they accept your internship request.

110
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,370
I dare not, either.

111
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,550
I'm scared, too.

112
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,630
Scared?

113
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,350
What are you afraid of?

114
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,350
If it doesn't work, just find another place for the internship.

115
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,900
Right.

116
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,900
Or

117
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,990
do you secretly admire someone in the crew?

118
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,159
Are you all crazy?

119
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:51,710
You...

120
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,710
How's it possible that I like someone?

121
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,110
I just want to be an intern on the filming set.

122
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,820
Oh.

123
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,650
It's not strange at all.

124
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,940
Then call them now,

125
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,160
and we'll know the result.

126
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,730
Go ahead.

127
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,220
Okay.

128
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,800
Let's wait and see.

129
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,830
I'll call now.

130
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,810
Okay.

131
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,650
Don't be so nosy.

132
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,180
I don't want to know. Come on.

133
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,510
Hello.

134
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,230
Well, I'm calling

135
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,640
to ask about your recruiting interns.

136
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,290
Thank you.

137
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:39,800
Bye.

138
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,220
How is it?

139
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,710
They said

140
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,720
their company

141
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,800
doesn't have a policy to recruit interns now.

142
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,460
What?

143
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,960
Before you sent the request letter, didn't you call

144
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,950
to ask about their internship policies?

145
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,240
I didn't.

146
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,110
I'm doomed.

147
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,170
Then you should find

148
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,350
an intern this weekend.

149
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,770
We'll help you call them on Monday.

150
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,680
Yes.

151
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,730
Amanda.

152
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,200
Amanda.

153
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,290
Listen to me first.

154
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,150
Amanda.

155
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,850
Laura.

156
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,150
Do you think

157
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,100
people in this family

158
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,900
are so stupid that they'll be fooled by you.

159
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,270
Ashi.

160
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,400
-So cute. [-Fool?]

161
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,200
What did I fool?

162
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,100
Laura!

163
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,710
Laura!

164
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,470
Laura!

165
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,310
Laura!

166
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,610
Have you heard of this name before?

167
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,690
Whose name is it?

168
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,390
It's nice.

169
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,630
Amanda.

170
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,500
Laura.

171
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,230
Amanda.

172
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,310
Tom, if you keep calling another person's name,

173
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,670
I'll leave.

174
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,590
Is your job

175
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,820
to monitor others?

176
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:20,950
Tom.

177
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,550
I think you love monitoring others more.

178
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,220
Amanda.

179
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,010
Serves you right.

180
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,010
-Look at your cute eyes.
-A woman like you

181
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,659
-should fall further.
-Oh, good boy.

182
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,840
Go away.

183
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,039
I want to see Ashi.

184
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,450
Stop screaming.

185
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,610
People like you should go to hell.

186
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,880
Don't stare at me. No.

187
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,220
I'm shy.

188
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,300
So cute.

189
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,420
Punn.

190
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,020
Didn't you see me?

191
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,590
Oh.

192
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,460
Hello, Grandma.

193
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,500
What's wrong with him?

194
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,670
[President of the Student Union, 2016]

195
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,520
Is it we're not destined to be together, Ashi?

196
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,550
Is Punn back?

197
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,150
Yes.

198
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,180
He went back to his room, but he's a bit weird.

199
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,570
How is he weird?

200
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,110
He came back with his head down.

201
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,730
If I hadn't called him, he wouldn't have seen me.

202
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,330
Was he hurt by a girl?

203
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,720
I don't know.

204
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,500
You're his mother.

205
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,010
You should often check and supervise the behavior of the children.

206
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,770
If anything goes wrong, it can be solved in time.

207
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,730
When I raised Phu,

208
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,240
I didn't raise him like this.

209
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,130
Okay, Mom.

210
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,790
I'm going to bed.

211
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,340
Punn, what are you doing?

212
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,300
I'm going to take a shower.

213
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,160
Are you okay?

214
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,620
I'm fine.

215
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,820
Have you eaten?

216
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,240
Yes.

217
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,130
I'm going to sleep after the shower.

218
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,370
[Unknown caller]

219
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,620
Hello?

Hello, Ms. Film.

223
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,390
Can I help you?

224
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,020
[Ms. Koi read your letter]

225

[The result is...]

227

I see.

228
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,660
Come on.

229
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,160
Honey.

230
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,720
You're back.

231
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:45,600
What's wrong?

232
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,560
Right. You don't look well.

233
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,340
I got an internship at Prince of Love's set, really?

234
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,140
[Didn't you just say you got it?]

235
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,100
Yes, right.

236
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,350
Thank you so much, Ms. Film.

237
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,500
Yeah! I got an internship!

238
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,870
Would you dance with me?

239
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,270
I don't know what's wrong with Punn.

240
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,930
Do you want me to ask him?

241
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,160
Pai.

242
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,680
Are you going to ask him or irritate him?

243
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,360
I know what to do and what not to do.

244
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:41,070
There's no secret Punn can hide from me.

245
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,510
Then go ask your brother.

246
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,900
I want to know what happened to him too.

247
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:49,630
Yes, Ma'am!

248
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,000

I can go intern at Prince of Love's filming set!

252
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,420
I'm gonna meet my Ashi, Dad.

253
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,790
Isn't that too much?

Yes, they just called.

256
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,100
I wasn't going to answer it at first.

257
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,040
I'm afraid it's a fraud call.

258

Okay.

375
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,140
Punn.

376
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,560
This is Nuo.

377
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,760
Nuo, this is Punn.

378
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,690
-Hello. -Hello.

379
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,190
Nuo, get me the script and the script breakdown.

380
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:30,640
Okay.

381
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,710
First,

382
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,100
you need to read what we're shooting today.

383
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,170
For example, what we'll shoot about

384
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,010
and what props we'll use in these scenes.

385
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,800
Nuo will explain it to you in detail later.

386
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,110
Here.

387
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,190
[Script]

388
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,160
-I'll leave him to you. -Okay.

389
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,040
We're going to shoot Scene 9, Episode 3.

390
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,530
Ask me if you have any questions.

391
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,590
I don't know anything.

392
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,880
-Ms. Wan. -Yes?

393
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,500
Is it true that Mr. Gang hired me?

394
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,150
So what whether it's true or false?

395
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,080
I knew it.

396
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,920
If it was true, you would have told me long ago.

397
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,850
I did it to protect you.

398
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,150
That woman persuaded Ms. Koi to look for sponsors.

399
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,790
She's trying to ask Ms. Koi to put pressure on me again.

400
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,660
Does she think I'll be scared? I will not.

401
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,800
I know her style.

402
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,710
No one is willing to work with her now.

403
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,420
She raised the prices of her clients.

404
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,540
No one wants to work with her anymore.

405
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,890
So you used Mr. Gang as an excuse

406
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,410
so that Ms. Preaw would return the time to us?

407
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,290
Yes, more or less.

408
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,360
We must punish evil with evil.

409
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,960
Pawonasa, Tidarat, Kunakorn.

410
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,680
Get ready for the shooting.

411
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,210
Go.

412
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:53,790
In this scene...

413
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,230
Pawonasa was annoyed by Kunakorn

414
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,220
and lost his mind.

415
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,230
Then Pawonasa rushed over to hit Kunakorn.

416
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,860
Tidarat came in at the moment and saw it.

417
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,640
So she misunderstood.

418
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,030
-That's it. -Okay.

419
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,760
Okay.

420
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,180
Let's start. No need for blocking.

421
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,700
Director, sit here.

422
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,230
Boom operator.

423
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:15,960
Ready.

424
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:17,770
The camera.

425
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:18,870
Ready.

426
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,120
Prince of Love,

427
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,510
Episode 3, Scene 3B, Take 1.

428
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,190
Action.

429
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,940
You are a hypocrite.

430
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,280
So what?

431
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,540
Anyway, Tidarat trusts me more

432
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,080
than you.

433
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,550
Just wait and see.

434
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,150
Who will Tidarat choose

435
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,320
between you and me?

436
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,400
Kunakorn.

437
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,400
Staff,

438
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,140
check on him.

439
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,830
Are you hurt badly?

440
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,850
Your mouth is bleeding.

441
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,240
Oh my god, Title.

442
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:58,850
Get up.

443
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,680
Go away.

444
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:01,710
Let me see.

445
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,730
My goodness.

446
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,860
Your mouth is swollen.

447
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,140
How can we continue?

448
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,630
It's okay.

449
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,800
I can continue.

450
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,920
What are you talking about?

451
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,530
The scenes can't even be coherent.

452
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,110
Do you know how to act? You're not professional at all.

453
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,460
How can you hurt other people?

454
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,240
How can you blame others like that?

455
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,000
I saw it with my own eyes.

456
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,130
Dain moved his face over to let Ashi hit.

457
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,200
If you don't believe me, ask the director to replay the footage.

458
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,420
I saw it with my own eyes.

459
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,300
What?

460
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,020
Stop twisting the truth.

461
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,940
Everyone in the crew saw it.

462
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,430
Your Ashi punched him on purpose.

463
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,780
I saw it with my own eyes. Everyone in the crew saw it too.

464
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,290
Use your brain. Who would move his face over to be hit?

465
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,450
-What? -That's enough.

466
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,660
I'll take him to treat the wound first.

467
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,570
Let's go.

468
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,520
Get back to work.

469
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,210
-What's wrong? -Calm down.

470
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,330
It's Title.

471
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,720
I'll check on Title first.

472
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,240
Him, too!

473
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,120
Too much sympathy.

474
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,960
I saw it with my own eyes.

475
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,480
Title moved his face over to let Ashi hit.

476
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,150
Why would he do that?

477
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,330
Get beaten for nothing?

478
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,110
[It must be Preaw's order.]

479
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,550
[As you know, she's mad at me.]

480
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,250
If they planned this,

481
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,510
[it'd be too strange]

482
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,970
Be gentle.

483
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:19,850
It's all right.

484
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:30,810
Kunakorn.

485
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,080
-Are you hurt badly? -Go check on him.

486
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,850
I saw what Wan saw.

487
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,080
Why did you do that?

488
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,500
What did I do?

489
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,650
-You moved your face over…
-Title, are you okay?

490
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,010
Sorry, Ms. Preaw.

491
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,110
I was careless.

492
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,060
It's good that you know you did wrong.

493
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,490
Luckily, you're friends.

494
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,850
Otherwise, he'll be even angrier.

495
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,100
Be more careful next time.

496
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:08,660
Okay.

497
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,110
Then, please let me take care of him.

498
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:16,800
Go ahead.

499
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,150
Let me ice your wound

500
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:25,940
Okay.

501
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,230
so that it won't swell.

502
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,590
Does it hurt?

503
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,000
-I'm sorry. -It's okay.

504
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,290
Let me do it myself.

505
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,040
You pressed too hard.

506
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,520
I'm sorry.

507
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,850
I'm going back to the set.

508
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:06,280
Take care.

509
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,940
Ms. Wan, the crew's van broke down at the entrance of the alley.

510
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,630
I won't be able to make it to the event.

511
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,060
[Really? I'll go pick you up right away]

512
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:30,990
Okay.

513
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:43,550
[Owl Coffee]

514
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,590
[Incoming call, Pai the foe brother]

515
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,110
What is it?

516
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,720
Brother, have you seen your beloved Ashi?

517
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,340
Don't make me angry, bad brother.

518
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,080
See? I told you.

519
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:00,410
Which set would let interns contact actors?

520
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,960
Yes, I know.

521
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,380
Just wait.

522
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,930
I've waited several times.

523
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,250
I won't give up easily.

524
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,960
All you can do is talking.

525
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,130
Pai, are you talking to your brother on the phone?

526
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:12,640
Yes.

527
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,960
Let me talk to him.

528
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,040
Mom wants to talk to you.

529
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,350
[Hello?]

530
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,050
How was your first day of internship, Punn?

531
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,210
It's good, Mom.

532
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:27,130
But I'm an intern with the art director.

533
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,680
I can't see Ashi.

534
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,980
[I believe you can do it]

535
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,520
But don't let it affect your work.

536
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,130
Got it, Mom.

537
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,660
Okay, I'll hang up now.

538
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,930
Okay, Mom. Bye.

539
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:46,070
[Okay, bye, son]

540
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,540
It's his first day at work.

541
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,710
Mom,

542
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,190
you dote on him too much.

543
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,220
What? Pai.

544
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:57,210
We're family, so of course we should encourage each other.

545
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,560
By the way,

546
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:03,440
you have someone you like too, right?

547
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,370
What?

548
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:09,760
Punn.

549
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,590
Get me something for me from the car.

550
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,510
It's a white bag in the back seat.

551
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,350
Okay.

552
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,610
It's a Pickup. The plate number is Bangkok 2512.

553
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,630
Give it to me at the set.

554
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:22,720
Okay.

555
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,840
Where is the set?

556
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,120
Mingmuang.

557
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,230
You won't be able to wait for the next car.

558
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,590
Let me take you there.

559
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,160
I'll come back to pick up Ashi later.

560
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,370
I'll call Ashi first.

561
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,530
Is he filming?

562
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,130
Right.

563
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,570
What should I do?

564
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,230
Young man.

565
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,570
Young man.

566
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:46,900
Are you calling me?

567
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,780
Can you tell Ashi?

568
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,980
I'm going out to send Mingmuang.

569
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,560
I'll come back and pick him up later.

570
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,470
Okay.

571
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,250
Tell him as soon as the shooting is over, okay?

572
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:57,670
Okay.

573
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,880
Hurry up. Let's go.

574
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,530
Okay.

575
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,700
Or we'll be late.

576
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,870
Ms. Nun.

577
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,880
This is the thing you asked me to get.

578
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,270
Okay.

579
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:19,970
That's right.

580
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,110
Thank you.

581
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:21,850
You're welcome.

582
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,680
Guys, have you finished reading through the script?

583
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,770
Ms. Film.

584
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,500
Yes?

585
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,660
I saw Ms. Wan

586
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,140
when I went to fetch the stuff.

587
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,460
She asked me to tell Ashi

588
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,100
she's going to send Mingmuang first.

589
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,570
Oh, go tell Ashi.

590
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,410
He's there. Go tell him.

591
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,560
I dare not.

592
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,580
Come, I'll take you there.

593
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,060
You're so shy.

594
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,680
Come here.

595
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,760
Ashi, he has something to tell you.

596
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,170
Yes.

597
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,170
Go ahead.

598
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,210
You're memorizing the lines. I'll call you later.

599
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:19,050
If you want his autograph,

600
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,220
or if you want to take a photo with him, hurry up.

601
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,370
We still have work to do.

602
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,600
It's not like that.

603
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,150
Ms. Wan asked me to tell you

604
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,310
she's going to send Mingmuang first.

605
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,880
She'll come back and pick you up later.

606
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,180
Thank you.

607
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,340
You're welcome.

608
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,270
Ashi.

609
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,710
Why didn't Ms. Wan call you herself?

610
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:53,400
Right.

611
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,690
I'll call her first.

612
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,470
[Actors in position]

613
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,160
Mingmuang, I'm going upstairs to talk to a client.

614
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,280
Then I'll go back to pick up Ashi.

615
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,110
Do you want me to come back to pick you up?

616
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,890
I'll take a taxi.

617
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,470
You go take care of Ashi.

618
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,560
Don't say I treat you differently then.

619
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,920
If anyone dares to criticize you, he'll be dead.

620
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,070
Only you two dare to criticize me.

621
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,310
No, I dare not, Your Highness.

622
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,030
Okay, just go.

623
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,200
Or you'll be late.

624
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,110
I'll get going.

625
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,270
-Okay. -Bye.

626
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,720
Hello, Doctor.

627
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,820
Do we know each other?

628
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,830
Or are you a patient at the clinic?

629
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,190
I'm not a patient, but I...

630
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,020
Then I'll leave now. I have to go to work.

631
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,140
Your Highness!

632
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,570
Your Highness.

633
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,710
Don't listen to him.

634
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:23,480
You know I only have you in my heart.

635
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,760
You know that, right?

636
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,040
Your Highness,

637
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:33,090
I'm pregnant with our child.

638
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,110
You can't let him slander our child.

639
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,670
Your Highness.

640
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,960
Your Highness.

641
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,490
Who do you trust between me and her?

642
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,860
I trust Tidarat.

643
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
Your Highness!

644
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,370
Cut.

645
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:10,840
Ashi.

646
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,760
Ms. Wan is not here yet.

647
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,960
How are you going home?

648
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:17,330
She'll be here soon. Don't worry.

649
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,830
[Ms. Wan]

650
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,720
Ashi, Ms. Wan's call.

651
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:27,270
And we're done shooting today.

652
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,770
Not for you.

653
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,140
We need to insert some shots.

654
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:30,990
Mr. Pun said so.

655
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,040
Okay.

656
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,570
Are you here, Ms. Wan?

657
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,940
Not yet, Ashi.

658
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,360
I don't think I can make it.

659
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,390
You take a taxi. Don't wait for me.

660
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,750
Okay, bye.

661
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,920
Ashi, what's the matter?

662
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,650
Ms. Wan doesn't have time to pick me up.

663
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,300
I need to take a taxi.

664
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,090
I'll go get changed.

665
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,720
Mr. Pun. Ms. Film.

666
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:56,770
I'm leaving now.

667
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:57,950
Bye.

668
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,570
Excuse me, Ashi.

669
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,190
Are you waiting for Ms. Wan to pick you up?

670
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,570
She doesn't have time to pick me up,

671
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,760
so she asked me to take a taxi.

672
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,640
But there is no taxi.

673
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,720
Are you in a hurry to go anywhere?

674
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,660
I have an event at the hotel.

675
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,060
I don't know if I can make it.

676
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,130
Do you want me to give you a ride? I promise you'll make it.

677
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,540
I'll call Ms. Wan first.

678
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:06,620
Hello?

679
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,060
Hello, Ms. Wan.

680
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,820
There's no taxi.

681
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:12,760
I was thinking of hitching a ride with a junior of the crew.

682
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,830
That's fine.

683
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,400
But it's a motorcycle.

684
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,030
What? A motorcycle?

685
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,440
Yes, or I'm sure I won't make it.

686
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,010
What should we do?

687
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,710
[You've never ridden a motorcycle before]
[Will it do?]

688
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,469
It has to, Ms. Wan.

689
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,570
Take care of yourself, Ashi.

690
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,639
Tell him not to drive too fast.

691
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,460
[Your life is more important than his motorcycle]

692
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,449
Okay, Ms. Wan.

693
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,440
Bye.

694
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,090
Let's go, or it'll be too late.

695
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:43,560
Okay.

696
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:44,870
Let's go.

697
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,670
Wait here by the bike.

698
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:51,710
I'll go get a helmet. I'll be right back.

699
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,070
It's hot. Hot! Hot!

700
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,680
If you feel hot, go get changed, so that you can go home early.

701
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,810
Hurry up.

702
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:09,920
Hurry!

703
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,000
Let's go.

704
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,530
Ms. Preaw,

705
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,770
can you let Ashi go together with me?

706
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,170
Why?

707
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,000
Ms. Wan didn't have time to pick him up.

708
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,720
And he has an event later.

709
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,970
I wonder if the taxi is here to pick him up.

710
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,880
Title, why didn't you tell me earlier?

711
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,510
If he doesn't attend the event in time,

712
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,260
his reputation will be ruined, you know?

713
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,090
All right.

714
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,840
I borrowed one from the staff.

715
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,010
You wear mine. It's safer.

716
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,890
What's wrong?

717
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:00,950
I don't know how to wear it.

718
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,030
Let me help you.

719
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,550
Excuse me.

720
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,260
If this happens again,

721
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,440
tell me right away, okay?

722
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,120
Okay.

723
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,430
Go check if Ashi is still waiting.

724
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,790
Okay, thank you.

725
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,880
You're such a professional agent.

726
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,680
You can handle everything.

727
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,890
Of course.

728
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,740
Anyone can rest assured with me.

729
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,380
Wan, you're done for this time.

730
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,180
You're talking to yourself.

731
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,570
[Bitch]

732
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,500
Hold on my shoulder and get up.

733
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,740
I'm fine.

734
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,520
I'm sorry.

735
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,910
Where should I hold so that I won't fall off?

736
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:44,020
You can hold my shoulder or my waist.

737
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,620
It depends on you.

738
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,710
I'll hold you then.

739
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,060
Okay.

740
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:58,520
Let's go.

741
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,120
Ashi, what took you so long?

742
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,790
The event is about to start. Let's go.

743
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,260
Ashi! Ashi!

744
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,410
Hello, Punn.

745
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,050
[What's wrong, kid?]

746
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,490
Hello, Mom.

747
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,100
I'll be home late tonight.

748
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,090
Will the work finish late?

749
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:28,320
Yes.

750
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,880
I'm helping take care of the actor.

751
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,420
I'll go home as soon as I'm done.

752
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,800
Okay, no problem.

753
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,150
[Be careful when you ride the bike. See you at home]

754
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:38,970
Okay, Mom.

755
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:43,040

Yes.

778
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,360
Let him rest. He's in a hurry to leave.

779
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:16,770
Yeah.

780
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:24,790
Let's go.

781
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:25,640
Let's go, Ashi.

782
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,190
Ashi.

783
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,880
Ashi.

784
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,220
Ashi.

785
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,160
Excuse me.

786
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,860
Ashi.

787
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:13,350
[Be mine. Superstar]

788
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,210
I don't think I'll have another chance to be so close to Ashi.

789
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,470
Yours.

790
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,750
Cappuccino, no cinnamon.

791
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,230
It's you.

792
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,610
Last night, you rode a motorcycle to send Ashi.

793
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,310
Please tell your mom.

794
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,610
She really knows me.

795
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,780
From now on, call me Dad.

796
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,620
Call you Dad?

797
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,460
You're way out of his league.

798
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:36,170
I love you, Your Highness.

799
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,300
My heart is breaking.
