[Characters, places and incidents in this production are partly fictitious. Viewer discretion is advised]

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,150
I'll give you a chance to prove yourself.

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,590
Take good care of Ashi.

4
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,630
I swear on my life.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,120
Oh.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,860
When I went to save Ashi,

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,110
I saw firecrackers scraps nearby.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,230
How was Pun?

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,020
Pretty good.

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,580
He took all the work.

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,020
I didn't have to do anything.

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,350
Which actor do you like?

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,350
I like Ashi.

14
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,560
The audition is over.

15
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,140
Director Tanada has gone back.

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,780
Is there any other work?

17
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,750
Yes.

18
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,870
I know

19
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,950
you made a lot this time.

20
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,200
Don't you want to give me a commission?

21
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,320
It's not much. It's a loss this time.

22
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,490
I knew you were lying when you opened your mouth.

23
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,430
In the past few days,

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,630
I saw you

25
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,270
buy branded goods practically every day.

26
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,330
How much do you want?

27
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,190
Thirty percent of what you received.

28
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,470
My gosh.

29
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,539
You want 30 percent?

30
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:34,100
I've sacrificed a lot for this job.

31
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,009
You don't have to give me anything,

32
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,310
but

33
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,140
I don't know

34
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,650
if you'll get another job.

35
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,590
Alright.

36
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,770
I'll sent it to you.

37
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,240
Give me your phone.

38
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,190
But I have something to tell you

39
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,000
about the casting.

40
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,009
About the casting?

41
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,080
I know something of interest to you,

42
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,110
but you need to buy this information.

43
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,550
Why should I?

44
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,900
You don't have to pay.

45
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,870
I just won't tell you.

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,550
How much do you want? Tell me.

47
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,150
The 30 percent that I should give you.

48
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,560
Okay?

49
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,780
Ban!

50
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,550
You're so cunning.

51
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,060
Do you want it or not?

52
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,600
If you don't want the news,

53
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,730
I'll transfer the money to you

54
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,730
and leave immediately.

55
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,990
Yes.

56
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,500
Tell me everything.

57
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,079
Director Tanada likes Title.

58
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,570
I thought it was something serious.

59
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,470
I already knew.

60
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,120
But another thing,

61
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,660
Director Tanada has fully appointed Mr. Kevin for casting,

62
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,370
because he believes Kevin

63
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,540
would choose the best actor who can get along with him.

64
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,390
And Kevin likes Ashi.

65
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,550
Is this worth your money, Ms. Preaw?

66
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,470
Get out.

67
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,350
Get out of my office now!

68
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,950
Get out!

69
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,890
Wan,

70
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,390
don't think I'll give up.

71
00:03:52,810 --> 00:04:01,330
[Be Mine. Superstar]

72
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,980
Ashi is calling.

73
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,130
How is it, Ashi?

74
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,580
The audition is over.

75
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,900
Mr. Kevin and I even acted together.

76
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,430
The other actor who came for the audition was Kevin?

77
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,350
Yes.

78
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,110
He's a good partner.

79
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,280
That's great.

80
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,960
I think I should go and pray more.

81
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,900
Drive home safely.

82
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,280
Okay.

83
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,690
Bye.

84
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,130
Where are you going?

85
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,300
I'm going to go pray. Do you want to go with me?

86
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,810
Don't you think it's already set?

87
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,300
Do you want to go with me?

88
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,630
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

89
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,830
The audition is over.

90
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,720
How was it, Ashi?

91
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,570
Was it hard?

92
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,020
No.

93
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,730
It depends on whether the director likes it or not.

94
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,950
I hope you can get this job.

95
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,070
Thank you.

96
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,510
By the way,

97
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,440
what are you doing now?

98
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,230
I'm helping my mom clean the cafe.

99
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,250
By the way, Ashi,

100
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,520
Ms. Film just sent me a message.

101
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,140
She asked me to go back to be Mr. Pol's assistant director.

102
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,670
Good.

103
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,150
I'm happy for you.

104
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,600
If you have the chance,

105
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,860
you can come guide me.

106
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,750
I'm not that good.

107
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,510
Ashi, I have to serve the guests now.

108
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,980
Okay.

109
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,730
Then, goodbye.

110
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,659
Is this okay?

111
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:56,409
Look into the eyes.

112
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:58,350
Okay.

113
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,220
I'm angry.

114
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,780
I angry. I know everything now.

115
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,370
-I wanted to punch you in the face.
-Yes.

116
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,570
But I don't think the director will like it.

117
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,580
Come here.

118
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,740
You keep staring at them.

119
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,760
Are you jealous?

120
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,420
No.

121
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,420
It's just strange.

122
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,870
Why did Ashi and Title suddenly come here?

123
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,080
They used to be focus on themselves.

124
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,250
The war is over.

125
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,390
What war?

126
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,960
A psychological battle between two managers.

127
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,030
You're already working in the director team.

128
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,270
What are you going to do with Ashi now?

129
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,590
Yeah.

130
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,430
I think it's hard to get close to Ashi,

131
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,430
especially when Title is here.

132
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,180
It's harder than before.

133
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,460
Don't worry about that.

134
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,650
I'll stop Title for you,

135
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,830
but don't make too much of a commotion

136
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,790
and let Title find out you're pursuing Ashi.

137
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,310
He doesn't like you.

138
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,630
He doesn't like me?

139
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,300
Your journey of love is not easy.

140
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,310
You must stay calm

141
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,150
until you get Ashi.

142
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,610
By then,

143
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,650
Ashi may open his arms to protect you.

144
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,510
Good luck.

145
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,770
Okay.

146
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,090
Pun.

147
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,580
Yes.

148
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,590
Ask the actors to start blocking.

149
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,550
OK, Mr. Pol.

150
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,980
Ms. Wan, I'm going back.

151
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,840
Mingmuang, stop fooling around like crazy.

152
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,880
I'm just going after my heart.

153
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,650
Bye.

154
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,760
Is Mingmuang dating?

155
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,909
I don't know.

156
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,690
I don't know either.

157
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,680
He didn't tell me anything.

158
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,120
I think he's dating.

159
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,450
No.

160
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,250
If he is,

161
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,980
he'll introduce me to his partner..

162
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,190
You too, Ashi.

163
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,110
How long are you going to be single for?

164
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,630
Let's talk about me after you get someone.

165
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,340
I want to date, but they never care about me.

166
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,210
I really want to know

167
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,390
who will be the lucky one.

168
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,730
Forget it, Ms. Wan.

169
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,590
He'll find out eventually.

170
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,070
I wish you find that person soon.

171
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:34,760
By the way, where's your manager?

172
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,600
I haven't seen her all day.

173
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,350
Ms. Preaw is busy,

174
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,059
so I drove here myself today.

175
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,630
Drive home safely.

176
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,669
Okay, bye.

177
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:43,470
Bye.

178
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,070
Ashi, I’m leaving.

179
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,160
Okay.

180
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,720
Let's go.

181
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,910
Why is it so troublesome?

182
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:32,210
Was today tiring?

183
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,780
No, I can't do that.

184
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,420
Redo.

185
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,570
[Was today tiring?]

186
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,720
Are you sleeping?

187
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,970
[Are you sleeping?]

188
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,750
Oh.

189
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,470
Ashi,

190
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,850
what are you doing?

191
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,520
I miss you, you know?

192
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,910
You only talk to the pillow.

193
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,790
How would he know you miss him?

194
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,540
Call him if you miss him.

195
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,490
What's so hard about it?

196
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,020
I don't dare. It's too late.

197
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,270
Then call him tomorrow.

198
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,440
I don't want to disturb him.

199
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,200
He has to work.

200
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,580
What's wrong with you?

201
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,980
Why are you hesitating? What do you want to do?

202
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,390
You're not me. You don't understand.

203
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,950
I don't want to be you either.

204
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,060
You always make simple things complicated.

205
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,560
If you're here to laugh at me,

206
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,210
then go away, Paii.

207
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,890
Fine, I'll leave.

208
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,110
You're so ungrateful,

209
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,830
you delusional guy.

210
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,250
He comes and goes so freely.

211
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,670
Let's not do this.

212
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,910
Why are you shy?

213
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,710
No one will see you.

214
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,910
We'll talk when we get to the hotel.

215
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,420
I need to go to the restroom first.

216
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,200
What happened, Ms. Wan?

217
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,260
Mingmuang got dumped.

218
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,760
Who did he break up with?

219
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,080
Dr. Ning.

220
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,990
Dr. Ning?

221
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,070
When did they start dating?

222
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,350
They didn't.

223
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,680
They didn't?

224
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,790
Then how did he get dumped?

225
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,660
He went to the bar to see Dr. Ning.

226
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,740
You're crying for such a trivial matter.

227
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,330
You're supposed to be amazing.

228
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,390
Yes.

229
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,460
I'm amazing,

230
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,470
But Ms. Wan made Dr. Ning hate me.

231
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,220
Mingmuang had a one-night stand with Dr. Ning

232
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,340
and fell in love with him.

233
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,990
But he has a rule that he doesn't date one-night stand.

234
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,120
I suggested him to have a two-night stand with Dr. Ning.

235
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,530
I didn't expect him to actually do that.

236
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,500
Now,

237
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,180
Dr. Ning hates me and doesn't want to see me anymore.

238
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,630
I must apologize to you.

239
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,870
Why are you apologizing?

240
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,360
About Mingmuang.

241
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,500
I'm apologizing to you for Mingmuang.

242
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,690
The two-night stand thing

243
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,570
was my fault.

244
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,910
I was just kidding.

245
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,800
I didn't expect Mingmuang to take it seriously.

246
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,510
Yes.

247
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:26,870
I understand,

248
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,860
but he doesn't want to understand me.

249
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,620
Can I ask you something?

250
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,620
Why don't you open your heart to my friend?

251
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,300
Hey, why is it you?

252
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,000
Why can't it be me?

253
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,870
Why are your words so annoying?

254
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,030
I don't like it.

255
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,570
I'm not being annoying.

256
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,390
But I want to know

257
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,430
why it can't be me.

258
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,210
As you know,

259
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,920
it's just a one-night stand between us.

260
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,590
I know.

261
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,000
But this is the second time.

262
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,560
This goes against the rules.

263
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,650
If there is a third time,

264
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,290
a fourth time

265
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,520
could happen too.

266
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,890
Hey.

267
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,870
You're too cunning.

268
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,060
You like taking advantage of others.

269
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,090
I really hate people like you.

270
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,710
Wait.

271
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,910
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

272
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,830
I didn't think it through.

273
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,590
I don't want to hear it.

274
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,710
You can scold me as you want,

275
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,250
but please don't hate me.

276
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,670
I love you very much.

277
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,340
I don't think we'll have a future together.

278
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,140
Let's start the rehearsal.

279
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,190
Ready, action.

280
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,369
Your Highness, I really want to go to Europe.

281
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,630
I've never taken a plane before.

282
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,560
Please take me there.

283
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:22,329
Sure, but I must finish my work first.

284
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,420
Kunakorn,

285
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,869
do you want to go with me?

286
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,260
Sure.

287
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,950
Your Highness,

288
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,190
I want to go with you alone.

289
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,960
Then we can have a sweet journey.

290
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,200
Please, Your Highness?

291
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,140
Okay.

292
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,410
Okay, cut.

293
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,600
Ashi,

294
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,990
you passed the audition.

295
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,620
You passed the audition!

296
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,380
What?

297
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,810
That Japanese movie.

298
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,660
Director Tanada emailed me

299
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,070
that you passed the audition.

300
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,750
Really?

301
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,470
Yes, get ready to go international.

302
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,370
Look at the email he sent.

303
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,490
Watch where you're going.

304
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,440
I'm sorry.

305
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,340
Wait and see.

306
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,160
When I'm successful,

307
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,480
I'll crush you under my feet.

308
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,850
Excuse me.

309
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,960
Get ready to go international.

310
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,430
You passed the audition.

311
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,230
How you just acted

312
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,030
was great.

313
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,150
-Pun.
-What is it?

314
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,210
I passed the audition for the Japanese movie.

315
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:53,910
Really?

316
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,350
Great.

317
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,180
Congratulations.

318
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,910
I'll prepare for the shooting now.

319
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,310
Get ready for the official shooting.

320
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,020
I knew you'd get this job.

321
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,570
You didn't let me win, right?

322
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,970
No way.

323
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,860
I knew I couldn't beat you.

324
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,400
Don't say that.

325
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,590
I know you work hard too.

326
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,230
Hey, aren't you going to collect the script?

327
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,490
Yes, coming.

328
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,950
Excuse me.

329
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,600
How irresponsible.

330
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,820
Ready, action.

331
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,150
Your Highness, I really want to go to Europe.

332
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,960
I haven't been there yet.

333
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,070
Take me there.

334
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,170
Ban! Ban! Come here!

335
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,440
Hurry!

336
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,970
Is there anything I can do for you, Ms. Preaw?

337
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,830
I want you to pretend to be an extra and sneak in.

338
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:02,950
An extra?

339
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:03,550
Yes.

340
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,120
Ms. Preaw, with my talent,

341
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,820
I should be the male lead.

342
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,970
Just do as I say.

343
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,250
What about the pay?

344
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,990
Who will pay?

345
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,250
I'll pay you.

346
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,740
Just do as I say.

347
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,500
Fine.

348
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,000
But next time, I want to be the lead.

349
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,310
Okay, let's go.

350
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,790
Pun, hurry up.

351
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,380
Okay.

352
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,590
Let's start filming.

353
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,230
Boom operator.

354
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:35,790
Ready.

355
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:36,950
Camera.

356
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,830
Ready.

357
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,770
Ready, action.

358
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,290
Your Highness,

359
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,010
you have to protect me.

360
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,080
Someone wants to hurt me.

361
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,900
I almost got hit by a car today.

362
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:55,460
Lady Rapeeponpun will definitely send someone to harm me.

363
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,540
Please save me, Your Highness.

364
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,060
My goodness.

365
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,070
I'm doomed.

366
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:19,930
Blood!

367
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,500
Film, go check on him.

368
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,320
Hey, Film,

369
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,510
scene 12.

370
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,000
Are you okay? What happened?

371
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,590
Let me see, Pun.

372
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,860
I'm fine.

373
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,630
You're bleeding.

374
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,440
Are you hurt?

375
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,310
I'm fine.

376
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,250
What about you? Let me see.

377
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,280
Okay.

378
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,910
Goodness.

379
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,180
You said you were fine.

380
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,430
Why did you block me with your body?

381
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,800
It's probably an instinct.

382
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,950
Let me see.

383
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,540
-No.
-In the afternoon...

384
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,440
What?

385
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,290
I'm going now.

386
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,320
Pun, Pun.

387
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,490
Pun!

388
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,750
Are you okay?

389
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,080
I'm fine.

390
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,880
I'll take him to a doctor.

391
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,030
Ashi.

392
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,100
Ashi.

393
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,240
Ashi.

394
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,950
Ashi.

395
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,160
Ashi, how are you?

396
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,690
Are you okay?

397
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,890
Pun got hurt.

398
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,360
Let's go.

399
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,550
What?

400
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,360
Move.

401
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,360
Move!

402
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,390
Move!

403
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,680
What happened?

404
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,430
Is Ashi hurt?

405
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,130
I'm fine. Take him to a doctor first.

406
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,900
Help him to my car.

407
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,550
Hurry.

408
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,370
Let's go. Take my car.

409
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,180
Oh my.

410
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,370
You crashed into me.

411
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,540
-Come here.
-What's wrong, Ms. Preaw?

412
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,660
What's wrong?

413
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,510
You failed.

414
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,250
How did I fail?

415
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,340
Ashi is completely fine.

416
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,560
How could he be fine?

417
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,130
It's such a heavy crate.

418
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,940
Someone blocked it with his body.

419
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,990
Are you saying you won't give me money?

420
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,430
I've completed my mission.

421
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,710
I won't agree to it.

422
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,930
I will definitely give you money.

423
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:57,980
Here.

424
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,390
Ms. Preaw, I want a raise.

425
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,020
This job is very difficult.

426
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,250
Otherwise, I'll tell everyone.

427
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,690
Here.

428
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,480
Go to my apartment tonight.

429
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,660
If I go to your apartment,

430
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,130
it'll be a different price.

431
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,940
We'll talk about it later.

432
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,550
Hurry and go.

433
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,900
Go.

434
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,640
I’m afraid I’ll have to be a member of Dr. Ning's clinic.

435
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,920
Everyone is constantly getting hurt and sick.

436
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,180
And someone is heartbroken too.

437
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,650
He probably doesn't want to see me anymore.

438
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,350
Aren't you going to let him rest?

439
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,810
You have no appetite when you can't see him.

440
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,260
I want to see him.

441
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,390
I can't wait to say sorry to him.

442
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,420
Pun, how are you going to tell your parents?

443
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,820
I'll tell my family it was an accident.

444
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,570
I don't want your family to worry about you.

445
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,460
Stay in my apartment for now,

446
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,570
until the day you remove the stitches.

447
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,050
Gosh, it'll take a week.

448
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,620
Will your parents be okay with it?

449
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,200
Just let Pun tell his family he must take care of Ashi.

450
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,120
They didn't say anything last time.

451
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,070
Right, Pun?

452
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,750
Yes, Daddy Mingmuang.

453
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,520
I'll call my family later

454
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,750
and tell them I'll stay with Ashi for a while.

455
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,930
They won't be suspicious.

456
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,360
What about the landlord?

457
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,370
I have no objection. Let Pun stay here to recuperate.

458
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,120
Two votes against one.

459
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,180
I guess majority rules.

460
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:56,480
I think the prop team should take most responsibility.

461
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,450
It has nothing to do with Ms. Nun and the others.

462
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,960
I saw the prop box

463
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,750
when I stood before the monitor.

464
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,550
It's not what we agreed on.

465
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,090
Is this a prop box for the shoot?

466
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:09,520
Yes.

467
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,870
It won't hurt if this falls on your head, right?

468
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,630
You won't get hurt.

469
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,560
So I blocked Ashi with my body.

470
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,510
Who did it? It's so bad.

471
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,070
I'm sure the cameraman caught it on film.

472
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,000
You can ask the director to take a look.

473
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,540
Okay.

474
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,830
One more thing.

475
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,510
It may not be an accident

476
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,990
when Ashi fell off the horse.

477
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,980
Why do you think so?

478
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,620
He found scraps of firecrackers nearby,

479
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,550
so he thought someone lit the firecrackers and threw them to the horses

480
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,810
to hurt Ashi.

481
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,550
That's horrible.

482
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,380
Don't let me know who did it.

483
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,270
I won't forgive him.

484
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,500
I think

485
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,430
you need to discuss this with Ms. Koi

486
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,060
so she knows

487
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,080
what happened at the set.

488
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,530
Don't worry.

489
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,470
I was going to talk to Ms. Koi.

490
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,390
I'll get justice for you.

491
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:29,660
By the way, I found out who it is.

492
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,210
When did you find out?

493
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,470
Now.

494
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:35,040
It can't be anyone except Preaw.

495
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,400
Ms. Wan,

496
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,450
don't accuse Ms. Preaw.

497
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,230
No matter what, I think it's her.

498
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,770
Because if Ashi gets hurt

499
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,760
or something happens to him,

500
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,950
the one who takes his place in the Japanese movie

501
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,110
would be Title.

502
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,150
Aren't you overthinking it?

503
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:52,370
This morning, Director Tanada emailed me

504
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,350
and said Ashi was chosen.

505
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,850
When Preaw heard it,

506
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:56,790
she rushed out angrily.

507
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,470
Then Ashi had the accident in the afternoon.

508
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,380
What should I think about this?

509
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,480
You have the right to think that.

510
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:07,050
But we have no evidence to accuse Ms. Preaw.

511
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,110
We'll know tomorrow.

512
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,960
Ashi, are you okay?

513
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,070
Ashi.

514
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,500
Pun.

515
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,860
Ashi.

516
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,260
Pun.

517
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,350
Ashi.

518
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,020
Pun.

519
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,670
Ashi.

520
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,890
Are you okay?

521
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,670
You're the one who got hurt.

522
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,870
Does the wound hurt?

523
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:55,910
A little.

524
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,140
Let me wipe you down.

525
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,520
It's okay.

526
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,520
I'll take a shower.

527
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,000
Don't be stubborn.

528
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,720
I said I'll wipe your body.

529
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,950
Okay.

530
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,550
I'll take it off myself.

531
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,110
I'll do it myself.

532
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,030
What?

533
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,710
Are you afraid I'll do something bad to you?

534
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,750
I don't want to waste your time.

535
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,950
You don't have to do this for me.

536
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,700
Wait here.

537
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,000
What's wrong?

538
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,970
It's cold.

539
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:12,070
I think I should take a shower.

540
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,000
I need to pee.

541
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,520
Thank you, Ashi.

542
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,820
If Ms. Koi finds out,

543
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,550
the whole crew will be ruined.

544
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,760
Do you know who it is?

545
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,520
Call your manager right now.

546
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,930
Okay.

547
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,600
Why didn't anyone tell me

548
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,010
such a major thing happened?

549
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,280
Have a seat.

550
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,580
I'm sorry, Ms. Koi.

551
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,550
At first, I thought it was just a simple accident.

552
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,720
No matter it's simple or not,

553
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,380
you have to tell me.

554
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,700
If this gets out,

555
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,600
our crew's reputation will be ruined,

556
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,320
okay?

557
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,230
You too, Film.

558
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,770
I'm sorry.

559
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,980
Is the intern okay?

560
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,220
Do his parents know?

561
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,830
Pun is recuperating at my place.

562
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,950
Don't worry.

563
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,350
-Wan.
-Yes?

564
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,160
You don't have to report it. I'll do it myself.

565
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,480
Okay.

566
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,420
-Mr. Pol.
-Yes.

567
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,670
Give me the screenshot of the extra

568
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,910
and delete the video.

569
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,270
Yes, Ms. Koi.

570
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:43,810
During this period,

571
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:46,070
to ensure the safety of all parties,

572
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,350
I will suspend filming

573
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,270
until we catch the culprit.

574
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,840
The TV station is rushing us.

575
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,070
I'll talk to the TV station.

576
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,190
I don't want you all to feel uneasy at work.

577
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,070
I feel uneasy too.

578
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,930
If anything happens again,

579
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,740
the TV station will be involved as well.

580
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,990
Thank you for defending us.

581
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:10,210
We're a family when we work together.

582
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,860
By the way, Pun.

583
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,360
this is your compensation from Ms. Koi.

584
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,640
Please return it to Ms. Koi.

585
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,010
No, if I give it to you,

586
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,150
you have to accept it.

587
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,340
But...

588
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,950
Don't be shy, Pun.

589
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,190
Take it

590
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,740
as your medical expenses.

591
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,440
Ms. Wan, then you should take it.

592
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:09,650
You paid for my medical expenses yesterday.

593
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,270
Take it.

594
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,320
Fine. I'll take the money.

595
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:22,550
Tell me when you want it.

596
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:23,830
Okay.

597
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,110
Since this part is over,

598
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,060
and filming will be suspended,

599
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,040
where should we go to have fun?

600
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,310
Yes.

601
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,830
Where can we go?

602
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,540
Ashi has to practice and go to Japan for filming.

603
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,630
How long will it take?

604
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,090
About two months.

605
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:53,469
Since you're all here,

606
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:56,610
Ms. Wan, Daddy Mingmuang,

607
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,660
I have something to say.

608
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,540
Ashi,

609
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,950
I want to confess something.

610
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,870
I like you.

611
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,410
I've liked you for a long time.

612
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:29,580
I still remember the first day I saw you.

613
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:35,950
Your smile lit up my world.

614
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,880
Since I fell in love with you,

615
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:43,800
my world has no longer been dark.

616
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,640
If I want to date you,

617
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,640
can I?

618
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:19,760
Thank you for being so honest.

619
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,800
But give me some time

620
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,310
to consider your request.

621
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,220
Okay.

622
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,680
I'm really sorry.

623
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,300
I can't give you an answer yet.

624
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,830
Okay.

625
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,170
Pun.

626
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:58,020
You really don't know the timing.

627
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,100
Who would confess at a time like this?

628
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,450
If I can't say it now,

629
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,050
when should I say it?

630
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,470
Pun,

631
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,140
since you've made up your mind to say it,

632
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,150
you should be prepared to accept it,

633
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,140
even if it's not the answer you wanted.

634
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,550
Okay, Ms. Wan.

635
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:27,230
Ashi had a hard time before.

636
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,420
His mother raised him alone.

637
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,230
When he entered the entertainment industry,

638
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,830
he swore to himself

639
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:41,600
he would never date before he succeeded.

640
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,120
He was determined to give his mom a happy life,

641
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,370
but his mother left him forever

642
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:52,340
right when he was about to succeed.

643
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,330
As you know,

644
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,580
besides work,

645
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,140
I shouldn't spend my time on having happiness.

646
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,110
That's why I don't want to put anything into my life anymore.

647
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:05,110
So he closed the door of love.

648
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,700
We all know about this.

649
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,780
I was wrong.

650
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,620
I was presumptuous

651
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,050
and willful.

652
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,160
I never thought about others' feelings.

653
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:31,670
Although Ashi closed the door of love,

654
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,870
it doesn't mean he won't love anyone.

655
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:35,790
Yes.

656
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,320
Don't be discouraged.

657
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:42,270
Maybe the answer is not what we think.

658
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,960
Thank you for your encouragement.

659
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,270
I'll get going.

660
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,550
-Bye.
-Okay.

661
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,510
Bye.

662
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,870
How will Ashi feel?

663
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,550
Pun confessed his love so directly.

664
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,960
Mingmuang, do you want to check on Ashi?

665
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,310
Okay.

666
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,300
Let's go.

667
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,840
I think

668
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,070
you should open your heart for him.

669
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,650
His love may fill your life.

670
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,350
All this time,

671
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:50,690
you should've seen how well he treats you.

672
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:56,270
But you can't force these things.

673
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,810
I just want to tell you

674
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:07,670
Ms. Wan and I will always be by your side.

675
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,790
Thank you.

676
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,070
But first, I want to think about some things.

677
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,480
If anything happens,

678
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,990
call me and Mingmuang.

679
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,630
I'm happy to listen.

680
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:28,520
Okay.

681
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,130
I'll get going.

682
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:37,720
Okay.

683
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,310
Let's go, Mingmuang.

684
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:51,030
I remember the first day I saw you.

685
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:57,170
Your smile lit up my world.

my world has no longer been dark.

688
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:19,480
Thank you for being so honest.

689
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,470
But give me some time

690
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,000
to consider your request.

691
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,900
I'm really sorry.

692
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,650
I can't give you an answer yet.

693
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,560
I won't ask about your eyebrows.

694
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:08,110
