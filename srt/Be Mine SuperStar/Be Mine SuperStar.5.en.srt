But the first person rushed to Ashi

00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,590
was Pun.

181
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,040
Right.

182

00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,940
But then who will take care of Ashi?

192
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,780
Or are you going to work alone?

193
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,240
You promised to take care of me.

194
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,570
What can I do? Ashi is injured so seriously.

195
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,680
Who will take care of him?

196
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,870
You go take care of Mingmuang.

197
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,260
I can take care of myself.

198
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,160
No, if you overuse your ankle,

199
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,590
it'll be harder for you to recover.

200
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,040
Let Pun take care of him.

201
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,830
He often comes here.

202
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,050
No, he's an outsider.

203
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,880
How can he be allowed to stay with Ashi all day?

204
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,410
It's not good to be seen.

205
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,570
I'm sorry.

206
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,970
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

207
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,130
Bye.

208
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:54,970
Here.

209
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,620
Excuse me.

210
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,690
Let's talk when I'm back.

211
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,150
Pun, wait.

212
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,430
Pun, don't go.

213
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,900
Daddy Mingmuang.

214
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,990
What is it?

215
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,810
I know you feel wronged.

216
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:31,880
I don't.

217
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
What Ms. Wan said is true.

218
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,930
Sometimes, I might have gotten a little carried away.

219
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,280
Let me ask you seriously.

220
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,530
What kind of feelings do you have about Ashi now?

221
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,580
My feelings haven't changed.

222
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,520
I still love him like before.

223
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:03,460
I've loved him for nine years, and I'll keep loving him.

224
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,190
Are you sure what you said is true?

225
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,780
Don't take love as a joke.

226
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,390
Haven't you seen my heart?

227
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,780
All this time, I tried my best to do everything.

228
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,040
In the end, I'm just an outsider.

229
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,510
Are you discouraged just like that?

230
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,320
I'm not discouraged.

231
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,970
I still love Ashi. It has never changed.

232
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,610
But I should know where my place is.

233
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,460
If you're not discouraged,

234
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,300
I order you to fight on

235
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,910
until you and Ashi can date.

236
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,440
If you need my help,

237
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,430
just let me know.

238
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,670
Really, Daddy Mingmuang?

239
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,270
I always

240
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,040
keep my word.

241
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,850
Thank you, Daddy.

242
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,560
Hey, calm down.

243
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:58,430
The one you should hug is Ashi, not me.

244
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,510
Someone might misunderstand us.

245
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,310
Okay.

246
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,070
But Ms. Wan may think differently from you.

247
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,160
It depends on your courage.

248
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,020
I can only give you a push from behind.

249
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,770
If I help you too much,

250
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,270
Ms. Wan will say I'm too partial to you.

251
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,920
I understand.

252
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,150
I'll go up first. I'll help you with this first.

253
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,070
Okay.

254
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,610
My feelings haven't changed.

I've loved him for nine years and I'll keep loving him.

258
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,680

Come to me in Ms. Wan's office.

273
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,570
Quickly.

274
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,450
Now?

275
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,790
Yes, now.

276
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,410
I'll send you the address. Come quickly.

277
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,040
Okay, no problem.

278
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,360
Pun.

279
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,310
Hello.

280
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,410
Hello.

281
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,569
Ms. Wan wants to talk to you.

282
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,290
Here. This is the password to enter Ashi's apartment.

283
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,380
Why are you giving this to me?

284
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,650
Are you really stupid or are you playing dumb?

285
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,810
Ms. Wan has agreed to let you take care of Ashi.

286
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,450
Really?

287
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,750
Have I ever joked?

288
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,310
Then why did Ms. Wan agree?

289
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,350
Ask her yourself if you want to know.

290
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,710
Why do you ask me?

291
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,730
Let me sum it up.

292
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,240
Tomorrow, you go to Chanthaburi Province alone to work.

293
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,700
I'll stay here to take care of Ashi.

294
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,920
I'm fine. Go take care of Mingmuang.

295
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,940
I want Pun to take care of me.

296
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,110
He knows very well

297
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,940
what I like or dislike.

298
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,970
Keep this a secret.

299
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,500
Don't tell anyone that you're taking care of Ashi.

300
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,390
Got it?

301
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,880
No problem, Ms. Wan.

302
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,610
No matter what you want to do, think twice before you act.

303
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,900
Don't act recklessly,

304
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,380
because you have Ashi's reputation in your hands.

305
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,190
No problem, Ms. Wan.

306
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,560
I want to apologize to you.

307
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,060
I've made you worry the whole time.

308
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,610
To be honest,

309
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,600
I like Ashi.

310
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,280
I liked him before he entered the entertainment industry.

311
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,290
I just want to say, please give me a chance

312
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,410
to prove myself.

313
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,550
Fine, I'll give you a chance to prove yourself.

314
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,960
Take good care of Ashi.

315
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,760
If you do well this time,

316
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,580
I'll turn a blind eye to you.

317
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,280
No problem, Ms. Wan.

318
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,750
Don't worry.

319
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,750
I'll guarantee it with my life.

320
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,400
You're exaggerating.

321
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,720
No need to exaggerate like that.

322
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,840
You've promised me.

323
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,340
Yes, Ms. Wan.

324
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,960
I need to take this call.

325
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,610
You're exaggerating so much.

326
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,950
Go home and pack your things.

327
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,210
Thank you, Daddy Mingmuang.

328
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,210
No need to thank me.

329
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,250
You have to take good care of Ashi

330
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,830
like you promised Ms. Wan.

331
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,880
I swear in the name of a man.

332
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,320
And don't act recklessly.

333
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,680
Ashi is still a pure man.

334
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,250
What are you talking about, Daddy Mingmuang?

335
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,010
I'm a pure man too.

336
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,880
I don't believe it.

337
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,560
If Ashi tells on you when I'm back,

338
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,850
I won't let you go.

339
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,330
I'm not in a hurry to do that.

340
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,920
I'll wait until Ashi is ready.

341
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,300
Ashi's hero…

342
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:54,970
I'll wait and see.

343
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,280
By the way, when we were at the beach,

344
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,010
what do you think that sudden loud bang was?

345
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,150
When I went to save Ashi,

346
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,180
I saw scraps of paper for firecrackers nearby.

347
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,010
Pun, where are you going?

348
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,750
I'm going to take care of Ashi.

349
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,310
Why are you taking care of him?

350
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,310
He has an agent.

351
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,520
His ankle is injured.

352
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,720
Ms. Wan is going to Chanthaburi Province to take care of Mingmuang.

353
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,300
So I have to take care of him.

354
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,180
Is that a national secret?

355
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,340
Yes.

356
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,660
How long will you be away?

357
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,540
I need to answer your dad and grandma when they ask about it.

358
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,870
About three days.

359
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,040
If Grandma asks, just tell her I'm staying at my friend's place.

360
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:03,800
Why, son?

361
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,130
I think she's a fan of Ashi.

362
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,510
Grandma?

363
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,200
She even asked me to give Ashi a gift.

364
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,970
I've never seen her watching a TV drama.

365
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,090
But I saw it secretly.

366
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,670
When she was watching TV,

367
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,210
she always shrinks and twists around.

368
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,520
Don't say that about Grandma.

369
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,340
Do you think too much?

370
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,270
I really saw it.

371
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,760
How about this? Pack up quickly.

372
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,470
Stop talking about your grandma. Just let her be.

373
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,540
Hurry up and make a start, kid.

374
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,080
It's getting late.

375
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,230
Take care on the way.

376
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,650
-And this bag. -Okay.

377
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,610
Help your brother.

378
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,480
Here.

379
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,690
-Bye, Mom. -Have a safe trip.

380
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,210
I think Pun must have been tricked.

381
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,020
I think Ashi looks like a good person.

382
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,600
What do you think?

383
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,370
I'm not talking about Ashi.

384
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,150
I mean his agent.

385
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,350
She saw Pun's willingness to obey her,

386
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,970
so she wants to use him.

387
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,920
You're overthinking.

388
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,920
You always think too highly of other people.

389
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,160
I'm not talking with you anymore. Bye.

390
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,150
Frozen food.

391
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,680
What did you buy? There's so much stuff.

392
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,910
Frozen food.

393
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,740
I'll heat it up when you're hungry.

394
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,740
It's okay. I can make it myself.

395
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,790
How can you do it yourself?

396
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,790
The doctor doesn't allow you to use your hands or feet.

397
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,050
I'll put the things away first.

398
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,350
Have you eaten?

399
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,550
Yes. I made instant noodles.

400
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,680
The doctor told you not to move, but you didn't listen.

401
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,120
I didn't know if you'd come to take care of me or not.

402
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,540
I'll take care of you no matter what.

403
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,040
I'll sleep on the sofa tonight.

404
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:42,670
You sleep in the room. Call me if you need anything.

405
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,690
No, let's sleep together.

406
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,090
Why do you have to sleep on the sofa? It's too tiresome for you.

407
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,950
Sleep together?

408
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,230
What do you think?

409
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,100
Okay.

410
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,580
But this way you can sleep more comfortably.

411
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,900
My bed is big. There's more than enough room for two people.

412
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,290
Besides,

413
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,330
if I need anything,

414
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,540
I won't have to call you.

415
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,130
I can just poke you.

416
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,780
Don't get up, Pun Junior.

417
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,210
Don't get up. I'm begging you.

418
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,070
Let's go. I'm sleepy.

419
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,230
Damn.

420
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:27,850
Hurry up.

421
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,180
It's too late.

422
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,090
Hurry up.

423
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:31,480
Okay.

424
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,750
Be careful.

425
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,030
[Romeo and Juliet]

426
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,000
Okay.

427
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,480
Excuse me.

428
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,670
Sorry.

429
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:37,690
Good night.

430
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,060
Okay, good night.

431
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,860
I've never tried it before.

432
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,240
Pun.

433
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,470
Yes?

434
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,770
What, Mom?

435
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,240
Pun.

436
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:13,990
Pun.

437
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:15,820
Pun.

438
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,120
Pun.

439
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,270
Paii, can you leave me alone?

440
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,390
I'm off today.

441
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,210
Oh no!

442
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,670
Ashi, are you okay?

443
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,890
♫I've been here for you♫

444
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,130
♫If you turn around, you'll know♫

445
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:39,590
♫Everything I've been trying so hard♫

446
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:44,390
♫Every moment I do it for you♫

447
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,810
♫For you♫

448
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,340
You stink.

449
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,400
I'm going out.

450
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,550
Pun.

451
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,280
Yes?

452
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,610
Take me to the bathroom.

453
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:12,990
Yes.

454
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:27,780
Does your stomach hurt?

455
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,470
Yes.

456
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,570
Are you okay?

457
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,710
I'm sorry.

458
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,120
It's okay.

459
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:46,400
I understand.

460
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,090
You can wait outside.

461
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,460
I can handle it myself.

462
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:50,850
Okay.

463
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,820
Do you need anything else?

464
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,470
That's enough, Miss.

465
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,720
Tell me what you want to talk about.

466
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,410
Are you sure?

467
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,500
Tell me everything honestly.

468
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,870
Just tell me what it is.

469
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,690
It's about Dr. Ning.

470
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,340
See? You're not talking.

471
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,450
If you don't want to answer me today,

472
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,290
no matter what,

473
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,380
I will find the answer on you sooner or later.

474
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,840
Do you want me to know it from you

475
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,050
or from someone else?

476
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,350
-Okay. I'll tell you. -Okay.

477
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,520
I met him at a bar.

478
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,040
We were drunk that day, and we...

479
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,460
had a one-night stand.

480
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,650
The minute I saw him,

481
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,470
I knew

482
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,260
he was my type

483
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,790
and he was the person I'd been looking for.

484
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,350
But he has his own principles.

485
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,520
He doesn't date his one-night stand.

486
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,630
What are you afraid of? One-night stand rule, huh?

487
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,830
If he doesn't want to date a one-night stand,

488
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,670
you can have a two-night stand with him, or a three-night stand.

489
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,870
That's all.

490
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,500
Let me give you a massage to relax it.

491
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:20,790
No, thanks.

492
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,590
It's okay.

493
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,530
Is it okay?

494
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,070
Yes.

495
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:47,710
OK.

496
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,380
Let me massage this side for you.

497
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,190
I don't think that's necessary.

498
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,140
No, you need it on this side too,

499
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,580
so that both sides can be relaxed.

500
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,960
Otherwise, if one side is relaxed and the other is tense,

501
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,260
it won't be balanced.

502
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:22,610
Pun.

503
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,030
Yes?

504
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,450
What's the matter?

505
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,460
You're carried away.

506
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,790
The doctor said we should press here too.

507
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,970
Because the nerves are connected.

508
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,030
Don't you believe me?

509
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,690
I think it's okay on this side.

510
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,220
I should press this side slowly.

511
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,700
Good evening, Director Tanada.

512
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,210
Good evening.

513
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:09,180
Have a seat.

514
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,540
Thank you.

515
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,620
Sorry for wasting your time.

516
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,170
It's okay.

517
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:21,870
It's okay.

518
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,910
Do you have anything to tell me?

519
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,640
I heard you're interested in Title,

520
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,350
so I want to make a suggestion.

521
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,730
It's about Title's remuneration.

522
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,090
I can give you 50% off.

523
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,080
Really?

524
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,370
Yes.

525
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,950
Actually, I really want Title to work with you.

526
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,200
Thank you very much

527
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,950
for seeing the value of my work.

528
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,940
Director Tanada, you're here in Thailand.

529
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,700
If you need someone to take care of you,

530
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,320
just let me know. I'll arrange it.

531
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,720
I know many handsome kids

532
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,310
who can take care of others and have a good figure.

533
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,830
Is that really okay?

534
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:15,030
Of course, we're all friends.

535
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,430
Then I won't stand on scruples.

536
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,460
I want a young,

537
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,090
strong, and tall kid.

538
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,770
I'll arrange it right away.

539
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:28,620
Hello, Ban.

540
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,570
What are you doing?

541
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,060
Pun.

542
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,000
You don't have to do it if you can't do it.

543
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,950
I'll try.

544
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:19,830
Hello, what is it, Mingmuang?

545
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:23,639
I'm just calling to ask if you feel better.

546
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,060
Yes.

547
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:26,739
Now my ankle can bear some weight.

548
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,880
How about Pun?

549
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:30,820
Pretty good.

550
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,670
He took all the work.

551
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,920
I don't have to do anything.

552
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,290
Now he's fighting with the mop.

553
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,810
I'm relieved that Pun is taking good care of you.

554
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,070
You should get some rest too.

555
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,250
Be good to Pun.

556
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,040
I've always been good to him.

557
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,600
If you're happy and Pun is happy,

558
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,780
I'll be happy.

559
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,250
What do you mean?

560
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,700
Just the literal meaning.

561
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,280
I'm hanging up.

562
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:05,760
Okay.

563
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,100
Bye.

565
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,250
The client wants to shoot another scene for demonstration.

566
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,100
Make it cool.

567
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,280
Okay.

568
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,470
You know what?

569
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,520
Pun loves him very much.

570
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,370
He won't let Ashi do anything.

571
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,360
I'll wait and see.

572
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:33,660

573

You don't have to do it if you can't do it.

574
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:38,090
Let the nanny do it.

575
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,680
But I want to try it again.

576
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,030

Ashi, don't!

579
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,630
Don't come over!

580
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,620
Ashi, are you okay?

581
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,620
It's all wet.

582
