I want to go to Japan to take care of Ashi.

192
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,970
You can't help him get better.

193
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,170
At least I can fulfill my duty as his boyfriend.

194
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,820
You have to come with me too.

195
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,500
It's none of my business.

196
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,650
Of course it is.

197
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,670
You have to help me this time.

198
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:38,210
At least Ashi will feel at ease when he sees us.

199
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,140
Aren't you afraid of Title?

200
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,840
That's the thing.

201
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,470
You have to help me.

202
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,480
Did you ask me? Did I agree for you two to go?

203
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,850
Right.

204
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,200
Ms. Wan, if I can't go take care of Ashi,

205
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,190
I might not be able to eat or sleep.

206
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,910
I'll feel guilty for the rest of my life.

207
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,720
Please let me go. I'm begging you.

208
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,070
Please let me go.

209
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,310
You want to go? Do you have money?

210
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,380
You pay for me first.

211
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,330
I'll work hard and pay you back.

212
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:17,770
You jerk.

213
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,410
Fine.

214
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,690
Just go,

215
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,790
but don't get involved in the crew's arrangement.

216
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,980
Understand?

217
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,410
Yes, Ms. Wan.

218
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:29,850
Here.

219
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,170
This is the money Ms. Koi gave you before.

220
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,520
I think it's enough for you to buy round-trip tickets.

221
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,960
Thank you, Ms. Wan.

222
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,410
Mingmuang, book a hotel for him.

223
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,260
A cheap hotel should be available.

224
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,450
Daddy Mingmuang, I want to stay in a five-star hotel.

225
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,170
No way.

226
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,190
You got what you wanted.

227
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,270
You act like you won't worry

228
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,860
if Dr. Ning gets sick.

229
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,310
Besides,

230
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,890
I won’t let that Kev...

231
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,600
Kevin's men take advantage of me.

232
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,520
You can't do long-distance jealousy?

233
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,010
Anyway, Ms. Wan agreed.

234
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,880
Consider it a vacation.

235
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,980
I’ll ask Dr. Ning to come with us.

236
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,720
I know what you're thinking.

237
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,500
You talk as if you won't be getting it on

238
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,470
with Ashi when you're there.

239
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,340
Are you crazy, Daddy?

240
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,520
He's sick.

241
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,370
Then, what are you going to tell Ms. Preaw?

242
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,340
Well...

243
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,460
How are you?

244
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:18,760
Much better.

245
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:21,990
Mr. Ashi,

246
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,990
get some rest.

247
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,770
Tell me if you need anything.

248
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,220
Thank you.

249
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,220
Okay, that's all for today.

250
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,480
Don't forget, Pun.

251
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,320
You have to observe the environment

252
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,930
and express the message you want to express in words.

253
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,720
This is the core of acting.

254
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,580
Acting is reacting.

255
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,420
That's it.

256
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,150
Now, tell me.

257
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,900
What is acting?

258
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:05,950
Acting...

259
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,990
What is it?

260
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,090
Acting is reacting.

261
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,040
Okay.

262
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,390
Thank you for teaching him,

263
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,610
-You're welcome.
-Mrs. Aewoo.

264
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,170
You're welcome. I'm happy to help you.

265
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,320
Thank you.

266
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,390
I'll pay you later.

267
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,200
Okay.

268
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,870
When is the next class?

269
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,000
Because this week,

270
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,730
I have to finish the ending of the short film and hand it in.

271
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:36,760
Really?

272
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,830
It's a group project and the others are all free this week.

273
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,730
Finish your schoolwork first

274
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,760
and then call me.

275
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,090
See you.

276
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,710
Bye.

277
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,390
What's the hurry?

278
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,670
Ashi,

279
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,820
get up and take your medicine.

280
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,840
Ashi.

281
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,190
Surprise!

282
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,340
Hey, what are you doing here?

283
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:35,840
Mingmuang.

284
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,770
Ms. Wan was worried about Ashi,

285
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,100
so she asked me to come take care of him.

286
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,600
Don't worry.

287
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,010
I'm here.

288
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,150
Why didn't you call me first?

289
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,390
I wanted to surprise you.

290
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
By the way, Title,

291
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,860
I'm staying in another hotel.

292
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,040
There's no shooting for you two recently.

293
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,300
I want Ashi to live with me.

294
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,070
We can all live here together too.

295
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,090
It's okay. I don't want to trouble the film crew.

296
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,830
Besides, Ashi has recovered.

297
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,830
He's just staying at my place for a few nights.

298
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,900
If Ms. Wan hadn't forced me to come,

299
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,200
and arranged everything for me,

300
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,280
I wouldn't have came.

301
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,390
It's so cold here.

302
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,940
Please take care of him.

303
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,860
Don't let him get a fever again.

304
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,420
Okay.

305
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,050
I promise he'll be up and running soon.

306
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,040
Let's go pack up.

307
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,260
Let's go.

308
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,900
Doctor, it's so cold.

309
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,650
Doctor, I'm going to answer the phone.

310
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,600
Call out to me in a few minutes.

311
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,440
What do you want me to say?

312
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,590
Just shout to me,

313
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,790
"Pun, come back to work."

314
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,970
Something like this.

315
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,900
Okay.

316
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:55,800
Hello, Title.

317
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,840
I called to tell you

318
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,330
Mingmuang came to Japan.

319
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:00,800
Really?

320
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,900
What is Daddy Mingmuang doing in Japan?

321
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,660
He said Ms. Wan asked him to take care of Ashi.

322
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:11,180
Now he took Ashi to his hotel.

323
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,040
Ms. Wan must be worried about Ashi.

324
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,920
Aren't you worried about Ashi?

325
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,130
Pun, come back to work.

326
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,540
Louder!

327
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,360
What?

328
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,710
Pun, come back to work.

329
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,250
Pun.

330
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,600
Title, my friend is calling me.

331
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,100
I have to go.

332
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,900
Bye.

333
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,090
What's the matter, Pun?

334
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,600
Title called to check where I am.

335
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,600
He must suspect

336
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,100
I came to Japan with Daddy Mingmuang.

337
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,230
Why would he suspect that?

338
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,880
Title likes Ashi.

339
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,820
He tried his best to steal Ashi from me.

340
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,390
But don't tell Daddy Mingmuang about this.

341
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,210
I don't want any conflicts between them.

342
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,550
Thank you.

343
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,150
Hey.

344
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,100
What are you two talking about?

345
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,570
Ashi.

346
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,200
Pun.

347
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,120
Okay.

348
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:37,810
Put me down first.

349
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:38,590
I'm going to fall.

350
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,150
I'm sorry.

351
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,240
Are you okay?

352
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,190
Let's go inside.

353
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:56,940
It's cold.

354
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,770
Do you still have a fever?

355
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,570
You're acting like the doctor.

356
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,660
Hey, the real doctor is here.

357
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,750
Let's take your temperature.

358
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,550
He insisted on coming to Japan.

359
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,930
He was like a kid who wanted a toy.

360
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,200
You're spoiling him.

361
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,460
He didn't spoil me.

362
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,360
I begged him.

363
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,340
Plus, I got Ms. Wan's permission.

364
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,810
You brought Dr. Ning here too.

365
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,580
Thank you.

366
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,490
You misunderstood.

367
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,730
I didn't bring the doctor here to treat you.

368
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,660
I just wanted a change in environment.

369
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,430
His fever is gone and his temperature is normal,

370
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,260
but he might be tired.

371
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,970
Get some rest and drink more water.

372
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,200
Okay.

373
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,890
Dating a doctor

374
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,440
is always so heartwarming.

375
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:31,670
Let's go.

376
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,970
