3
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,250
You are mad at me because of Mr. Ashi, right?

4
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,250
I like Mr. Ashi.

5
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,850
But now, we're just friends.

6
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,730
Don't worry.

7
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,810
Thank you very much for respecting Ashi.

8
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,330
But I want to talk to you about Title.

9
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,530
Please don't tell anyone that you met me here,

10
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,450
because Title doesn't know I'm here.

11
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,030
Mr. Title also likes Mr. Ashi. I know.

12
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,650
How do you know?

13
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,210
I can tell from the look in his eyes.

14
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,810
By the way, Mr. Title doesn't like you, right?

15
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,890
Don't worry.

16
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,870
Mr. Title will never get close to Mr. Ashi.

17
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,890
I promise.

18
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,570
You don't have to go that far, Mr. Kevin.

19
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,250
Still, thank you very much.

20
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,130
Actually, we should bring Title along.

21
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,650
I don't think so.

22
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,410
Can he accept you and Pun being together?

23
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,890
I want Title to know about this.

24
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,490
Maybe...

25
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,630
Are you okay?

26
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,130
I'm fine.

27
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,490
I think Title is a reasonable person.

28
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,050
He's my friend. He'll accept it.

29
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,550
Soon,

30
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,210
everyone will know about me and Pun.

31
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,090
I want the people around me to know it first.

32
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,450
I think we should talk about this when we get back to Thailand.

33
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:02,170
The four of us should enjoy ourselves when we are here.

34
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,090
Yes, we can talk about it back in Thailand.

35
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,450
Dr. Ning and I will go back to rest.

36
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,010
Fighting.

37
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,330
Are you really going to tell Title about us?

38
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,730
Yes.

39
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,890
Do you think differently?

40
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,850
I just think that Title doesn't like me very much.

41
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:59,090
I want him to know this.

42
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,370
Because this is the best result for him.

43
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,410
Pun.

44
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,890
I have something to tell you.

45
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,490
I can be at ease only if I tell you.

46
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:16,930
What is it?

47
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,210
In this movie,

48
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,610
there are many romantic scenes.

49
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,650
I'm afraid you'll mind.

50
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,210
You've had many romantic scenes in dramas.

51
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,409
Those were with girls

52
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,370
and we were just pretending to be kissing.

53
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,570
But this time, I'll have romantic scenes with a man

54
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,810
and we'll be kissing for real.

55
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,250
I don't want you to be unhappy about it

56
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,330
after the movie is released.

57
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,650
Only your kiss can move my heart.

89
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,250

90
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,810
What do you mean?

91
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,770
Pun lied to you.

92
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,330
In fact, he secretly flew here with Mingmuang.

93
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,570
What are you going to do with him?

94
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,610
What do you want me to do?

95
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,610
He lied to you.

96
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,330
I'll deal with Pun when he comes back.

97
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,370
Can you control your emotions

98
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,770
and turn the tide to win Ashi's heart?

99
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,610
I'll do my best.

100
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,050
Are you sure you want to try it here?

101
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:39,890
Why?

102
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,050
I want to try.

103
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,330
I'm finally home.

104
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,490
Hello?

105
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,930
Did you forget something?

106
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,050
Go out. I'm going to sleep.

107
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,920
You forgot my presents.

108
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,330
You didn't ask me to bring presents for you.

109
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,810
Then why should I buy you presents?

110
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,090
Hey, I didn't ask you.

111
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,850
But you should have done it.

112
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,170
Give it to me.

113
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,210
Hurry!

114
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,810
So annoying.

115
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,570
Wait.

116
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,290
Here.

117
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,530
Are you satisfied?

118
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,490
Pun.

119
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,930
Why did you buy this?

120
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,330
Do you want it?

121
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,370
I'll give it to someone else if you don't want it.

122
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,210
I want it.

123
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,250
Stop yelling.

124
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,260
Be careful when you're using it.

125
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,050
I only bought one.

126
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:08,650
Okay.

127
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,090
Do you know how to use it?

128
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,610
Mind your own business.

129
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,770
I'm home.

130
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,650
What are you doing?

131
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,290
Are you thinking about me?

132
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,370
I just came back from the rehearsal.

133
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,410
I have an action scene to shoot this afternoon.

134
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,570
Fighting.

135
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,690
I'm already doing my best.

136
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,050
Okay, I'm going to rest.

137
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,090
I miss you.

138
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,610
I miss you too.

139
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,290
Young Master, I'm sorry.

140
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,370
As you know,

141
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,010
I love Ryuujiro.

142
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,290
How dare you hurt him!

143
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,890
I can't stand the fact that

144
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,570
he doesn't cherish your love for him.

145
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:26,890
I don't care.

146
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,290
The only thing I know is that I love him.

147
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,570
I have admired you all my life.

148
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,490
I want you to see my love.

149
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,250
Okay, cut.

150
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,130
I like it. I like it.

151
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,650
Let's go eat.

152
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,610
Ashi.

153
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,250
Where are you going?

154
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,290
You can't accept it, right?

155
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,090
You know my bottom line.

156
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,730
I'm sorry.

157
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,050
I just want to make the acting real

158
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,370
so that I can finish this scene in one take.

159
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,570
If you want to do this,

160
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,730
you should tell me

161
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,450
instead of doing it at your will.

162
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,090
I didn't mean it.

163
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,130
Ashi.

164
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,810
I love you.

165
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:11,970
I've always loved you.

166
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,410
Can you give me a chance?

167
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,050
Sorry, Title.

168
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,290
I have a lover already.

169
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,770
Are you sure you really love Pun?

170
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,290
Why do you say that?

171
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,690
Nothing.

172
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,770
I just want to make sure.

173
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,490
I'm sure.

174
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,250
I know how I feel.

175
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,730
Why didn't you text me?

176
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,010
Are you busy?

177
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,290
Why did you call?

178
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:27,130
Nothing. I wanted to hear your voice.

179
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,050
I want to hear your voice too.

180
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:37,330
I'll finish the filming next week.

181
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,410
Really? Then we can meet.

182
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:45,230
I'll be free for a week when I get back.

183
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,370
Let's spend some time outside Bangkok.

184
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,810
I want to be alone with you.

185
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,570
Well...

186
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,290
Well...

187
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,250
It's okay if you don't want to.

188
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,730
No.

189
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,450
I'll check my schedule

190
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,610
and reply to you.

191
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:09,730
Okay.

192
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,570
I miss you.

193
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,090
I miss you too.

194
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,210
Good night.

195
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:20,670
Good night.

196
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,350
Relax.

197
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,770
You're lucky to sign him.

198
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:55,770
Yes.

199
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,450
I was lucky.

200
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,210
Do I need to change my clothes again?

201
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,250
No, it's enough.

202
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,330
I'd say once these photos are released,

203
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,610
many people will be fascinated by you.

204
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,630
Who will like me?

205
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,180
I'm a nobody.

206
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,370
You're being modest again.

207
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,210
Wait and see.

208
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:28,130
I'll find you a job within a week.

209
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,250
I'll get going then.

210
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,010
OK.

211
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,690
Mr. Ashi.

212
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,010
Stay here for a few more days.

213
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,650
It's okay. I can come again.

214
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,250
You miss Mr. Pun, don't you?

215
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,090
When I first met Mr. Pun,

216
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,170
I knew

217
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,570
he's Kenichi's Ryuujiro.

218
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,050
Do you think so too?

219
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:21,850
You see?

220
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,890
I'm not the only one who thinks that way.

221
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,730
Cherish this love.

222
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,450
Don't let others ruin it.

223
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,670
Thank you.

224
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:11,450

Hello.

00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,450
Hello.

243
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:50,970
Have a seat.

244
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:01,690
You look great after coming back from Japan.

245
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:12,090
I mean, Ashi and I just came back from Japan.

246
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,170
Have you met each other?

247
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,490
Not yet.

248
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,330
What event are we going to attend?

249
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,630
It's a new product launch event for a supplement.

250
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,250
Title is the star of this event.

251
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:32,650
Okay.

252
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,530
At least you can make an appearance

253
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,850
as our company's new artist.

254
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,490
Many entertainment reporters will come to this event.

255
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,570
Okay.

256
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,330
Pun.

257
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,170
How is my new artist?

258
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,250
Is he handsome?

259
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:57,810
We want to know your relationship with the Japanese actor Kevin.

260
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,050
It's nothing. We're just colleagues.

261
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,730
Just colleagues?

262
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,250
Then why did you two interact so closely on social media?

263
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,610
That's why there are fans who ship you two.

264
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,390
If you don't believe me, you can ask Title.

265
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,770
So Title has the insider knowledge?

266
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,970
Let's wait for the official information

267
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,330
to see how Ashi and Kevin met.

268
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,040
Nice to meet you.

269
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,810
This is our company's new actor.

270
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:29,410
Hello, everyone.

271
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,970
Go over there.

272
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,890
Ashi, come here.

273
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,570
Stand in the middle. Like this.

274
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,210
This is Pun.

275
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,850
Both Ashi and Title know him well.

276
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,010
Right, Ashi?

277
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,330
Yes.

278
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,370
Pun was an intern in our crew.

279
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,890
Ms. Preaw wants to make him famous because he's handsome.

280
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:57,050
Please support him.

281
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,130
-Okay.
-Okay.

282
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,650
Look over here.

283
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,610
I'll take good pictures of you.

284
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,970
Look over here.

285
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:08,050
Good. It's cute.

286
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:15,170
-So handsome. I can't stand it.
-Yes.

287
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,410
After all, he's an artist in Ms. Preaw's company.

288
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:46,850
Ashi.

289
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,170
What happened?

290
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,890
Why didn't you tell me?

291
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,610
Do you know

292
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,850
how much I care about your feelings?

293
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,850
I care about your feelings more than mine.

294
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,290
Well...

295
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,010
I'm sorry.

296
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:28,170
-I wanted to tell you, but I...
-Enough.

297
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:35,130
You're acting like

298
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,610
I'm not important to you at all.

299
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:18,530
Here.

300
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,730
Thank you.

301
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,330
5,000 baht in total.

302
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,010
What's with your expression?

303
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,690
It costs a lot of money

304
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,650
to make you famous.

305
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,970
You have to understand.

306
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,820
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

307
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,810
I need to go back and help my mom.

308
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:45,850
Bye.

309
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:58,130
It's time for me to make a fortune.

310
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,810
I really don't know anything.

311
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,490
Mingmuang, it's you.

312
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,520
You're the naughtiest.

313
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,210
You know everything, but you don't say anything.

314
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:20,610
Pun and I planned to tell you after you return.

315
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,770
We didn't know Ms. Preaw would make such sudden moves.

316
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,210
Why didn't you tell me when you were in Japan?

317
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,650
Pun didn't want to bother you with these things.

318
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:35,330
He doesn't want you to be distracted at work.

319
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,450
Then can you tell me now?

320
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,530
Why did Pun sign the contract with Ms. Preaw?

321
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,970
If Pun had refused to sign the contract,

322
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,570
Ms. Preaw would expose his relationship with Ashi.

323
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,130
How did Ms. Preaw know about my relationship with Pun?

324
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,850
I don't know either.

325
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:53,810
I only know

326
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:57,010
she has photos of you two exchanging bracelets.

327
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,250
She threatened Pun with these photos.

328
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,730
Why did she do that?

329
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,650
Maybe she wants to take revenge on you.

330
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,490
What does it have to do with me?

331
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,850
If Pun refused to sign the contract,

332
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,730
Ms. Preaw would expose them.

333
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,370
Then Ashi's career would be affected.

334
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,010
If Ashi's career doesn't go well,

335
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,330
your career will be ruined too.

336
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,890
That's why Pun signed the contract.

337
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,930
He did so to protect the one he loves.

338
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,610
I feel sorry for him.

339
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,170
He's carrying all the burden on his own.

340
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,490
Paii, you don't have to say anything more.

341
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,449
Can anyone other than Paii say something?

342
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,449
Ashi.

343
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:23,850
I'm sorry.

344
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,730
Mingmuang told me everything.

345
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,489
I know

346
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,929
how hurt you are.

347
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,730
You have to do things you don't like.

348
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,650
I'm really sorry.

349
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,810
I'm fine.

350
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,050
It's only a one-year contract.

351
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,730
It'll expire soon.

352
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,970
Then we can reveal our relationship.

353
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,610
By then,

354
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:24,650
even if Ms. Preaw publishes our photos,

355
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,850
it's useless.

356
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,770
But it's a hard year.

357
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:38,690
We can't go anywhere we want anymore.

358
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:42,490
Even if it's my apartment, you...

359
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,050
Even if we can't meet,

360
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,730
we can call each other.

361
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,090
Don't think too much.

362
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,770
Don't you want to be with me?

363
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,330
Of course I do.

364
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,090
I want to be with you all the time.

365
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,570
I want to

366
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,610
kiss you like this.

367
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,770
I want to

368
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:24,530
hold you like this.

369
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,210
Like this, okay?

370
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,690
If we want to meet,

371
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,970
come to my house and find me.

372
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,210
Everyone here loves you

373
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,570
and is ready to protect you at any time.

374
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,050
What about the work Ms. Preaw arranged for you?

375
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,850
Well,

376
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,530
I might have to do it first.

377
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,650
I'm not born to be an actor.

378
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:07,930
Ms. Preaw may give up on making me popular.

379
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:17,970
I only worry about Title.

380
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:19,970
I never thought

381
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,890
he liked me.

382
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,770
How do you know?

383
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,970
When we were filming in Japan,

384
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,010
Title...

385
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,650
I love you.

386
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,570
I've always loved you.

387
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,570
Can you give me a chance?

388
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,930
What are you going to do with Title?

389
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,290
The filming of the drama and the movie was over.

390
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,770
I'll stay away from him for a while.

391
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,170
I believe

392
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,570
time can heal his heart.

393
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:11,770
I hope he can be my friend again.

394
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,330
I hope so too.

395
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,250
Do you miss me?

396
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:24,690
Very much.

397
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,290
You're not as fast as me.

398
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:44,490
♫If you turn around, you'll know♫

399
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:48,790
♫Everything I've been trying so hard♫

400
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,670
♫Every moment I do it for you♫

401
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,270
♫For you♫

402
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,420
If you turn around, you'll understand

403
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,870
♫Do you know♫

404
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:10,490
♫How much I love you♫

405
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:14,480
♫Do you hear that♫

406
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,010
Do you want to sleep on the bed?

407
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:24,890
It's soft.

408
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:25,490
Let's go.

409
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,370
I've changed the bedsheet and bedding.

410
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,330
Are you sure it was him?

411
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,130
Yes, I remember his face.

412
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,210
I was suspecting

413
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:20,370
Ms. Preaw was involved in this.

414
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,050
It's all your fault.

415
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,850
You kept denying me.

416
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,610
What do you mean?

417
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,290
I just said

418
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,890
you shouldn't accuse her without evidence.

419
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:32,250
Well, we have a witness now.

420
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,330
But we still have no evidence

421
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,530
to prove that they know each other.

422
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:38,970
Well,

423
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,690
don't tell anyone about this.

424
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,330
I'll handle it.

425
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,450
But I need your help.

426
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,770
What do you want me to do?

427
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:50,050
I need you to find information and evidence

428
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:54,290
to find out how close Ms. Preaw is to that supporting actor.

429
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:55,610
Okay.

430
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,750
We have to kill the snake.

431
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,490
Won't it bite us?

432
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,380
You're such a good teller of sayings.

433
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,210
Otherwise, she'll bite us back.

434
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,890
You said we couldn't meet at the apartment.

435
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,530
I mean

436
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:29,570
we can't meet whenever we want.

437
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,490
We need to set a time in advance.

438
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,530
But I...

439
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,890
I'm available anytime.

440
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,850
Stop talking back.

441
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,530
Anyway,

442
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:49,410
you need to be more careful recently,

443
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:52,450
especially with Ms. Preaw.

444
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,810
Don't worry.

445
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,850
I'll try my best to make it look real.

446
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:02,330
So confident.

447
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,890
I have a great teacher too.

448
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,810
I was just kidding.

449
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:11,850
You're teasing me again.

450
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,530
This is the punishment for teasing me.

451
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:15,490
Just kidding.

452
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:16,530
Pun.

453
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:40,290
Hello, Ms. Preaw.

454
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,890
Is there anything I can do?

455
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,410
You sound so happy.

456
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:48,010
Dress up and come to my office tomorrow.

457
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,050
I'll take you to visit the elders.

458
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,650
Okay.

459
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,450
See you at the office at nine.

460
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,130
Okay.

461
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:07,450
How is it?

462
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:10,050
Am I good at acting?

463
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:13,410
Yes. It's like you are a Channel Three star.

464
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:17,250
Ashi.

465
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,170
You're teasing me again.

466
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:26,770
I can't reach it.

467
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:29,690
No.

468
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:54,410
OK, Mr. Title.

469
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:55,090
OK.

470
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:57,570
I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

471
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:59,930
Okay, bye.

472
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:04,410
Hello, Ms. Gong Ae.

473
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,530
This is Pun.

474
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,010
You're amazing.

475
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:17,730
You made him more handsome.

476
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:23,450
Thank you for taking care of him.

477
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:25,810
I need to see if he can play the role first.

478
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:27,450
Don't worry.

479
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:32,010
I hired an acting teacher to teach him one-on-one.

480
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:38,770
Let me see.

481
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,730
Let him try with the director.

482
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:50,650
Okay.

483
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,410
Pun.

484
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:52,650
Say thank you to Ms. Gong Ae.

485
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:54,370
Thank you.

486
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:54,850
You're welcome.

487
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,850
Hello, Ms. Preaw.

488
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:04,770
Ms. Gong Ae.

489
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:06,090
Hello, Ms. Gong Ae.

490
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,490
I'm Ban.

491
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:08,890
Who is this?

492
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:15,810
An actor I know.

493
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,810
Isn't he an artist at your company?

494
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,290
Excuse me.

495
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:21,130
Pun.

496
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,370
Sit here with Ms. Gong Ae.

497
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:23,690
Okay.

498
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,570
Do you know that guy?

499
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:43,890
I just joined the company.

500
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:45,970
I don't know a lot of people yet.

501
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:48,370
Okay.

502
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:57,130
I'm going to the bathroom.

503
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:58,690
Okay, go ahead.

504
00:45:58,890 --> 00:45:59,490
Excuse me.

505
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,010
What are you doing?

506
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:12,410
Ms. Preaw.

507
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,210
If I hadn't played the supporting role,

508
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:15,250
I wouldn't have known

509
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:16,770
you are so close to her.

510
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:18,890
You brought that rookie to the crew,

511
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,330
but you didn't recommend me.

512
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:24,050
Ban, I recommended you.

513
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:25,650
But Ms. Gong Ae is not interested in you.

514
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:27,010
What do you want me to do?

515
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,370
Timing is very important.

516
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:30,370
Calm down.

517
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,010
Don't be so reckless.

518
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,090
How calm do you want me to be?

519
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,530
I've been doing everything for you,

520
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:36,650
be they big or small.

521
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:37,930
I did everything

522
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:38,890
you asked me to do.

523
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:40,410
But you never care about me.

524
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:43,290
Anyway,

525
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:45,930
I'll recommend you to Ms. Gong Ae again

526
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:48,010
since she saw you.

527
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:49,570
But I can't guarantee

528
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,570
that she will reach out to you.

529
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,210
Okay, Ms. Preaw.

530
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:54,730
I'll wait for your reply.

531
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:57,450
What are you doing?

532
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:58,530
There are so many people here.

533
00:46:58,770 --> 00:46:59,450
Come here.

534
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:09,410
Hello, honey.

535
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:13,650
You don't have to be alone tonight.

536
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:18,730
Because I'll take care of your heart.

537
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:27,850
Is it okay?

538
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:38,170
You know what? You embarrassed me today.

539
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:40,410
I'm sorry.

540
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:42,770
This is my first time acting,

541
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:45,490
So, I was careless. I didn't act well.

542
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:46,850
It's not that you didn't act well.

543
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:48,730
It's that you don't know how to act at all.

544
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,410
Looks like I need to give you more training.

545
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:53,970
Bring me your class schedule.

546
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:55,410
Let me see when you don't have classes

547
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,170
so that your acting teacher can give you extra lessons.

548
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:00,050
Wait for me here.

549
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:02,260
I'm going to the bathroom. I'll talk to you later.

550
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:38,490
Oh...

551
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:58,290
What are you doing, Pun?

552
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,530
Did you get the class schedule?

553
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:08,770
I...

554
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:10,530
I can't reach my friend.

555
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:12,290
I'll send it to you tonight.

556
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:15,290
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

557
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:16,650
Bye.

558
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:36,570
I'm here.

559
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:39,210
This is the memory card of the surveillance camera.

560
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:40,210
As for this...

561
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:42,650
This is the memory card of our photos.

00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,410
Is this the time to joke?

563
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:49,930
Isn't this too risky?

564
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,530
What if Ms. Preaw finds out?

565
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:54,290
I don't think she will know.

566
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:58,890
Because she won't see anything on CCTV.

567
00:49:59,050 --> 00:49:59,850
I think

568
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,370
there must be pictures of Ban

00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:02,770
coming to the company to see Ms. Preaw.

570
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:05,930
This time, Ms. Preaw will be in big trouble.

571
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:15,290
Hello?

572
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:16,170
What's wrong, Mingmuang?

573
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:20,090
Help me. I don't want to be in such pain.

574
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,450
Mingmuang is in trouble.

575
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:27,610
I'll go get changed.

576
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:33,370
Do you need my help?

577
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:00,370
Mingmuang.

Dr. Ning has someone else.

Daddy Mingmuang.

581
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,450
I'll get him a towel to wipe his body.

582
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:40,530
Okay.

583
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:42,650
No need.

584
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:45,690
I want to drink more.

585
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,130
Buy me some wine.

586
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:51,850
That's enough. You can't be more drunk.

588
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:57,330

589
00:51:57,610 --> 00:51:58,530
If you don't tell us,

590
00:51:58,650 --> 00:51:59,970
how can we know what happened?

591
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:02,850
Dr. Ning has someone else.

592
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:07,090
I saw it with my own eyes.

593
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:17,650
Doctor.

594
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:19,850
Mingmuang.

595
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:25,850
You have a patient?

596
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:30,850
Pupa is the son of my father's best friend.

597
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:33,370
He just came back from abroad.

598
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:42,930
Hello.

599
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:48,130
Hello.

600
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:05,370
Then I'll have the check-up next time.

Daddy Mingmuang, calm down.

603
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:37,410
Have you talked to Dr. Ning?

604
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:39,530
Not yet.

605
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:42,210
I called him and he turned off his phone.

606
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,410
Hey. Hey. Hey.

607
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:46,490
Daddy Mingmuang.

608
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,430
Shall we go upstairs?

609
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,860
Daddy Mingmuang, cover your ears.

Then you need to pay me three million.

613
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:58,250
No problem. I have money.

614
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:00,210
You want to get back together with him.

615
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:01,770
I'm sorry.

How?

619
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:11,490
Did Ashi ever tell you he loves you?

620
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:13,970
Listen to me first, Pun.

621
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,290
No need to explain.
