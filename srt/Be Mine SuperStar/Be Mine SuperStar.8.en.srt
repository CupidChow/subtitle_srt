[Characters, places and incidents in this production are partly fictitious. Viewer discretion is advised]

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,320
Ta-da. It's from my mom.

3
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,030
Paii just sent it here.

4
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,350
How's our acting?

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,320
Is that necessary?

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,300
This is just from my mom.

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,300
I didn't count in my grandmother yet.

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,340
You have to tell your mother and grandmother

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,910
not to prepare these things for me next time.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,450
Then you'll have to tell them yourself.

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,700
I'll be there when I'm free.

12
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,140
Let's have coffee.

13
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,910
Look.

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:01,810
Pun.

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,390
Yes?

16
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:06,250
What are you doing?

17
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,630
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,940
I can't help it.

19
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,289
Ban!

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,930
I need you to do something important for me.

21
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:14,510
[Be Mine. Superstar]

22
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,420
Please, Ashi.

23
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,680
Do you want to sleep here tonight?

24
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,040
I'm free tomorrow. We can hang out together.

25
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,960
I thought you wouldn't invite me.

26
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,380
Then...

27
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,960
What?

28
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,680
Tonight, once.

29
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,090
What once?

30
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,640
Oh, Ashi.

31
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,520
I've kept it for several times.

32
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,350
Don't you feel sorry for Pun Junior?

33
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,030
Ashi Junior hasn't complained.

34
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,220
Pun Junior is only 20 years old.

35
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,210
Are you saying I'm old?

36
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,820
You're only a few years younger than me.

37
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,890
That's not what I meant.

38
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,500
I don't want to argue with you about this.

39
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,930
Let's go.

40
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,070
Pun Junior will lead the way.

41
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,420
Pun.

42
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,010
Yes.

43
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,200
This way, please.

44
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,649
Doctor, I can't take it anymore.

45
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,280
Why do you want to take a walk in the park?

46
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,120
What brings you here?

47
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,860
Didn't you say

48
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,290
you wanted to wait until you grow up and get ready?

49
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,280
I am going to wait.

50
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,390
Then why did you buy this?

51
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,890
I thought...

52
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,820
If I were to buy you an engagement ring,

53
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,700
that ring must be good enough.

54
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:35,650
I won't let you wear a ring that's worse than anyone else's.

55
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,770
I don't mind.

56
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,780
Any ring is fine.

57
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,130
As long as the person who gives it to me

58
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,770
can see its value.

59
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,390
Give me your hand, okay?

60
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,340
You can wear it when you are in Japan.

♫I want to thank Destiny for bringing you to me that day♫

62

When you miss me,

64
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,250
you can put it on.

Go back.

Don't forget to pay me.

109
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,710
I was just about to be romantic.

110
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,940
I transferred the money.

111
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,620
Received.

112
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,240
You can call me often for simple jobs like this.

113
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,930
I'm willing to help.

114
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,250
Don't tell others about this.

115

Don't worry.

116
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,500
I'm leaving.

117
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,410
Okay.

118
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
Did you forget something again?

119
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,940
Nothing.

120
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,030
Where did you get these photos?

121
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,720
And what are you going to do with these photos?

122
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,980
Nothing.

123
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,790
It's just that someone gave them to me.

124
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,390
Don't lie.

125
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,140
I bumped into Ban just now.

126
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,280
If you don't tell me the truth,

127
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,990
I'll ask him.

128
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,310
All right.

129
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,170
I'm just looking for evidence

130
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,720
to expose them.

131
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,370
I really want to know

132
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,710
how disgraced Wan'en will be.

133
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,850
You can't do that.

134
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,990
You're ruining someone else's future.

135
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,270
His future is going to be ruined.

136
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,250
But your future will be bright.

137
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,350
I won't have a brighter future

138
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,280
if Ashi doesn't love me...

139
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,390
What are you talking about?

140
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:42,890
Ms. Preaw,

141
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,410
I beg you.

142
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,300
Don't hurt the man I love.

143
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,170
I fell in love with Ashi at first sight.

144
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,850
Title.

145
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,330
You should know the love of people like us very well.

146
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,490
Don't include me.

147
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,860
I've never loved anyone.

148
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,610
If I want it, I'll buy it.

149
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,370
I understand. I won't blame you for loving someone.

150
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,360
Let me ask you.

151
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,660
Why don't you confess your love to Ashi directly if you love him?

152
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,730
I dare not, Ms. Preaw.

153
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,600
I'm afraid Ashi will hate me.

154
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,640
What are you thinking?

155
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,140
You're much better than that guy.

156
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,250
And you met Ashi before he did.

157
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,820
It's not hard to win Ashi's heart,

158
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,900
if you dare to do it.

159
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,720
Do you want me to take Ashi away from his boyfriend?

160
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:44,900
Come on.

161
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,430
Don't act like you only want to be his good friend.

162
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,490
Destroy your enemy

163
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,770
and win Ashi's heart.

164
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,340
I know you can do it.

165
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,580
I won't stop you.

166
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,480
Okay, Ms. Preaw.

167
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,770
Thank you.

168
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,680
As I said,

169
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,460
we're a family.

170
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,240
The imported products will be delivered by today, Your Highness.

171
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,350
I'll leave it to you, Kunakorn.

172
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,320
No problem, Your Highness.

173
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,760
Cut.

174
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,690
The shoot is over, everyone.

175
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,100
Thank you.

176
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,820
Ashi, I have something to tell you.

177
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,620
What is it?

178
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,590
Actually,

179
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,180
I wanted to tell you on the day I fly to Japan.

180
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,550
But on second thoughts,

181
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,280
I think I should tell you now.

182
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:02,610
Go ahead.

183
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,080
I accepted Director Tanada's invitation

184
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,250
to act as your trusted subordinate.

185
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,340
Really?

186
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,560
Yes.

187
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,130
That's great.

188
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,680
Congratulations.

189
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,450
My two friends are going international.

190
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,840
Great.

191
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,080
If you go to Japan together,

192
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,120
you can help and take care of each other.

193
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,560
Thank you.

194
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,470
By the way, Ashi,

195
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,950
we should rehearse together.

196
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,310
It'll be easier for us to work together once we get there.

197
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,640
Good idea.

198
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,050
I'm worried about this too.

199
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,030
When shall we start rehearsing?

200
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,890
Today is fine.

201
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,840
We won't waste any time this way.

202
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,150
Okay.

203
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,710
I've known you for so long.

204
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,170
But this is my first time here.

205
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,130
If we were in the same agency

206
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,250
as before,

207
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,150
you might have been free to go in and out of this house.

208
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,350
Sit here and wait for a while.

209
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,240
I'll get changed first.

210
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,230
There's water in the fridge.

211
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,440
Suit yourself.

212
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:30,510
[Dragon's Desire]

213
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,510
[Notes]

214
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,190
[Come on, Dragon's Desire]

215
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,210
[Dragon's Desire]

216
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,230
Let's start the rehearsal.

217
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,070
Which scene should we start from?

218
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,750
Which scene?

219
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,220
This scene.

220
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,700
Okay.

221
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,740
As you play the subordinate, you should stand here.

222
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,390
I'll sit here.

223
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,170
-Here. Okay?
-Okay.

224
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,650
Is he done rehearsing?

225
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,270
[Pun's calling]

226
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,140
Why isn't he picking up?

227
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,630
[Pun: Are you asleep?]

228
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,150
Can't you bear to hurt him?

229
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,079
I don't know.

230
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,869
Maybe it's because we're very close.

231
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:09,660
Something like this.

232
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,450
Why hasn't he read my texts?

233
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,660
I'm going to bed then.

234
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,550
[Pun: I'm going to bed then. Miss you]

235
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,700
How are you, puppy?

236
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:56,920
Today,

237
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,070
no planes have flown over here.

238
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,760
Ashi didn't call me.

239
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,950
He didn't read my texts.

240
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,680
What's wrong with him?

241
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,570
Daddy Mingmuang said

242
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,340
he was rehearsing a Japanese movie with Title.

243
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,880
But why can't he watch his phone while rehearsing?

244
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,260
Hey, maybe he's rehearsing a banned film.

245
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,360
Nonsense.

246
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,450
I just want to make you laugh. Can't I?

247
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,050
You can call Mingmuang

248
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,300
and ask him to call Ashi.

249
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,550
Then Mingmuang can ask Ashi to call you back.

250
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,720
What's so hard about that?

251
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,030
I don't want to bother him with trivial things.

252
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,050
If he misunderstands me,

253
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,620
it'll be worse.

254
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,840
Do you want me to make some coffee?

255
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,770
Then you can take the coffee to Ashi and Title.

256
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,200
Have you heard of food support?

257
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,590
Right.

258
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,960
Why do you know so much now?

259
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,780
I'm getting goosebumps.

260
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,260
How come you need my help for such a simple thing? You stupid.

261
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,830
Go make coffee.

262
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,120
Didn't you say you would help me?

263
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,340
Wait. Let me play with Coco for a while.

264
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,110
Go and make coffee.

265
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:08,870
Go away.

266
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,280
I need to take this call.

267
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:44,900
Pun, what is it?

268
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,950
What are you doing?

269
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,460
I just came back from dinner with Title.

270
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,630
Really?

271
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,230
I'm sorry.

272
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,620
My phone is muted.

273
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,200
I rehearsed with Title until dawn.

274
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,720
Ashi, take care of yourself.

275
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,670
I miss you.

276
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,330
I miss you too.

277
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,680
Let's talk next time.

278
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,560
Okay.

279
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,130
How is it?

280
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,750
Is everything here?

281
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,450
Yes.

282
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,420
Are you ready, Pun?

283
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,030
-Yes.
-Tell the actors to get ready.

284
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,660
You are going to start shooting. Hurry.

285
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:21,710
OK.

286
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,480
Mr. Ashi, Mr. Title.

287
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,270
You are going to start shooting.

288
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,230
Please, Your Highness.

289
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,640
You should move like this.

290
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,450
Like this.

291
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,010
Ashi, you stand here.

292
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,980
Here, here. Okay, a little more.

293
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,000
Move over there a little more.

294
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:53,670
Okay.

295
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,380
Okay.

296
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,030
Boom operator.

297
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,200
Ready.

298
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,230
Camera.

299
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,410
Ready.

300
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,410
And action!

301
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,000
Kunakorn, have you ever loved?

302
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,030
Yes.

303
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,460
My love

304
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,620
is unconditional.

305
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,230
I think so too.

306
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,270
Ms. Film

307
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,260
-What?
-Is it okay?

308
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,950
Good. I like it.

309
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,040
Cut. Change the scene.

310
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,150
Ashi, let me help you with your hair.

311
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,040
Thank you.

312
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,090
In the end,

313
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,770
I'm just a puppy in his eyes.

314
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,410
Give me your hand.

315
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,510
Is something wrong?

316
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,390
Nothing.

317
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,810
That's who I am.

318
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,900
What's wrong?

319
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,740
Tell me.

320
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,510
Since Ashi and Title started rehearsing,

321
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,470
Ashi hasn't called me.

322
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,570
In terms of my texts,

323
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,880
sometimes he would read them, and sometimes not.

324
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,430
I asked them to get ready for blocking,

325
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,490
Title looked at me in a strange way.

326
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,290
Or he feels happy about

327
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,860
taking Ashi away from me?

328
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,560
You're jealous because of Title.

329
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,200
You.

330
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,770
They are friends.

331
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,060
If Ashi doesn't like him,

332
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,770
no one can take Ashi away from you.

333
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,780
I just want to say

334
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,840
I won't be able to see Ashi in the crew soon.

335
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,210
I'm going to work in the editing room as an intern.

336
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,810
Today is my last day in the crew.

337
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,610
This is very important.

338
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,960
I'll handle it for you.

339
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,930
What's wrong, Mingmuang?

340
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,940
Come to see me.

341
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,280
What is it?

342
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,700
Just come.

343
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,530
Or you can come to me.

344
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,690
I need to get ready for the next scene.

345
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,900
I need to focus.

346
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,890
Okay. We can talk after the shoot.

347
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,870
I'll bring him to you after the shoot.

348
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,730
Okay?

349
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:26,930
Okay.

350
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,000
Pun. Pun.

351
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,360
Are you ready for the next scene?

352
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,170
Yes, I'm ready.

353
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,790
I'll be right there.

354
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,280
I'll get going.

355
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,470
How much of the script did you read?

356
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,770
I've read two scenes.

357
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,620
I've been reading.

358
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,400
Ashi.

359
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,960
Are you in a hurry to go home?

360
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,990
Oh, right. You said you had something to tell me.

361
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,110
Is it something important?

362
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,580
Yes.

363
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,870
Wait a minute.

364
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,270
How about this?

365
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,860
If you need to talk,

366
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,270
I'll go back first.

367
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,520
Today's rehearsal is canceled.

368
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:24,550
Hey.

369
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,850
I memorized all the lines for the rehearsal.

370
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,110
You have something to say, don't you?

371
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,970
So, what's

372
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,010
the important thing you want to say?

373
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,080
Mingmuang, just say it.

374

I'll massage your shoulders and back.

563
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,720
Do you know how to massage?

564
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:12,740
I can do it.

565
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,710
What time is it in Japan?

566
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:31,100
How are you?

567
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,790
[How are you?]

568
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:33,490
Is it cold there?

569
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:38,390
[Is it cold there?]

570
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,080
Wear more clothes.

571
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:41,110
[Wear more clothes]

572
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,590
[Unknown Caller]

573
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:56,010
Hello?

574
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,310
Hello, Pun.

575
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,700
I'm Preaw.

576
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,820
Are you free tomorrow?

577
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:03,780
I have something important to tell you.

578
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,100
Something important?

579
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,290
What is it?

580
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,240
I want you to come to my office

581
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,930
to talk about it in detail.

582
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:14,330
Okay.

583
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:16,770
I'll send you the location.

584
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,830
See you around 10 a.m.

585
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,530
Okay, ten o'clock.

586
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,170
Okay, bye.

587
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:25,360
See you tomorrow.

588
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,370
Come in.

589
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:51,990
Hello.

590
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,390
Hello.

591
00:46:58,740 --> 00:46:59,310
Okay.

592
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:13,480
I won't beat around the bush.

593
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,770
I hope you can be my artist.

594
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,380
Now there are TV producers who want to make you famous.

595
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,930
Do you want me to be a star?

596
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,630
Yes.

597
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:30,090
Don't say no

598
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,150
or tell me you're not suitable to be a star.

599
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:35,670
But I'm not good at acting.

600
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:39,110
Don't worry.

601
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,130
I'll ask the acting teacher

602
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,990
to tutor you one on one.

603
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:47,670
The chance is right in front of you.

604
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,160
I think you should seize it.

605
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:52,840
What if I refuse?

606
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,060
It doesn't matter.

607
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,630
Why do you have these photos?

608
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:24,650
Don't ask me.

609
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,430
Just answer me.

610
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,330
Do you want to sign the contract with me?

611
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:36,040
You should know

612
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,950
what will happen to Ashi

613
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:39,610
if these photos are out there.

614
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,010
And about the movie shoot in Japan,

615
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,160
it's clearly stated

616
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,150
that no actors are allowed to disclose their relationship within a year,

617
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,900
or the actor will be held accountable.

618
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:03,190
You don't want Ashi to be sued, do you?

619
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:05,260
Right?

620
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:11,690
I want to discuss this with my parents first.

621
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,690
Sure.

622
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:15,840
I'll give you three days.

623
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:17,840
Today is the first day.

624
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:21,690
You have to give me an answer on the third day.

625
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:23,720
Okay?

[Be Mine. Superstar]

627
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,930
I want to tell you

628
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,490
I have a boyfriend.

630
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:20,470

631
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,590
I hope your movie will be a global hit.

632
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,320
Are you sure you can relax this way?
