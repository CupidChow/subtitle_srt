00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,040
Hello, Ms. Koi.

4
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,120
Really?

5
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,210
Thank you so much, Ms. Koi.

6
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,539
Don't worry. I'll take care of that.

7
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:14,750
Thank you again.

8
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,930
OK.

9
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,920
Bye.

10
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,300
Preaw.

11
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:26,770
You have nowhere to run this time.

12
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,640
Officers, calm down.

13
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:39,830
Officers.

14
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,440
What are you doing?

15
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,900
Why do you arrest me?

16
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:43,570
Look at my shoes.

17
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,570
Can I go back and change my shoes?

18
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,229
-No.
-Let me go back and change my shoes.

19
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,729
-My shoes are broken.
-Get changed at the police station.

20
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,910
Look at my face.

21
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,380
Who can I hurt when I look like this?

22
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,190
It has nothing to do with the looks. Go.

23
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,330
Hello.

24
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,550
-Hello. -Hello.

25
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,150
Look over here, please.

26
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,950
Ms. Preaw.

27
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,450
What is it?

28
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,430
Please come with us 
to the police station to give a statement.

29
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,990
What is it?

30
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,430
What is it?

31
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,120
It's about the thing 
you hired someone to hurt people.

32
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,650
Wan.

33
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,130
Don't slander me.

34
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,510
I'll call the police and sue you for defamation.

35
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,710
Please. Hurry up.

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,030
Please call the police.

37
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,780
Because the police are waiting for you.

38
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:30,770
Most importantly,

39
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,510
Ban said he missed you.

40
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,870
Being in the prison, 
he wants to talk to a friend.

41
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,500
Don't listen to her.

42
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,680
She's lying.

43
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,480
If you insist that you're innocent,

44
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,160
please come to the police station
to help us investigate.

45
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,230
-This way, please.
-Take photos here. It's big news.

46
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,640
-Please take photos.
-Stop taking photos!

47
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,670
I said stop!

48
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,829
You reporters are crazy!

49
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,980
Stop taking photos!

50
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,710
I'll sue you for invasion of privacy.

51
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,510
Stop! I'm innocent.

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,420
Mr. Title,

53
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,030
do you know what happened to your agent?

54
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,270
I'm not clear about it.

55
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,130
My work is done here. I'll get going.

56
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,040
-Wait.
-Wait, Mr. Title.

57
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,470
-What about Pun?
-What about you?

58
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,760
Do you know what happened?

59
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,680
Please answer.

60
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,030
I'm a newbie. I know nothing.

61
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,250
Let's go, Pun.

62
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,790
Come here.

63
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,010
-Bye. -What?

64
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,170
I'm free.

65
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,200
I'm free!

66
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,150
Pun, great.

67
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,430
I'm happy for you. Very happy.

68
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:45,070
Thank you for being willing to suffer.

69
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,530
You didn't care how hard it was.

70
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,710
I'm willing to do it 
even it's harder than this.

71
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,090
I don't know how to repay you.

72
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,450
But I want to tell you

73
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,810
that…

74
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,270
I love you the most in the world.

75
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,400
Are you taking revenge on me?

76
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,580
Pun.

77
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,790
Are you taking revenge on me?

78
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,660
Title.

79
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,190
I'll wait for you in the car.

80
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,480
So you can have a good talk.

81
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,390
You asked me out here. Is there anything?

82
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,970
I know at the moment

83
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,750
you're upset because of what happened to Preaw.

84
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,350
I want to help you.

85
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:35,400
Help me?

86
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,720
How?

87
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,810
You don't have an agent now.

88
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,200
Do you want to work with me and Mingmuang?

89
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,200
I've talked to Ms. Wan.

90
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,610
She's fine with it.

91
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,010
Are you sure? Won't you mind?

92
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,230
You know my feelings for you.

93
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,000
But I believe

94
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,440
our friendship

95
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,430
will never disappear.

96
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,510
If you're OK with it, I'm OK too.

97
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,480
That's good.

98
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,750
Call Ms. Wan

99
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,020
so that she can take over your work.

100
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,370
Thank you.

101
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,620
I'll get going.

102
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,070
Have you found Mingmuang?

103
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,610
He was not in the apartment.

104
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:52,870
No one opened the door no matter how hard I knocked.

105
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,940
Where did he go then?

106
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,710
I'll attend this event for him then.

107
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,300
No.

108
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,810
The products you two endorse 
are competitive products.

109
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,270
I don't want to do it.

110
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,620
I'll be kicked out by the organizer again.

111
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,140
Hello, Ms. Wan.

112
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,010
Hello.

113
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,970
I've arranged Title to go.

114
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,760
I've called the organizer.

115
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,490
Thank you both

116
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,130
for helping me and Mingmuang.

117
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,440
It's good that Title can go.

118
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,700
Something must have happened 
between him and Dr. Ning.

119
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,250
Don't worry.

120
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,960
Pun and I will try our best to find him.

121
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,420
By the way,

122
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,550
I need to take Title over 
to try on the clothes.

123
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,770
OK.

124
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,880
Seeing Title like that,

125
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,330
I feel much relieved.

126
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:09,850
Why?

127
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,280
Because he made friends with you again.

128
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,690
We've solved Title's problem,

129
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,760
but we still have to 
deal with Daddy Mingmuang.

130
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,570
It's endless.

131
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,710
Alright.

132
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,180
Since they are our friends,

133
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,720
we have the responsibility to support them.

134
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,960
OK.

135
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,230
Ashi.

136
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,990
Is that it?

137
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,190
Ashi.

138
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,530
Where have you been?

139
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,080
Do you know everyone is worried about you?

140
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,750
None of your business.

141
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,310
If you keep drinking like this, 
who can help you?

142
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,200
Don't help if you can't.

143
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,770
Daddy Mingmuang, you have a call.

144
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,750
Aren't you going to take it?

145
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,270
It must be Ms. Wan.

146
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,840
She calls you because she's worried about you.

147
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,910
Dr. Ning.

148
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,190
Where have you been?

149
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,350
Where are you now?

150
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,120
I'll go look for you.

151
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,510
I'm in another province. The signal's not good.

152
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,310
I'll go look for you when I get back.

153
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,970
I have something to talk to you too.

154
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,350
OK, I'll wait for you.

155
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,990
You...

156
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,920
must be curious about Pupa.

157
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,750
You told me that day.

158
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,780
He's the son of your father's best friend.

159
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:53,990
Yes, we've known each other 
since we were kids.

160
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,580
And I liked him a lot.

161
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,030
I also hoped that one day he could like me

162
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,870
until we slept.

163
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,990
That was our first time.

164
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,350
At that time, I thought

165
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,920
he must have fallen in love with me.

166
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,470
But in the end,

167
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,910
his feelings for me didn't change.

168
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,240
That's why I became like this.

169
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,280
In order to forget him,

170
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,540
I kept having one-night stands with others

171
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,030
until I met you.

172
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,920
You made me forget him as much as possible.

173
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,660
But he came back to me.

174
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,630
He said he wanted to date me again.

175
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,040
He also confessed to his father.

176
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,510
His father agreed,

177
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,870
and was happy that I was the one he chose.

178
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,230
So you want to get back together with him?

179
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,750
I'm sorry.

180
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,980
I see.

181
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,980
Thank you for telling me the truth.

182
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,790
When I was with him,

183
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,510
I thought I could start over with him.

184
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,030
But I missed you so much.

185
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,650
My feelings for him are gone.

186
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,390
I know you may not forgive me,

188
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,980
to be able to confess to you like this.

189
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,530
I told you before

190
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,150
if I could hold your hands,

191
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,280
I will never let you go.

192
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,750

00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,860
Hello.

196
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,110
Where are you going tomorrow?

197
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,810
I'm going to school tomorrow

198
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,150
to discuss the thesis with my friends.

199
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,320
When are you free?

200
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,560
Probably afternoon.

201
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,120
What can I do for you?

202
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,040
I have something important to show you.

203
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,080
OK. Where should we meet?

204
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,220
OK.

205
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,770
OK.

206
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,090
What important thing?

207
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,720
Hello, Title.

208
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,530
Have a seat.

209
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,470
Do you have something important to tell me?

210
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,040
I have something to show you.

211
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,000
What is it?

212
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,830

215
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,350
Someone sent it to me.

216
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,490
I'll send it to you later.

217
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,750
I don't know why Ashi wrote this

218
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,270
or when he wrote it.

219
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,500
I think he just wrote it casually.

220
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,910
Ashi likes to integrate his life experience into the performance.

221
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,050
I try not to think

222
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,990
that Ashi used your feelings for this movie.

223
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:16,310
I'm just saying this from what I know of Ashi.

224
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,609
It's OK.

225
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,369
It's like what he said.

226
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,510
He said he'd never be in a relationship.

227
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,870
I still don't know

228
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,150
if he has truly loved anyone.

229
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,760
I can't answer this for Ashi.

230
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,700
Did he ever say that he loved you?

231
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,890
I hope you are the lucky one.

238
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,250
How did it change?

239
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,210
From looking at you as a secret admirer,

240
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,690

Tell me.

250
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,030
Do you just take my love

251
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,750
as a kind of love of a meaningless character?

252
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,910
Listen to me, Pun.

253
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,350
You don't have to explain anything.

254
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,210

00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,330
It's OK.

370
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,560
Baby.

371
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,390
My baby.

372
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,670
I'll always be by your side.

373
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,720
OK? It's OK.

374
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,100
Let's go downstairs and find Dad.

375
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,600
Let's eat together.

376
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,310
Dad is waiting for you.

377
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,310
Let's go, kid.

378
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,080
Look, you didn't even take a shower.

379
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,830
Get up.

380
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,090
One, two, three.

381
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,090
Go, kid.

382
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,500
It's OK.

383
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,150
Let's go.

384
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:59,010
♫I want you to know the words in my heart♫

385
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:24,890
I've known

386
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,580
it was impossible between us.

387
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,670
But I've been working hard.

388
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,680
Sit down first.

389
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,760
Sit down to talk.

390
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,390
It's OK.

391
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,950
It's OK.

392
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,970
I believe you're a strong person.

393
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,410
But if you can't stand it,

394
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,950
just cry, kid.

395
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,270
Don't worry about anything.

396
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,250
We'll always be by your side.

397
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,060
Yes.

398
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,740
I'll be strong as soon as possible.

399
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,590
Good.

400
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,520
Good.

401
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,460
I believe you can do it.

402
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,590
But if you want me to beat him up,

403
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,840
I'll go.

404
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,520
Paii, don't use violence.

405
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,240
Paii, don't do that.

406
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,910
I believe

407
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,110
there's a reason for every behavior.

408
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,290
I don't care.

409
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,020
I'm going to tell Grandma

410
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,760
to stop being Ashi's fan.

411
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,240
Forget it.

412
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,530
I don't want to upset Grandma.

413
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,070
That's how you are.

414
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,160
Listen to me.

415
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,400
If you want to love,

416
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,720
forget the so-called sadness.

417
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:31,620
I believe

418
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,060
this experience

419
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,140
will help you grow up 
and understand love better.

420
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,950
You'll get better soon.

421
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,420
How about this?

422
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:42,380
Honey,

423
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,720
let's shut the store for a couple of days

424
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,570
and go to the beach, OK?

425
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,630
OK, kids?

426
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,140
Let's go together.

427
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,180
Let's go.

428
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:54,600
Why would a heartbroken person 
go to the beach?

429
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,190
We don't welcome

430
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,620
a golden award star like you.

431
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,690
Paii, don't be like that.

432
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,390
Hello, Uncle.

433
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:22,510
Hello.

434
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,500
Hello, Aunt.

435
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,030
Can I talk to Pun?

436
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,370
Let's leave first.

437
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,630
Let the kids talk.

438
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,330
-Yes. -Let's go.

439
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,210
Let's go, kid.

440
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:36,440
Let's go, Paii.

441
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,100
Have a good chat.

442
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,810
Paii, Paii.

443
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,450
Dad said "let the kids talk."

444
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,790
I'm a kid too, Mom.

445
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,380
Look at him.

446
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,740
Paii, don't try to be smart.

447
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,630
Get out!

448
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:49,780
Get out, you little rascal!

449
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,110
It's none of your business.

450
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,070
That's right. Come here.

451
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:52,450
Hurry up.

452
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,470
Your brother has something to talk.

453
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,910
-What are you meddling here?
-You can't learn a lesson.

454
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,040
Come on.

455
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:10,830
Pun.

456
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,680
Please go back.

457
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,150
Can you give me a chance to prove myself?

458
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:36,310
Why would a star like you

459
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,790
want to prove yourself for me?

460
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:42,510
I'm not that important.

461
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,650
I love you.

462
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,100
You don't have to act here.

463
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,760
I'm not a director either.

464
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:09,590
I won't say "cut" or "action"

465
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,440
to make you act.

466
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,250
Go back, Ashi.

467
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,770
I don't want to get hurt anymore.

468
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,670
Please.

469
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,310
