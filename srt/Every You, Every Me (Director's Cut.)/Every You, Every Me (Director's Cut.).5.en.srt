James!

4
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,980
James, where are you going?

5
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,300
James!

6
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,057
James, where are you going?

7
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,684
James!

8
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,400
Who's knocking on the door so early in the morning?

9
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,071
Er... are you a guitar teacher?

10
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,764
No. His house is over there.

11
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,102
Who's knocking on the door again?

12
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,786
It's you again!

13
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,380
I think I've come to the right place.

14
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,620
The map shows that it’s here.

15
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,980
No!

16
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,020
You’ve come to the wrong place.

17
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,380
Many people have gotten it wrong.

18
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,740
I'll tell you the way.

19
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,780
Go out of my house, turn left, then take two right turns.

20
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,500
When you reach the intersection, go straight and turn left.

21
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,900
You’ll see the red house.

22
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,580
Who on earth is that?

23
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,460
I followed your directions, but I still couldn’t find a red house.

24
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,660
There's only a spirit house.

25
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,300
Why did you tell me to go that way?

26
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,180
I asked everyone around, and they said you’re the guitar teacher.

27
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,540
Just admit it that you’re a guitar teacher!

28
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:50,620
Nope.

29
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,620
- You're not? Just let me go inside first?
- Nope!

30
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,020
Hey!

31
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,460
Wait!

32
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,060
Come outside and talk to me first!

33
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,860
Urgh!

34
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,780
Hey! You!

35
00:06:32,471 --> 00:06:32,986
You!

36
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,160
How could you just barge into someone else's house?

37
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,540
This is you, right?

38
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,820
At this moment...

39
00:07:44,053 --> 00:07:44,711
There's no way...

40
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,500
From now on...

41
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,820
That you've never encountered...

42
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,020
What are you doing all by yourself in secret?

43
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,340
You're doing it again!

44
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,380
You always film me when I'm writing a song.

45
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,660
- Why? I can't do that?
- Damn it.

46
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,980
Fine, it's just that I can't come up with anything yet.

47
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,180
I thought you were going to charge me a copyright fee or something like that.

48
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:27,780
Woo!

49
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,900
You are... my encouragement.

50
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,620
Er... you...

51
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,780
You...

52
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,660
You...

53
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,220
Damn it! What the heck?

54
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,140
Hello, Sian!

55
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,500
My name is Green.

56
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,420
If you come across my message,

57
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,540
please take me as your student and teach me how to play guitar.

58
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,740
I've sent you so many messages.

59
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,060
Please don't be annoyed with me. You're my idol!

60
00:10:18,737 --> 00:10:19,288
Alright!

61
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,580
If you dare to come,

62
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,860
then I'm willing to teach you.

63
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,300
I can't teach your brother how to play guitar.

64
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,620
Tell him I'm sorry.

65
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,540
Why are you telling me to tell him?

66
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,831
You should send him a message yourself.

67
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,380
But I think it’s fine.

68
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,820
Looking at you now,

69
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:49,520
I can tell you’re not ready to teach.

70
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,900
Are you criticizing me?

71
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,620
I just say it as I see it.

72
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,020
You were just a famous guitarist in decline.

73
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,540
I quit the band a long time ago.

74
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,020
But...

75
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,660
you seem to know me so well.

76
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:17,980
Do you like me?

77
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,020
My brother does,

78
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,940
not me.

79
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,820
Anyway, tell your brother that I say thank you

80
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,780
for following my work.

81
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,340
You’re telling me to tell him again.

82
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,820
If you want to thank him, just tell him yourself.

83
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,980
Or...

84
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,460
are you afraid of confrontation?

85
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,860
Music is the medicine of the broken heart.

86
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,510
I like this sentence.

87
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,830
But I don't think it suits you.

88
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,310
Mr. Former Musician.

89
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,235
Sorry for wasting your time.

90
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,510
It suits you well.

91
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,490
Music is the medicine of the broken heart.

92
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:39,102
Wait!

93
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,860
Come here if he wants to learn.

94
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,900
I'll teach him myself.

95
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,540
I'm so excited, Blue!

96
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,980
How should I greet him?

97
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:23,902
Just say hello?

98
00:13:24,906 --> 00:13:25,964
Or just wave at him?

99
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,620
Should I bow to him instead?

100
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,660
I know.

101
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,500
I'll do something big

102
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,540
so he will be impressed.

103
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,100
What do you think?

104
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,460
Green.

105
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,580
Just wait.

106
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:00,791
Hello.

107
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:01,573
Come in.

108
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:08,835
Wow.

109
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,940
Who would have thought I would be standing here inside my idol's house?

110
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,320
Woo!

111
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,190
J only.

112
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,350
What is this room?

113
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,070
Green! Green, don't!

114
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:47,710
Green!

115
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,990
Green, don't!

116
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,350
What?

117
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,390
Why did you open his room?

118
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,350
I taught you about proper manners.

119
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,590
There's a sign here.

120
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,950
Maybe there's something good inside.

121
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,070
Green!

122
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,910
Go get ready for your lesson.

123
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,350
Alright, Mom.

124
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,070
The door is locked, so I can't go inside anyway.

125
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,190
There's a sign on the door. I just want to know what's inside.

126
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,510
- Come here.
- Yes, Mom.

127
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,684
Look at that.

128
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,390
Help me tidy things up.

129
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,030
You can't learn like this.

130
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:25,590
Come on.

131
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,470
Okay.

132
00:16:03,822 --> 00:16:04,826
Is it nice now?

133
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,390
Get your guitar out.

134
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,790
- Pay attention to the lesson.
- I will.

135
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,510
I want to know where you found this teacher from.

136
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,430
What? You don't know him at all?

137
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,350
Green.

138
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,070
Look at him.

139
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,750
He came out without a shirt, just like that.

140
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,310
If you don't pay attention, I won't let you continue with this class.

141
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,990
I know, I’ll definitely focus.

142
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:40,110
He’s a guitar legend. Everyone wants to learn from him.

143
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,150
Fine.

144
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,150
Get ready.

145
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,430
I'm sorry.

146
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,950
I just can't accept all the mess.

147
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,950
Just think of it as me helping you with your chores.

148
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,590
We just want to help, Teacher.

149
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,550
I guess you like to meddle in other people's business.

150
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,470
Please.

151
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:18,750
So...

152
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,066
Do I have to introduce myself?

153
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,070
No, sir.

154
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,390
I know you very well.

155
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,453
I've been following you for a long time.

156
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,511
My name is Green.

157
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,955
And this is my mom--

158
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,350
I mean, this is my brother.

159
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,110
His name is Blue.

160
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,350
And you bring your mom here to keep an eye on you.

161
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,608
You don't have to call me Teacher.

162
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,710
Or do you want me to call you sensei?

163
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,990
What the heck?

164
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,950
No!

165
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,150
You can relax here.

166
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,470
We can talk casually.

167
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,150
Okay.

168
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,630
Your guitar is good.

169
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,030
How much do you know about guitar?

170
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,030
Er...

171
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,710
Completely clueless.

172
00:18:03,173 --> 00:18:04,480
I'm here to learn everything from you.

173
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:07,750
Alright.

174
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,350
Let's start with the basics.

175
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,030
E minor.

176
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,830
E minor...

177
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,230
5th string.

178
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,270
2nd fret.

179
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,270
Use your index finger.

180
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,790
- This string, right?
- Yeah.

181
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,150
Use your middle finger.

182
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,430
Middle finger...

183
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,830
4th string.

184
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,830
4th string...

185
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,870
That's right.

186
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,630
Press it hard.

187
00:18:28,177 --> 00:18:28,720
Does it hurt?

188
00:18:29,111 --> 00:18:29,724
A little.

189
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,830
Make sure it hurts.

190
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,310
- It hurts already!
- Okay, now start strumming.

191
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,390
One more time.

192
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,350
Do it again.

193
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,590
Press it harder!

194
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,190
Green.

195
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,070
Yes?

196
00:18:55,493 --> 00:18:57,230
Is your mom going to sit here and watch you all day?

197
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,790
He's not here to keep an eye on me.

198
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,150
He's watching you.

199
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,670
It's my house!

200
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,190
Why would he do that?

201
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,870
He's afraid that your teaching won't be worth the fee.

202
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,950
But don’t mind him. Just think of him as a house spirit.

203
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:16,830
Green.

204
00:19:18,017 --> 00:19:18,337
Um.

205
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:19,910
A house spirit.

206
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,990
Just keep strumming the guitar.

207
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,470
Er... like this? Right?

208
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,710
Yes. Continue.

209
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,564
Alright.

210
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,510
Are you going to teach me another chord?

211
00:20:01,395 --> 00:20:01,973
Cool.

212
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,350
Put it here.

213
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,830
The pork.

214
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,030
Green!

215
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,350
Wait for the owner of the house first.

216
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,710
He didn't eat anything yesterday because he was busy teaching you.

217
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,910
Go prepare the dishes.

218
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,750
Did you even notice that?

219
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,030
Teacher! Let's eat.

220
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,990
This is for you, Teacher.

221
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,030
This is for you, Blue.

222
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,750
Thank you.

223
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,430
Here you go.

224
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,350
You have to eat a lot.

225
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,430
The food by Blue is very delicious.

226
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,110
If you eat it, you'll definitely like it.

227
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,950
You're exaggerating.

228
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,630
I'm not!

229
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,670
Eat a lot, Teacher.

230
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,070
Do you want a lot of rice?

231
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,550
- Just a bit.
- Okay.

232
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,430
I'm going to dig in now.

233
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,190
Hm!

234
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:30,750
It's delicious.

235
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:35,310
I told you. The food cooked by Blue is the best.

236
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,270
You should cook tomorrow too.

237
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,070
Huh?

238
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,670
I don't use the kitchen that often,

239
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,590
and your brother is learning guitar with me,

240
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,790
so you’d better be the one to cook.

241
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,310
Why do I have to cook for you?

242
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,870
I'm not a butler.

243
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,550
Come on.

244
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,790
I'll give you a discount.

245
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,030
Huh?

246
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,110
I'll give you a discount on the lesson.

247
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,470
10%

248
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:01,910
No.

249
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,750
20%

250
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,550
No.

251
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,990
30%

252
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,070
50% That's my final offer!

253
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,790
Blue!

254
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,590
Just do it.

255
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,510
It will help you save money.

256
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,590
It's 50% discount!

257
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:21,990
Come on.

258
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,310
Fine, I'll do it.

259
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,350
I do it because I feel sorry for those who have nothing to eat.

260
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,350
I'll consider it a merit.

261
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:35,910
Alright.

262
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,150
Mommy.

263
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:41,750
Making merit, huh?

264
00:22:47,697 --> 00:22:48,728
Thank you.

265
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,670
Oh.

266
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,030
Is there water?

267
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,510
You deserve to be my butler.

268
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,750
How did you manage to survive this long?

269
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,190
Why?

270
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,626
Pour it in a glass.

271
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,990
Let me do it for you.

272
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,190
No need. I'll just drink from the bottle.

273
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,030
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

274
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,870
Just chill. We're close now.

275
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:33,790
Should we get a new bottle?

276
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,230
Let's just eat.

277
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,070
Whoa! He's so cool today.

278
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,950
It looks like his concert outfit.

279
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,550
Bro, this is your concert outfit, right?

280
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:11,950
So cool!

281
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,350
Strum it properly. It sounds off.

282
00:24:33,235 --> 00:24:35,350
My fingers hurt, Teacher!

283
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,270
Come on. Just keep doing it.

284
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,640
Can't I take a break?

285
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:40,830
Okay.

286
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,333
What are you playing?

287
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,142
Do it again. Strum with a pattern.

288
00:25:00,613 --> 00:25:02,435
Strum downwards 4 times. Count it in your head.

289
00:25:02,693 --> 00:25:03,208
Do it.

290
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,270
It hurts like this at first.

291
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,142
You mean playing guitar?

292
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,950
Your fingers.

293
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,790
It really hurts.

294
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,910
Let's take a break.

295
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:23,670
- Keep playing.
- Gee, you're not easily swayed.

296
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,710
One, two, three, four.

297
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,070
One, two, three, four...

298
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,990
Do you want to see my play? Give me the guitar.

299
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,590
That'd be great!

300
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,190
Oh! This steamed egg is delicious.

301
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,630
Where did you buy it?

302
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,070
Don't speak with your mouth full.

303
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:19,946
Mommy is so serious.

304
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,110
Teacher!

305
00:26:22,453 --> 00:26:24,080
He's always like this at home.

306
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:27,137
I'm just kidding.

307
00:26:27,182 --> 00:26:29,750
Are you an artist? I see you like to draw.

308
00:26:31,768 --> 00:26:32,631
Not exactly.

309
00:26:35,128 --> 00:26:35,831
What about you?

310
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:38,168
Don’t you want to play music again?

311
00:26:39,857 --> 00:26:41,395
I used to listen to your songs.

312
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:42,986
They are good.

313
00:26:44,373 --> 00:26:46,097
I'm not surprised that Green wants to learn from you.

314
00:26:56,728 --> 00:26:57,191
Oh!

315
00:26:57,377 --> 00:26:58,293
I'm just asking.

316
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,910
You don't have to answer.

317
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,430
Teacher, this pork is very delicious.

318
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,190
You have to try it.

319
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,070
- It's really delicious.
- I can get it myself.

320
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,480
You really should eat a lot. It's so yummy!

321
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,270
Up, down, up, down! Now do it!

322
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,670
Green.

323
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,630
Yes, Teacher.

324
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,190
I want to ask you.

325
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,430
Doesn't your brother have a girlfriend?

326
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,150
I don't think so.

327
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,310
Why do you ask?

328
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,110
Hm.

329
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,470
Judging from what I see, I bet he doesn't have one.

330
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,310
Hey, don't understimate my brother.

331
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,630
Many people have hit on him.

332
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,430
Really?

333
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:13,310
My brother is extremely reticent.

334
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:17,310
When he likes someone, he doesn't let that person know his feelings.

335
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,550
Until now, he still doesn't have a girlfriend.

336
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,510
I'm not surprised.

337
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,510
Do you want to eat?

338
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,990
What do you want to eat? I'll cook for you.

339
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,870
I want to eat eggs.

340
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,950
Are you having perverted thoughts?

341
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,510
I'm talking about steamed eggs.

342
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,950
Well, I like to eat eggs.

343
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,190
Go away.

344
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:07,137
Get back to teaching.

345
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,670
I know!

346
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,750
So, are you bored with the guitar yet?

347
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,590
Do you want to try the dumbbell instead?

348
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,630
Whoa.

349
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:22,110
Will I be able to build muscles like yours?

350
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,070
You gotta try.

351
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,390
How many kilograms? Oh my!

352
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:27,950
Come on.

353
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,510
Woo!

354
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,230
Come on.

355
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,310
Okay.

356
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,070
When...

357
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,110
When are you going to teach me new chords?

358
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,230
I'm waiting to learn something new.

359
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:42,670
Here you go.

360
00:29:43,155 --> 00:29:43,662
Let's eat.

361
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,048
Why are there only egg dishes these days?

362
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:54,568
Look at that.

363
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:55,750
Braised eggs.

364
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,110
Egg drop soup, omelette.

365
00:30:04,675 --> 00:30:05,555
Umm...

366
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,910
Teacher, give me your plate. I'll get the rice for you.

367
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,350
Nah.

368
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,670
You have to eat a lot too.

369
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,830
You like to eat eggs, don't you?

370
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,590
I can't eat that much.

371
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,430
My heart is already full.

372
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:55,857
Hey, you!

373
00:30:56,844 --> 00:30:57,822
The water isn't running.

374
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,351
Alright! I'll check on it.

375
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,350
Is it broken again?

376
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,600
I just fixed it.

377
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,186
Damn it! It's always broken.

378
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,417
When will it be fixed?

379
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,670
Almost done.

380
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,750
Shit!

381
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,950
Gosh!

382
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,640
The water is running now.

383
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,150
Oh.

384
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,430
Can you stop licking your popsicle that way?

385
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:11,075
Pretty.

386
00:35:14,168 --> 00:35:14,835
Your painting.

387
00:35:19,608 --> 00:35:20,370
What do you call it?

388
00:35:24,382 --> 00:35:25,813
Hmm, I haven't come up with the name yet.

389
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,870
But I think...

390
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,070
It will be called "Every Tear."

391
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,390
Umm.

392
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,808
It sounds great. I like the name.

393
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,213
Can I take a closer look?

394
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,346
Oh!

395
00:35:49,822 --> 00:35:50,631
I got paint on my finger.

396
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,293
Do you have a tissue?

397
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,910
Don't think that it's dirty.

398
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,630
Look at it as art.

399
00:36:10,657 --> 00:36:11,350
Can you paint another finger too?

400
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,306
Beautiful.

401
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,377
You're right.

402
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,150
Beautiful.

403
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,110
This is your masterpiece.

404
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:34,870
Um.

405
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,430
Thank you.

406
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,470
Since you painted it,

407
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,270
don’t you want to display your ownership?

408
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,310
Phukan.

409
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,550
Why didn’t you answer the call?

410
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,070
Oh.

411
00:38:30,613 --> 00:38:31,390
I didn't recognize this number.

412
00:38:32,684 --> 00:38:33,270
Just forget about it.

413
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:39,751
Let's go.

414
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,350
Let's get dressed.

415
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,413
Green will arrive soon.

416
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:45,226
Why bother?

417
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,750
I can teach him like this.

418
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:55,750
Can we do it one more time?

419
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:57,910
Hm?

420
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,110
- Can we do it one more time?
- Teacher!

421
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,990
Teacher!

422
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,230
Clothes!

423
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,230
I'm here!

424
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,310
Where are you?

425
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,790
Oh, where are my clothes?

426
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,030
I'm in the toilet! I'll be down in a moment.

427
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,190
Just find something else to do first!

428
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,750
Do some exercises with dumbbells or just strum your guitar!

429
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:19,470
Okay!

430
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,670
Alright!

431
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,710
Blue.

432
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,150
Here.

433
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,670
Try to play the chords I taught you.

434
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,150
Okay, sir.

435
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,030
Try to do it smoothly.

436
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,150
Keep practicing it so you will get used to it.

437
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:46,870
Blue.

438
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,550
Are you okay?

439
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,733
Oh, I'm having cramps.

440
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,150
I'll be fine.

441
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,302
What?

442
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,230
You're cute.

443
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,670
Gosh, what is it again?

444
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,550
Stop it.

445
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,550
Do you want to switch positions next time?

446
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,750
Are you talking to me?

447
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:15,390
Oh! I want you to switch to this page and try playing this one instead.

448
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,630
Try it again.

449
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,310
But I still can't play the chords on the other page yet.

450
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:20,230
Oh!

451
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,670
But I listened to it, and it wasn’t so bad. Why don’t you try playing it again?

452
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,670
Okay.

453
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,070
Oh.

454
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,070
You're right. My hearing seems a bit off.

455
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,710
What is this chord?

456
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,870
Mi, Fa, Sol...

457
00:40:46,142 --> 00:40:46,613
Blue!

458
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,710
Green.

459
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:52,630
Yes?

460
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:53,870
I think...

461
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,510
you forgot something outside.

462
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,630
- I forgot something outside?
- Yeah, I saw it.

463
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:19,670
Hey!

464
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,470
You're teasing me again!

465
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:24,950
Do you want to eat the bread or not?

466
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,590
Do you want to paint in my room today?

467
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:35,377
Hey! You! You're being so cheeky again!

468
00:43:14,817 --> 00:43:15,893
What do you want?

469
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,110
What are you doing?

470
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:18,870
I'm cooking.

471
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,150
Go away!

472
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:35,573
Are you tired?

473
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:37,830
No.

474
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:39,128
Do you want me to give you a massage?

475
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:46,110
Hm?

476
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:07,470
Can we do it again?

477
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:09,830
What's wrong with you?

478
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:12,350
I’m really tired from earlier.

479
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:13,870
And you!

480
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,350
Why are you so strong?

481
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:19,350
I'm still having fun. Please, let's do it one more time.

482
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,270
Hey! No!

483
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:24,510
I have to cook after this,

484
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:25,750
clean dishes,

485
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:27,590
and wash your blanket too.

486
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:30,995
All you do is teach my brother guitar.

487
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:33,390
It's not that tiring for you.

488
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,590
I'm exhausted.

489
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:39,870
You're not me, you don't understand.

490
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:53,910
I'm sorry.

491
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:59,350
You can tell me what you like and dislike.

492
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:05,030
If it’s just me enjoying it

493
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,070
while you feel bad,

494
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:08,910
that’s not right.

495
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:10,110
Hm?

496
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:15,350
When it comes to our activities in bed,

497
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:16,737
you can talk to me openly.

498
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:23,630
I want you to feel comfortable

499
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:25,630
when you're with me.

500
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:34,870
Alright.

501
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:41,617
Do you want to switch position next time?

502
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:43,110
Huh?

503
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:52,702
But this time,

504
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:54,630
let me in charge.

505
00:45:58,910 --> 00:45:59,830
You agreed!

506
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,430
Teacher!

507
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:06,270
Green!

508
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:35,270
Blue!

509
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:39,150
Wear this tonight.

510
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:42,830
Hey!

511
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:46,230
Where did you get it from?

512
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,030
Keep it away!

513
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:50,270
Green won't come today.

514
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:53,070
You can wear this outfit and stay over tonight.

515
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:54,590
Please.

516
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:57,350
Please.

517
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,280
Does this mean you’re staying?

518
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:24,270
Phukan.

519
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:01,270
What are you doing all by yourself in secret?

520
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:03,590
You're doing it again!

521
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:05,550
You always film me when I'm writing a song.

522
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,070
Why?

523
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:08,750
I can't do that?

524
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:12,230
Fine, it's just that I can't come up with anything yet.

525
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:15,310
I thought you were going to charge me a copyright fee or something like that.

526
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:16,110
Woo!

527
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,270
If my song becomes a hit,

528
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,190
you will be the first person I collect a fee from.

529
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:22,310
Let me see.

530
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,870
This is too sad! Are you heartbroken?

531
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:32,750
Aww, my baby boy.

532
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:36,070
Of course, I'm sad.

533
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:38,230
I can't come up with any lyrics right now.

534
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:42,790
Everyone, this is Sian, our eager beaver!

535
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,710
He will become a star

536
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:46,310
in 100 years.

537
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:47,030
Whoa.

538
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:50,310
100 years? Do you think I will live that long?

539
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:52,470
Give it to me.

540
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:59,030
Don't!

541
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:02,790
I don't want to be in the frame. No!

542
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:08,110
How about that?

543
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,390
Take a look. Look at you.

544
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:46,390
Hey.

545
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:49,190
Are you okay?

546
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:53,831
It's nothing.

547
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:56,017
Let's sleep.

548
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:14,590
This again, James?

549
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:01,790
Phukan!

550
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,630
Why didn’t you answer my call?

551
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:07,110
Why are you hiding from me?

552
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,190
I'm not ready to talk.

553
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:12,990
Please leave.

554
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:14,870
What the heck is wrong with you?

555
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:15,830
Huh?

556
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:19,350
I've come all the way here.

557
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:23,510
Why are you shouting?

558
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:26,510
Why are you acting like I did something wrong?

559
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:29,550
Answer me!

560
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:31,510
Why are you running away from me?

561
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:33,870
Why aren't you saying anything?

562
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:35,550
Answer me!

563
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,110
I'm telling you to answer me!

564
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,110
You can talk to each other nicely.

565
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:47,390
Why are you butting in?

566
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,630
Blue is not ready to talk to you.

567
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:52,830
Just leave.

568
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:53,670
No!

569
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,550
I will talk things out with him today.

570
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,710
Blue!

571
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:01,790
I said my person is not ready to talk to you!

572
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:04,030
Just go back now!

573
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:05,310
Do you hear me?

574
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:15,110
I will talk to him anyway.

575
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:38,284
Are you hungry?

576
00:52:39,048 --> 00:52:39,564
Shall we eat?

577
00:52:41,031 --> 00:52:41,680
Let's go.

578
00:52:44,568 --> 00:52:46,373
You told her that I'm here, right?

579
00:52:54,408 --> 00:52:54,960
Answer me.

580
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:08,160
I'm sorry.

581
00:53:20,355 --> 00:53:21,057
I'm sorry.

582
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,266
I'm really sorry.

583
00:53:25,937 --> 00:53:27,564
I didn’t expect her to come and bother you like this.

584
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:31,150
I was curious

585
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:34,230
who called and texted you.

586
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:46,310
I'm sorry for crossing the line.

587
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:54,426
It's my fault.

588
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:09,110
I'm leaving.

589
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:10,720
Blue.

590
00:54:12,702 --> 00:54:13,244
Blue!

591
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:07,368
Wait.

592
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,106
Green.

593
00:55:15,733 --> 00:55:17,528
Are you sure he's not home today?

594
00:55:17,751 --> 00:55:18,871
Yes, I'm sure.

595
00:55:19,084 --> 00:55:20,497
He told me that.

596
00:55:21,706 --> 00:55:22,755
Okay, I found it.
