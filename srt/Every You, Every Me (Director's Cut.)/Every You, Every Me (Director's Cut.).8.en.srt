All characters, behaviors, places, occupations, and events in this series are fictional and created for entertainment purposes.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:15,000
There is no intention to promote any actions depicted. Viewer discretion is advised.

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,200
Everyone on this set knows that we’ve had a fight and can no longer work together.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,640
Isn’t that embarrassing enough?

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,240
How much more shame do you want me to feel?

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,320
Do you want me to look even worse than this?

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,480
If you really want to break up with me,

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,160
you don’t have to do all this.

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,960
I’ll tell Toey

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,680
that I’m going to quit this project.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,040
Inn...

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,640
Inn!

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,800
- Inn!
- Pun.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,320
Damn it.

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,160
Straight punch.

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,040
One, two.

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,200
Jab, jab.

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,240
Hook.

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,480
One, two, punch.

20
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:17,840
Jab, jab.

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,480
Damn it.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,400
You two just left the issue unresolved like this?

23
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,320
After listening to what you said,

24
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,040
the problem between you two is communication.

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,960
Why don’t you two try lowering your egos and talking to each other properly?

26
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,520
I’m the one with an ego?

27
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,400
See?

28
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,200
What should I do then?

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,840
From what I can tell, neither of you speaks your mind.

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,320
One of you is so sarcastic,

31
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,080
and the other

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,920
is always clueless.

33
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,840
Huh?

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
What do you mean?

35
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,000
You should tell Roi-Inn

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,000
what you’ve done for him.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why do I have to tell him?

38
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,680
Actions speak louder than words, don’t they?

39
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,240
There’s no need to spell it out.

40
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,800
You said yourself that Roi-Inn only cares about himself, so how would he know?

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,520
Can you stop being so complicated?

42
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,520
You two keep breaking up and getting back together.

43
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,880
Don’t be like Au and Sun.

44
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,920
If you want to be with him, then be with him.

45
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,000
But if you want to break up, then end it for good.

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,680
It’s giving me a headache just listening to you.

47
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,280
Is it that bad?

48
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,480
No.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,040
I think both of you have your own way to express your love.

50
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,520
You both have the same life goal,

51
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,560
which means you still want to have each other in your lives.

52
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,920
But maybe you’ve been focusing too much on the goal

53
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,240
and overlooking the people who are with you along the way.

54
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,920
Damn! That's deep.

55
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,960
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

56
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,360
Also,

57
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,480
there's one more thing you need to know.

58
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,480
That day,

59
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,880
Pun...

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,200
apologized to everyone on the set for you.

61
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,920
He was so worried about you.

62
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,080
Pun really tried his best for you.

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,120
Shit!

64
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,040
What's wrong with you?

65
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,480
What's wrong?

66
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,920
I lost the ring.

67
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,120
What ring?

68
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,320
What ring?

69
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,360
My wedding ring.

70
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,320
- Huh?
- Shit!

71
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,920
That's right!

72
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,040
Where did you lose it? Go find it now!

73
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
I don't know!

74
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,640
I'm always with you guys. Gosh!

75
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,600
Hello, Pun.

76
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,280
What are you doing here?

77
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,200
That's my question for you.

78
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,800
- What is it?
- Come here.

79
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,040
Whoa.

80
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,360
You're here to see Jia?

81
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,800
No, bro!

82
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,520
I'm here to exercise.

83
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,880
Are you here for boxing?

84
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,840
Yeah.

85
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,640
I see.

86
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,760
You’re so fit.

87
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,480
Stop trying to hide it from me.

88
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,600
What? You already know?

89
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,240
Why wouldn't I know?

90
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,880
Jia is my friend.

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,240
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

92
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,760
You let me continue making up stories.

93
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,320
You should tell me sooner so I wouldn’t have to make stuff up.

94
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,160
So…

95
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,560
Right now,

96
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,200
I’m a third wheel,

97
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,520
aren’t I?

98
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,200
You’re exaggerating a bit.

99
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,880
Let’s deal with you first.

100
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
You keep teaching me,

101
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,000
so why don’t you tell me how this happened?

102
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,760
Pun, pick up the phone!

103
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,960
Pun.

104
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,800
Pick up the phone.

105
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,760
Don't forget to take the medicine after finishing your meal.

106
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,000
Could you please turn on the AC?

107
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,480
It's really hot right now.

108
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,680
Thank you.

109
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,360
You should learn to take care of your own matters,

110
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,680
so you don't become a burden to others.

111
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,800
Hello.

112
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,640
Are you free to talk?

113
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,160
Sure, the set is on a break right now.

114
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,240
How many more scenes do Pun and I have to shoot together?

115
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,880
Pun has scenes with Phukan and James,

116
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,760
and one more scene with you, scene 17, the last scene before we wrap up tomorrow.

117
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,400
I’ve made up my mind.

118
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,520
I’m going to finish this.

119
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,600
I knew it.

120
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,520
Your dream is to be an actor.

121
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,600
Also…

122
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,160
I'm sorry about that day.

123
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,120
You don’t have to apologize to me, you should apologize to Pun.

124
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,760
I’m not mad at you.

125
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,240
Really?

126
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,600
Yes.

127
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,080
I have to get back to work now. See you on set.

128
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,080
Okay.

129
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,640
See you tomorrow.

130
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:26,720
Hello, everyone. We’re finally on our last day of shooting 'You and Your Beautiful Soul.'

131
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,600
We’re about to shoot scene 17.

132
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,920
The characters are Sian and Blue.

133
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
See you all in 40 minutes!

134
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,800
How are you?

135
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,240
I’m good.

136
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,440
How about you?

137
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,800
I’m okay.

138
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,640
I’m sorry about the other day.

139
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,520
And everything that happened.

140
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,520
If I want to talk to you now, is it too late?

141
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,880
I don’t think this is the right time.

142
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,360
Let's talk later.

143
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,280
Let’s focus on our work today.

144
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,360
Let’s help each other finish this.

145
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,040
Okay.

146
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:42,880
Sure.

147
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,360
This is the last scene, the final cut.

148
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,440
Okay.

149
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,320
- Chill.
- I'll brief the actors first.

150
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,120
- Sure.
- Okay.

151
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,920
Let’s talk after wrap-up.

152
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,720
Hey, guys, it’s finally the last scene.

153
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,480
Just do your best.

154
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,440
Let's do it.

155
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,880
Take off your bathrobe.

156
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,640
Everyone, stand by. Get ready to shoot.

157
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,000
Let’s clear everything up here.

158
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,080
All done? Okay.

159
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,600
Okay, everyone, stay in your positions.

160
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,720
Okay, slate, get ready.

161
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,600
Alright.

162
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,080
Ready?

163
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,240
Camera, sound.

164
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,160
Crew, please be quiet.

165
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,320
Sound speed.

166
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,320
And action!

167
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,360
Beautiful.

168
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,760
Yes.

169
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,360
Beautiful.

170
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:44,960
Cut!

171
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,760
End slate, scene 17, cut 1, take 2.

172
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,760
Good job, guys.

173
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,760
Is it okay?

174
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,040
Okay.

175
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,480
Okay.

176
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,840
- That's a wrap!
- Yay!

177
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:05,480
Everyone, it's a wrap! Thank you so much! Thank you!
- Thank you so much.

178
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,920
- Thank you.
- Thanks, dude.

179
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,960
Good job.

180
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,200
Thanks, bro.

181
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,360
Goodbye.

182
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,080
Pun!

183
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,640
Mr. Tui is interested in your script!

184
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,680
He wants you to come in for a discussion today.

185
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,600
Are you serious?

186
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,200
I’m not dreaming, am I?

187
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,880
Give me a slap.

188
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,120
Sure! Do you want me to slap you now?

189
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,080
Let’s just go.

190
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,920
What else did they say?

191
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,760
- Pun, come back here and let me slap you first! Let me slap you!
- Hey! No!

192
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,160
Can you tell us what role you play in this movie?

193
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,200
My role is Sian.

194
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:53,920
Okay.

195
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,640
And I’m Blue.

196
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,240
Alright.

197
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,280
Will this movie have a happy ending?

198
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,360
Umm… If I tell you now, it won’t be fun.

199
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,600
I think you all should watch it to find out.

200
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,200
Alright, sure.

201
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,360
Is it true that you two had a fight on set?

202
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,760
- Oh yes, we heard about that too.
- So what really happened?

203
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,080
- Can you tell us?
- Please let us know.

204
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,040
Please tell us what actually happened.

205
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,440
- Can you confirm this rumor?
- What’s the truth behind it?

206
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,720
- Many fans have been asking about this.
- That’s right.

207
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,040
- Yes, it’s true.
- Eh?

208
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,000
It's true?

209
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,160
Well, we’re very close.

210
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,120
I think it’s normal to have fights when you’re close to someone.

211
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,520
We had a lot of conflicts, especially during script rehearsals.

212
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,360
So it was just conflicts during rehearsals?

213
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,720
That’s right, it only happened while we were practicing together.

214
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,320
- That’s understandable.
- Yes, we understand that.

215
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,880
But I heard it was a serious fight.

216
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,920
I heard that too. It was more than just a work conflict, right?

217
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,480
Is there more to it than that?

218
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,960
Do you have issues with each other?

219
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,560
Do you?

220
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,160
- All the fans want to know.
- Is it a personal problem we don’t know about?

221
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,160
- Is it more than just a work issue?
- So what is it?

222
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,240
- Can you please give us the answer?
- Please tell us.

223
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,440
I have something to tell you all.

224
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,040
Please.

225
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,880
Well...

226
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,720
This will be my last movie, as it will also be my final acting job.

227
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,720
- What do you mean?
- What happened?

228
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,440
- Can you provide more details on this?
- This is a big decision.

229
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,400
- Is there something going on?
- Did you make this decision a long time ago?

230
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,360
- You two are so famous now.
- Won’t you regret this for your career?

231
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,000
- What about all the other jobs you’ve already accepted?
- Please give us some answers.

232
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,200
The fans are waiting for your answers.

233
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,240
After this, please stay tuned for what I’ll be doing next.

234
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,440
I hope all the fans will understand.

235
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,720
And also,

236
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,880
I hope everyone will continue to support Roi-Inn.

237
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,960
I truly believe Roi-Inn will be a great actor.

238
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,520
Is there a problem beyond just work? Please tell us a bit!

239
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,000
- Or is it a personal issue?
- What about other events?

240
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,440
Please excuse us.

241
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,120
- What about the rest of your works together?
- Wait! Can you share more information on this?

242
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,720
Please wait! Manager! Can we interview you instead?

243
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,120
Can we interview you for a few minutes?

244
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,960
Otto: There's a gift I want to give you.

245
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,840
Inn, is this your ring?

246
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,800
Yes, it's my ring!

247
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,800
Where did you find it?

248
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,360
I found it in the shirt you wore on set.

249
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,440
Oh...

250
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,560
Thank you so much. You came just in time.

251
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,760
If I get the chance, I’ll treat you to a meal.

252
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,560
Sure.

253
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,520
Thank you.

254
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,880
You like it, don’t you?

255
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,920
Standing here alone like this.

256
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,480
How do you know I’m here?

257
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,040
Someone gave me a present.

258
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,320
What are you talking about?

259
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,520
Forget it.

260
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,440
I’ll get to the point.

261
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,520
Should we get back together?

262
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,560
Hey.

263
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,400
Don’t be so quiet.

264
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,120
You’re making me nervous.

265
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,600
I’m serious.

266
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,200
Do you really want to get back together?

267
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,800
I do.

268
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,200
I’ve never wanted to break up with you.

269
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,360
And now I know

270
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,480
how selfish I’ve been.

271
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,640
I won’t do it again.

272
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,480
Thank you so much

273
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,440
for everything you’ve done for me.

274
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,240
It’s okay.

275
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,200
All this time, I was willing to do it for you.

276
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,320
I still want to be in every movie with you.

277
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,240
I can’t do it with you anymore.

278
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,880
I have another dream...

279
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,560
I want to achieve.

280
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,400
But we don’t have to break up, do we?

281
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,040
Isn’t it strange?

282
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,200
Since we started dating,

283
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,600
we haven’t had time to eat together, watch movies, listen to music,

284
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,840
or even talk to each other.

285
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,520
We both have different things we want to do.

286
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,040
Besides,

287
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,080
the path you’re going to take,

288
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,920
you’ll go further

289
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,680
without me.

290
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,040
We’ve been neglecting each other’s feelings for long enough.

291
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,040
Our love isn’t just about the two of us anymore.

292
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,760
You have your own duty and responsibility.

293
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,240
You want to be an actor, don’t you?

294
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,560
- If we break up now--
- Pun.

295
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,920
Can you please not say that word?

296
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,880
I can’t bear it.

297
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,600
I think breaking up when we still love each other

298
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,520
is better than waiting until we can’t even look at each other.

299
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,120
Thank you for everything.

300
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,120
Inn.

301
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,280
Pun.

302
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,280
I'm sorry.

303
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,600
Years later.

304
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,720
Otto Inn, the hottest couple of the year.

305
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,480
Hello, everyone. Before the actors and the director come up on stage,

306
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,880
we’d like to take a moment to thank our sponsor.

307
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,480
Without them, we wouldn’t be here today.

308
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:48,680
Our main sponsor is Dr. Jak. Please give a big round of applause!

309
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,600
Can we add more light here?

310
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,280
Let me check on it.

311
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,400
Otto.

312
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,440
Please take care of this for me.

313
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
Thank you so much for today.

314
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,080
Are you going anywhere after this?

315
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,240
I have an appointment.

316
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,320
What about you?

317
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,800
Umm…

318
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
I have an appointment too.

319
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,280
Hey.

320
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,280
If you’re free, let’s grab something to eat together.

321
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,120
Okay?

322
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,240
My buddy.

323
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,480
You still won’t accept that we’re a ship now.

324
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,960
How could I? That spot belongs to Pun.

325
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,720
Whoa.

326
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,880
Let’s not bring up that name anymore.

327
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,480
If he wanted to be with me, he wouldn’t have left me like this.

328
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,480
Whatever. It’s none of my business.

329
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,600
By the way, there's the premiere of the movie Pun directed today.

330
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,040
I heard there’s a live stream,

331
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,200
in case you want to watch.

332
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,720
A live stream?

333
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,560
I have to go now.

334
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,000
See you later, bro.

335
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,040
See you.

336
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,520
Alright, everyone.

337
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,240
I want to know about the difficulties and the easy parts you experienced while making this movie.

338
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:35,000
For me, it was quite difficult. We all did a lot of homework.

339
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,080
We always brought the characters home with us.

340
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,240
Me too.

341
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,680
Until today, my family still asks me why I don't act like myself anymore.

342
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,640
It's good for acting,

343
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,080
but it's not good in real life.

344
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,240
So, don’t do it like I did.

345
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,240
Who would do it like you? Except for the actors, right?

346
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,720
You're right.

347
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,000
Now, let’s ask Pun, our director.

348
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,680
Wow, wow. Wait a minute.

349
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,560
The cheers for you are louder than for the actors.

350
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,480
I'm just kidding. Don't be shy.

351
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,040
Alright, let me ask you.

352
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:26,080
Can you tell us what your inspiration is behind this movie?

353
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,280
Umm...

354
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,320
My inspiration for this movie

355
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,840
comes from my love life.

356
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,200
What?

357
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,240
I really want to thank that person

358
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,000
for making this movie possible.

359
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
Without him,

360
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,280
there wouldn't be this movie for everyone to see.

361
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,240
This movie has a sad ending.

362
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,440
Does that mean in real life it didn’t end the way you wished?

363
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,440
It’s true that the movie doesn’t have a happy ending.

364
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,240
But in my life,

365
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,000
I hope I will have a happy ending.

366
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,640
Let's go.

367
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,480
Go sleep upstairs.

368
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,560
Why are you so drunk?

369
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,440
I miss you.

370
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,520
If this isn’t a dream,

371
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,960
it would be nice.

372
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,120
Will you marry me?

373
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,320
Huh?

374
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,840
Do you know that I’ve always wanted to say this to you?

375
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,760
But I want to wait until the day we’re ready.

376
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,800
The day when you become the director,

377
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,240
like you’ve always dreamed of.

378
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,160
And I’m the actor

379
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,080
who can proudly stand right next to you.

380
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,840
I’ve always thought

381
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,640
that if I don’t succeed,

382
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,360
I wouldn’t have the courage to ask you.

383
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,880
That’s why I work so hard.

384
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,440
I guess you already know that,

385
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,440
because we argue about it all the time.

386
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,880
It’s so embarrassing, you know?

387
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,760
I don’t want you to know this.

388
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,680
I work hard,

389
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,680
but I neglect your feelings.

390
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,720
I feel so bad

391
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,880
when I see you cry.

392
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,200
I'm sorry.

393
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,360
I never knew anything.

394
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,600
I let you feel this way alone.

395
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,040
I’m sorry.

396
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,080
Please stay with me.

397
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,480
I want you to be with me forever.

398
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,760
Is it too selfish of me?

399
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,240
Or should I let you go?

400
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,600
I’ll wait until we’re ready.

401
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,320
And I promise

402
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,480
I'll do whatever it takes to bring you back to me.

403
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,640
You promise?

404
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:22,920
Yes.

405
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:52,480
♪ I want you to know that with every breath, there’s only you ♪

406
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,120
Wow! What a big bouquet of flowers.

407
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,720
We don’t have to guess anymore whether this is a sad or happy ending.

408
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,040
Congratulations.

409
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,160
Thank you.

410
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,000
You like it, don’t you?

411
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,760
Standing here alone like this.

412
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,640
You always know that I’m here.

413
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,480
How could I not know?

414
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,160
You’ve changed a lot. Do you know that?

415
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,320
Is that good or bad?

416
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,760
I don’t know.

417
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
But you’re still the same.

418
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,760
You’re still amazing as always.

419
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,640
And now you’re the director you’ve always wanted to be.

420
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,720
You did such a great job. Do you know that?

421
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,680
I never thought I’d hear that from you.

422
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,960
This movie…

423
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,520
You got the inspiration from me?

424
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,240
I think…

425
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,800
I wasn’t that stupid.

426
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,320
It depends on who the director is.

427
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,720
I'm here to fulfill my promise.

428
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,200
That night...

429
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,680
Were you aware of what happened?

430
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,960
At first, I thought it was a dream.

431
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,920
But now I know that it’s real.

432
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,440
Thank you for coming to see me that day.

433
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,960
I’m ready now.

434
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,320
Can you please come back?

435
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,400
Let me think about it first.

436
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,000
I can start hitting on you again.

437
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,960
I did it before.

438
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,480
It’s not hard to do it again.

439
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:04,880
Right?

440
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,600
Alright, you can do that.

441
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,120
I don’t mind.

442
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,160
Why are you so mean?

443
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,240
Please be kind to me.

444
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:21,960
Okay.

445
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,640
Fine.

446
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,280
Mr. Rising Star.

447
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,840
Mr. Cool Director.

448
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,360
Are you teasing me?

449
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,120
We’re both ready, right?

450
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:39,600
Yes.

451
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,760
I don’t want to go to work.

452
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,800
Hang in there.

453
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:23,880
You can do it.

454
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,280
But I won’t send you to work today.

455
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,600
Come on, please take me.

456
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,600
No.

457
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,680
Please.

458
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,560
No.

459
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,920
Please.

460
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Come on.

461
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,320
No.

462
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,640
Come on, get up.

463
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,560
No.

464
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,440
Quick!

465
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,520
Come on.

466
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,120
Fine, fine.

467
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:55,720
Get up.

468
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,960
Just a sec.

469
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,280
- Let's go.
- I know.

470
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,880
Why don’t you eat?

471
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,960
I am.

472
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,720
I'm getting it.

473
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,040
Are you going anywhere after work?

474
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:31,960
No.

475
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,360
Why?

476
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,680
Are you asking me out on a date?

477
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,800
No.

478
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,960
I saw there’s a movie.

479
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,800
I think you’ll like it.

480
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,040
It’s the genre you said you want to direct.

481
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,360
- Really?
- Yes.

482
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,080
But you can’t trick me into watching your movie.

483
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,520
I don’t want to see you with someone else. I’ll get jealous.

484
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,920
They said it's a good movie.

485
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,400
I saw the reviews.

486
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,760
Fine, I believe you.

487
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,800
Is there something going on?

488
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,920
You seem suspicious.

489
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,680
No.

490
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,000
Let's eat.

491
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,920
You should eat a lot.

492
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,200
You must be tired from all the work.

493
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,200
I’ll be right back.

494
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:51,720
Where are you going?

495
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,480
Inn!

496
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,360
I really like my life right now.

497
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,080
I wake up and see you every morning.

498
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,600
I get to look at your face while I'm eating.

499
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,720
I want my life to be like this forever.

500
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,320

What are you doing?

517

Cutting vegetables.

518
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,960
No, I want to know what you’re cooking.

519
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,600
Umm…

520
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,200
What do you want to eat?

521
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,040
Hm?

522
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,520
I can eat anything that you cook.

523
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,680
Everything looks good on me.

524
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,640
Whoa.

525
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,680
I’m going to cut vegetables.

526
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,920
Do you want to eat or not?

527
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,240
Not yet.

528
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,840
I want to eat something else first.

529
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,440
Hey, you!

530
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,240
What?
