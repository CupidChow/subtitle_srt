Shit!

4
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,200
Next year, I might not be able to come and pay my respects to both of you.

5
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,360
I've chosen your favorite food for you today. Do you like it?

6
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,120
What?

7
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,760
You didn’t choose it alone. I chose it too.

8
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,240
Auntie, I want to tell you something.

9
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,320
I also chose these dishes.

10
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,640
Dad, Mom, Ton was just standing there. I’m the one who chose it.

11
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,920
I'm going to start the car first.

12
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,900
Goodbye, Auntie.

13
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,900
You can come later.

14
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,080
I have to go now, Dad, Mom.

15
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,620
Don't be lonely.

16
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,440
This is all I can get.

17
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,900
I don't know whether you will like it.

18
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,380
My name is X.

19
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,100
I don't know what to say.

20
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,260
I'll speak frankly.

21
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,990
I would like to ask for your son.

22
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,720
I like him so much.

23
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,600
I've liked him for a long time.

24
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,580
Auntie, please help me!

25
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,380
Bro, what size number should I use for this?

26
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,320
What number? What do you think?

27
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,480
- Nineteen.
- It's eighteen!

28
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,140
What?

29
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,820
Hey!

30
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,580
You went to see your sweetheart?

31
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,900
Jay.

32
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,420
Look at your brother.

33
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,820
He's smiling so wide, his ears might tear off.

34
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,780
It happens every year.

35
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,580
He's smiling so wide, it goes beyond his ears.

36
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,360
Jay.

37
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,140
You're really annoying me.

38
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,560
- You're too, bro!
- He's so aggressive.

39
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,060
You tease me every year. I feel shy too, you know?

40
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,660
Why? I just want to tease you a little bit.

41
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,800
It’s rare to see you act this way.

42
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,360
Just go eat. We want to work here.

43
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,140
Enjoy your meal, Mr. X.

44
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,020
Let's get back to work, bro.

45
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,780
So, it's nineteen, right?

46
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,760
Eighteen!

47
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,280
Okay, X. I will transfer you the money after it's done.

48
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,560
Okay.

49
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,170
Thank you.

50
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,540
Dad, Mom, I'm going to graduate this year.

51
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,620
If I pass the pilot exam this time,

52
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,640
I'll take you both on the plane with me.

53
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,060
You two will be my first passengers.

54
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,620
Oh, Auntie,

55
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,280
before he flies an airplane, please appear in his dreams to warn him.

56
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,760
Dad, Mom, don't listen to Ton.

57
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,900
What? What did I say wrong?

58
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,900
Auntie was afraid of heights, wasn't she?

59
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,500
She would be scared if you wanted to take her up that high.

60
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,060
But I want to.

61
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,640
Take me with you.

62
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,700
Do you have a ticket?

63
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:15,880
No.

64
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,440
Oh, wait!

65
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,400
You'll be the pilot

66
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,600
and I'll be the steward.

67
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,320
Grandpa!

68
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,440
Hello!

69
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,640
How are you?

70
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,350
Okay, I’ll make sure to visit you often.

71
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,910
I forgot to bring you the offerings.

72
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,560
Please wait for next year.

73
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,900
Don't be mad, okay?

74
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:03,810
Let's go.

75
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,400
Let's go, Mr. Pilot.

76
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,400
Okay, Mr. Steward.

77
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,140
Let's go.

78
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,480
Auntie, we're leaving now.

79
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,500
We'll come back again soon.

80
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,660
Bro, do you need any help?

81
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,840
Are you free now, Mr. Lover?

82
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,420
Let me help.

83
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,040
How's your study?

84
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,880
It's good.

85
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,500
But...

86
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,360
It would be better if I worked and earned money.

87
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,120
This again?

88
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,870
Don't worry about the money.

89
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,740
Just focus on your study.

90
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,460
But it's expensive.

91
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,780
And all I get after graduation is a single piece of paper?

92
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,720
That's right!

93
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,040
I will put that single piece of paper that you get in a frame and hang it in front of our garage.

94
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,700
You're making me blush.

95
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,800
A person like you feel shy?

96
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,160
Tear it open quickly!

97
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,520
Yes, Mister.

98
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,400
Just follow the map.

99
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,070
I think it's the route to the dam.

100
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,540
What?

101
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,480
There's no mechanic available?

102
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,840
But the car is already broken.

103
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,980
Mister, hello?

104
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,520
Hello?

105
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,880
Hello? Mister!

106
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,300
There's no mechanic available.

107
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,310
I'll try to find more.

108
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,210
Are you okay?

109
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,280
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

110
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,590
Are you thirsty?

111
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,680
Er... do you need help?

112
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,900
Oh.

113
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,980
Are you a mechanic?

114
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,400
My car has a flat tire. Can you please take a look at it?

115
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,040
Of course.

116
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,540
Shit.

117
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,840
Is it because of Auntie?

118
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,060
Alright.

119
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,900
I'll change the tire for you.

120
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,260
Thank you.

121
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,460
By the way, what's your name?

122
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,140
I'm X.

123
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,260
Oh, X.

124
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,620
I'll go get the tools in my car.

125
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,940
Okay.

126
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,760
There's someone here to help us.

127
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,300
I'll get the tissues for you.

128
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,660
Are you okay?

129
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,430
- You sure?
- Yes.

130
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,140
How's the car?

131
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,160
I've changed the tire for you.

132
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,080
It can still run.

133
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,300
But to be sure, you should go to my garage.

134
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,440
I see.

135
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,080
Please lead the way, and I’ll follow your car.

136
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,620
Oh, X, can my friend go with you?

137
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,660
The air conditioning in my car isn't very good.

138
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,650
Sure.

139
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,370
Thank you.

140
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,210
Don't. I'll carry it for you.

141
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,510
- Please take care of him for me.
- Okay.

142
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,680
Please wait a minute.

143
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,600
Do you like vintage cars?

144
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,980
Can I try sitting inside?

145
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,180
Namping, we're home.

146
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,360
Namping, that's not a place for you to draw.

147
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,730
You're really naughty.

148
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,700
If I want to buy this car,

149
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,500
will you sell it?

150
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,640
Well, it belongs to the owner of this garage.

151
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,920
Not mine.

152
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,130
I can't buy it?

153
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,700
Well...

154
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,980
The car can't run anymore.

155
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,150
My boss bought it and just left it parked here.

156
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,520
Buying it will waste your money.

157
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,270
If you really want it,

158
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,980
I'll talk to my boss for you.

159
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,400
The car radio may not work, but I can get the horn to make a sound now.

160
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,700
Honk honk!

161
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,440
He's leaving.

162
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,680
He's staring without blinking.

163
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,240
Let's check on him.

164
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,100
Why?

165
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,980
Is that the owner of the white flowers that you collect from the cemetery?

166
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,080
Yeah.

167
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,200
He's pretty.

168
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,000
Bro,

169
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,080
if he's a flower,

170
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,440
then you’re just a lowly dog.

171
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,800
Hey! Jay, watch your mouth!

172
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,080
You and I, we're both lowly dogs!

173
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,720
Come on, I'm just teasing you.

174
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,580
Let's get back to work.

175
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,620
If you two are lowly dogs, then I'll be the leader.

176
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,680
Let's work!

177
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,120
I'll treat you guys to dinner today.

178
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,280
Let's go!

179
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,320
I saw you and X today.

180
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,440
What did you see?

181
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,220
What did I see?

182
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,280
Don't act like you don't know.

183
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,060
You can’t lie under my watchful eye.

184
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,940
We were just talking about the car.

185
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,240
Okay.

186
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,440
Actually,

187
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,560
if the car can be driven again,

188
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,120
that would be great.

189
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,260
It's done.

190
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,880
The car charger plug is a bit loose.

191
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,990
I've already fixed that.

192
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,460
Thank you.

193
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,300
Do you accept card?

194
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,780
Oh, no.

195
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,280
Our garage accepts cash only.

196
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,200
Uh…

197
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,780
Well... can I scan QR code?

198
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,080
I don't have any cash with me.

199
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,880
It's okay. I’ll do the repair for free.

200
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,260
No! I've wasted your time.

201
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,080
I'll go find the ATM.

202
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,140
It's okay. It's nothing much. It's just a plug.

203
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,100
- But I…
- No.

204
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,360
It's okay.

205
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,370
How about this?

206
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,270
If you feel bad, come use the services at my garage.

207
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,720
Just go straight, and you'll arrive in a few minutes.

208
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,360
I have to go.

209
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,650
Drive safely.

210
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,740
See you.

211
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,500
It still looks the same.

212
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,260
Right here.

213
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,580
Do you remember?

214
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,180
Yes.

215
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,520
Don't you miss it?

216
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,860
Look.

217
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,300
Wow.

218
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,200
You were so naughty back then.

219
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,500
I'm still naughty.

220
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,360
If your parents were here, they’d definitely be scolding you.

221
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,980
Do you need help?

222
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,920
It's okay. No problem.

223
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,620
X: My boss is willing to sell the car to you.

224
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,260
I've sent it!

225
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,760
Calm down! We know. Just calm down.

226
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,780
Calm down, bro. Calm down.

227
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,200
Take a deep breath.

228
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,300
You should thank me

229
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,840
for giving you a reason to talk to him.

230
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,620
I know. I already thanked you.

231
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,340
Hey! He’s replying!

232
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,360
Shit!

233
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,360
Jay!

234
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,240
I'm really nervous already.

235
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,380
He will reply you soon. Just calm down.

236
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,000
Shit!

237
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,760
He's calling you!

238
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:24,860
What should I do?

239
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,840
- Pick up the phone! What are you waiting for?
- Pick up the phone now!

240
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,500
Pick up the phone, quickly!

241
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,180
Really?

242
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,320
Just do it.

243
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,920
- If you’re not going to do it, I’ll just do it myself.
- Hey! Bro!

244
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,660
- Now it's up to you! Jay, let's go!
- Hey!

245
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,300
Uh.

246
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,020
Hello.

247
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,420
Hi, X.

248
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,100
Can we talk?

249
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,680
Sure.

250
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:55,000
I want to ask how long it will take to fix the car.

251
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,280
If we have all the replacement parts, it will take around 2-3 weeks.

252
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,920
I see.

253
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,160
Thank you.

254
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,040
Er...

255
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,500
How long will you stay here?

256
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,560
Umm.

257
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,100
Not that long.

258
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,560
But to be honest, I want to stay until the car is fixed.

259
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,500
Then, 3 weeks.

260
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:27,740
Huh?

261
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,460
Please stay for another 3 weeks.

262
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,580
I can't stay that long.

263
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,220
But if the car owner stays until it's repaired,

264
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,140
it will be great.

265
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,560
You're right.

266
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,800
It will be great if I stay until my dad's car is fixed.

267
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,800
Did you see the drawings on the seat?

268
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,520
I did that.

269
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,120
I learned art back then

270
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,420
and I wanted to give it a try.

Whoa.

282
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,820
About your dad's car, what a coincidence.

283
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,590
Your dad and mom must have wanted it to happen.

284
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,880
What do you mean?

285
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,420
Oh, I mean your dad and mom must be happy.

286
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,730
You're right.

287
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,920
I didn't expect to find my dad's car here.

288
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,800
Oh, Namping,

289
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,630
what do you like to eat?

290
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,880
I like strawberries.

291
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,820
I like everything that has strawberries.

292
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:40,800
What about you?

293
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,790
Other than fixing cars,

294
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,830
can you also fix electrical issues?

295
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,380
What?

296
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,800
Namping!

297
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:29,810
Namping!

298
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,220
The doorbell is broken.

299
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,910
You can call me next time. You already have my number.

300
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,500
Hey.

301
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,270
Ping.

302
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,120
Don't.

303
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,430
I'll do it for you.

304
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,280
Can you change it?

305
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,600
Yes.

306
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,030
It's the same size.

307
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:42,980
Ping!

308
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,050
Are you okay?

309
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,850
Why are you so shocked?

310
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,130
I only broke a glass.

311
00:31:58,910 --> 00:31:59,210
Well,

312
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,100
you're so clumsy!

313
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,710
You’d better clean this up yourself.

314
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,320
Okay.

315
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,350
I know. There's no need to nag.

316
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:09,910
Oh,

317
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,480
I'll buy some food for you.

318
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,460
Stir-fried crispy pork with basil and a fried egg, like usual, okay?

319
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,720
Okay.

320
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:19,840
X, do you want as well?

321
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,830
It's okay.

322
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,780
Never mind, I'll buy it for you too.

323
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,220
Don't forget to clean this.

324
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,340
Be more careful!

325
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,340
Be careful!

326
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:37,660
Thank you.

327
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,300
It's okay.

328
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,460
It would be more worse if you got cut on glass.

329
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,820
I'll clean it up for you.

330
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,440
Hey.

331
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,090
I think I will stay here longer.

332
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,840
Really?

333
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,110
Well...

334
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,700
If you're free, you can come to the garage.

335
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,420
You can check out the car you bought.

336
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,650
Ahem!

337
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,650
Is there anything you want to tell me?

338
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:18,640
No.

339
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,490
Are you sure?

340
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,540
I'm sure.

341
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,110
Let's get inside.

342
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,310
Let's go.

343
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,520
Are you sure?

344
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:33,770
Okay, fine. Let's go.

345
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,660
Let's eat.

346
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,350
- Quickly!
- I know!

347
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,310
Oh, hey!

348
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,120
We met again.

349
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,360
Is this your garage?

350
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,300
No, I work here.

351
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:15,820
What a coincidence.

352
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:17,550
Well...

353
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,370
Let's say that I've finally come to use your services here.

354
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,890
And I'll pay this time.

355
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,140
Cash only, correct?

356
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,780
Good job!

357
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,630
So what's wrong with your car?

358
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,140
I don't know too.

359
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:33,590
The car shakes while I’m driving.

360
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,190
Alright, I'll take a look at it.

361
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,280
Excuse me.

362
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,350
Whoa!

363
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,900
There's a nail in your back tire.

364
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,370
What?

365
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,840
You might accidentally run over it.

366
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,950
Whoa! People these days.

367
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,880
Why did they just throw it away carelessly?

368
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,290
Why didn't they throw it in the bin?

369
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,030
It's lucky that I didn't get into an accident.

370
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,720
It's alright. I'll repair it for you.

371
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,070
Mister!

372
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:22,860
Mister.

373
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:24,940
Mister!

374
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,410
Your car is fixed.

375
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,170
Sorry for making you wait. There are so many customers today.

376
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:39,840
Your service is good.

377
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,740
No wonder why there're so many customers.

378
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,680
Thank you.

379
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,970
I will come back to use your services again.

380
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,440
He's the problem.

381
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,270
That's my brother.

382
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,180
He's fixing a car for someone special to him.

383
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,100
That's why all the workload becomes my burden.

384
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:05,520
Hang in there!

385
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,140
Thank you.

386
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:09,950
Well then,

387
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,000
I have to go first.

388
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,880
Drive safely.

389
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,290
Jay!

390
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,010
Can you get the water for me?

391
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:51,950
Here.

392
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,080
Namping!

393
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:01,850
Does it hurt?

394
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:11,840
Thank you.

395
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:29,760
Namping,

396
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,300
what brings you here today?

397
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,150
I want to see the car.

398
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,970
I just want to know what I need to buy.

399
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:41,860
I want to help.

400
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,440
Oh.

401
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,160
I'll go take a shower first.

402
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,490
Wait.

403
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:58,920
Sit down.

404
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,730
Let’s treat your wound first.

405
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,450
There's dirt all over.

406
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:51,220
Oh.

407
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:56,880
Thank you

408
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,900
for fixing the car for me.

409
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:42,950
I'll come back again tomorrow.

410
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,020
You should take a rest.

411
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,280
Namping.

412
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:27,120
I've checked the electrical system,

413
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,240
and I’ll change the battery.

414
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:34,170
Also, I’ve checked all the systems here already.

415
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:38,870
They’re still functioning, but I think I will replace them with new ones

416
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,560
so there won’t be any problems in the future.

417
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,870
Namping, can you get me a size 18 wrench?

418
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,760
I want something like this.

419
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:19,790
Oh!

420
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:24,660
This one?

421
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:25,370
Yes.

422
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:27,870
Can you keep this for me?

423
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,330
It slipped out of my hand.

424
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:30,730
Thank you.

425
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:35,170
Are you tired?

426
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:36,790
Yes.

427
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,380
I'm tired

428
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:40,980
and hot.

429
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,660
The weather is so hot today.

430
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,240
Are you laughing at me?

431
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,660
No.

432
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:53,850
- Are you laughing at me?
- No, I'm not.

433
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,020
I'm not laughing at you.

434
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:56,200
Nope.

435
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,670
Why are you laughing?

436
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,680
Because I'm dirty, huh?

437
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:00,800
No, you're not dirty at all.

438
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:02,170
Not at all.

439
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,570
Not dirty at all.

440
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,270
Whoa!

441
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,930
Your hand is so dirty!

442
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,890
You're teasing me, right?

443
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,560
No.

444
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,430
Look at my hand.

445
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:33,510
How's it going?

446
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:36,160
Well...

447
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,840
I've changed the electrical system.

448
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,290
I'm not talking about that.

449
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:40,410
I saw you.

450
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,850
If you're looking at him like that,

451
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:46,410
just take him to the resort.

452
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:48,470
Wow.

453
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,370
- But...
- Don't say anything.

454
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:52,800
Just tell me what you need.

455
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,170
I'll get it for you.

456
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,310
Really?

457
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,190
Have I ever said anything jokingly?

458
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,210
Come on.

459
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:05,750
Alright?

460
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:07,390
Just keep fixing it.

461
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:08,670
I know you're motivated.

462
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:09,900
Keep going, X.

463
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:11,970
Thank you!

464
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:12,670
Okay!

465
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:55,390
I like to come here alone when I want to think aimlessly.

466
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:16,880
Namping!

467
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:36,690
Let's get in the water.

468
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:39,930
No.

469
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:44,560
X!

470
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,010
Since we're at the waterfall,

471
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,140
let's go play in the water.

472
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,770
You're making go crazy.

473
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,360
The sky is so beautiful today.

474
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:53,030
That's because...

475
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,640
Those who say that the sky looks beautiful are in love.

476
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:08,120
I like when I'm up there.

477
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:12,690
Sometimes I just want to jump out the window

478
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:16,890
and float among the clouds.

479
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:22,260
If you weren't here,

480
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,080
I guess I'd be looking at the sky all day.

481
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:31,930
Looking at the airplane?

482
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,420
I'm not a dog!

483
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,000
Namping.

484
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:46,950
You don't want to move back to Thailand?

485
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,050
I do.

486
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,160
So, why not just do it?

487
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,230
Is there someone waiting for you there?

488
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,170
There's no one.

489
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,440
But you have me here.

490
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:45,990
Can you please not go back?

491
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:02,900
I'll come back here again next year.

492
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:06,500
I promise.

493
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:11,900
How about...

494
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:27,180
Stop asking.

495
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:31,570
Can you do it again?

496
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,040
No.

497
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,830
Namping!

498
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:41,760
Please.

499
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,030
No.

500
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:47,150
Please.

501
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,320
Stay still.

502
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:56,150
Just a sec.

503

504
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:12,170

509
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,070
I've rescheduled the flight to Switzerland to make it faster.

510
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:39,130
So that means

511
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,480
Namping has decided not to stay here anymore, right?

512
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:42,590
Yeah.

513
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,850
I don't know what I did that made him feel sad.

514
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,640
Why did he just leave like that?

515
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:49,320
Ping.

516
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,710
I think you should reconsider.

517
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:55,210
I think X will be very happy if you change your mind.

518
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,400
I just want to see you enjoy your life with friends,

519
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,100
family,

520
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:03,400
and a good partner.
