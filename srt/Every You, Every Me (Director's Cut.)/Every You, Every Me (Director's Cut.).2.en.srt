Respected Members of the board and all employees of MAIO Corporation,

4
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,680
before we begin the annual meeting today,

5
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,700
I would like to inform you all

6
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,180
of an important announcement from Mrs. Pimpan Prasertrungruangtham.

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,160
It’s wonderful and important news that she would like to share herself.

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,120
Please welcome her on stage.

9
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,120
Hello, everyone.

10
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,260
I'll keep it brief today.

11
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,500
For the past ten years,

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,740
continuing my husband's legacy in managing this company

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,560
has been very tough for someone my age.

14
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,260
Today,

15
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,920
I’m going to pass the company down to my grandson.

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,260
And that person is...

17
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,360
Parinth Prasertrungruangtham.

18
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,800
Mr. Parinth!

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,600
Where is he?

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,440
Madam has a grandson?

21
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,220
You know nothing. Mr. Parinth is her beloved grandson.

22
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,940
He's just graduated from abroad.

23
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,480
He's handsome and rich.

24
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,540
What a perfect man!

25
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,140
Is this really the time for jokes?

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,480
You want a grand opening, don't you?

27
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,860
I am confident

28
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,600
that Parinth will take the company to new heights.

29
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,600
I hope that everyone will continue to work hard just like you always have.

30
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,100
Also,

31
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,920
there's one more thing I would like to inform you all.

32
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,940
What is it?

33
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,700
My grandson...

34
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,900
is still single and ready to mingle.

35
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,400
(1 Year Later)

36
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,520
About the interview session with your new secretary.

37
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,400
What about it?

38
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,340
Our HR will interview the candidates today,

39
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,340
and they can likely start working tomorrow.

40
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,860
What am I supposed to do if you all work so slowly?

41
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,980
I'm sorry, boss.

42
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,720
I'm so sorry, Mr. Parinth.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,600
Whatever.

44
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,960
Brace yourself.

45
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,340
Three, two, one.

46
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,480
Gosh! I was so tense!

47
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,000
You're lucky that he didn't scold you.

48
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,080
I bet he already did.

49
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,660
Handsome, rich, and perfect? I don't want any of that!

50
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,100
He can't even be friendly with his employees.

51
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,880
It's okay, sis.

52
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,520
Eat this to help calm yourself down.

53
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,940
Calm down, sis.

54
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,120
Auntie, be careful!

55
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,940
The water is spilled. Please clean it up.

56
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,420
Sis, so your feelings have changed?

57
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,580
You don't like him anymore?

58
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,300
I was just excited in the beginning.

59
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,780
How can I like my own boss? No way! That’s just crazy!

60
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,380
Does he even like girls?

61
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,740
Maybe he just doesn't like anyone.

62
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,080
You have to think about those who don't need love in life.

63
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,180
Whatever.

64
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,100
I have Gong Yoo as my husband, and that's more than enough.

65
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,000
Do you think he wants you?

66
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,860
Sis, even he knows you're being delusional.

67
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,820
How can he change his secretary every day?

68
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,580
It's been a year already, and he is still not getting along with his employees.

69
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,040
Auntie.

70
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,160
Auntie.

71
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,460
Are you okay?

72
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,500
Auntie.

73
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,520
Breathe.

74
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,680
Please help!

75
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,460
Someone is fainting. Please help!

76
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,720
Auntie, breathe.

77
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,380
Grandma!

78
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,260
Oh, you're here.

79
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,760
I thought I wouldn't wake up to see my dear grandson.

80
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,520
I admit that I'm getting old.

81
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,200
I feel like I might die just from falling.

82
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,640
Your grandpa likes to come into my dreams.

83
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,060
It’s like he wants to take me to be with him.

84
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,480
Grandma.

85
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,700
Don't think too much.

86
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,400
Get some rest.

87
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,060
Nanon.

88
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,320
Why haven't you changed my grandma's shoes yet?

89
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh.

90
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,340
I already changed to orthopedic shoes for her.

91
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,600
But she wanted to wear high heels.

92
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,400
Well, um, the shoes look pretty ugly.

93
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,200
I just want to wear something nice.

94
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,040
How can it be ugly?

95
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,240
I bought you only good things,

96
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,520
and this pair of shoes is the most popular.

97
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,980
Please be careful when you walk.

98
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,220
You're already old.

99
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,100
It's easy to fall down.

100
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,540
Gosh! You keep calling me old.

101
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,040
I'm not old. I'm just classic!

102
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,400
It still means old.

103
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,900
Parinth.

104
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,720
I'm serious this time.

105
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,440
Can you date someone for me?

106
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,420
Grandma.

107
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,740
It can be a girl or a boy.

108
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,480
I don't mind.

109
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,760
Mabel asked me to watch the BL series with her.

110
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,580
I like it!

111
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,520
It's cute.

112
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,320
That's right!

113
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,320
Whoever doesn't like it, that's up to them.

114
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,300
I can accept it.

115
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,720
If there's anything that can make you happy,

116
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,280
I can accept it all.

117
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,160
I'm happy...

118
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,900
when I work.

119
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,040
Please let me work.

120
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,780
Nanon, Mabel.

121
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,620
Yes, sir.

122
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,060
Take care of grandma for me.

123
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,240
Don't let her out of sight.

124
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,940
The older she gets, the more stubborn she becomes.

125
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,200
No! She's not stubborn at all.

126
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,720
I always keep an eye on her, and Nanon is helping me too.

127
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,080
Can I trust you guys?

128
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,340
Think you're so good, huh?

129
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,580
Hello, Mr. Parinth.

130
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,700
I'm...

131
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,740
I'm First Ekdanai.

132
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,660
I will be your secretary.

133
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,760
Um.

134
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,700
Follow me.

135
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,940
This is your tablet.

136
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,320
You can jot down my schedule here.

137
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,800
It's synced with my tablet.

138
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,300
One more thing.

139
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,360
I want you to remind me about the meeting

140
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
one day before

141
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,880
and one hour before the scheduled time.

142
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,480
Do you understand?

143
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,560
Yes.

144
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,320
But...

145
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,540
I'm more used to writing with pen.

146
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,420
Do you know what our company does?

147
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,200
Yes.

148
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,660
You know, right?

149
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,840
Yes, I do.

150
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,180
Right now, I'm in the process of rebranding the company.

151
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,140
The brand was founded in my grandpa's generation.

152
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,580
My team has finished the analysis and updated all products.

153
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,500
The next step is to find a marketing agency to advertise our company.

154
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,280
Hey!

155
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,940
Can you keep up?

156
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,820
Yes.

157
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,460
I can keep up.

158
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,720
I'm so sorry!

159
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,840
From now on, learn how to use the tablet.

160
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,640
Yes, sir.

161
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,720
How about this?

162
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,180
I’ll give you your first task.

163
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,540
Find me ten marketing agencies to choose from

164
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,840
by tomorrow.

165
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,240
How many agencies again?

166
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,220
Ten agencies.

167
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,720
Ten agencies!

168
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,940
By tomorrow?

169
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,320
You can go now.

170
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,500
I have a meeting.

171
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,500
Can he manage?

172
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,740
He's here.

173
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,720
You're not going, sis?

174
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,020
- Goodbye.
- Good luck.

175
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,060
Mr. Parinth, I have sent you the file containing information on the ten agencies

176
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,060
attending the meeting tomorrow.

177
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,900
The meeting schedule is also included in the file.

178
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,720
Thank you, First.

179
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,140
Here's the marketing plan that I came up with.

180
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,700
Mr. Parinth, I would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity.

181
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,200
My family really likes your product.

182
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,440
Hello, Mr. Parinth. I'm so glad that your company contacted me.

183
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,780
We really look up to your company.

184
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,860
I was so excited when I heard about the rebranding of your brand!

185
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,980
I also heard that you graduated with an MBA from abroad, right?

186
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,140
We can also reach other target audience groups.

187
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,960
Mr. Parinth, are you interested in having lunch with me?

188
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,520
How was it today?

189
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,500
I'm sorry that I could only make appointments with five agencies.

190
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,800
The rest would like to reschedule.

191
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,060
I'm not interested in any of them yet.

192
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,660
Make appointments with the remaining seven agencies tomorrow.

193
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,720
Okay.

194
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,080
Noted.

195
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,780
I told you to use the tablet!

196
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,120
I'm sorry.

197
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,640
Get out.

198
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,600
Will he be able to manage this?

199
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,980
Mr. Parinth, do you have a specific topic you want them to present?

200
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,380
I want to see case studies that show me a better picture.

201
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,660
Copy that.

202
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,180
Do you want the presentation in English or Thai?

203
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,320
Do you have the limit number of slides?

204
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,920
Do you want them to present the case study using graphs or infographics?

205
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,580
Do you want only the case study from Thailand?

206
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,240
Do you want them to focus on any particular product?

207
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,460
You can decide. I'll look at it tomorrow.

208
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,600
I've already made appointments with three agencies for tomorrow.

209
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,220
I'll send you the details.

210
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,640
Just three?

211
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,380
How come only three appointments?

212
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,100
That's right, sir.

213
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:46,600
I also designed a new logo that is more modern and minimal to appeal to all age groups.

214
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,860
I want you to take a look, and you can make a decision later.

215
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:56,420
I think we shouldn't overlook customer loyalty.

216
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,120
Based on my research with the focus group.

217
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,140
You can see right here.

218
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,520
The users are really satisfied with your brand

219
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,960
compared to other brands offering the same product.

220
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,480
These customers come back to buy the product again.

221
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,100
How was it today, Mr. Parinth?

222
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,760
Why did you make only three appointments?

223
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,720
Are you already burnt out?

224
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,220
No.

225
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,220
Actually, there are more.

226
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:34,080
But I saw that you were so tired after five meetings yesterday.

227
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,960
I think three agencies would be just right.

228
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,140
I printed out my notes from all the meetings today.

229
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,020
Alright.

230
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,500
You did a good job today.

231
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,440
DNA agency seems to have a good vision.

232
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,260
But their marketing plan is too unrealistic.

233
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,220
2Four Agency is average.

234
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,480
Their data seems to come from the internet.

235
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,100
They’re not experts in this.

236
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,660
CIC Agency has a good plan.

237
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,580
But the speaker couldn't stay still.

238
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,520
He was either too nervous or really needed to go to the toilet.

239
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,100
Be Trendy Agency has a really nice presentation.

240
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,220
But the speaker couldn't pronouce the words properly.

241
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,420
This will make Mr. Parinth angry if we work together.

242
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,460
First.

243
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,200
How did your Gong Yoo's series end?

244
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,460
It was so good that I even dreamt about it.

245
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,720
How good was it?

246
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,500
It was such a sweet dream!

247
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,300
Hello, boss.

248
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,340
Here it is.

249
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,340
- I bought you guys coffee.
- Oh, you're finally here.

250
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,200
Hot coffee for you.

251
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,600
There you go.

252
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,080
- This is your iced latte.
- Thank you.

253
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,340
- You're the kindest!
- You're welcome.

254
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,200
This one is yours!

255
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,940
Hello, Mr. Parinth.

256
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,120
Where's my coffee?

257
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,420
You didn't order it, did you?

258
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,480
You're my secretary, right?

259
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,800
Yes.

260
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,140
I'm your boss, right?

261
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,480
Yes.

262
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,980
But you bought coffee for everyone except me.

263
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,240
Oh, Mr. Parinth!

264
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,920
If I buy it for you and you don't like it, you’ll scold me again.

265
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,860
First!

266
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,740
Yes.

267
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,880
I'll go buy it for you now.

268
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,760
No need.

269
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,900
I'll buy it myself.

270
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,920
Oh, okay.

271
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,620
I said I'll buy it myself.

272
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,420
Oh! I'll go with you.

273
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,680
Iced Americano with no ice, please.

274
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,840
Mr. Parinth.

275
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,440
How can an iced Americano not have ice?

276
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,100
I like to drink it this way.

277
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,960
I see.

278
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,020
Okay.

279
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,500
You can order a drink.

280
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,420
It's okay.

281
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,000
One pink milk, please.

282
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,660
You drink like a kid.

283
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,800
I'm still a kid.

284
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,820
Don't you want to go inside?

285
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:45,960
No.

286
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,820
I just want to get lost in thought.

287
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,120
What are you thinking about?

288
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,760
Do you want to know?

289
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,780
Yes.

290
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,980
If it's about you,

291
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,760
I want to know everything.

292
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,520
Otherwise, you'll complain that I don't care about you again.

293
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,060
Do you also like to drink pink milk?

294
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,440
Yes.

295
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,140
Mr. Parinth.

296
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,080
I want you to look at this.

297
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:32,900
Based on what I've read, I think we can use all this information. Please take a look.

298
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm hungry.

299
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,180
Do you want me to order food for you?

300
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,780
No need.

301
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,740
I want to eat out.

302
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:50,980
Okay.

303
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,300
You haven't eaten yet, right?

304
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,340
Let's eat together.

305
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,420
Huh?

306
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,520
Pack up.

307
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,420
Oh, okay.

308
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:21,980
So slow.

309
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,260
Well, I'll wait for you outside.

310
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,400
I thought he couldn't make it.

311
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,080
Look at him now.

312
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,200
Why, sis?

313
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,260
Don't you know?

314
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:10,200
First has a connection with Madam.

315
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,340
What?

316
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,020
Really?

317
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,320
Yes.

318
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,260
You know about this too?

319
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:16,900
Of course!

320
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:19,820
Yes.

321
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,400
Alright.

322
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,180
I'll send you any updates I have.

323
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,080
To whom?

324
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,760
Thank you, Mr. Parinth.

325
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,560
I was so scared.

326
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,240
So?

327
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,640
Send updates to whom?

328
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,660
To...

329
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,720
my mom!

330
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,480
She's worried about me.

331
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,940
I'll go prepare the food for you.

332
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,880
Not from me.

333
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,660
From him.

334
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,740
Parinth: Check this for me. I want it in ten minutes.

335
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,140
It's not done yet?

336
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,820
Too much.

337
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,280
Are you saying I'm being too much?

338
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,980
No.

339
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,680
I mean it's a lot of work to do

340
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,520
Please give me some time.

341
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,200
You haven't eaten yet?

342
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,480
When can I go eat?

343
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,920
If I go, the work won't get done.

344
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,240
Order something to eat if you're hungry.

345
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,420
I'm leaving.

346
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:10,960
Okay.

347
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,500
Drive safely.

348
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,360
The door is locked.

349
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,220
Oh?

350
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,980
I don't have a key either.

351
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,700
Hmm.

352
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,880
I'll call the building staff.

353
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,080
No answer.

354
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,140
Forget it.

355
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,200
You're not going back?

356
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,080
How can I go back? The door is locked.

357
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,820
Are you hungry too?

358
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,720
I'll find something for you to eat.

359
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,140
Instant noodles for you, Mr. Parinth.

360
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,060
I don't eat instant noodles.

361
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,240
Mr. Parinth.

362
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,140
You should eat something when you're hungry.

363
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,580
There's nothing left in the carbinet.

364
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,200
The housekeeper probably got rid of everything.

365
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,720
Let's eat it before it gets cold.

366
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,940
I have 'cat tongue.'

367
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,140
What?

368
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,960
I can't eat anything that is too hot.

369
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,920
I see.

370
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,920
I'll manage that for you.

371
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,400
Here you go.

372
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,000
I can eat it myself.

373
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,940
First.

374
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,400
You're drinking beer?

375
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,120
Er...

376
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,380
It's not mine.

377
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,900
Do you have more?

378
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,220
It's okay, Mr. Parinth.

379
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,900
I can do it myself.

380
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,100
I had already been through this work before you.

381
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,220
Whoa, Mr. Parinth!

382
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
If you did it before,

383
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,660
why didn't you do it properly?

384
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,920
Do you know that it's so hard to understand?

385
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,360
Mr. Parinth.

386
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,560
You work so hard,

387
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,340
but sometimes you're too stressed.

388
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,860
You should find something else to do.

389
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,800
Like what?

390
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,940
Like...

391
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,340
find someone who understands you.

392
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,460
I'm not interested in romance.

393
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,300
Well then.

394
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,840
So what are your interests?

395
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,640
This.

396
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,580
I'm interested in work.

397
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,080
Come on.

398
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,660
This is so boring, Mr. Parinth.

399
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,100
Do you think...

400
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,400
I'm a good leader?

401
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,000
You?

402
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,480
You're fierce like a tiger.

403
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,720
You assign tons and tons of work.

404
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,900
You assign the work today and want it done by tomorrow.

405
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,060
I know that you want the work to come out perfect.

406
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,020
You want the company to thrive.

407
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,360
But...

408
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,320
you look so cool when you work.

409
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,360
I like seeing you focus on work.

410
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,000
Mr. Parinth, you're my idol.

411
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,380
What about...

412
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,220
my relationship with my employees?

413
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,260
After I finished my master's degree, I went straight to work.

414
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,800
I'm also responsible for such a high-ranking position.

415
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,000
I have to take care of everyone in the company.

416
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,800
I actually don't know where to start.

417
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,160
I don't know where to start too.

418
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,600
But...

419
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,020
I want you to try first.

420
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,440
Try?

421
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,500
Try what?

422
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,460
You can try eating out with others.

423
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,920
Try to socialize more.

424
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,660
It's not that hard.

425
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,180
But I understand that there's always a first time for everything.

426
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,440
Mr. Parinth,

427
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,760
you're my first...

428
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,140
Your first?

429
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,400
You mean...

430
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,580
You're my first boss!

431
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,420
First!

432
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,480
You're drunk.

433
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,540
I'm not.

434
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,160

Oh my God, First!

455
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,620
Why are you sleeping here?

456
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,140
Well...

457
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,440
He worked the whole night and didn’t go home.

458
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,060
Look at all the documents on the table. I bet your workload is overwhelming.

459
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,560
You're okay, right?

460
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,260
I'm okay.

461
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,840
You should quickly grab something to eat. Work is about to start.

462
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,280

469

Our boss is bullying him.

470
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,880
Yeah.

471
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,840
I don't think we can survive without sleep.

472
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,560
That's so true.

473
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:51,420
He worked so hard that he couldn't even go home.

474
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,240
But I don't think our boss is that kind of person.

475
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,420
You know nothing. I work with him all the time.

476
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,360
You know when he's angry,

477
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,260
it's really hard to please him.

478
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,380
Umm.

479
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,660
He seems arrogant.

480
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,140
You think so?

481
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,180
- But boss--
- That's not true!

482
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,940
Mr. Parinth is not like that.

483
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,620
Oh, First.

484
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,080
Well, First....

485
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,700
- We're just talking.
- Yes, just like the usual.

486
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,320
Don't mind us.

487
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,160
I think Mr. Parinth just takes his work seriously.

488
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,160
Also, he's not an arrogant person.

489
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,160
I see. He's just serious about work.

490
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,220
He only wants this company to thrive forward.

491
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,280
He doesn't have any bad intention.

492
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,120
Ah, I understand now.

493
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,600
You're right. I agree with you.

494
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,280
Thank you, Mr. Parinth,

495
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,440
for lending me your clothes.

496
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,580
I don't know where to start too.

497
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,080
But I want you to try first.

498
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,760
Try what?

499
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,520
You can try eating out with others.

500
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,240
Try to socialize more.

501
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,960
It's not that hard.

502
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,420
But I understand that there's always a first time for everything.

503
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,180
What do you think they want to eat?

504
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,560
Everyone,

505
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,760
I bought some snacks for you all.

506
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,960
Feel free to eat.

507
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,700
Wow! We're already hungry.

508
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,920
These are all my favorites! I will eat them all.

509
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,800
What, sis? You just said you're on diet.

510
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
Mr. Parinth.

511
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,740
Who is this client?

512
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,260
Why did you come to meet her personally?

513
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,400
Oh.

514
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,500
She’s my friend from when I studied abroad.

515
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,740
Por!

516
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:22,880
Lin!

517
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,300
Oh my!

518
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,980
You look dashing!

519
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,580
I miss you so much! Long time no see.

520
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,360
I miss you too.

521
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,980
Let's take a seat first.

522
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,660
I'm so happy to see you.

523
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,640
You’re always busy, so I don’t dare to reach out.

524
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,300
You're the busy one, not me.

525
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,420
And this is?

526
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,020
Oh.

527
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,080
He's my secretary. His name is First.

528
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,500
I see.

529
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,080
Hello.

530
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,280
Nice to meet you. I'm Pailin.

531
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,560
Por is always grumpy.

532
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,640
Please bear with him.

533
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,060
Hey!

534
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,780
You chew me out again.

535
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,780
You see? He's nagging again.

536
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:08,760
It's the truth. You always change your secretary.

537
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,180
That's not true.

538
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:10,920
Yes, it is!

539
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,240
You're exaggerating.

540
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,580
I'm not!

541
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,620
Fine, you win.

542
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,660
How's your company?

543
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:23,680
We're mainly exporting products and expanding our market to the Latin American region.

544
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,080
I'm quite busy these days.

545
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,160
I see.

546
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,400
You were busy back then, and you're even busier now.

547
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,700
That's not it. I'm currently learning Spanish.

548
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,900
- Really?
- Yes.

549
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,660
You're amazing.

550
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,000
I want to be as good as you.

551
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,620
I'll go order you a coffee.

552
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,040
Iced Americano with no ice, right?

553
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,260
You know me.

554
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,920
You don't have to go, First. It's embarrassing.

555
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,780
Let him go order it by himself.

556
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,020
How can it be embarrassing?

557
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,700
It is! Who in the world drinks such a thing?

558
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,920
I do!

559
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,100
That's why you're weird.

560
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,840
I'll go order it then.

561
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,960
Who drinks it without ice?

562
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,720
I like it!

563
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,160
Iced Americano...

564
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,020
with no ice, please.

565
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,160
This makes you feel fresh.

566
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,940
It keeps you awake.

567
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:26,660
I am awake.

568
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,180
Otherwise, how could I be here?

569
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,240
You know me.

570
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,060
Thank you.

571
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,260
You still like to complain.

572
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,320
How's it going, First?

573
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,760
You guys went to see the client, right?

574
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,560
Did Parinth have any reaction?

575
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,640
The client is Ms. Pailin.

576
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,440
He said she's his friend from abroad.

577
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,380
I remember Pailin.

578
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,480
Parinth told me about her. So she's back in Thailand?

579
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,120
Yes.

580
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:01,040
She's beautiful, smart, and has a good profile.

581
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,620
Their ages are similar, and her company is doing well.

582
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,080
I see.

583
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,780
It seems like they will work together.

584
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,980
Mr. Parinth seems...

585
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,300
What?

586
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,320
He seems to be impressed.

587
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,400
That's good news.

588
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,380
What do you think, First?

589
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,200
I think they are a perfect match.

590
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,200
Really?

591
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,440
Yes.

592
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,960
I think like that.

593
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:36,380
First, tomorrow you should try asking Parinth

594
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,680
about his preferences in a partner.

595
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,420
Deal?

596
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,120
Okay.

597
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,400
Alright.

598
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,460
Why?

599
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,100
What's the matter?

600
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:09,780
Umm.

601
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,320
Today is Friday.

602
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:16,560
Don't you have any plan after work?

603
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:17,960
No.

604
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,980
I usually go to the gym and then go straight home.

605
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:21,960
Is that so?

606
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:23,660
Yes.

607
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,160
I'm single.

608
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,400
I don't know where to go.

609
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,660
Well...

610
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,620
What about...

611
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,260
Are you interested in anyone?

612
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,920
Someone like...

613
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,920
Maybe someone from the agencies or one of the clients?

614
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,160
No.

615
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,180
Come on.

616
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,060
I assumed most people would have their own preferences.

617
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,520
Hey.

618
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,780
You want to know my type?

619
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,300
Oh.

620
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,080
Well...

621
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,220
I want to know but...

622
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,540
I like hardworking people.

623
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,280
They don’t have to be excellent, but they must be diligent.

624
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,780
A good heart

625
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,440
and have the ability to handle pressure.

626
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:36,080
Most importantly, they should understand what I want.

627
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,760
They don't have to be perfect.

628
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,300
They can be a bit silly.

629
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,000
When they don’t know what to do,

630
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,000
they tend to keep pressing the pen.

631
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,400
It's quite annoying.

632
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,940
But, I find it funny.

633
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,320
Is that all?

634
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,040
Yes.

635
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,760
Are these his specs?

636
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,000
Yes.

637
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,340
Are you clueless or stupid?

638
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,940
The person that Parinth likes

639
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,540
is you.

640
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,700
You're hardworking.

641
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,180
You're diligent.

642
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,740
You have a good heart.

643
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,940
You understand him.

644
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,000
You're a bit silly too.

645
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,500
And also, you like to click the pen.

646
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,740
What he said refers to you.

647
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,300
Is it not?

648
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,280
I think you're drunk.

649
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:08,800
First.

650
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,380
Yes?

651
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,200
Did you hear what I just said?

652
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,260
Oh.

653
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,400
I couldn't catch a few parts.

654
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,620
Can you please say it again?

655
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:21,880
What's wrong with you today?

656
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:23,860
You seem distracted.

657
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,240
Do you want to take a break?

658
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,900
It's okay.

659
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,440
Mr. Parinth.

660
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,540
Well...

661
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,040
I've been thinking about

662
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,720
what you said yesterday.

663
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,700
It might sound absurd,

664
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,700
but...

665
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:00,220
when you talked about your specs,

666
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,540
you didn't mean me, right?

667
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,700
First!

668
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,840
Where did you get that idea from?

669
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:33,040
I'm so sorry, Mr. Parinth. I won't talk about it again.

670
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:33,760
I was just...

671
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,900
I was just imagining things.

672
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,220
Er...

673
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,620
Hello, Pailin.

674
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,100
You may leave.

675
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,400
I have a meeting.

676
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,260
The signal is not good.

677
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,560
Pailin! Hello, Pailin.

678
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,820
Grandma, look!

679
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,000
Parinth! Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

680
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,280
How are you? Do you feel better now?

681
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,300
Hm?

682
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:32,440
Oh! Yes! I'm much better now.

683
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,900
How are the meetings with all the clients going?

684
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,040
Client.

685
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,100
Do you mean Pailin?

686
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,060
You want to know about this, right?

687
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,700
Or you want to know about First?

688
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,780
Who? Pailin? First?

689
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:56,940
You’ve never mentioned any of them, so how am I supposed to know?

690
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,100
I know everything.

691
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,900
I know you sent First to keep an eye on me.

692
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,340
What? What are you talking about?

693
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,140
What is he talking about?

694
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,940
Grandma.

695
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,660
You're not very convincing.

696
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,840
Grandma, just tell me the truth. How did you know First?

697
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,060
I met him by chance.

698
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:23,960
Where?

699
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,220
At the office.

700
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,520
Then what?

701
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,440
Well--

702
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,940
This is getting us nowhere.

703
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,920
I'll tell you everything, sir.

704
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,820
Madam is very worried about you.

705
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,420
She followed you to the office.

706
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,820
She disguised herself to keep an eye on you.

707
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:46,880
She fainted one day.

708
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:51,160
Luckily, Mr. First was there to help her.

709
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,700
She saw that Mr. First was looking for a job.

710
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:59,080
So she asked him to be your secretary.

711
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:00,900
But...

712
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,840
he must spy on you for her

713
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,640
Hey!

714
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,500
You don't have to tell him all the details,

715
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,020
especially the last part.

716
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:13,320
There's nothing left to hide, grandma.

717
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:16,200
Your plan is no longer a secret.

718
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,460
What you did was ridiculous.

719
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:24,040
You've caused trouble for everyone.

720
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,520
What trouble? First was just being my eyes and ears.

721
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,560
You've caused trouble for me and First!

722
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,160
Please stop bothering First.

723
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,860
First didn't seem to mind.

724
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,800
Also, about trying to set me up with someone and all the fuss.

725
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:44,420
Please stop.

726
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,480
There's nothing between me and First.

727
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,920
We don't like each other that way.

728
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,880
One more thing.

729
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,860
Please stop trying to dictate my life.

730
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,440
I'm leaving.

731
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,480
It's okay, grandma.

732
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,320
Madam, it's alright.

733
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,820
It's okay. Let's hug.

734
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:01,860
Yes.

735
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:03,020
What's up?

736
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,700
Mr. Parinth.

737
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,060
Your grandma is sick.

738
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:07,820
What?

739
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,100
Grandma!

740
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,980
Mr. Parinth!

741
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:22,700
How is she doing?

742
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,820
Her blood sugar level suddenly dropped.

743
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,360
Her blood pressure dropped too.

744
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:29,240
She couldn't breathe properly,

745
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,900
so we took her home.

746
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,460
The doctor already gave her an injection.

747
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,480
I think she's getting better now.

748
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,380
First,

749
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:45,560
go back to the office and cancel all the appointments for today,

750
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,020
and rearrange them for tomorrow instead.

751
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,060
Okay.

752
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,220
I...

753
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,360
I'm hungry.

754
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,760
I want to eat stir-fried rice noodles in gravy from Soi 33.

755
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,160
My favorite restaurant.

756
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:04,960
Will my beloved grandson go and buy it for me?

757
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,400
I'll go buy it for you.

758
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:15,040
You can go with Parinth.

759
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,480
Okay?

760
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,140
Alright.

761
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,240
Child, you're a good person.

762
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,240
Thank you for helping me.

763
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:46,680
It's okay, auntie. It's no big deal.

764
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,140
Do you feel better now?

765
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:50,760
Yes.

766
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,840
Madam!

767
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,600
Madam!

768
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,800
I told you not to do this.

769
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,260
Please take a lot of rest.

770
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,620
Okay.

771
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,080
Mister.

772
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,460
You forgot this.

773
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,420
Thank you.

774
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,980
But I don't think I will need it anymore.

775
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,400
It's too late for my job interview now.

776
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,700
I will hire you.

777
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,060
Er...

778
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,500
What did you say again?

779
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:43,820
I will hire you to work here.

780
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,640
And you will be a spy for me.

781
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:08,380
Why don't you try to assess yourself?

782
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,540
Do you think you've done well in your job?

783
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,180
No.

784
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,780
You can't find a perfect match for Parinth.

785
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,000
I'm going to die anytime soon.

786
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,320
I would like to resign.

787
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,740
I'm not qualified for this job.

788
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,040
Please let me resign.

789
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:52,040
Thank you for giving me the opportunity.

790
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:22,620
Are you leaving already?

791
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,480
Want some water first?

792
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:34,720
Thank you, Mr. Parinth,

793
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,180
for everything.

794
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:42,720
But...

795
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,040
Please take care of yourself.

796
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:13,680
Grandma.

797
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,000
What did you say to First?

798
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,340
Mr. Parinth, please calm down.

799
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,140
I fired him.

800
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,400
An employee who cannot perform the job according to the requirements

801
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,160
should be fired.

802
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:38,100
But First belongs to my team.

803
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:38,920
Really?

804
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,500
So how do you assess him?

805
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,360
Tell me.

806
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,740
He's good at work.

807
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:51,220
He's determined, hardworking, and doesn't give up easily. He's also generous.

808
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,280
Most importantly,

809
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,920
he truly understands me.

810
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:55,000
He is my--

811
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:59,240
If he is so important to you,

812
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,740
why are you still doing nothing.

813
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:05,140
Hm?

814
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,320
First.

815
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:26,560
Mr. Parinth.

816
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,000
Why are you waiting in front of my house?

817
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:37,260
There's something I want to talk to you.

818
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,600
Drink some water first.

819
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,960
We can talk after you're not so tired.

820
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:50,840
I'm worried.

821
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,600
Why do you always say you're worried about me?

822
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,300
Can you stop saying that?

823
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:15,640
Well...

824
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,520
I'm so sorry.

825
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,500
The reason I get to be close to you

826
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:24,000
is because it's part of my job.

827
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,360
I got the job because of your grandmother,

828
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,840
but in return, I have to take care of you.

829
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,880
And report everything to her.

830
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,760
Also, find me a partner.

831
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,200
You knew about this?

832
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:43,760
I knew a while ago.

833
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,000
I suck at this.

834
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,400
So?

835
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,480
Did you succeed?

836
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,680
That's the reason I quit my job.

837
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:11,600
You quit?

838
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:14,960
You decided to quit on your own?

839
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:17,980
Yes.

840
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:20,940
I just told your grandmother this afternoon.

841
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,560
Gosh, grandma!

842
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:33,700
Mr. Parinth.

843
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,800
From now on,

844
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,140
please don't be harsh with the new secretary.

845
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:44,260
Don't be hot-tempered

846
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,020
Everyone needs time to adjust.

847
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:53,060
Who said I was going to change my secretary?

848
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,220
But I already quit.

849
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,220
I don't approve.

850
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:04,280
What is this, Mr. Parinth?

851
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,240
I'm confused.

852
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:19,600
I want my partner to work with me.

853
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:26,080
Mr. Parinth, why are you telling me this?

854
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:32,760
You!

855
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,160
I'm going to tell you something.

856
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,340
Actually, I don’t have any specific preferences

857
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:39,700
because I've never liked anyone first.

858
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:41,780
But if I'm going to like someone,

859
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,260
we need to be close first.

860
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,600
Alright, I will tell your grandmother about this.

861
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,060
Why is it so hard for you to understand?

862
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,600
I like you!

863
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:11,380
I. Like. You.

864
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:14,480
Do you understand now?

865
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:23,440
I understand now.

866
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,940
Well...

867
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:30,620
Why didn't you just tell me straight from the beginning?

868
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:34,040
What about you?

869
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,520
How do you feel about me?

870
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:39,300
I...

871
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:43,600
I like you too, Mr. Parinth.

872
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:51,380
Well then,

873
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,140
how do you like me?

874
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,140
I have to answer that too?

875
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,840
You always say something that makes me think that you like me.

876
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:12,960
For example...

877
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,060
I'm worried about you.

878
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,240
Please take care of yourself.

879
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,320
I'm definitely interested if it's about you.

880
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:21,460
Something like that.

881
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:31,960
Well...

882
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,180
Can I like you as a boyfriend?

883
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,000
Are you sure that's your answer?

884
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:48,640
Have I ever lied to you?

885
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:58,000
So...

886
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,720
Will you be my boyfriend?

887
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:17,640
Well then,

888
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,340
I will use my rights as your boyfriend now.

889
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,280
Mr. Parinth!

890
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,000
Why?

891
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:28,920
I'm shy!

892
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:29,760
I can't do that?

893
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:31,720
Mr. Parinth!

894
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:37,860
You guys! I have the latest news!

895
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:39,060
What is it, sis?

896
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:40,060
Is it about our boss?

897
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:42,160
Nope! It's about First.

898
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:45,140
He already quit!

899
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:46,300
Really?

900
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:47,080
Yes.

901
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:48,060
Why?

902
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:50,700
I wonder too! He's really good at his work.

903
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:51,600
Exactly.

904
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,960
Where did you hear it from?

905
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,140
I heard it from your team!

906
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,500
Are you serious? He actually quit?

907
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:05,080
It's false news, sis! They come to work together!

908
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,200
What are you guys chatting about?

909
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,560
It's nothing!

910
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,100
We're just having a little chit-chat.

911
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,360
Nothing much.

912
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:17,740
If it's about First, he didn't quit his job.

913
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:22,100
I see. That's great.

914
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,720
It's more like...

915
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,260
he got promoted.

916
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,820
Oh! Okay! He got promoted.

917
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:41,360
He deserves it.

918
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:43,320
We understand now, boss.

919
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:46,520
Feel free to go ahead.

920
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:47,960
You're welcome.

921
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:53,340
Come here.

922
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:56,040
Look at that.

923
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,060
They're together!

924
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:00,100

925
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:05,740
