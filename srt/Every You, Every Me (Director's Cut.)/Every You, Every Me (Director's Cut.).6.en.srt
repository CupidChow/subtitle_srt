Phukan!

4
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,140
Why didn’t you answer my call?

5
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,730
Why are you hiding from me?

6
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,770
I'm not ready to talk.

7
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,640
Please leave.

8
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,470
What the heck is wrong with you?

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,380
Huh?

10
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,880
I've come all the way here.

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,120
Why are you shouting?

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,040
Why are you acting like I did something wrong?

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,050
Answer me!

14
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,110
Why are you running away from me?

15
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,440
Why aren't you saying anything?

16
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,120
Answer me!

17
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,950
I'm telling you to answer me!

18
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,420
You can talk to each other nicely.

19
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,810
Why are you butting in?

20
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,510
Blue is not ready to talk to you.

21
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,720
Just leave.

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,730
No!

23
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,510
I will talk things out with him today.

24
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,820
Blue!

25
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,150
I said my person is not ready to talk to you!

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,240
Just go back now!

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,640
Do you hear me?

28
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,430
I will talk to him anyway.

29
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,740
Are you hungry?

30
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:04,940
Shall we eat?

31
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,120
Let's go.

32
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,790
You told her that I'm here, right?

33
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,740
Answer me.

34
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,560
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,520
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,640
I'm really sorry.

37
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,950
I didn’t expect her to come and bother you like this.

38
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,884
I was just curious about who was calling you all the time.

39
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,350
I'm sorry for crossing the line.

40
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,930
It's my fault.

41
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,220
I'm leaving.

42
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,690
Blue.

43
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,150
Blue!

44
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,170
Is Blue here?

45
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,280
No.

46
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,440
You should go.

47
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,950
I knew it.

48
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:12,840
Wait.

49
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,590
Can I ask you about Blue?

50
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:18,920
Can I?

51
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,320
Sure.

52
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,220
Tell us.

53
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
I want to know too.

54
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,900
Well...

55
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,670
Blue and I were friends at the university.

56
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,560
But we had a fight

57
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,600
because Blue submitted the drawing I helped him create into the contest,

58
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,440
and he won first prize.

59
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,110
So?

60
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,260
Wasn't that great?

61
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,780
It was.

62
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,790
But my name was not included.

63
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,530
That's not true.

64
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,960
My brother is not that kind of person.

65
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,250
Exactly.

66
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,170
I know that he's not that kind of person.

67
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,620
That's why I want to know what happened.

68
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,400
Since then, he wouldn’t pick up my calls

69
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,100
or reply to my texts.

70
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:15,820
Green.

71
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,440
Where can I find your brother?

72
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,210
Think fast.

73
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,280
Green.

74
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,740
Are you sure he's not home today?

75
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,830
Yes, I'm sure.

76
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,530
He told me that.

77
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,230
Well...

78
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,020
Where did you put my bag?

79
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:01,740
Er...

80
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,560
Around the sofa, do you see it?

81
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,090
Oh.

82
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,750
Okay, I found it.

83
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,440
Phukan!

84
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,720
Can we talk now?

85
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,370
I don't know where to start.

86
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,130
Let's start from answering all my questions.

87
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,210
Why did you hide from me?

88
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,860
Do you realize what you did wrong now?

89
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,170
Yes.

90
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,790
I know what I did was wrong.

91
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,760
But I had no bad intentions.

92
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,800
And I didn't want to run away from you.

93
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,240
Actually, the day I won the first prize,

94
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,720
it was the best day of my life.

95
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,826
Dear Mr. Patchara Phansit. The acceptance letter for finalists in the project with MAIOSIAM Artist Management Company.

96
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,510
You know how much that day meant to me, right?

97
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,450
I wanted to tell everyone that

98
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,330
it's you I had to thank.

99
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,580
Because you were the one who started that project.

100
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,240
You were also the inspiration for me to finish it.

101
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,330
But I didn't know why.

102
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,780
That day...

103
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,360
I just wanted everyone to think I could do it

104
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,770
and that I was good at it.

105
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,640
So I didn't mention your name.

106
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,690
That day passed.

107
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,640
And then a month passed, a year passed.

108
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,444
I couldn't clear things up with you.

109
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,850
And I let it be.

110
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,100
I let you think that...

111
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,580
we don't have to be friends anymore.

112
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,320
Why did you think that way?

113
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,820
Because I'm scared.

114
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,810
I’m scared to tell you the truth, and I’m scared to face you like this.

115
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,880
So you decided to hide from me, just like that?

116
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,480
How do you think I feel?

117
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:17,860
I'm sorry.

118
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,060
I...

119
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,210
am not a fool.

120
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:28,820
Hm?

121
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,680
I was never mad at you.

122
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,930
Because I know

123
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,240
my friend had his own reasons.

124
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,550
I just want you to tell the truth.

125
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,750
You didn't mean to do it.

126
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:21,860
Actually,

127
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,820
the success of that project, just as we both imagined,

128
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,840
was because of you.

129
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,180
Really?

130
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,530
Of course.

131
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,880
You're talented.

132
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,640
You're so talented.

133
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,040
Thank you.

134
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,000
It took us ages to talk like this.

135
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,580
There's nothing much I want to say.

136
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,610
I just want to give you the invitation card.

137
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,890
Well,

138
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,440
I'm going to open a gallery in the US.

139
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,630
- You want to invite me?
- Yes.

140
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,020
The day you were successful,

141
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,640
I was standing there.

142
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,850
It's my turn now.

143
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,120
I...

144
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,200
I want you to see it too.

145
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:30,844
You...

146
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,400
Gosh, you're so...

147
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:38,030
- Thank you so much.
- What's wrong with you?

148
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,940
You're crying like a baby.

149
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,080
You're that not young anymore.

150
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,970
I'm happy.

151
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,800
Don't forget to come.

152
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,140
You know that you can talk to me about anything, right?

153
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,200
Don't cry, you silly!

154
00:13:57,457 --> 00:13:57,884
Hmm!

155
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,300
I'm sorry.

156
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,430
I know.

157
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,240
I know you didn't mean to do it.

158
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:08,900
Well then.

159
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,170
I'm leaving now.

160
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,040
I'm going with you.

161
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,060
What?

162
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,060
I'm going to celebrate your new gallery.

163
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,820
I don't think so.

164
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,760
I think there's someone is waiting to talk to you after me.

165
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,340
See you later, my friend.

166
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,200
Talk to you later.

167
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,430
Your turn.

168
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:43,980
So?

169
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,760
Your issue is solved.

170
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,680
Right now...

171
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,910
it's my turn.

172
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,770
I have something to tell you.

173
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,410
Follow me.

174
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,260
Blue.

175
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,880
This used to be my ex's room.

176
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,220
We had a good time together here.

177
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,110
This is too sad! Are you heartbroken?

178
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,280
Aww, my baby boy.

179
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,430
Of course, I'm sad.

180
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,610
I can't come up with any lyrics right now.

181
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,200
Everyone, take a look.

182
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,060
I will continue writing.

183
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,190
Sian.

184
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,020
Hm?

185
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,110
Don't push yourself too hard.

186
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,190
Things you like

187
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,560
might turn into something you hate.

188
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,860
As for me,

189
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,680
I'll be waiting to hear all the songs you write from now on.

190
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:57,720
Okay?

191
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,760
What?

192
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,800
Answer me. Why are you so quiet?

193
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,662
Do you want to get married?

194
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,290
What are you saying?

195
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,970
I can't come up with the lyrics,

196
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,010
so I want something new

197
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,995
to inspire my song.

198
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,760
Be serious.

199
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,850
You like to be half joking, half serious.

200
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,420
I'll give you one more chance to say it.

201
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,290
I just want you to always be my inspiration like this.

202
00:18:00,408 --> 00:18:00,693
Um.

203
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,980
See, it's not that hard.

204
00:18:04,755 --> 00:18:05,528
You can say it out loud.

205
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,920
So what do you say?

206
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,250
Marry me or not.

207
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,191
If you do,

208
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,050
I already have a ring.

209
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,720
Where did you get it from?

210
00:18:32,097 --> 00:18:33,200
I'm well prepared.

211
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,760
Until one day...

212
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,730
Hello, Mom.

213
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:28,933
What are you saying?

214
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:09,991
James.

215
00:21:11,048 --> 00:21:12,080
Why are you sitting over there?

216
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:13,404
Come here.

217
00:21:14,488 --> 00:21:14,995
Okay?

218
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:18,613
James.

219
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:22,960
You look so handsome! It’s been a while.

220
00:21:23,902 --> 00:21:26,168
You still like to wear this favorite shirt.

221
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:29,422
Let's go sleep, James.

222
00:21:30,328 --> 00:21:31,182
Sleep here.

223
00:21:32,177 --> 00:21:33,173
I'm sleepy now.

224
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:35,528
Let's sleep, James.

225
00:21:36,444 --> 00:21:37,066
Sleep.

226
00:21:40,435 --> 00:21:41,395
Sleep right here.

227
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:43,848
I'll sleep right next to you.

228
00:21:44,364 --> 00:21:44,764
Okay?

229
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,640
I'm sorry to hear that.

230
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,740
It's okay.

231
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,850
I kept this room locked for a really long time.

232
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,770
I thought I couldn't accept it yet.

233
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,010
But the truth is,

234
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,770
I wanted to hide my weakness.

235
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,910
I'm fine now,

236
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,710
and I can enter this room without any bad feelings.

237
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,740
James...

238
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,040
is my starting point and my inspiration

239
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,070
for playing music.

240
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,290
You don't have to try to forget him.

241
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,720
He's important to you.

242
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,180
He's worth remembering.

243
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,660
James and I said goodbye with a smile.

244
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,950
Let him be a memory.

245
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,490
And I will keep moving forward

246
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,620
with this person,

247
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,330
the one I love.

248
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,840
The person who makes me want...

249
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,410
to be with him all the time.

250
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,600
And I won't let you go again.

251
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,400
I think...

252
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,830
I can't live without you.

253
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,780
Thank you.

254
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,400
I'm sleepy now.

255
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,520
I won't send you home today.

256
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,720
You better to sleep here.

257
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,750
It's not that far.

258
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,200
But my body is aching.

259
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,890
I want you to give me a massage.

260
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,450
What are you tired of?

261
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,490
Just send me home.

262
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,410
No.

263
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,080
It's already late. I have to go home.

264
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,250
Are you sure you want to go?

265
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:18,910
Hm?

266
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,270
Well, let’s take a shower first,

267
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,280
and we can talk later.

268
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,200
I would like a deposit first.

269
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,570
Let's go!

270
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,570
Do you like me that much?

271
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,170
If you're done drawing,

272
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,920
can I have it?

273
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,500
No.

274
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,610
Why not? It's a picture of me.

275
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,253
But I'm the one who's drawing it.

276
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:39,902
I should be the one who owns it.

277
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,390
Fine, I won't have it.

278
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,620
Well,

279
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,570
I'm going to get dressed.

280
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,860
Don't change the body wash.

281
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,168
Why?

282
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:09,910
You like it?

283
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,570
I've always liked it.

284
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,680
It smells good.

285
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,910
You're working hard to make sure I don't finish drawing today.

286
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,475
There's something

287
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,982
we can finish faster if we do it together.

288
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,560
I can't help it.

289
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,897
You're making me crazy in love.

290
00:30:41,244 --> 00:30:42,293
Why are you so shocked?

291
00:30:43,137 --> 00:30:43,990
I'm not going anywhere.

292
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,970
The song I wrote for you,

293
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,320
it's done now.

294
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,390
It's called...

295
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,630
Every Tears.

296
00:30:58,810 --> 00:30:59,560
Wait a minute.

297
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,180
That's the same name...

298
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,530
It's because of your painting that I was able to finish the song.

299
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,390
You're lying.

300
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,240
And the sentence that you told me you liked it before.

301
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,380
Music is medicine of the broken heart.

302
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,130
You're right. It doesn't suit me.

303
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,420
Do you know why?

304
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:28,380
Because when I'm feeling blue, having you is the best medicine.

305
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,750
Yuck.

306
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,480
Actually, I don’t want our art to depend on each other.

307
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,710
Apart from that thing,

308
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,930
music is another one of my weapons.

309
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,590
Do you want to listen to it?

310
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:01,100

So there's one weapon left.

331
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,200
Do you know

332
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,830
that you're my favorite musical note?

333
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,960
You're also the work of art I love the most.

334
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,390
What are you guys doing?

335
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,820
Green!

350
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,770
And action!

351
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,910
Just keep practicing, and you will get used to it.

352
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,080
Okay.

353
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,920
So...

354
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,830
when are you going to teach me new chords?

355
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,140
I'm waiting to learn something new.

356
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:32,360
Here you go.

357
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,570
Let's eat.

358
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,920
Why are there only egg dishes these days?

359
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:44,330
Look at that.

360
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,730
Braised eggs.

361
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,950
Egg drop soup, omelette.

362
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,630
Umm...

363
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,300
Teacher,

364
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,360
give me your plate.

365
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,150
I'll get the rice for you.

366
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,670
Nah.

367
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,940
You have to eat a lot too.

368
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,900
You like to eat eggs, don't you?

369
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,590
I can't eat that much.

370
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,690
My heart is already full.

371
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,591
Cut! Slate.

372
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,160
Hit it.

373
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,413
I think what's between us

374
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:43,555
should stop here.

375
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,702
What do you mean?

376
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,720
I mean what I say.

377
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:06,810
Let's break up.

378
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,791
I told you I don't like it when you say that.

379
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,050
I'm serious this time.

380
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,360
I'm tired!

381
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,680
I want our relationship to continue,

382
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,528
but neither of us is trying to change.

383
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,870
I think we can only come this far.

384
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,350
I'm not trying to change?

385
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,580
No, you're not!

386
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,050
I asked you to care about my feelings.

387
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,020
Pay a little attention to me

388
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,540
But you never do!

389
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:57,970
You only care about yourself!

390
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,390
You care about everything

391
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,200
except me.

392
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,420
You don't care about me at all.

393
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:19,880
Even right now,

394
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,350
you still...

395
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,240
don't care about me.

396
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,380
Pun!

397
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,910
You're not me,

398
00:39:58,930 --> 00:39:59,795
you don't understand.

399
00:40:09,591 --> 00:40:10,542
Let's just break up, Inn.

400
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:24,900
Thank you.

401
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,760
Let's go.

402
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,760
Hello, everyone.

403
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:32,440
Welcome to the set of 'You and Your Beautiful Soul.'

404
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,870
We're going to shoot the second scene, which is the opening scene of 'Blue.'

405
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,720
The characters are Sian and Blue.

406
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,475
We'll start shooting in 20 minutes.

407
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:42,453
Okay.

408
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:45,902
Is everything ready?

409
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,020
Yes.

410
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,310
You're so handsome today.

411
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,190
I know, right? But I'm still a kid this time.

412
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,870
They are calling us now. Let's hurry.

413
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:55,530
Alright.

414
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,470
- The assistant director always rushes us.
- No need to hurry.

415
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,850
- Always in a hurry. What for?
- Exactly.

416
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,050
- We always get to eat last.
- That's right.

417
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,980
And we have to start working earlier than others.

418
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,120
By the time we get to eat, it's already late.

419
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,180
Where's the lipstick?

420
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,180
You guys are gossiping too much. He might barge in at any time.

421
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,180
You're right. He will come to rush us again.

422
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:32,630
What's up?

423
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,888
You thought no one would know because you’re wearing sunglasses?

424
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,060
That you were crying all night.

425
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,160
No one cried.

426
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,900
Hello.

427
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:14,670
Pun, Inn.

428
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,426
Do you want to practice the lines?

429
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,390
Sure, let's do it.

430
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,000
Who goes first?

431
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,370
Here we go.

432
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,840
It's too early.

433
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,400
Everyone.

434
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,130
Can I have ten minutes?

435
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:34,820
Hey.

436
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,700
Hello, Otto.

437
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,640
- Come on, bro.
- Hi.

438
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,200
I just came.

439
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,360
Come on, please help me.

440
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,660
You also act in this one?

441
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,560
How come I didn't know?

442
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,560
I'm not in this.

443
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,420
I'm here as an assistant director.

444
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:53,360
You're so cool!

445
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:58,040
Since when have you started working behind the scenes?

446
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,860
We just have to try new things, don’t we?

447
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,500
You're right, bro.

448
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,510
You're my idol!

449
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,448
Come on, Smile.

450
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,240
You say that to everyone.

451
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,550
Bro, just look at him.

452
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,560
Guys.

453
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:17,810
I'm going to change the breakdown since it's about to rain.

454
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,808
I don't want to risk it.

455
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,600
We're going to film the scene in the house first.

456
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,280
The first scene is scene 21.

457
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,804
I'm telling you guys first so that you can all get ready.

458
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,080
Bro.

459
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:36,910
Scene 21 is the sofa scene, right?

460
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:37,920
Yes.

461
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,990
Shooting the love scene first

462
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,930
is very hard.

463
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:45,370
It's not that hard. I know you guys can do it.

464
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:47,670
How about...

465
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,457
other scenes in the house?

466
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,060
Why don't we shoot that first?

467
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,080
We can't.

468
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,453
Those scenes will be filmed tomorrow,

469
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:56,053
so the art team hasn't prepared the props yet.

470
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,604
Just think of it as helping the crew so there won't be any overtime.

471
00:43:59,450 --> 00:43:59,800
Um.

472
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:00,590
Okay?

473
00:44:06,097 --> 00:44:06,977
Otto!

474
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,551
Please come see me on set right now.

475
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,430
Alright, I'll be right there.

476
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:11,890
10 more minutes, okay?

477
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:13,040
Please hurry up.

478
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,600
I'm coming.

479
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,130
Bro, am I in scene 21?

480
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,030
No.

481
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,626
But do you want to do it in my place?

482
00:44:26,808 --> 00:44:27,724
Are you being sarcastic?

483
00:44:29,608 --> 00:44:31,066
I'm just answering his question.

484
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,290
How can that be sarcastic?

485
00:44:36,835 --> 00:44:37,662
Action!

486
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:42,764
Can we do it again?

487
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,670
Come on.

488
00:44:45,546 --> 00:44:46,755
I’m really tired from earlier.

489
00:44:47,697 --> 00:44:48,293
And you!

490
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,644
Why are you so strong?

491
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:51,720
Please, let's do it one more time.

492
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,337
One more.

493
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,644
No!

494
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:56,302
I have to clean dishes after this.

495
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:57,742
I have to cook.

496
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:58,910
And clean the house.

497
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,950
And wash your blanket too.

498
00:45:04,248 --> 00:45:05,875
All you do is teach my brother guitar.

499
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,360
It's not that tiring for you.

500
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,120
I'm exhausted.

501
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,680
You're not me, you don't understand.

502
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:27,430
Cut!

503
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:33,980
Pun.

504
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,630
You took too long just now.

505
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:38,320
Make it sharper.

506
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:39,560
Okay.

507
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,570
You guys can continue where we left off.

508
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,490
Wait for Inn to say, 'You're not me, you don't understand.'

509
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:47,750
Let's start from here.

510
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:49,300
Okay.

511
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,390
Okay, everyone, let's get ready. Camera, sound!

512
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,800
Everyone gets ready.

513
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:55,630
Save speed!

514
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:56,910
Sound!

515
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:59,020
Everyone, ready.

516
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:00,600
Save speed!

517
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,290
4/21, cut 1, take 2.

518
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,620
And action!

519
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,040
You're not me,

520
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:11,900
you don't understand.

521
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:18,373
I'm...

522
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,120
I'm sorry.

523
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,010
Cut!

524
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,280
Pun, what's wrong?

525
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,230
You seem distracted.

526
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:35,850
Go outside and try to get your senses back.

527
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:38,360
Go!

528
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:39,760
Come back when you're ready.

529
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:55,130
Everyone, let’s keep the set as it is.

530
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,380
Otto, go check on him. What a waste of time!

531
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,940
There're so many scenes left.

532
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:06,590
If he's not ready, don't come back. Make sure it's sorted out.

533
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:10,670
Gosh!

534
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,750
The weather is being so unkind to me today.

535
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:30,780
It’s like it wants to tease me.

536
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:33,280
What are you complaning about?

537
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:36,800
Just look.

538
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:38,460
It didn't rain in the end.

539
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,400
We wouldn't have to shoot the sofa scene first.

540
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:45,350
You two have a problem, right?

541
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,035
Who wanted to break up first this time?

542
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,142
You're crazy.

543
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,093
You're thinking too much.

544
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,210
- I bet it was Inn.
- It was me!

545
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:56,017
I knew it.

546
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,640
I think I'm going to quit acting.

547
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,022
Wait.

548
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,088
Did you two have a big fight?

549
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:17,170
It's not about Inn.

550
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:19,777
It's because of me.

551
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,000
I saw you, and now I want to work behind the scenes too.

552
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,000
It's true that I work in production now,

553
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:27,930
but I still accept acting roles.

554
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:29,780
I know.

555
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,991
But I also have my own dream.

556
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:36,370
Also,

557
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:38,880
I didn't want to be an actor from the beginning.

558
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:43,520
You want to be a director.

559
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,600
You know that?

560
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,020
Why wouldn't I know?

561
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:50,670
You always say that whenever you give an interview.

562
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,102
Is it that obvious?

563
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:56,500
But right now, you have to focus on your work here.

564
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:11,804
Why are you here today?

565
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,302
I heard that the main actor has a problem,

566
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,204
so I intend to step in.

567
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,093
I'm just kidding! Don't think too much.

568
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:26,622
Excuse me.

569
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,040
Can I take a few behind-the-scenes photos?

570
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:29,480
Of course! I'd love to.

571
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:32,280
- Please be quick. We have to get back to shooting.
- Okay, sure.

572
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:34,020
Come inside when you're done.

573
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:36,450
- 3, 2 --
- Okay, everyone!

574
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:38,740
Can you move a bit closer?

575
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:43,580
3, 2, 1.

576
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,000
Thank you.

577
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,460
Pun!

578
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,330
Let's go.

579
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,293
The photos look nice.

580
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:59,180
- Hello, I've bought some snacks for you.
- Thank you so much, Pat. You come to the set every day.

581
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:00,702
Please take care of this.

582
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:01,840
How are you these days?

583
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:03,680
I'm always available.

584
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,880
Feel free to reach me anytime.

585
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,080
- You're free now?
- Yes.

586
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:10,560
- Okay, if I have a new project, I'll contact you.
- Great!

587
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,235
Let's talk later.

588
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:16,120
Okay, let's continue.

589
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,320
Give me back the script.

590
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:19,160
Let's do it.

591
00:50:21,395 --> 00:50:21,733
Give me.

592
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:22,910
Okay!

593
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,040
Alright.

594
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:25,900
Wait.

595
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,380
Pun, take off your shirt.

596
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:28,720
Costume team, please check.

597
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:30,570
Okay, okay. Let me.

598
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,706
Slate, don't go in yet. Slow down.

599
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:38,960
- Okay, please hurry. We're running out of time. Come on, come on.
- Alright.

600
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:41,720
- Maintain your emotions.
- Thank you so much. Sorry!

601
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,840
Okay, the actors are on standby. Everyone, get ready.

602
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,880
Slate, not yet.

603
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:48,810
Camera.

604
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,300
- Sound!
- The crew, ready.

605
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,850
Slate, come in!

606
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,500
Save speed.

607
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,760
4/21, cut 1, take 3.

608
00:51:00,684 --> 00:51:02,133
And action!

609
00:51:09,893 --> 00:51:12,053
You're not me, you don't understand.

610
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:23,795
I'm sorry.

611
00:51:26,231 --> 00:51:27,946
I don’t want to be in this movie because of Inn.

612
00:51:30,693 --> 00:51:31,191
Cut!

613
00:51:31,635 --> 00:51:32,808
This is already the eighth take!

614
00:51:34,648 --> 00:51:35,733
Don’t ruin this.

615
00:51:35,902 --> 00:51:38,586
- What the hell are you thinking?
- Just look at what you're doing now!

616
00:51:40,693 --> 00:51:43,706
I’ve decided we should put a halt to this project.

617
00:51:45,022 --> 00:51:45,848
What?
