Pun.

4
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:25,790
Do you want anything else?

5
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,290
Are you going to eat?

6
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:38,220
Huh?

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,210
You're making your life too complicated.

8
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,350
You don’t eat because you don't want to see his face,

9
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,470
and you asked me to pick you up

10
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,010
just so you wouldn’t have to be alone with him.

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,600
This is getting too much.

12
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,050
You think so?

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,180
Of course!

14
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,730
I don’t want to be in this movie because of Inn.

15
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,860
But it’s also because of Inn that I haven’t quit yet.

16
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,280
Why?

17
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,680
I saw that he was so worried today.

18
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,140
If he loses this role,

19
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,360
he will be very sad.

20
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,620
Also,

21
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,730
if we can't do the job,

22
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,590
there will be someone else ready to take our place.

23
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,880
Why do you think you can't do it?

24
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,910
Because I just broke up with him.

25
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,440
If we were still together,

26
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,560
I wouldn't be this afraid.

27
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,350
Pun.

28
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,150
Why do you have to do everything...

29
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,910
for Inn?

30
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,080
You two already broke up, didn’t you?

31
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,160
I just...

32
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:46,870
I don't want him to be disappointed.

33
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,080
I've decided.

34
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,230
- I will continue woking on this movie.
- Eat.

35
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,320
Eat.

36
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,040
No.

37
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,170
Stop be dramatic and just eat.

38
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,190
Eat now.

39
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,020
Good. You should eat a lot.

40
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,560
They have such great chemistry. I need a whole series of them!! #OttoPun #PunOtto

41
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,140
I'm really shipping them!

42
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,670
They are so cute.

43
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,090
It's time for their series!

44
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:29,980
They're so cute, I want to be close to them!

45
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,460
It looks yummy.

46
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,840
You'll get to eat it in the scene.

47
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,430
Hey, dude, practice your script first.

48
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,210
Smile.

49
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,820
I want to fix your hair. It isn't consistent.

50
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,080
- My hair?
- Yeah.

51
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,190
- Please go to the makeup room. Let's go
- Alright.

52
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,430
Excuse me.

53
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,010
Keep practicing first.

54
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,570
Pun.

55
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,100
Look at this.

56
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,330
There are so many people who have contacted me. They want to hire you and Otto together.

57
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,080
I was worried there might be negative feedback

58
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,380
because you and Inn are still a ship.

59
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,630
But it turns out great!

60
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,010
Do you want me to accept the offers?

61
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,350
Sure, you can do that.

62
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,370
I feel comfortable to work with Otto.

63
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,340
I don't think you should do that.

64
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,300
Why?

65
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,410
Because you're working with me right now.

66
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,030
Why would you want to create a buzz with someone else now?

67
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,730
What do you think will happen to this movie?

68
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,150
Are you jealous?

69
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,830
I’m putting a lot of effort into this movie.

70
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,730
Am I not putting effort into this too?

71
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,360
Don't ruin this.

72
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
I'm ruining it?

73
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,760
- What the hell are you thinking?
- Just look at what you're doing now!

74
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,320
Why?

75
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,290
- Am I really wrong just because I want to eat out with my friend?
- Oh my!

76
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,920
Er... everyone, they are just practicing their script.

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,160
Please carry on with what you're doing.

78
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,170
Everyone, don’t mind us. It’s nothing, just relax. They’re just rehearsing their lines.

79
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,320
Please carry on. Please sit.

80
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,600
That's right.

81
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,210
You two,

82
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,890
collect yourselves.

83
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,670
Stay focused on this work first.

84
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:55,920
Understand?

85
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,770
Hey, what happened?

86
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,940
Oh, it's nothing.

87
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,530
They're just rehearsing their lines.

88
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,490
It's nothing. Just chill.

89
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,220
Okay.

90
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,100
Alright, everyone, let's take our positions. We’re about to start filming.

91
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,520
Let's go. Please clear everything.

92
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,290
- Set.
- And action!

93
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,620
This steamed egg is so good!

94
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,010
Where did you buy it?

95
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,860
Don't talk while you're eating.

96
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,580
You're so serious, Mommy.

97
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,400
Teacher, I get treated like this all the time.

98
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,500
I'm always like this.

99
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,970
I'm not surprised.

100
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,920
What about you?

101
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,650
Why do you always make others uncomfortable?

102
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,400
Cut!

103
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,600
End slate. Scene 3, cut 1, take 4.

104
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,080
What's wrong between you two?

105
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,100
Huh? It's already been a couple of takes.

106
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,620
If you want to improvise,

107
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,440
make sure it ends well.

108
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,360
Don't be sarcastic like this.

109
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,380
Get a grip.

110
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,250
Tell me when you're ready.

111
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,480
Sorry.

112
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,410
Alright, everyone.

113
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,460
Staff, please reset the food.

114
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,610
- Makeup and hair stylists, touch-up please.
- Okay.

115
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,870
Let's do it again. It's okay.

116
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,030
Pun.

117
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,520
Are you okay?

118
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,820
I'm fine.

119
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,090
Here.

120
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,520
I’ve got an electrolyte drink for you.

121
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,650
Thank you.

122
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,050
I need to go to the bathroom.

123
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,790
Okay.

124
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,840
You know your stomach isn’t feeling well, yet you still don’t eat on time.

125
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,070
- See? I'm drinking this electrolyte drink.
- Fine.

126
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,100
Everyone, please hurry up and reset the scene.

127
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,520
Okay, let's continue.

128
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,910
And action!

129
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:24,880
It's beautiful.

130
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:27,910
Yes.

131
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,140
Beautiful.

132
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,160
Cut!

133
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,620
End slate. Scene 17, cut 1, take 8.

134
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,690
Why does the kiss look so forced?

135
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,840
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,220
No one's eating anymore today!

137
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,670
Otto, go talk to them.

138
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,100
This is already the eighth take!

139
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,020
Okay.

140
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,140
Yot,

141
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:11,400
Ms. Toey just called. She wants to talk to you and the actors.

142
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,770
Inn, Pun!

143
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,390
Go upstairs with me.

144
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,550
Let me get straight to the point.

145
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,570
Roi-Inn.

146
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,620
Pun.

147
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,470
What's going on between you two?

148
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,120
When an adult asks you a question,

149
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,900
you should answer it.

150
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:44,810
No need.

151
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,800
I can tell just by looking at you two.

152
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,750
I don’t know what’s going on between you two.

153
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,830
And I don't want to get involved.

154
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,530
But you do realize, right, that if it affects the work,

155
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,700
I can’t let it slide.

156
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,900
Do you understand me?

157
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,180
We’ve gone over our shooting schedule.

158
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,170
This is costing me a lot.

159
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,470
I’ve wasted a lot of money on the production and actors who still can’t act.

160
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,750
If this continues,

161
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,610
it means I'm wasting money for no reason.

162
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,050
Can I say something?

163
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,500
Please.

164
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,740
It's my fault.

165
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,290
I make mistakes.

166
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,510
Um.

167
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,400
Working in a production

168
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,160
means we work as a team.

169
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,030
It's like a group project where we all have to work together.

170
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,150
I can't blame just one person.

171
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,930
What I want is to make sure this project keeps moving forward.

172
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,250
I've decided.

173
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,290
We should put a halt to this project

174
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,080
until you two can work together again.

175
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,500
What?

176
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,490
You're going to stop this project?

177
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,980
- You can't do that!
- Inn!

178
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,200
Calm down!

179
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,540
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,030
I'd like to suggest another solution.

181
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,060
I want one more workshop session

182
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,470
so that these two can patch things up

183
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,970
and adjust their behavior again.

184
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,920
This will allow the project to continue during the break.

185
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,200
Umm...

186
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,150
Alright, I have no problem with that.

187
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,820
If it helps these two and allows the work to continue.

188
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,840
We can try.

189
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,160
Okay.

190
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,660
I think...

191
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,810
it's time to change the actors

192
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,090
because of the budget.

193
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,510
I've bought the snacks for you all!

194
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,340
- It's just these two who have issues.
- How are you going to solve it?

195
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,680
- There's a way to solve it.
- Don't you see? They can't act at all.

196
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,710
Hello, I've bought snacks for you.

197
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,660
- Hello.
- You visit us every day.

198
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,660
I just want to give my friends some encouragement.

199
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,500
Er... why are you wrapping up so early today?

200
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,640
It's not finished yet.

201
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,620
But I put a halt on this project.

202
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,030
Huh?

203
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,600
Really?

204
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,460
Why?

205
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,560
Are you smiling because you're happy?

206
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,130
No, not at all!

207
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:34,850
Er...

208
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,440
I guess the main leads are having problems.

209
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,200
Where did you hear about this?

210
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,870
I heard it from the crew.

211
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,230
Oh, right.

212
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,840
I think you should have Pat and Force join the workshop too.

213
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:52,990
I think it will good.

214
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,370
What are you saying?

215
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,010
Come on! Trust me.

216
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,330
They have good chemistry. Let's try and see.

217
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,610
Okay, sure.

218
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,050
Alright, let's do it.

219
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,910
I'll let you take care of it.

220
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,580
I have to go now.

221
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,040
Goodbye. Thank you so much.

222
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,580
- You can come with me. I can drop you off.
- Drive safely. Goodbye.

223
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,600
Inn.

224
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,440
Should I call him?

225
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,460
No.

226
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,010
That's not cool.

227
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,830
Inn.

228
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:51,620
Um.

229
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:52,950
What's up?

230
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:53,960
Can we talk?

231
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,480
I have a few moments.

232
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,690
Do you know what we have to do for the workshop tomorrow?

233
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:08,980
I have no idea.

234
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,640
Yot hasn't told me anything.

235
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,160
Um.

236
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,150
Er.

237
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,410
I'm practicing my lines.

238
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,430
Oh.

239
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,240
Well...

240
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,350
- I won't bother you then.
- Wait.

241
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:30,940
No, you're not.

242
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,720
Well...

243
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,140
I'm just wondering...

244
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,280
Why couldn’t we act out that scene?

245
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:52,740
Why are you laughing?

246
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,880
Nothing.

247
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,650
Well...

248
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,440
What are you going to do after going through the script?

249
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,500
Umm...

250
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,220
I'm not sure.

251
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:14,730
Well then,

252
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,360
that means you don't have to hurry to hang up the phone.

253
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,890
Actually, I'm a bit in a rush.

254
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,890
But...

255
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,500
I still have around 30 minutes.

256
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:39,960
Alright...

257
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,420
After finishing reading the script,

258
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,180
do you want to find something to eat?

259
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:06,010
♪ There’s no need to worry about the past ♪

260
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,490
♪ No matter how far, I will not make you sad ♪

261
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:20,180
♪ You will always see me beside you, never to leave ♪

262
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:27,870
♪ I want you to know that with every breath, there’s only you ♪

263
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,510
You two are joining us today too?

264
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,240
Toey wants us to try this in the workshop too.

265
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,870
Maybe our chemistry will work,

266
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,490
and we could be in the next project.

267
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,880
She told you that?

268
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,950
Hey, how's everyone doing?

269
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,080
Have you guys done the warm-up?

270
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,670
- Yes.
- Yes.

271
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,110
Alright, let's get started.

272
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,590
I'll let you guys pair up.

273
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,800
Pat will be with Force, and Roi-Inn will be with Pun.

274
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,730
I'll come up with a scenario...

275
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,670
What would happen if you two

276
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,610
got stranded on a deserted island,

277
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,410
and I want to add a task.

278
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,280
In this case, you two

279
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,290
don’t like each other either.

280
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:54,390
Pat and Force will the first pair to act.

281
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:56,690
Okay?

282
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,910
Let's get ready.

283
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,040
Get yourself ready.

284
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:02,410
Okay.

285
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,570
I'll start counting down.

286
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,710
5, 4, 3, 2, action.

287
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,030
It's raining so hard,

288
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,470
just come inside.

289
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,830
It's none of your business.

290
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,460
You won't listen when I'm being nice, huh?

291
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,790
Gosh!

292
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,170
What's wrong with you?

293
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,070
Just come inside?

294
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,000
- Can you stop bothering me?
- You hate me, don't you?

295
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,460
Is it enough to be this close?

296
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,080
Hey!

297
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,920
Just go away! What's wrong with you?

298
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,480
Cut!

299
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,130
That's enough for you two.

300
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,250
Take a break first.

301
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,510
Let's move on to the next pair, Roi-Inn and Pun.

302
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,630
Ready?

303
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,010
- Okay.
- Let's go.

304
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,280
Ready?

305
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,380
5, 4, 3, 2,

306
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,700
action.

307
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,100
So,

308
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,920
what should we do now?

309
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,900
We're in the middle of nowhere.

310
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,090
And we can't contact anyone.

311
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,890
Can you stop nagging?

312
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,000
Just help me find something useful on the boat.

313
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,840
Maybe there's something that can help us.

314
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,480
You want me to stop nagging?

315
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,450
Go find it yourself then.

316
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,520
You're not going to do anything, are you?

317
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,300
So selfish.

318
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:32,880
Come on.

319
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,930
Isn't it because of you that I'm stuck here?

320
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,020
-  Are you going to blame it on me again?
- Yes, it's your fault.

321
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,240
I didn't want to come here in the first place.

322
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,670
I came because of you.

323
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,500
Look around you!

324
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,190
The weather! The boat!

325
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,110
You and I both don’t really know how to drive a boat.

326
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,890
So stop blaming others and take a look at yourself.

327
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,560
Look at you now.

328
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,380
You only care about yourself.

329
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,530
Do you really think I'm that kind of person?

330
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,080
You think I'm selfish?

331
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,170
Everything I do, I do for you.

332
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,170
How? Tell me!

333
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,010
I work so hard and try to do everything to make sure our relationship lasts.

334
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,070
How does that have anything to do with the deserted island?

335
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,750
Freeze!

336
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,240
Maintain your emotions.

337
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,870
I want to add a 'give and take' challenge.

338
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,450
Roi-Inn, you need to say 'sorry,' and Pun needs to say 'it's okay'

339
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,400
until you both actually feel what you're saying.

340
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:17,870
Sorry.

341
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:19,910
It's okay.

342
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,580
Sorry.

343
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,610
It's okay.

344
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,390
Sorry.

345
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,820
It's okay.

346
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,720
Sorry.

347
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,910
It's okay.

348
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:08,670
Sorry.

349
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,230
It's okay.

350
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,350
Cut.

351
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,200
Come back. Take deep a deep breath.

352
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,250
Um!

353
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,440
Are you feeling okay?

354
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,660
Alright.

355
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,850
Everyone, that’s it for today.

356
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,560
Thank you so much.

357
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,860
Don't forget to do your homework.

358
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,790
Alright.

359
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,570
I have homework for Inn and Pun to do it together.

360
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,550
What?

361
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,500
Inn and Pun, you two have to watch all the work you've done together.

362
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,190
You must watch it all together.

363
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,350
And record your reactions.

364
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:53,140
Tell us the feelings and emotions you both experienced in each movie.

365
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,940
Record video clips and send them to me and Teacher Bow to review.

366
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,710
Excuse me.

367
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:01,860
Do we really have to watch it together?

368
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,910
Otherwise, it wouldn't count as partner homework.

369
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,170
You two have to watch it together.

370
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,690
What about the homework for Force and me?

371
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,750
I think...

372
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,560
you two should really reconsider

373
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,930
whether you actually want to be actors or not.

374
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:45,880
Pat.

375
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,160
Pat, calm down.

376
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,600
How can I be calm about this?

377
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,120
Yot just humiliated me.

378
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,360
Listen carefully.

379
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,860
He just wanted to give you advice.

380
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,390
To be honest,

381
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,970
I'm not okay with what we did in the workshop today either.

382
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,730
Behave yourself and go back inside.

383
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,330
I know!

384
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,640
But I'm not in the mood right now.

385
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,370
How should we do it tomorrow?

386
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,160
Where should we watch it?

387
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:43,540
Umm...

388
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,340
Should we go to the cafe?

389
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:49,610
Umm...

390
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,930
I don't want to.

391
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,510
Too many people. We won't be able to concentrate.

392
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:55,730
What about...

393
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,290
temple?

394
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,760
Pun!

395
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,420
Are you messing with me?

396
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,360
Where do you want to go? You don't want this and you don't want that.

397
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,830
Do you want to come to my house?

398
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,720
Why...

399
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,380
Why do I have to go to your house?

400
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,320
Well... the stuff you left at my house...

401
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,530
If you don't take it, I'll use it.

402
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,430
Inn!

403
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,840
Stop right there.

404
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,160
Fine! I'll go to your house.

405
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,340
Okay.

406
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,900
See you tomorrow then.

407
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:52,840
Um.

408
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,280
Bye-bye.

409
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,290
These are all my favorites.

410
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,320
Did you buy all these to please me?

411
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,550
I bought them for myself,

412
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,320
not to please anyone.

413
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,550
Is this the snack from the entrance of the alley?

414
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,910
Yes. There're so many people today.

415
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,150
What about the orange juice?

416
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,260
Did you tell them no syrup?

417
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,310
Of course, I did.

418
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,840
I saw it with my own eyes.

419
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,500
Are you sure

420
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,760
that you bought these for yourself?

421
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:06,730
Do you want to eat it or not?

422
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,110
Yes, sir.

423
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,340
This is so good.

424
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,350
I get to see what I used to see.

425
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,110
You're delusional.

426
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,410
Don't try to flirt with me.

427
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,180
I'm not flirting with you.

428
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,480
I just want to make up with you.

429
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,170
Go away. Turn on the video and wait for me.

430
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,650
If you're here, you're in my way.

431
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,200
Just sit down.

432
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,570
Whoa.

433
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:55,770
You're so fierce.

434
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,830
Shall we start?

435
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,260
- Okay.
- 3, 2, 1.

436
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,670
Well...

437
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,340
We're here to record a clip for the homework you assign us.

438
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,550
The first one we watched,

439
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,670
it was...

440
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:27,050
the first project where Phi Pun and I got to know each other.

441
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,390
You don’t have to call me 'Phi' so formally. I’m not used to it.

442
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,910
We're recording this, so we should speak properly.

443
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,620
That's right. This is the first movie that we got to know each other.

444
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,260
The first time I met Phi Pun,

445
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:47,830
I was tense on the set because

446
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,140
he looked fierce and unfriendly.

447
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,360
So I didn't really want to talk to him.

448
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,430
He was completely from his character, Sun.

449
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,500
Sun is...

450
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,020
smiley, lively, and cheerful.

451
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,570
Also...

452
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,710
We were pretty distant until the first time we kissed

453
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:16,310
I mean, it was the love scene at the end of the movie.

454
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:21,900
I think we broke the ice after that and got to know each other more.

455
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:26,390
That's right. Actually, I'm an introvert.

456
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,970
I don't like to make conversation, especially with strangers.

457
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,610
We have to get to know each other first before I start talking.

458
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,140
After that project, we began to talk more.

459
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,280
Actually, I really liked it when he played Sun.

460
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,320
I think he was very lively.

461
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:42,660
Really?

462
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,420
- But I didn't it when you were Dol.
- Eh?

463
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:46,610
Why?

464
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,510
He's so much like you.

465
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,820
He's reserved and seems to have an attitude.

466
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,220
- He's exactly like you.
- Pun, come on. Be serious.

467
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,830
Let's go to the next one.

468
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:56,420
Alright.

469
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,330
As for the second movie,

470
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,010
it was when...

471
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,930
I started to hit on Phi Pun.

472
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,590
You don’t need to go into that much detail.

473
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,290
Everyone on that set knew it anyway.

474
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,870
Yes, that's right.

475
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,610
We got to know each other more

476
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,670
through our characters,

477
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,450
First and Parinth.

478
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,980
Parinth's character was quite new to me.

479
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:34,490
Also, I had to wear a suit and tie all the time. It was difficult to dress up like that.

480
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,650
But luckily, we shot most of the scenes in an air-conditioned room.

481
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:46,140
As for First's character, he's a freshly graduated boy with enthusiasm for his first job.

482
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,460
It was pretty fun.

483
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:49,950
That movie...

484
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,430
we got to spend a lot of time together,

485
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,790
which made me

486
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,860
really want to hit on him.

487
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:06,900
I started by asking him to dinner after finishing shooting,

488
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,100
and we went to have some desserts together.

489
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,770
- After that, I started to--
- Enough, enough.

490
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,860
Let's move on to the next movie.

491
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,290
In the next project, I really X.

492
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,070
I think the way he dressed was so cool. I want to dress like him.

493
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:27,750
X has a very manly character, and I really like him too.

494
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:31,050
He's trying to get someone who's out of his league.

495
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,730
He's one of my favorite characters.

496
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,170
What about

497
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:35,610
Namping?

498
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,850
Namping...

499
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,370
He's a beautiful person.

500
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,040
I mean, in the movie, he's beautiful.

501
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,370
Everyone on set called him 'Beautiful Namping.'

502
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,690
Namping isn't just a character, it's an attitude.

503
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,750
Stop it.

504
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,110
How did you come up with all those words?

505
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:10,010
Why? You're really beautiful.

506
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:12,950
If you're not, I wouldn't ask you to be my boyfriend.

507
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,590
I like you.

508
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:20,780
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

509
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,100
What?

510
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,680
I already said alright.

511
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:25,930
Once we’re together, it’s forever.

512
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:29,790
Inn!

513
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,320
That day...

514
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,290
I was so happy

515
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:44,880
that you accepted it.

516
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,000
I didn't expect you to say yes.

517
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,210
I didn't expect that you would be my boyfriend.

518
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,130
I'm hungry now. I'll find something to eat.

519
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,220
- Do you want to stay?
- I should go.

520
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,490
I think I'd better go now.

521
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:11,960
See you tomorrow.

522
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:36,870
Are you sure you've made the right decision?

523
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,410
Yes.

524
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:41,200
Alright.

525
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,930
If you're sure, then focus on doing your best with this.

526
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,370
I'll deal with the rest.

527
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,290
Thank you.

528
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,860
- Oh.
- Hello.

529
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,100
Do you want to eat together?

530
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,480
Your fans are so nice. They came so early.

531
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,040
These are not from the fans.

532
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,390
These are from your boyfriend.

533
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,230
Look.

534
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:13,720
Let's go.

535
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,640
Hello.

536
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,590
Hello.

537
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,080
Here's the water.

538
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,300
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

539
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,240
Pun.

540
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,270
You're eating breakfast today?

541
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:49,130
I’ve never usually seen you eat anything in the morning.

542
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,670
I'm trying to train him to eat on time.

543
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:53,950
so he won’t have a stomach ache.

544
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:00,350
That's good. You should eat a lot so you'll have the energy to work.

545
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,090
Thank you.

546
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,800
I'm not a dog.

547
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,900
Anyway, thank you.

548
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,330
Thanks for eating breakfast with me.

549
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,220
Even though it's been many days since we started shooting this movie.

550
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:22,450
I finally get to eat breakfast like everyone else.

551
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:27,020
We will start with scene 20 first.

552
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:30,290
You two will be cooking and fooling around.

553
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,930
Then Sian hugs Blue from behind, takes a tomato to eat,

554
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,990
and they look at each other.

555
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,470
Take your time in this moment.

556
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,370
You can hear each other's breath,

557
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,870
and Sian gives a mischievous grin,

558
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,150
asking Blue to go upstairs, giving him a hint.

559
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,950
Make sure you give him a longing look.

560
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,490
And then Blue just head straight upstairs.

561
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,180
Okay?

562
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,880
Can we rehearse it first?

563
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,070
Sure.

564
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,240
Like this?

565
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,140
Yeah.

566
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,910
Grab the tomato...

567
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,150
Excuse me.

568
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,990
Could you please turn on the AC?

569
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,230
The sound will pick up on the mic.

570
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,420
Please, just a few minutes. It's really hot right now.

571
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,750
Okay, okay. Please turn on the AC for the actors.

572
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,120
Sound team, we'll turn on the AC for just a few minutes.

573
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,460
Thank you.

574
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:01,590
Alright, everyone, please clear the set.

575
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:04,680
Those who are in the frame right now, please step out. We're about to start shooting.

576
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,240
Stay in your positions.

577
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:12,680
Let's do this. Let's go. I want to go home now. Hang in there, guys!

578
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,640
Bew, what time did you schedule the extras?"

579
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,740
- 12 p.m.
- Okay.

580
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,170
Pun.

581
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,370
Wait for me.

582
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:26,850
You bought a lot.

583
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:27,530
Yeah.

584
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,170
Otto!

585
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,700
Hello.

586
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:32,840
Hello.

587
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,190
Do you want some snacks?

588
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:37,900
Please share this with everyone.

589
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,420
All this?

590
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:38,900
Sure.

591
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:44,890
You want some?

592
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:55,720
Otto.

593
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:56,440
Yes?

594
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,450
What scene are we shooting next?

595
00:40:58,770 --> 00:40:59,260
Er...

596
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:06,700
We'll shoot this scene first. It's the one where Sian and Blue are hanging the clothes.

597
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,050
Sian then brings the maid outfit to tease Blue, and Blue gets really shy about it.

598
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:10,680
Er...

599
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,700
Excuse me.

600
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,040
Did you lose Blue's anklet?

601
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:17,990
Oh.

602
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,860
Costume!

603
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,180
Costume!

604
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:21,990
Yes?

605
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,120
Where did his anklet go?

606
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,930
I already put it on him.

607
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,920
You lost it again? This is the second one already.

608
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:29,290
Gosh.

609
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,490
Everyone, please help us to find it.

610
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,760
Everyone! Please help us find Blue's anklet.

611
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,300
It's okay. We'll help you find it.

612
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:36,680
Okay.

613
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,660
There's no spare one left?

614
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:40,910
I don't think so.

615
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,510
Did you go to the bathroom?

616
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,480
You usually wash your feet after going to the bathroom.

617
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,400
Maybe you took it off then.

618
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,130
You're right.

619
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:01,940
Oh.

620
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,240
Mister.

621
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:04,490
I've found it.

622
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,650
I'm sorry.

623
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,270
I'm so sorry.

624
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:11,660
I'm sorry.

625
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,740
No one can beat you when it comes to being forgetful.

626
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,880
You should learn to take care of your own matters,

627
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,130
so you don't become a burden to others.

628
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:37,550
What are you laughing at?

629
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:39,490
Nothing.

630
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,760
Okay, you've found it, right?

631
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,500
Let's get back to work.

632
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,030
Okay.

633
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,230
Please be on standby.

634
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:58,920
Everyone, please be on standby. We'll continue to shoot.

635
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,130
Thank you, my friend.

636
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,130
So,

637
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,070
Inn still not dressed?

638
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,050
Not yet.

639
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,540
Otto, please rehearse the lines with Pun for me.

640
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:50,040
Okay, sure.

641
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:55,030
Er... let's do the blocking for this scene first.

642
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,460
How about when Blue smells you?

643
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,030
Okay, sure.

644
00:43:59,050 --> 00:43:59,360
Okay.

645
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,210
Alright.

646
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,350
I'm ready.

647
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:08,760
Um.

648
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,700
Well,

649
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,260
I'll go get dressed.

650
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,970
Please don't change your body wash.

651
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,050
Why?

652
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:29,980
You like it?

653
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,030
I've always liked it.

654
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,060
Thank you, dude.

655
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,160
This is my place, right?

656
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:01,420
Yes.

657
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,080
Um... you sit right here.

658
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:06,450
Okay.

659
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:10,920
Everyone, get ready. We'll start shooting now.

660
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,340
You went to the toilet, right?

661
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:22,840
Your hair is so messy.

662
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,460
You know me well.

663
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:31,990
It's your habit.

664
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,700
Okay, let's do it.

665
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:36,420
Let's actually shoot this scene.

666
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:52,620
Will it be weird...

667
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:54,350
if I give him this?

668
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,800
Gosh! This is bad.

669
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:05,950
Umm...

670
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:08,810
Maybe he will accept it.

671
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:11,990
He has a soft heart these days.

672
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,830
Hello, sis. What is it?

673
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:20,610
Ah...

674
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,480
Oh my!

675
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:25,600
Pun doesn't accept any more acting roles.

676
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,710
This is his last project.

677
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,750
Sis, what do you say then?

678
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,390
I am so sorry.

679
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,730
Pun accepts this as his last project.

680
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:13,750
Good that you're here. Can you practice this scene with me?

681
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,110
What?

682
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,850
Why don't you do it with Inn?

683
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,340
Come on. Just help me.

684
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,300
Please, my friend.

685
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:21,610
Hey.

686
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,540
You should practice this with Inn.

687
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,020
How would it help if you rehearse with me?

688
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,740
I... I don't want to bother him.

689
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,070
Please, help me.

690
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,970
And you don’t care if it bothers me?

691
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,330
It's not like that.

692
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,340
It's just that I failed it last time.

693
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,790
So I want to do my best this time.

694
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,500
I want Inn to feel at ease and not be worried.

695
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,030
If you want him to feel that way, you should practice with him.

696
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,530
Wait.

697
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:53,920
But you're my everything.

698
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:00,570
Is that all I can be to you?

699
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:06,330
What?

700
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,240
Nothing.

701
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:15,140
So which scene do you want me to help with?

702
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,770
The scene where I got paint on my finger.

703
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:18,930
This one.

704
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,260
Okay.

705
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,260
Okay.

706
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,330
Okay, let's do it.

707
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,780
So, I have to start off with...

708
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:37,040
This.

709
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:38,740
Oh.

710
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:39,860
I got paint on my finger.

711
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:45,190
Don't think that it's dirty.

712
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,290
Look at it as art.

713
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:53,660
Beautiful.

714
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:57,760
You're right.

715
00:48:58,270 --> 00:48:58,840
Beautiful.

716
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:00,940
After that...

717
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:02,870
bend down...

718
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,480
What the hell are you guys doing?

719
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,230
Er...

720
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,930
I just asked Otto to help me practice my lines.

721
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:29,940
But that's my part, isn't it?

722
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,150
Why didn't you practice it with me?

723
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:34,520
Inn, calm down.

724
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:37,870
- He's doing all of this for you.
- For me?

725
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,560
Why don't you tell me what you've done?

726
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,260
You see?

727
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,420
You don't care about anything!

728
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:50,430
- Do you ever know anything?
- I don't know anything!

729
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:53,560
That's why I always hear it from someone else.

730
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,190
About the fact that you have a new partner,

731
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,510
and that you quit acting

732
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:00,640
You don’t want to be an actor anymore, right?

733
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,460
You said it yourself, didn’t you?

734
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,500
That this would be your last project.

735
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,690
Everyone on this set knows

736
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:10,690
that we’ve had a fight and can no longer work together.

737
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,310
Isn’t that embarrassing enough?

738
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:15,680
How much more shame do you want me to feel?

739
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:18,690
Do you want me to look even worse than this?

740
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:23,050
If you really want to break up with me,

741
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,730
you don’t have to do all this.

742
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:31,380
I’ll tell Toey

743
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,250
that I’m going to quit this project.

744
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,470
Inn...

745
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,100
Inn!

746
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,120
- Inn!
- Pun.

747
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:48,830
Damn it.

748
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,800
Okay, let's do it. Please be quiet. We're shooting now.

749
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,050
- Sound!
- Crew, please be quiet.

750
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:02,480
Speed!

751
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:03,780
Slate.

752
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:08,630
3, 2, 1, action!

753
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:27,130
Why don’t you two try lowering your egos and talking to each other properly?

754
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,890
You both have the same life goal,

755
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:33,850
which means you still want to have each other in your lives.

756
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,280
But maybe you’ve been focusing too much on the goal

757
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:40,530
and overlooking the people who are with you along the way.

758
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:42,590
I'll get to the point.

759
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,300
Should we get back together?
