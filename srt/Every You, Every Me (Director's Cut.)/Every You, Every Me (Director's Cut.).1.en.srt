00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,640
Good morning!

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,020
It’s been so hot the past few days, hasn’t it?

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,280
The Meteorological Department announced that due to the effects of global warming,

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,800
it will rain at night throughout November

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,080
in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region for 30 consecutive days.

8
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,940
Prepare yourself for the upcoming rain.

9
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,780
Plan your commute before leaving.

10
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,720
Prepare all the essentials to protect yourself from the rain.

11
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:07,040
Sometimes bad luck brings good luck. Some of you might find what you've been searching for.

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,760
I hope all the single people out there meet their soulmate in the rain.

13
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,660
Get ready to see all the vivid colors!

14
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,240
If any of you meet your soulmate, I hope you both fall deeply in love.

15
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,800
If luck hasn't favored you yet, or if you're soulmate blind, please don't be sad.

16
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,100
Don't forget to love yourself and take care of your health first.

17
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,860
Let's continue with international news.

18
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,400
Heng!

19
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,220
Bro, I've got a plan.

20
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,680
Did you hear the news?

21
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,440
What is it? What news?

22
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,880
They said it will rain for 30 consecutive days.

23
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,880
You're not going to ask me about my plan?

24
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,300
Fine. What is your plan?

25
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,180
If it rains heavily, I won't be able to go out to deliver. Why don't we start selling umbrellas instead?

26
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,860
Where do we get the umbrellas from?

27
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,620
From your store.

28
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,720
Most of the people might want to get wet in the rain.

29
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,300
They won't buy umbrellas.

30
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,620
Really?

31
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,560
Single people looking for their soulmates,

32
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,060
they'll dash into the rain!

33
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,460
I'm so jealous of those people

34
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,100
who can see their soulmates in the rain.

35
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
Oh, right.

36
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,180
You're soulmate blind.

37
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,820
You don't have to repeat that.

38
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,740
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,540
But really,

40
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,060
who would be crazy enough to run into the rain just to see their soulmate?

41
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,360
They'll just end up with pneumonia instead.

42
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,020
Exactly!

43
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,020
So what do you think? Are you in?

44
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,500
I can't go to sell umbrellas with you.

45
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,540
I have to look after this store.

46
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,300
How about this?

47
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,880
You can stay here.

48
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,480
And I'll go out there to sell them.

49
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,280
And we can share the profits, seventy-thirty.

50
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,820
Are you crazy?

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,020
Sixty-fourty.

52
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,540
Come on, bro!

53
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,340
Sixty-five to thirty-five. No more negotiation. The deal is done.

54
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,940
Fine. You win again.

55
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,180
I'll go get the umbrellas then.

56
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,960
Okay.

57
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,320
Whoa.

58
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,660
Are you crazy?

59
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,560
I'm off!

60
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,540
What!

61
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,320
You should pay first.

62
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,260
Add it to my bill. I'll come back to pay later. I'm leaving. Bye!

63
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,840
Gosh!

64
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,600
Clumsy as always.

65
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,440
Dad is definitely going to scold me.

66
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,680
What should we eat for dinner?

67
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,400
I want to eat Italian food.

68
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,220
Look at him!

69
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,080
What kind of outfit is that?

70
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,080
Why is he all covered up?

71
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,520
Exactly. I guess he's scared to die of pneumonia.

72
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,680
Look at Dol.

73
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,860
The way he dresses is so strange.

74
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,340
Do you want an umbrella?

75
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,620
Do you want one?

76
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,520
Oh, you already have it. What about you?

77
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,480
I already have mine.

78
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,120
But my umbrellas are prettier. Look at the color.

79
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,080
No, thank you.

80
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,940
Do you want a raincoat?

81
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,620
No, thanks.

82
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,380
Bro, do you want a raincoat? I have umbrellas too.

83
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,140
You don't want one?

84
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,200
You want to buy?

85
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,540
Choose whichever color you like. I have this one as well.

86
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,880
How about the green one? It suits you.

87
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,780
You want the pink one?

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,280
Who is that guy?

89
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,600
I don't know too.

90
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,480
Heng!

91
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,500
Bro!

92
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,220
I'm in trouble now!

93
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,940
I met my soulmate.

94
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,960
Huh? What do you mean?

95
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,320
I got wet in the rain, and then I saw him in full color.

96
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,760
Aren't you soulmate blind?

97
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,440
Maybe...

98
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,760
Your boyfriend lied to you.

99
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,880
Ex-boyfriend!

100
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,280
Oh, right, ex-boyfriend.

101
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,560
Au definitely lied to you.

102
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,100
He said you're his soulmate, so you wouldn't dare to break up with him.

103
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,520
We've already broken up.

104
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,140
You keep saying that.

105
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,000
How many times have you broken up already? You'll get back with him again.

106
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,640
This time, we really broke up for good.

107
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,800
I hope it's true.

108
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,920
But you should stop acting like a bank that lends money first.

109
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,740
How much did he waste on football betting?

110
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,360
I know.

111
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,760
I'm so done with him.

112
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,440
But are you sure?

113
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,680
That you actually met your soulmate.

114
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,320
I'm sure!

115
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,060
He's a man.

116
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,960
He was waiting for the van to go home.

117
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,900
He's handsome too!

118
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,880
Wait a minute.

119
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,640
So that means he's working in this area.

120
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,480
You're right!

121
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,620
I know what to do.

122
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,820
I have to prove it.

123
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,260
Tomorrow, I'll go to the bus stop and wait for him, and I'll ask him,

124
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,500
'Do you see me in color?'

125
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,940
I can see you in color!

126
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,800
What do you think?

127
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,640
Or maybe there's something wrong with my body.

128
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,420
Am I going to die? Oh my God!

129
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,240
You're talking nonsense.

130
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,700
Come on!

131
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,480
I think this plan will work.

132
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,200
I'm going now.

133
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,900
Hey! Pay for your cat food first.

134
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,280
Add it to my bill. I'll come back to pay later.

135
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,020
I knew it.

136
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,960
Eh?

137
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,600
Who gave you the food?

138
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,260
It's okay.

139
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,120
I'll give you an umbrella instead.

140
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,400
There you go.

141
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,380
It's going to rain for 30 days.

142
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,280
Use this umbrella so you won't get wet.

143
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,480
Umbrellas!

144
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,160
Mister!

145
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,440
You're feeding the Midnight gang?

146
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,540
What are you talking about?

147
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,060
You don't have to raise your voice.

148
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,460
What's your name?

149
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,900
Is your office in this area?

150
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,360
Really?

151
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,680
Let's get straight to business.

152
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,840
Can you please confirm the answer for me?

153
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,240
I see you in color. Do you see me in color as well?

154
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,320
If it's a yes,

155
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,580
then we're soulmates.

156
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,540
It doesn't matter.

157
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,800
Yes, it is! We're soulmates!

158
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
How about this?

159
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,640
Can I get to know you more? Please.

160
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,340
Let's be on our own paths.

161
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,280
Why?

162
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,720
Eh?

163
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,880
Mister!

164
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,500
Mister!

165
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,580
Why is he playing hard to get?

166
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,080
Au: Can we go back to how things used to be?

167
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,720
Really?

168
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,060
Yes.

169
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,040
I can see you in color.

170
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,160
You've never heard of 'soulmate blind'?

171
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,100
1% of people in this world cannot see their soulmate.

172
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,080
I guess you're one of them.

173
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,240
This sucks.

174
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,940
It's already hard to find your own soulmate.

175
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,240
And I'm also in that 1% of people.

176
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,360
It's okay.

177
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,820
Just know that we're soulmates. That's enough.

178
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,480
Delete.

179
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,120
Here you go.

180
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,520
So, is there any update?

181
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,040
I wish! I came back empty-handed.

182
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,820
He got angry when I started talking about soulmates.

183
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,940
Did you annoy him?

184
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,560
Me? Annoyed him? Are you mad?

185
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,720
Also, the way he dressed was completely covered up.

186
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,520
He was wearing a raincoat and boots.

187
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,480
Why is he so afraid of the rain? What a weirdo.

188
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,160
Whoa, look at you!

189
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,960
It's not like you're not weird.

190
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:25,480
I'm weird? I'm completely normal and handsome.

191
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,220
I won't back down.

192
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,800
I won't give up.

193
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,180
I will keep approaching him.

194
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Whatever.

195
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,580
Bro, there's an order. See you later.

196
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,200
Alright, see you.

197
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,140
Count the money too. Make sure it's correct

198
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,380
Hello.

199
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,860
Your food is here.

200
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,520
I'm waiting in front of the building.

201
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,360
Sure.

202
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,040
Okay.

203
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,960
I'm here to pick up my food.

204
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,680
Oh, here you go.

205
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,080
And you're... Dol, right?

206
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,280
Are you working here?

207
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,260
Thank you.

208
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,200
I always deliver food here. How come I’ve never seen you before?

209
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,600
Also, if you don't want to get wet from the rain, I can come to pick you up.

210
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,580
Mister! It's free for you!

211
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,660
Mister!

212
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,620
Mister!

213
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,300
You want to go to the bus stop, right? I'll take you there.

214
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,620
It's okay.

215
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,400
Come on. We know each other now. No need to worry!

216
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,380
Please.

217
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,480
It's okay.

218
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,880
Please. It's free. I won't add extra charges just for you.

219
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,560
No, thank you.

220
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,320
Please, let me give you a ride.

221
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,500
I told you no.

222
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,420
Mister!

223
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,540
Are you alright?

224
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,080
I'm fine.

225
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,180
Let me help you.

226
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,240
You can hardly walk, and you still say you're fine?

227
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,820
Let me help you.

228
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,260
I'm fine, seriously.

229
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,200
Will you let me buy that word from you so you won't say it again?

230
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,200
You're so stubborn.

231
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,600
I'll take you to get your wound treated.

232
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,480
Walk slowly.

233
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,280
May I?

234
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,300
Are you okay?

235
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,740
Let's go. I can assure you of your safety.

236
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,080
Trust me.

237
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,880
Let me see.

238
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,900
I told you I would drop you off. You're so stubborn.

239
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,440
You see? You were grazed by the motorcycle.

240
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,240
It's not that serious.

241
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,400
It is.

242
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,600
You shouldn't keep saying that everything is fine when you're hurt.

243
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,220
If it hurts, then just say so. Do you understand?

244
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,800
Let me put it on for you.

245
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,860
It will hurt a bit.

246
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,400
And don't forget to put the medicine on your ankle too.

247
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,820
It will definitely throb tomorrow.

248
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,240
Here. Take it.

249
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,340
- Thank you.
- What?

250
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,660
Thank you.

251
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,800
Your welcome.

252
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,140
It's nothing.

253
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,580
By the way, can I ask you something?

254
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,580
When I see you, you always dress so covered up.

255
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,000
Don't you feel hot?

256
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,440
It's about to rain.

257
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,100
So I have to wear a raincoat.

258
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,940
I understand.

259
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,520
But I guess you're really scared of the rain, aren't you?

260
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,520
Yeah.

261
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,280
But rain...

262
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,980
It makes us see each other in color.

263
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,780
Are you going to talk about this same topic again?

264
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,740
But we're actually soulmates, aren't we?

265
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,800
You can see me in color.

266
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,320
I can see you in color too.

267
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,720
Is this real?

268
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,700
Yes.

269
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,500
I can see you in color.

270
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,080
- So that means--
- I don't believe in such things.

271
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:50,820
Oh.

272
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,400
There're so many people who love each other even though they're not soulmates.

273
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,740
And their life as a couple can be good.

274
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,340
There are some couples...

275
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,920
who are soulmates,

276
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,580
but it doesn't work out.

277
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,700
The Rain-Color Verse and all those soulmate beliefs are meaningless to me.

278
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,480
Aren't you happy?

279
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,700
The chance that you will meet your soulmate...

280
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,180
It's very hard.

281
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,480
Why don't you give it a try?

282
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,640
No.

283
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,840
Just give it a try. If it doesn't work, then we can figure it out later.

284
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,620
Where can I grab a taxi here?

285
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,760
Why get a taxi? I can drop you off instead.

286
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,480
It's okay. I can call a car using an app.

287
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,680
Why do you have to use the app? It costs you an extra fee. If you go with me, it’s all free.

288
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,960
The extra fee isn't much. I can find a taxi on my own.

289
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,040
Please, just let me give you a ride.

290
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,460
I can use the app.

291
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,460
Come on.

292
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,520
You see? I can drop you off here, and it’s all free.

293
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,380
Yeah.

294
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,980
Thank you.

295
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,380
By the way, if your office needs a messenger, feel free to contact me.

296
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,900
Or if you need someone to take you anywhere and drop you off, just call me.

297
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,900
I drive safely, and I have a free helmet for you.

298
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,600
Are you trying to hard sell me?

299
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,840
No, I'm not. I see that your arm hurts, you leg hurts too.

300
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,600
So I just want to help.

301
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,480
By the way,

302
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,060
can I have your number?

303
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,500
No.

304
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,240
But I work hard and I work fast.

305
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,820
There's no need.

306
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,880
Please. Please give me your number.

307
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,580
No.

308
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,420
Don't be so mean. Please give me your number.

309
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,660
There's no need.

310
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,280
Give me your number instead.

311
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,780
Oh, so you’re asking for my number?

312
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,760
I didn't mean it that way.

313
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,580
Say no more.

314
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,020
Actually, I already have your number since you ordered the food.

315
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,120
But I'm asking for your permission first.

316
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,960
Don't scold me.

317
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,000
You were the one who asked for my number.

318
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,840
One, two, seven, eight, two seven, eight...

319
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,120
Seven, eight, seven, eight. What the heck?

320
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,620
Two, seven, eight...

321
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,200
What a big smile on your face.

322
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,140
What?

323
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,900
What is two, seven, eight?

324
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,620
Guess.

325
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,860
I don't know!

326
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,700
I got his number! Aren't I great?

327
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,800
Who?

328
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,120
Your soulmate?

329
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,200
That's right. Who else would it be?

330
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,880
That guy who came to the store and you treated his wound?

331
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,700
That's correct.

332
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,460
I see.

333
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,500
Well, he doesn't look bad.

334
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,000
Good for you. You can finally move on.

335
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,620
I'll text him now.

336
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,400
Au: Why aren’t you picking up the phone?

337
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,660
Speak of the devil.

338
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,180
I've moved on already.

339
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,560
I'm deleting his text, you see?

340
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,980
You better be.

341
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,320
I better text that guy now. What should I say?

342
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,100
Hello.

343
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,140
Who?

344
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,620
- There's only one person I'm talking about!
- Okay, okay.

345
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,180
Mr. Soulmate.

346
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,060
Ohhh.

347
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,500
You think it's a good idea?

348
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,660
Go for it.

349
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,080
Dol, please help me with this.

350
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,300
It's not that far.

351
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,720
Er, okay--

352
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,500
Hello.

353
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,880
Here.

354
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,660
Yes, sir.

355
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,300
I forgot my wallet upstairs.

356
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:33,140
It's okay. You can transfer via Promptpay. My number is 081-616-763-442

357
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,800
I'll keep repeating it until you know my number by heart.

358
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,060
I know. I already saved it.

359
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,240
You can call me when you miss me.

360
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,820
I have to go now.

361
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,620
I've transferred the money already.

362
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,160
Alright.

363
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,500
Let me put it on for you.

364
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,240
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

365
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,300
This one is for you.

366
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,300
You bought a coffee for me?

367
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:31,740
Yes.

368
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,960
Hey.

369
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,760
You don't have to.

370
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,620
You like to look at the sky, right?

371
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,140
I don't.

372
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,040
But I just can't help it.

373
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,220
Why?

374
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,080
Because life gets troublesome when it rains.

375
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,220
You're saying it like you know when it's going to rain.

376
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,240
I know.

377
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,500
That single cloud over there.

378
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,260
It's called a cumulus.

379
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,800
It means the weather is still nice.

380
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,680
But the weather forecast says it’s going to rain for quite some time.

381
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,320
That's because, as the day goes on,

382
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,060
cumulus clouds combine into cumulonimbus clouds.

383
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,540
More commonly known as thunderclouds.

384
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,900
What is it called again?

385
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,740
Something bus? What a funny name.

386
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,080
Actually, clouds have many names.

387
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,640
Like Stratus.

388
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,040
Stratocumulus.

389
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,480
Nimbostratus.

390
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,020
There are more types of clouds as we go higher.

391
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,360
You're finally looking at my face.

392
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,720
Huh?

393
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,180
Usually, you’re always looking at the sky.

394
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,940
That's not true.

395
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,260
Fine, whatever you say.

396
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:36,380
Tell me more about that nitrobus something.

397
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,040
I want to listen. Please.

398
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,140
Your ice-cream is melting.

399
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,820
Give it to me.

400
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,680
Hold it this way so your hands don't get dirty.

401
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,140
Finish eating so we can go home.

402
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,420
It's going to rain soon.

403
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,020
I’m not scared of the rain.

404
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,740
It's good if it rains every day

405
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,040
so I can see you in color.

406
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,880
If you really like the rain that much, why don’t you ride a boat instead of a motorcycle?

407
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,700
You're ruining the mood.

408
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,020
Mom

409
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,080
Hello.

410
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,580
Not yet.

411
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,360
I don't think he will call.

412
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,220
Maybe he forgets about it.

413
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,920
It's okay as long as I remember.

414
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,420
Thank you.

415
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,600
Happy birthday to you.

416
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:35,300
Happy birthday to you.

417
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:40,960
Happy birthday, happy birthday.

418
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,900
Happy birthday to you.

419
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,400
Happy birthday!

420
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,280
Thank you.

421
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,480
Wishing you lots of happiness.

422
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,780
Thank you.

423
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,300
Let's eat.

424
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,680
Boss, there's an urgent task coming up.

425
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,920
Okay.

426
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,500
Thank you.

427
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,420
Hello.

428
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,560
Hello, Dol.

429
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,060
I'll be late to pick you up today because I have to go get a very important parcel.

430
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,860
It's okay.

431
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,400
I can go back by myself.

432
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,900
Dol!

433
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:35,080
Happy birthday to you.

434
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,780
Happy birthday, happy birthday.

435
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:46,700
Happy birthday to you.

436
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,640
Happy birthday to you, Dol.

437
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,380
Yay!

438
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,380
Happy birthday, Dol.

439
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,180
I wish you immense happiness!

440
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,900
How do you know that today is my birthday?

441
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,180
It's in the app.

442
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,920
I didn't know that.

443
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,800
It's about to rain.

444
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
You can keep the cake and eat it at home later.

445
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,380
No need.

446
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,560
Why?

447
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,560
You're not going to eat my cake?

448
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,320
You're so mean.

449
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,640
Let's eat it together.

450
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,940
I'll take you to a place to eat.

451
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,240
Oh, hello.

452
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,720
What's your order number?

453
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,580
No, bro.

454
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,500
I'm here to eat this time.

455
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,960
I thought you're here to take your order.

456
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,720
Scan for the menu right here.

457
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,120
Order whatever you want. It's on me.

458
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,200
You're going to treat me?

459
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,820
There's no need. I feel bad for it.

460
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,540
It's in return for the cake.

461
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,260
Don't feel bad about it.

462
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,220
Dol.

463
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,140
Isn't this too much?

464
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,060
We'll eat here.

465
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,680
Alright.

466
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,240
Total is 520 baht.

467
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,500
I'll scan to pay.

468
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,980
It's so yummy.

469
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,820
Of course, this is a famous place.

470
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,440
I know it's famous.

471
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,260
But I don't have that much money.

472
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,420
So I never tried eating it before.

473
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,540
You seem to have a lot of work.

474
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,780
I see you busy with work all the time.

475
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,520
Nope.

476
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,040
It's not that much.

477
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,800
Just enough to live.

478
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,420
But at least my mom doesn't ask me for more money

479
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,080
because she has a happy life now with her boyfriend.

480
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,860
So I decided to leave and take care of myself.

481
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,140
I do miss my dad, though.

482
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,000
My dad passed away since I was 3 years old.

483
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,320
I couldn't even remember his face.

484
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,380
If he was still here, my life would be better than this.

485
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,180
Dol.

486
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,280
What's wrong?

487
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,580
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told you.

488
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,180
It's okay.

489
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,120
You can tell me.

490
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,260
Actually, that's all.

491
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:11,140
My mom met her soulmate and now she's happy.

492
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,540
I feel happy for her.

493
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,500
I understand now.

494
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,520
Is this why you're so interested in soulmate stuff?

495
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,400
You don't like it?

496
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,360
No.

497
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,480
I think it's nonesense.

498
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,680
People can love each other even if they aren’t soulmates.

499
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:43,820
And even soulmates can break up in the end.

500
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,780
You're not romantic at all!

501
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,420
You're not selling umbrellas anymore?

502
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,820
Nope. Not anymore.

503
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,980
I want to spend my time...

504
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,980
flirting with you.

505
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,000
Should I?

506
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,560
Actually, I really admire you.

507
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,340
You can do so many things.

508
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,820
You're a rider.

509
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,340
A messenger, delivering parcels.

510
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,840
You can also make time to sell umbrellas.

511
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,920
I don't think I can do all this.

512
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,680
You're making me blush now.

513
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,960
Do you think I'm amazing?

514
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,180
Of course, you are.

515
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,320
You like me, don't you?

516
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,160
Just eat your cake.

517
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,060
It's going to melt.

518
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,920
Hello.

519
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,340
Dol.

520
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,320
Was it your birthday yesterday?

521
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,540
Yes, that's right.

522
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,620
Happy belated birthday.

523
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,420
Thank you.

524
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,900
Do you want to eat lunch together?

525
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,420
Join us. We can find someplace nice to eat.

526
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,980
Let's go. My treat today. Let's all go together.

527
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,500
But... I can't go.

528
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,920
Why not?

529
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,600
I can't go unless you let me treat you all.

530
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Great! You pay then.

531
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,840
Alright!

532
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,660
Yes!

533
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,760
Should we go now?

534
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,620
Of course. A boss like me can do anything.

535
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,860
Let's go. I'm so hungry.

536
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,600
I'll show you how to drift a motorcycle.

537
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,260
Do it then.

538
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,560
You should drive carefully.

539
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,900
I'm always careful.

540
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,100
Do you know these cats have their own gang?

541
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,140
Really?

542
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,480
That's good. They won't be lonely.

543
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,300
They are called the Midnight Gang. Isn’t that cool?

544
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,300
It's cute.

545
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,120
Sun.

546
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,400
Why did you not pick up my call?

547
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,280
Who's this?

548
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,300
He's my customer.

549
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,160
Can we talk later?

550
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,000
No.

551
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,880
Answer me first. Did you even read my text?

552
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,340
I didn't.

553
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,820
Let's go.

554
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,100
Wait, Sun.

555
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,320
We have to talk about this.

556
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,960
Can you just leave me alone?

557
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,940
We've already broken up

558
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,240
I've never agreed to that. We're not broken up yet.

559
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,440
It's all in your head.

560
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,260
Stop threatening to break up every time we fight.

561
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,440
Why do you like to run away from the problem?

562
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,580
We should help each other to find the solution.

563
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,240
Not just say you want to break up.

564
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,020
Sun.

565
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,880
Can you give me one more chance?

566
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,920
Let's talk about this.

567
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,980
That's enough, Au!

568
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,980
Stop lying to me.

569
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,860
Stop lying that we're soulmates.

570
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,100
You didn't see the color from me.

571
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,100
He's the one who sees me in color.

572
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,300
That's not right. I told you that you're soulmate blind.

573
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm not soulmate blind!

574
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,280
You lied to me about this too!

575
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,880
How could it be?

576
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,800
Because I can see him in color!

577
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,440
You suddenly have a change of heart just because you see someone else in color?

578
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,680
So what if that’s true?

579
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,040
People shouldn’t be in a relationship just because someone says they’re your soulmate.

580
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,100
I didn't just say it.

581
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,220
I really do see you in color.

582
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,840
You don't believe me?

583
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,500
No. I don't belive you.

584
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,980
Let's go.

585
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,660
No! Sun.

586
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,560
Let go of me!

587
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,620
Do it then!

588
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,120
Just do whatever you want!

589
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:35,220
There are many people here watching. They will know who you really are.

590
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,120
No!

591
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,700
Hey!

592
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,500
I think that's enough.

593
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,980
It's none of your business.

594
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,120
Let him go.

595
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,320
No.

596
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,240
I'll call the police then.

597
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,760
I will do it.

598
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,020
Let him go!

599
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,400
Thank you.

600
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,640
And I'm sorry for involving you in this.

601
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,940
Who's that?

602
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,340
Your ex-boyfriend?

603
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,400
Yes.

604
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:34,220
We've already broken up, but he won't let me go. I don't know what to do.

605
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,560
I won't go back to him this time. We're so incompatible.

606
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,780
So that means you guys have made up a couple of times already?

607
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,600
Yeah.

608
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,840
It doesn't sound good, does it?

609
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,760
I'm stupid.

610
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,860
Did you really mean what you said?

611
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,400
About what?

612
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,220
That you like someone else now.

613
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,100
Because he's your soulmate.

614
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,360
Oh, you want me to say it right here?

615
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,860
I feel shy now.

616
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,140
Well, then.

617
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,500
I just want to ask you.

618
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,700
All this time,

619
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,780
do you like me for who I am,

620
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,960
or is it just because I'm your soulmate?

621
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,180
Come on, Dol. I can't give you the answer right now. It's raining. We should go.

622
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,360
Let's go.

623
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,740
Come on, let's go.

624
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,760
Dol!

625
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,700
Dol!

626
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,200
I'm the one who's taking care of everything!

627
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,920
I'm the one who goes out to work!

628
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,900
What do you do?

629
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,680
You're just keeping complaining!

630
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,500
Do you know how tiring it is to look after your child alone?

631
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,460
Why are you making a fuss?

632
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,360
Sun

633
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:35,880
What's up?

634
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,220
Are you heartbroken?

635
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,100
What?

636
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,780
How do you know?

637
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,800
Au came here last night. I saw him.

638
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,360
Yeah.

639
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,380
Everyone around here probably knew.

640
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,620
What's wrong? Did you two have a fight because of Au?

641
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,420
Not really.

642
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,140
Or maybe it was.

643
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,200
He suddenly asked if I like him or not.

644
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,920
Do I like him for who he is,

645
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,460
or is it just because he's my soulmate?

646
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,480
What did you tell him?

647
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,300
I didn't answer.

648
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,200
I didn't know what to say. He asked suddenly,

649
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,200
and I didn't have time to prepare myself for it.

650
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,900
So do you like him?

651
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,900
How do I know that?

652
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,080
What! Are you trying to annoy me?

653
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,200
You're the one with experience, not me.

654
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,320
Right.

655
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,760
Don't you want to be with someone?

656
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:41,920
Well...

657
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,860
I don't want to be with anyone.

658
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,460
I'm not interested in love.

659
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,500
I can be happy

660
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,300
without love.

661
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,300
I hope there's a place for someone like me in this world.

662
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,240
Sadhu.

663
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:05,740
Maybe

664
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,240
the answer is very simple.

665
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:13,240
Do you feel happy when you’re with him?

666
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:19,220
Am I happy?

667
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,580
Hold it this way so your hands don't get dirty.

668
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,300
Just eat your cake.

669
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,500
You're right! I'm happy!

670
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,680
That's it. That's your answer.

671
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:43,540
Can't stop smiling now, huh?

672
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,880
So do you have the answer now?

673
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,900
Stop teasing me. You already know my answer.

674
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,740
I'm late now. I should go see him first.

675
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,640
I have to go. See you!

676
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,400
Damn! I forgot my motorcycle. I'll be right back, bro!

677
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,460
Whatever.

678
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,600
Hello.

679
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,860
Oh, Sun!

680
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,340
Why do you come back so early?

681
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,380
There aren't many orders today?

682
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,620
No, I'm off work today.

683
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,600
I'm going to see my soulmate.

684
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,840
I have to go now! See you later!

685
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,840
You found one already?

686
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,500
Hey! Who are you?

687
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,260
Sun.

688
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:42,740
Au.

689
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,080
How's it going today?

690
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,040
- Lots of work today.
- It's a rough day.

691
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,400
It's already 6 PM.

692
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,540
You're right.

693
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,060
Wait!

694
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,700
Can we talk now?

695
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,000
How much money did you lose this time?

696
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,960
Why do you think of me like that?

697
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,180
You're making me sad.

698
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,360
It's obvious that you're here to steal my money.

699
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,800
My necklace.

700
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,440
Where's my necklace?

701
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,960
Where is it?

702
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:41,760
Au!

703
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,480
This is my mom's necklace!

704
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:02,380
Who is it?

705
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,900
Who?

706
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:06,840
That guy?

707
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:30,980
Dol.

708
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:32,740
I'm going first.

709
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:33,780
Alright.

710
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,240
Do you want to come with us?

711
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,280
It's okay.

712
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,700
See you then.

713
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,720
See you.

714
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:58,620
Excuse me.

715
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,520
Sun is not here?

716
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,460
Sun has been out for a while now.

717
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:03,880
He doesn't pick up the phone?

718
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,440
I think he might be having a fight with his ex.

719
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,220
Where does he live?

720
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,080
Let me go!

721
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:31,560
No!

722
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,080
Do you think I would go back to you if you do this?

723
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,000
Why not? You always come crawling back to me.

724
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,660
A person like you doesn't have many places to go.

725
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,340
Who would love you except me?

726
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,260
That's not true!

727
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,840
There must be someone who truly loves me!

728
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,220
Who?

729
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:45,560
That asshole?

730
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,560
You just met him, and now you're already in love?

731
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:01,820
I don't love him yet.

732
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,960
But when I'm with him, I feel happy.

733
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,440
Not like when I'm with you!

734
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,000
All we do is fight!

735
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,020
- Happiness has disappeared a long time ago!
- It's because you don't try hard enough!

736
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,740
You always wanted to break up every time we fought!

737
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,620
How could we be happy?

738
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,980
Stop blaming on me.

739
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,740
In the end, you never liked me.

740
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:23,280
You just liked being able to mess with my head and control me.

741
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,660
Who is it? Who told you?

742
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,340
That asshole, right?

743
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,920
Fine!

744
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,060
I told you there's no one!

745
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,780
If you're going to hurt him,

746
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,920
then just do it to me instead.

747
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,420
You want this, right?

748
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:53,860
You want it, huh?

749
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,060
You want it, huh?

750
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,460
You want it?

751
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,880
You want more, don't you?

752
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,360
You want it so bad, right?

753
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,060
That's enough!

754
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,800
Stop bothering him.

755
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,760
Good that you're here.

756
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,420
We can sort this out now.

757
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,180
That's enough, Au!

758
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,420
I won't go back to you.

759
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,160
I want to love someone who values me.

760
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,340
Stop it, Au!

761
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,460
I'm going to call the police!

762
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:28,980
Stop right there!

763
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,940
Everyone in my building is scared now.

764
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,220
Why are you just standing there? Go arrest him!

765
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,220
Let go of me!

766
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,100
Get out of here!

767
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,680
Go away!

768
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:47,060
Don't ever come back here again! I will call the police to put you in jail!

769
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,280
Damn it!

770
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,520
Are you alright?

771
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,020
It's okay, Sun.

772
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,520
You'll be alright.

773
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,620
Will you get sick?

774
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,360
You went out in the rain just to help me.

775
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,100
It's not a big deal.

776
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,440
I will get well soon.

777
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,300
Thank you so much.

778
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:09,880
Don't think too much about it.

779
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:16,860
Dol.

780
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,300
I know the answer now.

781
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,980
I don’t like you

782
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,100
just because you’re my soulmate.

783
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,260
I like you

784
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,280
for who you really are.

785
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,240
Well...

786
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,920

Prin Prasertrungruangtham.

795
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:16,080
Hello, Mr. Prin. I'm First Ekdanai.

796
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,480
I will be your secretary.

797
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,080
I’ll give you your first task.

798
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,640
Find me 10 marketing agencies to choose from.

799
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:28,240
Mr. Prin, you work so hard, but sometimes you're too stressed.

800
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,380
You should find something else to do.

801
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,240
Like what?

802
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,340
Find someone who understands you.
