[The White Olive Tree]

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,860
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,350
[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

4
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,950
Song Ran.

5
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,039
You...

6
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,630
You are in no position to judge her!

7
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,370
How irresponsible of you

8
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,360
to stand on moral high grounds

9
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,030
and comment on things you haven't witnessed

10
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,650
and people you don't even know!

11
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,130
War Orphan

12
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,760
is Shen Bei.

13
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,690
I mean like who are you?

14
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,550
Who are you to judge?

15
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,250
Judging from the tone, it seems like she knows the journalist.

16
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,050
Is the journalist

17
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,120
trying to defend herself?

18
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,110
Record a video and let your voice be heard,

19
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,570
so we can uncover the truth.

20
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,490
I don't need to use other accounts to speak,

21
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,350
let alone human flesh.

22
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,060
As a journalist,

23
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,280
I know what freedom of speech is.

24
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,520
Whatever you want to say,

25
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,829
I'm here.

26
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,079
Song Ran, are you crazy?

27
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,220
Don't blame others.

28
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,270
Where's your conscience?

29
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,560
Your award matters

30
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,960
more than their lives?

31
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,200
Don't you feel guilty about this?

32
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,220
The kids died for nothing.

33
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,329
Record a video and let your voice be heard,

34
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,800
so we can uncover the truth.

35
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,820
Shen Bei, you are ridiculous.

36
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,230
You're a coward

37
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,720
and you still want to fight for others.

38
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,400
Now you got her into trouble.

39
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,360
You are truly more of a hindrance

40
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,560
than a help.

41
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,710
Reporter Song.

42
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,430
The act of gaining fame and fortune through others' suffering

43
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,150
is highly praised by the masses.

44
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,680
Is this societal progress

45
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,800
or setback?

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,710
She did something so shameless

47
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,630
No.

48
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,400
and dare to act so righteous.

49
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,240
I didn't see.

50
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,120
Is fame more important than human lives?

51
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,680
It's all your fault.

52
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,310
Do you have a conscience?

53
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,280
I didn't see it.

54
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,079
She doesn't deserve to be a journalist.

55
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,150
Can't you tell that that person is a devil?

56
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,210
Why didn't you tell those kids

57
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
to get away?

58
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,710
Why can't you tell

59
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,150
that the person is a devil?

60
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,710
Why?

61
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,710
Why?

62
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,000
Reporter Song.

63
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,420
Zan.

64
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,240
No matter how many years have past,

65
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,680
no matter what sort of problem you're facing,

66
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,800
as long as you send

67
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,950
"Li Zan is calling for support" to the group chat,

68
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,520
everyone will do their best to help you.

69
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,340
Li Zan is calling for support.

70
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:56,680
Captain.

71
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,510
You're wounded!

72
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,040
Let me out!

73
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,160
Let me out!

74
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,480
Captain!

75
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,040
Captain!

76
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,530
if you try to bring up the injuries,

77
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,750
if you say so,

78
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,550
I will put you into detention too.

79
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,090
No.

80
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,630
Look at the computer.

81
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,260
Zan sent a message.

82
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,920
Open the door.

83
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,920
Let me out!

84
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,390
By what right do you confine me?

85
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,250
By what right?

86
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,270
By the right that I don't want you to get yourself killed.

87
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,310
Who do you think you are?

88
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,370
I got into the Special Forces through passing the official assessment.

89
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,030
Whether I go on missions

90
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,600
is not up to you.

91
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,600
It's also none of your business whether I get killed or not.

92
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,800
You are abusing your power.

93
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,950
You know this won't work on me.

94
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,360
As long as I want you to stay here,

95
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,210
-you can’t go anywhere.
-You...

96
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,180
Reporter Song is in trouble.

97
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,570
Zan sent a message asking for help.

98
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,500
Take a good look.

99
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,340
It's up to you whether you want to help him.

100
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,750
You're a reporter.

101
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,120
That's what you're good at

102
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,180
and should be doing.

103
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,390
Killing those bastards

104
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,040
and avenging for Rina

105
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,900
is my business.

106
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,830
Come to your senses.

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,110
You're the one who's not clear-headed.

108
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,250
Rina is my mother.

109
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,720
This is my country.

110
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,860
I don't need you, a former mercenary, to take care of this.

111
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,480
You're talking nonsense!

112
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,910
Take your computer away!

113
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,140
Let me out!

114
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,960
Benjamin, let me out!

115
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,280
Benjamin!

116
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,170
I'm a member of the Eastern Country Special Forces

117
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,550
and was a journalist

118
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,860
who fought alongside Song.

119
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,750
I remember telling Song

120
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,300
that the Eastern Country

121
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,300
is like a great tree,

122
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,380
bearing the fruition of countless tragedies.

123
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,510
Every traveler from afar

124
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,120
can pluck a handful of its fruits,

125
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,440
harvesting a piece of its sorrow,

126
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,980
only to turn away without a second thought,

127
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,750
leaving the tree forgotten.

128
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,270
I suppose this is what you would call a vulture.

129
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,600
I think

130
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,190
as someone from the Eastern Country

131
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,270
and a witness to the disaster,

132
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,390
I hate vultures more than you do.

133
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,610
But Song showed me that

134
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,640
among those who come to this land,

135
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,010
there are not only those who pluck its fruits

136
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,910
but also those who water its roots,

137
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,200
trim its branches,

138
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,030
and shield it from the wind and rain to protect it.

139
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,790
They do so because they firmly believe that one day,

140
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,360
this tree

141
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,750
will bear not only the fruits of tragedy

142
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,160
but also those of joy and beauty,

143
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,870
hanging from its branches

144
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,790
for all to harvest.

145
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,040
This is what I saw in "Candy."

146
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,630
No matter what happens in the next moment,

147
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,730
the smiles in this one

148
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,630
are enough for me

149
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,600
and millions of soldiers of the Eastern Country

150
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,690
to lay down our lives for.

151
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,320
For this,

152
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,730
I want to thank Reporter Song.

153
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,120
I am proud of you,

154
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,080
and I am honoured to have once stood by your side in battle.

155
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,050
I also want to thank

156
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,080
all those who have ever shown

157
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,590
love,

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,510
kindness,

159
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,450
and greatness to this land.

160
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,560
Ran is so incredible.

161
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,440
But she didn't even say a word herself.

162
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,190
I know right.

163
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,980
There are so many people from the Eastern Country defending her.

164
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,480
Let's see what those people have to say.

165
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,470
Zan.

166
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,110
Thank you.

167
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,980
You're the one who went to find Sasin and the others, right?

168
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,750
I saw the comments online.

169
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,640
No one has more right to speak than Sasin and the rest.

170
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,610
I was on a business trip.

171
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,320
I just asked them to write about

172
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,170
the Song Ran in their eyes.

173
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,680
Zan.

174
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,320
When you come back from your business trip,

175
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,120
can I thank you in person?

176
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,910
He must be busy.

177
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,040
Will he agree to meet?

178
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,660
Thank you.

179
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,310
[Luo Zhan]

180
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,900
Luo Zhan.

181
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,010
I need your help with something.

182
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,080
Can you find me

183
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,320
the best psychiatrist in Liangcheng?

184
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,830
I want to get better soon.

185
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,280
I've found it for you.

186
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,690
I have booked

187
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,510
the director of the Psychiatry and Psychology Department at Cixin Hospital

188
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,670
for appointments

189
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,720
every Tuesday and Wednesday.

190
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,210

00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,830
I have to say

200
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,980
your condition has gotten very serious.

201
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,720
Your situation is considered the most complicated

202
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,510

Dr. Liang,

205
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,480
I'd like to ask

206
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,310
if there's any medication

207
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,300
that can help me recover

208
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,830

I want to meet someone.

210
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,440
I don't want her to see me like this.

it's serious.

216

221
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,030
Why do I feel like

222
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,350
you have violent tendencies?

223
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,800
I bragged to the company

224
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,270

Don't you think

229
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,130
I should have some violent tendencies?

230
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,320
That's fair.

231
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,590
Then I think I should let you attend

232

233
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,070

00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,270
I'm fine too.

378
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,030
I won an award

379
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,030
and I received support from you all,

380
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,590
I'm feeling better and better.

381
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,240
Anyway,

382
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,240
everything is fine.

383
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,940
♫She is a white island♫

384
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:25,730
♫The colorful wind rushes past♫

385
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:31,290
♫Lonely waves, starlit glow♫

386
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,920
♫Quietly leaning together♫

387
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,730
Why are you laughing?

388
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:39,090
♫Autumn reflects in the water♫

389
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:45,750
♫She is a white island♫

390
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,000
We're standing in the middle of the roads

391
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,590
and got trapped.

392
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:46,970
So silly of us.

393
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,490
♫Maybe the world has long forgotten her♫

394
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,830
♫Lonely waves, city lights♫

395
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,550
♫Drifting softly apart♫

396
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,240
Yeah.

397
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,160
So silly.

398
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:05,980
♫Longing lingers in the reflection♫

399
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,270
Back then, when rushing to catch the green light,

400
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:06,810
sometimes,

401
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,700
I would get stuck in the middle of the road too.

402
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:12,490
♫The sky turns a deeper blue♫

403
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,510
♫The brilliant night♫

404
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,560
And I'll feel so awkward.

405
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,190
♫Has never shone so bright♫

406
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,290
♫A white island♫

407
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,960
But,

408
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,580
♫Blooms in the vast sea♫

409
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,610
with two people...

410
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,230
♫I wish I could pick it♫

411
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,870
But what?

412
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,970
♫And give it to you♫

413
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:43,600
♫And she will remember you and me♫

414
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:36,950
But,

415
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,490
I'm rarely like this.

416
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,160
Just this once.

417
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,170
Do you want to have supper?

418
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,830
That's all.

419
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,240
Is it serious?

420
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,030
My hearing is fine.

421
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,250
Sometimes when it gets too noisy around me,

422
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,550
taking it off.

423
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,200
will make everything much more quiet.

424
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,530
Like now,

425
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,720
if I don't feel like talking to you anymore,

426
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,360
I can just take it off.

427
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,550
Did you

428
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,750
get hurt that time?

429
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,440
My eyes had some minor injuries.

430
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,030
It's not serious.

431
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,400
I recovered in a short time.

432
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,400
How about you?

433
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,590
Was your injury serious?

434
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:43,110
I was wearing a protective suit,

435
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,030
so it wasn't serious.

436
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:50,960
That's good.

437
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,670
Let's not talk about this.

438
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,180
Let's talk about something happy today.

439
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,630
Okay?

440
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,740
Ms. Fu.

441
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,050
Jiang Yu has troubled you again.

442
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,200
I'm really sorry.

443
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,650
Mr. Li.

444
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,610
Don't say that.

445
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,030
I'm his class teacher.

446
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,170
This is what I should do.

447
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,760
As for you,

448
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,970
it's not easy for you to do this

449
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,940
as his brother's friend.

450
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,070
Ms. Fu.

451
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,070
We'll handle some paperwork in a while

452
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,080
and then you can bring him back.

453
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:03,800
Okay.

454
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,630
Thank you.

455
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,700
Let me introduce you.

456
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,400
This is

457
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,590
your brother's friend,

458
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,120
Li Zan.

459
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,840
For the past few times you caused troubles,

460
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,320
he helped to sort things out.

461
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
When he received my call today,

462
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,360
he came here immediately too.

463
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,110
Jiang Yu.

464
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:17,710
Ms. Fu.

465
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,190
let me talk to him alone.

466
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:21,960
Okay.

467
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,630
You guys continue.

468
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,920
I'll go handle the paperwork.

469
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,440
Sorry for the trouble.

470
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,000
No problem.

471
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,550
Jiang Yu.

472
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,320
It's unfortunate that our first encounter

473
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,280
is under such circumstances.

474
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,090
I heard a lot about you from Jiang Lin.

475
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,120
I’m not good at lecturing,

476
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,520
but as your brother's friend,

477
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,690
I think I should say something.

478
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,820
I believe you must have your own reasons

479
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,250
for hitting people today.

480
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,340
But Jiang Yu,

481
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:40,760
violence can't solve any problem.

482
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,280
You may not realize now

483
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,280
how much violence will affect people.

484
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,960
So I hope that,

485
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,540
no matter what the reason is,

486
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,110
you apologize to the person who got hit.

487
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,630
If you have to solve any problems in the future,

488
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,250
as long as you trust me,

489
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,230
I'm willing to solve them with you.

490
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,570
Are you done?

491
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:26,630
Good.

492
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:27,840
Let me tell you.

493
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,100
I don't know who Jiang Lin is

494
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,670
and I don’t need his friend to be minding my business.

495
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,770
Jiang Yu.

496
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,230
I'll say it again.

497
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,190
Don't step into my business from now on.

498
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,670
Burdick's jersey?

499
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,840
It's not bad.

500
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,350
I just wonder if Jiang Yu will like it.

501
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,880
Li Zan didn't come today.

502
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:32,710
What?

503
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:33,800
He didn't come?

504
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,480
This guy didn't come for the follow-up visit again.

505
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,590
Mr. Luo.

506
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,430
Reporter Song.

507
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,360
I...

508
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:48,920
I...

509
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:49,810
I caught a cold.

510
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,640
So...

511
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:52,110
Yeah.

512
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,400
Me too.

513
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,150
I'm leaving.

514
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,190
Song Ran,

515
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,180
your condition is becoming stable,

516
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,860
so you're good to reduce the dosage of medicine now.

517
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,010
However, the reducing the dosage may cause emotional fluctuations.

518
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,590
You need to be prepared.

519
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,150
Got it,

520
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:19,690
Dr. Liang.

521
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:24,710
Dr. Liang,

522
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,760
if I were to return to the Eastern Country now,

523
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,690
what do you think will happen?

524
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,900
Directly facing the people and place

525
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,520
that caused you trauma

526
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,230
could possibly lead to two extreme situations.

527
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,630
The positive situation is that

528
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,820
facing the cause of the problem

529
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,570
helps you completely come out of the shadows.

530
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:53,910
The negative one is that

531
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:58,740
being intensely stimulated causes your condition to relapse or even worsen.

532
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,720
As a doctor,

533
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,790
I don't recommend you to do it

534
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,210
unless necessary.

535
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,190
That is because our current treatment

536
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,280
is still effective.

537
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,760
There's no need to take risks.

538
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,170
Luo Zhan.

539
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,230
You're back.

540
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,550
How long have you been here?

541
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,880
Why didn't you call me?

542
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,190
No need to change your shoes.

543
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,680
Take a seat.

544
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,530
I'm not done yet.

545
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,800
Why didn't you go for the re-examination today?

546
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,000
Didn't you want to get better?

547
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,380
You even avoid doctors now.

548
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,670
When will you ever recover completely?

549
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,500
I forgot about it today.

550
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,000
I didn't mean it.

551
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:37,840
Besides,

552
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,650
I'm fine now.

553
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,480
Let it be.

554
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,760
If you really want to let it be,

555
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,190
why bother with these things?
