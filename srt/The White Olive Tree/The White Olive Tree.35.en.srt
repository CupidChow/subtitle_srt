[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental]

4
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,229
I won't let you falsely accuse me.

5
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,460
Hey, guys!

6
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,640
Go down and catch the fish.

7
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,590
Zan, you come down, too.

8
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,920
There are severe water shortages in Happo.

9
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,360
This place is a natural bathing pool.

10
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,930
Zan, he's not lying to you this time.

11
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,190
Come down.

12
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,550
Come on!

13
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,120
Zan, come down.

14
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,180
Come down for a bath.

15
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,290
-Hurry up.
-Come down, Zan.

16
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,310
Join them.

17
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,590
I'll go cook.

18
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,280
It's really not cold.

19
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,030
Really.

20
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,030
I plan to let them taste my cooking.

21
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,940
Don't try to steal the credit.

22
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,079
Just go.

23
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,040
Go.

24
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,190

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,910
-Yeah.
-Delicious.

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,700
♫Te Amo♫

34
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,030
Yellow bullhead.

35
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,950
I saved it for you.

36
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,230
Li, you lucky dog.

37
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,030
Song's cooking is so delicious.

38
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,630
After marrying her,

39
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,960
you might be chubby.

40
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,790
Your girlfriend might get jealous

41
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,270
if she hears what you just said.

42
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,350
I'm not complimenting other women in front of her.

43
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,870
You single guys know nothing, not at all.

44
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,520
Thank you.

45
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,570
Although the fish soup has a Chinese flavor,

46
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,190
it makes me homesick.

47
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,430
Yeah.

48
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,040
This damn ordeal is almost over.

49
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,520
I miss my home so much.

50
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,079
I should go find a wife.

51
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,060
Can't let Morgan keep showing off.

52
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,640
Is it good?

53
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,800
But it's not as good as the fish at home.

54
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,460
Then when we get home,

55
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,420
I'll cook it for you every day, okay?

56
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,440
Okay.

57
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,000
Ran.

58
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,000
I want to go home right now.

59
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,000
Me, too.

60
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,060
Wait here for me. I'll be right back.

61
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,560
Here.

62
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,610
I'll take Song to walk around.

63
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,190
Enjoy your meal.

64
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,270
How long will be your walk?

65
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,110
-20 minutes?
-One hour?

66
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,540
Tomorrow morning, maybe.

67
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,480
Where are you taking me?

68
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,610
What do you think?

69
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,140
We're eloping.

70
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,950
What's going on in that little head of yours?

71
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,900
We're almost there.

72
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,500
You'll know when we get there.

73
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,110
I had enough food and came out to use the bathroom.

74
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,560
Why did you follow me here?

75
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:51,950
I had enough food

76
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,120
and came out to use the bathroom, too.

77
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,370
You can't even tell a lie.

78
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,390
Look who's talking.

79
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,770
I just wanted to come out for some peace and quiet.

80
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,110
Why did you follow me here to argue with me?

81
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,160
I'm warning you. I can put you in confinement.

82
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,990
I saw that you were upset.

83
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,850
I was afraid you might jump into the river to kill yourself.

84
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,720
You think I'm like you?

85
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,670
Who's the one that wanted to jump into the river?

86
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,120
Am I that fragile?

87
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,400
I wasn't upset.

88
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,210
I just felt

89
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,140
I couldn't join

90
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,480
their tedious conversation.

91
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,360
I might as well think carefully

92
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,890
about where to go next to make money.

93
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,840
I've lost quite a bit this month.

94
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,830
You're refusing to admit what you really think.

95
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,800
What's this?

96
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,159
A letter of recommendation.

97
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,040
For me?

98
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,880
You want me to go to university?

99
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,670
At my age?

100
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,670
Are you kidding me?

101
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,570
Stop acting like you're very old.

102
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,669
There are many university students older than you.

103
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:37,870
Besides, you've made a lot of money

104
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,200
in the past couple of years.

105
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,320
With this letter of recommendation,

106
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,270
your chances of getting admitted are quite high.

107
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,820
Since you could study on your own,

108
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,600
why don't you go to university yourself?

109
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,760
I've forgotten the things I learned from books.

110
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,790
Are you trying to make me look like a fool?

111
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,910
It doesn't matter.

112
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,780
I'll help you review.

113
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,510
You're suddenly so nice to me.

114
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,410
Do you have an ulterior motive?

115
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,750
Of course I do.

116
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,110
I want to be your senior

117
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,640
so you'll know what it's like to be bullied.

118
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,480
Alright. You want me to try to get into university.

119
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,630
Then let's have a contest.

120
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,640
If you win, I'll try.

121
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:46,860
What contest?

122
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,510
Skipping stones.

123
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,770
Okay.

124
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,690
You go first.

125
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,540
Okay.

126
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,400
You're pretty good at skipping stones.

127
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,360
It seems I really have to go to university when the war ends.

128
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,080
Just my luck.

129
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,950
I'm going to bed.

130
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,090
I need to sleep to calm my nerves.

131
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,840
You're still refusing to admit what you really think.

132
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,800
Don't say that about me again.

133
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,680
Zan, Song.

134
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,760
Where did you go?

135
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,030
Why is your face so red?

136
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,710
And your hair is all wet.

137
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,690
You two...

138
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,000
Ben,

139
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,750
don't jump to conclusions.

140
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,460
We just...

141
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,890
Zan just got some water

142
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,470
for me to take a bath.

143
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,240
Song, Benjamin is bullying you.

144
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,880
When I become his senior,

145
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,190
I'll help you get even.

146
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,240
Senior?

147
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,780
What senior?

148
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,210
Sasin,

149
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,490
if you don't shut up now,

150
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,550
I won't let you join the battle in Cangdi.

151
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,030
Why are you so good at being unreasonable?

152
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,520
Ben,

153
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,300
if you bully Ran again,

154
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,360
I'll take the plan for Cangdi

155
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,450
back from you.

156
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,050
Zan is really something.

157
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,330
Learn from him.

158
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,080
You...

159
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,390
I what?

160
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,270
Why aren't you going to sleep?

161
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,360
You want to disturb them?

162
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,140
I'll make you run 10 kilometers tomorrow.

163
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,100
I'll seize the chance when I can still torment you.

164
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,130
Little senior.

165
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,330

193
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,030
I'm done.

194
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,390
♫White olive tree♫

♫We sing our oath to you♫

197
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,880
Are you worried about Benjamin and the others?

198

♫Let us plant a courage seed♫

199
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:12,300

After you're done, make sure to rest early.

203
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,630
Okay.

204
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,200

♫We touch the time of breeze♫

208
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,760
You'll have to sleep on your own from now on.

209
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,820
No more acting spoiled.

210
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:40,260

211
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:49,140
♫We'll meet under the white olive tree♫

212
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,780
Zhou,

213
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,350
do you have any news from the front in Cangdi?

214
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,640
Okay. Let me know if you hear anything.

215
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,920
Run!

216
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,170
The special force's attacking.

217
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,430
How did these guys find us?

218
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,960
He's with Zan.

219
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,250
Zan.

220
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,890
It's him again.

221
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,990
The enemy's coming! Run!

222
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,010
This is all because of this Zan.

223
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,420
I'll kill him!

224
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,130
Looks like the blasts have ended

225
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,670
and the special forces are in direct combat with those guys.

226
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,550
Zan.

227
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,859
Did you not go to Cangdi this time

228
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,579
because of me?

229
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,069
Will you regret it?

230
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,030
Ran.

231
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,750
I chose not to go

232
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,740
not just for you

233
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,590
but for us.

234
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,810
I...

235
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,770
don't want to take risks anymore.

236
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,570
And I don't want you to bear the consequences of taking risks anymore.

237
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,840
♫She is a white island♫

238
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,250
I told you.

00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:58,640
♫The colorful wind rushes past♫

240
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,750
I'm not that good.

241
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,310
I can be selfish

242
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,200
♫Lonely waves, starlit glow♫

243
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,660
and afraid, too.

244
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,830
♫Quietly leaning together♫

245
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,000
♫Autumn reflects in the water♫

246
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,340
But you don't need to worry.

247
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,590
♫He is a blue sailboat♫

248
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,540
I'm not a soldier.

249
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,520
Benjamin and the others are.

250
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,040
They're the key

251
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,450
to winning the battle in Cangdi.

252
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,210
♫Sailing alone♫

Whether I'm there or not

255
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,110
won't make much difference.

256
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,410
♫His sails dancing in the wind♫

257
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,000

♫A white island♫

♫Blooms in the vast sea♫

270
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,460
I just...

271
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,140
♫I wish I could pick it♫

272
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,450
don't want to be the reason

273
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,880
♫And give it to you♫

274
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,070
that makes you change your decisions

275
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,650
and stops you from doing what you want to do.

276
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,720
I hope you can

277
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,400
do whatever you want freely

278
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,640
and won't be held back by anyone or anything,

279
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,200
especially me.

280
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,350
Okay.

281
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,150
Then,

282
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,890
do something I want to do with me now.

283
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,200
Okay?

284
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,710
Okay.

285
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:03,940
These are...

286
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,240
Fireworks.

287
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,780
Where did you buy them?

288
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,680
Buy?

289
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,190
There are still fireworks for sale in Eastern Country?

290
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,310
You made them?

291
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,890
You can even make fireworks?

292
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,440
Do you think this requires a higher level of technical proficiency

293
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,710
than making bombs?

294
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,180
Zan, you're so good.

295
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,380
But Ran,

296
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,600
I want to use these fireworks today

297
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,000
to pray for the special forces,

298
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,070
for the battle in Cangdi,

299
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,350
and

300
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,630
for Eastern Country.

301
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,230
So, they may not be your exclusive benefit.

302
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:57,740
Sure.

303
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,580
I hope these fireworks

304
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,800
can clear away the disaster here.

305
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,630
I will pray hard.

00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,770
make a wish.

377
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,390
♫The wish we made♫

378
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,160
My wish is...

379
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:46,410
Happy New Year!

380
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,480
Happy New Year!

381
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,030
Dad, Happy New Year!

382
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,270
I will adopt you

383
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,650
when I get 18,

384
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,510
and I'll be your real dad.

385
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,600
My wish

386
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,270
is for every child here,

387
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,390
no, for all children in the world,

388
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,100
to have a happy home.

389
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,750
Happy New Year,

390
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,740
Ran.

391
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,020
Happy New Year,

392
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,920
Zan.

393
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,350
What a pity!

394
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,030
I can't wait for Sasin and Benjamin to come back.

395
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,790
If I miss today's flight,

396
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,780
I'll have to wait another week.

397
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,210
The children rescue organization asked me to report within three days.

398
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,240
I can only ask you

399
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,960
to congratulate them on their victory for me.

400
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
You must wait for them

401
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,150
to take off this red cloth.

402
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,910
You'll know the reason.

403
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,170
How can you

404
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,510
leave before Zan and me?

405
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,640
That's because the earliest flight back to China

406
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,680
is on the third day of the New Year.

407
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,800
The airlines should take the blame.

408
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,060
Besides,

409
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,210
you two are sweet together no matter where you are.

410
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,600
You're different from me, a single woman.

411
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,420
You didn't make a wish last night?

412
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,400
You didn't pray

413
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,440
to find your Mr. Right soon?

414
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,030
I'm not telling you.

415
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,650
Shen Bei, have a safe journey.

416
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,070
Thank you.

417
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:23,350
Ran.

418
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,300
Shen Bei.

419
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,170
Take good care of yourself.

420
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,560
Visit us when you come back to China.

421
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,480
Don't worry. No matter where I am,

422
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,590
if you two get married,

423
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,090
I definitely...

424
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:00,790
won't attend your wedding.

425
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,400
You're so mean.

426
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,730
Alright. I'm going to miss my flight.

427
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,310
Remember to take a photo for me when you take off the red cloth.

428
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,470
Bye.

429
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,030
Have a safe trip.

430
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:14,970
Goodbye.

431
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,310
Zan.

432
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,880
What wish did you make last night?

433
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,760
I didn't catch that.

434
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,820
To go home early.

435
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,770
Then your wish is going to be wasted.

436
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,330
We're going home soon anyway.

437
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,900
Yes.

438
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,470
Zan, make a wish.

439
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,980
My wish is...

440
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,130
to marry you.

441
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:42,900
Song.

442
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,570
Sasin.

443
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,440
We won.

444
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,890
Ark was shot on the spot.

445
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,150
We finally won.

446
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,290
Sasin, I'm so happy for you

447
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,900
and for Eastern Country.

448
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,390
You're amazing.

449
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,730
Ben, you're amazing, too.

450
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,100
You're both amazing.

451
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,000
Song,

452
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,210
is "amazing" the only word you know?

453
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,680
Your vocabulary is so limited.

454
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,600
Ben.

455
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,640
Amazing.

456
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,100
You're just trying to annoy me, aren't you?

457
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,920
What's all this noise?

458
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,160
Jose,

459
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,080
go get all the teachers out.

460
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,770
We're going to unveil the orphanage.

461
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:27,940
Hurry up.

462
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,100
Okay.

463
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:29,980
Okay. Okay.

464
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,730
Before Shen Bei left, she specifically asked us

465
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,380
to wait for you two

466
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,210
to take off the red cloth.

467
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,730
Ben, come and take off the cloth with me.

468
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,710
Is a piece of red cloth that heavy?

469
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,110
Can't you do it by yourself?

470
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,410
Besides, we should let Zan and Song

471
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,460
do this.

472
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,980
Why are we two men doing this?

473
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,340
Cut the crap. Hurry up.

474
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:12,990
Don't dawdle.

475
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,730
Look at me.

476
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,350
Take a photo.

477
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,670
Smile.

478
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,940
Three, two, one.

479
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,930
[Rena Orphanage]

480
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,050
Who is Rena?

481
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,310
I don't know her.

482
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,930
Rena is the one

483
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,510
who gave me this star.

484
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,010
His one is also from Rena.

485
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,780
We both could often win in battles

486
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,850
and stay alive,

487
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,250
all relies on these two stars.

488
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,550
So, with Rena protecting you here,

489
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,170
you'll definitely grow up safely.

490
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,330
Rena Orphanage?

491
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,590
Rena sounds good.

492
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,810
Rena must be

493
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,390
a pretty girl.

494
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,750
What?

495
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,490
I talked nonsense again?

496
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,270
No.

497
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:17,710
Thank you.

498
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,190
Luckily, you're here.

499
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:22,970
Otherwise,

500
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,000
I wouldn't know

501
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,790
how to explain it to the children...

502
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,710
Stop.

503
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,960
I'm really not used

504
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,970
to hearing words of gratitude like this.

505
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:33,770
Especially from this guy.

506
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,530
When he thanks me,

507
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,700
I always feel

508
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,890
he's up to something.

509
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,860
Zan,

510
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,910
why don't you show me around this orphanage?

511
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,930
Since it's called that,

512
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,510
I must take a good look around.

513
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,450
Okay.

514
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,330
The stickers on the wall

515
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,980
were all cut out by the children.

516
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,670
Alright. Everyone wash your face.

517
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,630
Go wash your hands.

518
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,610
Jose,

519
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,190
I'm taking the kids

520
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,510
to the government to register with the other teachers.

521
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,400
Sally has finished the registration.

522
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,320
So, you stay here to accompany her

523
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,409
and just take care of the home.

524
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,679
-Okay, don't worry about it.
-Okay.

525
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,170
Okay.

526
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,590
Let's sit down.

527
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,320
Song,

528
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,219
you and Zan are leaving the day after tomorrow?

529
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:47,110
What about you?

530
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,199
After the battle in Cangdi,

531
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,159
do you have any new missions?

532
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:55,139
I don't know yet.

533
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,710
But we can't stay here for long.

534
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,980
We have to go back soon

535
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,380
to search for those rioters

536
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,630
who escaped

537
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,660
from the battlefield.

538
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,720
They're desperate now.

539
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,990
So, we can't let them run away

540
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,770
and cause more trouble.

541
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,630
Then you must be careful

542
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,000
and stay safe.

543
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,230
Okay. Don't worry.

544
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,330
Song,

545
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,070
before you leave,

546
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,220
I don't know what else I can say

547
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,550
to express my feelings.

548
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,320
I can only say thank you.

549
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,680
I'll always remember

550
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,890
you and Zan,

551
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:41,860
especially you.

552
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,600
You're one of the two reasons

553
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,100
that made me decide to go back to university

554
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,110
after the war ends

555
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,720
and finish my journalism degree.

556
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,320
You made me feel

557
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,200
that reporting news

558
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,070
is a particularly meaningful thing to do.

559
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,840
Becoming a reporter like you

560
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,480
is my goal.

561
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,400
Sasin,

562
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,650
you'll definitely become a better reporter than I am.

563
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,820
I look forward to the day

564
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,120
when we can report the same piece of news

565
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,890
and compete

566
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,380
for the same journalism award.

567
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,380
We'll compete fairly and see who's better.

568
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,210
It's a deal.

569
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:36,600
So, what's the second reason

570
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,150
that made you decide

571
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,810
to resume your studies?

572
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:53,910
This is the dining hall.

573
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,700
The children eat here.

574
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,500
Put it anywhere.

575
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,500
Very well, this guy.

576
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,940
You specially prepared it for me?

577
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,690
Of course.

578
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,090
Here.

579
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,550
Ben.

580
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:23,390
The battle must have been fierce, right?

581
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,030
Zan.

582
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,530
I hate saying

583
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,400
things like "thank you."

584
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,670
But I must

585
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,930
say "thank you" to you.

586
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,580
You know, it's people like you and Song

587
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:50,170
who made me willing to fight

588
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,690
for a country that has nothing to do with me

589
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,460
without asking for money.

590
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,590
I-I'm an orphan.

591
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,140
I used to think

592
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,320
no one in this world would help me

593
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,690
or care about me.

594
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,570
I even thought

595
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,630
I didn't need

596
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,190
to take any responsibility for this world.

597
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,360
Good or bad, life or death,

598
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,700
it all depended on my own abilities.

599
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,090
But it was you,

600
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,220
Song,

601
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,360
Rena,

602
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,630
and Sasin

603
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,000
who made me feel

604
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,150
connected to this world again.

605
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,630
I don't know what others think of you,

606
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,620
but in my opinion,

607
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,510
you are all good people,

608
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,190
people I'll fight for with all my might.

609
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,940
You're like...

610
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,200
my family.

611
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,810
The more playful and indifferent you appear to be,

612
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,490
the more passionate and sincere you are inside.

613
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:37,970
Ben.

614
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,440
You're the most contradictory person

615
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,710
I've ever met.

616
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,280
Cheers.

617
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,520
I think someone

618
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,120
said something similar to me before.

619
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,980
I wish you and Song a safe journey tomorrow.

620
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,090
I still need to catch those who escaped,

621
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:14,530
so I won't be able to see you off.

622
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,990
I hope when you and Song get married,

623
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:22,450
I can go to China to attend your wedding

624
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,230
as your best man.

625
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:27,690
Okay.

626
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,180
It's a deal.

627
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:31,800
Bye.

628
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,470
Let's go.

629
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,960
♫Butterflies♫

630
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:05,460
♫Flying free♫

631
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,480
Are you planning

632
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,840
♫Tell the story♫

633
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,130
to make every orphan in Rena Orphanage

634
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,710
♫Dancing in the rain♫

635
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,540
a reporter

636
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,810
and your junior?

637
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,820
♫Butterflies♫

638
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:19,250
♫Hiding from the world♫

639
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,760
I'm talking about the TVs on the shelves.

640
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:22,960
♫Never feel alone♫

641
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:26,130
♫Never let her go♫

642
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,180
You think all children

643
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,030
think the same way as you did when you were young?

644
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,380
I just think spending more time watching TV

645
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,360
isn't necessarily a bad thing.

646
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,830
It won't make someone

647
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,890
lag behind their peers when they grow up.

648
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,230
You all say that I don't say

649
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,270
what I mean.

650
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,710
It seems I'm not the only one

651
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,180
with this problem.
