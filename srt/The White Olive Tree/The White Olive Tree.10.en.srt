[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

4
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,050
Who told you I was looking for them?

5
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,039
Mind your own business.

6
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,870
You're so ungrateful.

7
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:01,230
Is it still for that stupid star?

8
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,200
It's not a stupid star!

9
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,860
Fine.

10
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,400
I'll get it back for you.

11
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Happy now?

12
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,710
What?

13
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,310
How...

14
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,000
How are you going to get it back for me?

15
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,870
I know that little boy.

16
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,190
I know where he lives.

17
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,120
I'll swallow my pride and get it back for you.

18
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,030
Why are you staring at me?

19
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,040
You don't believe me?

20
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,560
I don't want to see you with a sour face

21
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,750
every time we meet,

22
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,770
like I owe you a fortune.

23
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,310
Then...

24
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,430
Then I...

25
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,030
Then...

26
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,520
Then you still don't know me.

27
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,990
Seeing you angry, I...

28
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,150
I...

29
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,650
I feel happy.

30
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:14,870
You...

31
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,720
So I won't get it back for you.

32
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,240
That way leads to the bathroom.

33
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,010
Didn't you just go there?

34
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,210
Hey, lady,

35
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,380
this is your room key.

36
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,600
And a kiss for thanks.

37
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,100
What a rogue.

38
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,350
If Dr. Pei fancies you,

39
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,730
she must be blind.

40
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:14,870
Don't worry.

41
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,950
I have good eyesight.

42
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,870
Please, sit.

43
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,830
I've ordered a drink for you.

44
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,390
You're not planning

45
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:50,930
to get me drunk, are you?

46
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,360
Is your tolerance so low?

47
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,040
Do you get drunk so easily?

48
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,950
I'm very curious about

49
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,740
what you would do

50
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,680
after getting me drunk.

51
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,490
You wouldn't have already booked a room

52
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,920
in some hotel, would you?

53
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,510
Dr. Pei,

54
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,020
you...

55
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,630
What?

56
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,260
You don't understand?

57
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,240
Then I'll be frank.

58
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,960
I'm not some naive young girl,

59
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,750
nor am I the kind of woman

60
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,830
who would leave with you

61
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,680
after you

62
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,830
jingle your keys!

63
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,560
Dr. Pei,

64
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,120
I really don't understand…

65
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,920
You still don't understand,

66
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,560
do you?

67
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,720
Then let me sober you up!

68
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,970
Dr. Pei…

69
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,040
Brat,

70
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,070
what are you laughing at?

71
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:08,750
Sir,

72
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,650
that young lady told me you didn't finish the glass of wine just now.

73
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,190
She said she would let you have another one

74
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,460
as a way to thank you for returning the keys.

75
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,250
Being a good Samaritan is hard.

76
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,060
You don't still want that stupid star, do you?

77
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,640
Shut up.

78
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,630
That's not a stupid star.

79
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,260
Rina gave it to me.

80
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,360
What are you doing?

81
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,830
What am I doing?

82
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,670
After what happened to me tonight,

83
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,380
only the story of your stupid…

84
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,630
the story

85
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
of your cute

86
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,750
little star

87
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,159
can make it up to me.

88
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,000
You're crazy.

89
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,830
There's a custom in Eastern Country.

90
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,040
At the coming-of-age ceremony at 18,

91
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,190
mothers give their children a small gift.

92
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,610
This gift, carried with them,

93
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,700
is believed to bring safety.

94
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,870
I don't believe in it,

95
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,690
but...

96
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,570
but if I didn't carry it with me,

97
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,400
Rina would keep nagging,

98
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,570
so I...

99
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,140
So I

100
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,250
really made a mistake.

101
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,200
Can I…

102
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,200
make a drink?

103
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,120
Okay.

104
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,690
Thank you.

105
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,480
I can't get you a new star.

106
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,720
Consider the stars here

107
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,960
as compensation for you.

108
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,270
There are no stars in it.

109
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,060
This special cocktail is called

110
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:43,850
"Starry Sky."

111
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,790
You're so sincere, aren't you?

112
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,840
You call this compensation?

113
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,600
Doesn't it count?

114
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,460
Does it count now?

115
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,230
What do you think?

116
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,690
Impressed by my magic?

117
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,150
Adding some glitter to a drink

118
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,430
is your magic?

119
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,680
Is this some kind of mercenary-exclusive magic?

120
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,080
It's my secret trick for dates.

121
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,340
How does a young boy like you know about it?

122
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,440
Your secret trick

123
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,640
is known to all freshmen

124
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,410
at the freshman ball.

125
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,110
I knew it.

126
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,420
Being a good Samaritan is hard.

127
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,280
The trick might not be great,

128
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,290
♫Butterflies♫

129
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,390
but the drink is good.

130
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,790
♫Flying free♫

131
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,240
I won't waste it.

132
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,170
♫Tell the story♫

133
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,040
♫Dancing in the rain♫

135
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,870
You're young,

♫Hiding from the world♫

137
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,280

♫Never feel alone♫

139
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,600
I'll drink with you.

♫Never let her go♫

141
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,910
-What are you doing tomo…
-What are you doing tomo…

142
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,840
No matter what you do tomorrow,

143
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,270
I just hope

144
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,150
you don't run into

145
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,840
a situation like that morning again.

146
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,630
Oh, right,

147
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,750
I asked around.

148
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,400
They don't sell that kind of red string in Eastern Country.

149
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,730
I'll have to buy it for you when I get back home.

150
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,320
No rush.

151
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,310
I want to puke.

152
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,680
Let's keep drinking.

153
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,790
Li Zan,

154
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,720
thanks.

155
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,390
Li Zan?

156
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,720
Weren't you always calling me Zan before?

157
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,750
You've been in Eastern Country

158
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,320
for quite a while now, haven't you?

159
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,800
When are you planning to go back?

160
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,850
I'll be staying a bit longer.

161
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,870
One of our reporters got injured.

162
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,200
I applied to stay temporarily

163
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,670
to take over his work.

164
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,030
Temporarily?

165
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,780
How long is that?

166
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,310
How long do you hope it is?

167
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,510
I hope

168
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,630
as long as you're safe,

169
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,390
you can stay as long as possible.

170
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,410
Then…

171
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,960
Then I'll head back now.

172
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,840
Be careful

173
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,750
on your way back.

174
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,150
Okay.

175
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,550
I'm off.

176
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,510
Bye-bye.

177
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,640
Stay safe.

178
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,080
Got it.

179
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,440
Song Ran.

180
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,000
Ms. Shen?

181
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,790
What are you doing here?

182
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,030
I'm here for interviews, of course.

183
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,040
You should head back home.

184
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:24,870
Did you lose track of time?

185
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,240
Isn't it still a few days away?

186
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,460
I came early to get familiar with the environment

187
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,220
and also to check on our injured colleague

188
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,130
on behalf of the station.

189
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,480
Is something wrong with that?

190
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,080
No.

191
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,670
Of course not.

192
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,540
I'm just…

193
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:48,960
surprised.

194
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,370
In Happo, you need to prepare a lot of clothes.

195
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,980
Even though it's hot during the day,

196
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,010
you should still wear a jacket

197
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,300
because the air here is very dry.

198
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:06,240
If you dress lightly,

199
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,160
you'll get dehydrated easily.

200
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,619
And your pants—

201
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,550
make sure they're loose-fitting,

202
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
or by noon,

203
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,440
you won't be able to handle it.

204
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,960
I guess you already know it.

205
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,069
Li Zan

206
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,160
isn't my boyfriend.

207
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,030
But that doesn't mean

208
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,600
he won't be in the future.

209
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,590
In the past,

210
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,990
it was because there was a whole country between us

211
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,550
that we didn't know each other well.

212
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,400
You came here first

213
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,570
and got the upper hand,

214
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,070
but I'm here now.

215
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,710
It's common for the latecomer to take the lead.

216
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,550
I've never lost to anyone since I was a child.

217
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,200
This time…

218
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,840
there's no way I'll lose to you.

219
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,810
Ms. Shen.

220
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,710
You just got here and are already thinking about winning and losing.

221
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,310
Isn't that exhausting?

222
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,750
Get some rest.

223
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,240
We have work tomorrow.

224
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,240
Song Ran

225
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,510
has really changed.

226
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,940
Looks like this place does help people grow.

227
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,030
I should've come earlier.

228
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,860
Our mission today

229
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,270
is to clear a newly discovered minefield.

230
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,950
This minefield...

231
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,790
I won't lose.

232
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,310
I definitely won't.

233
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:14,690
Just wait and see.

234
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,170
Song.

235
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,680
Sasin.

236
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,720
I drank a bit too much last night.

237
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:48,720
Sorry.

238
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,860
I didn't walk you back.

239
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,260
It's fine.

240
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,100
Instructor Li sent me back.

241
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,490
Song.

242
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,910
I think he likes you.

243
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,240
Why do you say that?

244
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,690
Song,

245
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,510
I see you can always make him laugh,

246
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,640
and you get him to laugh nonstop.

247
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,730
You're not exactly a funny girl.

248
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,000
Sorry.

249
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,630
You're a good girl,

250
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,410
but you and the word "funny"

251
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,570
are as far apart

252
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,620
as Uglai and Happo.

253
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,110
Don't talk nonsense.

254
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,790
I can see

255
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,720
you're a bit different from usual today.

256
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,160
Did something interesting happen

257
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,200
after I left?

258
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,240
Didn't I just say?

259
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,340
I drank too much.

260
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,090
What interesting thing could have happened?

261
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,000
By the way,

262
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,930
what are you planning to do today?

263
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,400
I plan to visit the kids at the orphanage.

264
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,030
Since you're here,

265
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,590
come with me to pick up some things for them.

266
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:04,850
Okay.

267
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,640
Zan.

268
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,360
How was last night?

269
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,650
I saw Ms. Song when I left.

270
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,400
Seems like there's a story there.

271
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,440
Tell me.

272
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:23,920
Come on, tell me.

273
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,240
Don't you have something else to do?

274
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,890
Well,

275
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,980
have you prepared the gift

276
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,640
for Jiang Yu?

277
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,080
Of course.

278
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,160
Let me tell you,

279
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,110
this time...

280
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,080
Never mind.

281
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,750
I'll just show you.

282
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,670
Give me some advice.

283
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,830
Look.

284
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,070
What do you think?

285
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,210
A Burdick jacket?

286
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,690
Nice.

287
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,400
And it's signed.

288
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:01,980
You like Burdick too?

289
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,750
You've got taste.

290
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,480
I wonder if Jiang Yu will like it.

291
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,100
He should like it, right?

292
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,820
Who wouldn't like Burdick?

293
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,440
But that kid is always a little weird.

294
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,200
If he doesn't like it,

295
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,000
he might even

296
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,880
dig up old grievances and settle them with me too.

297
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,000
He'll probably say I don't care about him,

298
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,070
that I'm brushing him off,

299
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,270
and that I'm not paying attention to what he wants.

300
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,880
Don't worry.

301
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,590
He'll like it.

302
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,100
How do you know?

303
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,510
You've never met him.

304
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,680
The gift itself isn't what matters.

305
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,440
What matters is that

306
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,240
you care enough to give him a gift.

307
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:49,720
Trust me.

308
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,030
He'll definitely like it.

309
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,000
Of all the people I know,

310
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,400
you're the best with words.

311
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,080
No wonder Ms. Song is...

312
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:03,960
Benjamin is coming.

313
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,750
If you don't want him

314
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,440
to take that jacket,

315
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,830
you better hide it now.

316
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,070
Benjamin.

317
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,270
You actually came back to sleep last night.

318
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,400
Looks like Dr. Pei isn't interested in you.

319
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,310
Not just uninterested.

320
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:20,960
But

321
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,310
it's only fueled my determination.

322
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,140
Trust me.

323
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,070
I'll win her over

324
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,790
in 10 days.

325
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,500
You're like a machine,

326
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,680
chasing a girl like it's a battle

327
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,200
and even setting a deadline to it.

328
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:34,910
Of course.

329
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,790
I cherish every second of my life.

330
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,310
Zan,

331
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,600
what time did you get back last night?

332
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,510
At a normal time.

333
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,030
I saw you chatting with Ms. Song last night.

334
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,030
If you had just kissed her,

335
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,070
she would've surrendered to you.

336
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,590
By evening, the two of them might've naturally

337
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,790
taken things to the next level.

338
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:09,680
My leg's numb.

339
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,240
Zan is polite,

340
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,190
but don't think you can mess with him.

341
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,880
If you were as bold and precise with Ms. Song,

342
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,200
you would've won her over by now.

343
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,070
Instructor Li,

344
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,890
a female reporter at the gate wants to see you.

345
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,400
Zan,

346
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,590
Ms. Song is braver than you.

347
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,960
I like that.

348
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,110
Hold this

349
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,350
for me.

350
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,980
What's in your hand?

351
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,590
Li Zan,

352
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,980
long time no see.

353
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,440
Hello,

354
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,260
Ms. Shen.

355
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,790
You don't look

356
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,110
surprised at all.

357
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,280
It is a bit surprising

358
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,880
to see you here.

359
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,280
You knew it was me.

360
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,380
You just saw my back.

361
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,030
Wouldn't you mistake me for Song Ran?

362
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,070
No.

363
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,550
You and she look different from behind.

364
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,750
You're so familiar with her now.

365
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,310
Ms. Shen,

366
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,030
welcome to Eastern Country.

367
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,720
Is there something

368
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,570
I can do for you?

369
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,500
I'm just here to say hello.

370
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,200
Song Ran's work term in Eastern Country

371
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,110
is up.

372
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,820
She'll be heading back in a few days.

373
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,730
The station sent me to take over her work.

374
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,480
I'm afraid I'll need your guidance

375
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,960
in the future.

376
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,510
Zan.

377
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,640
The team's all set and ready.

378
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,020
We're waiting for you to start the training.

379
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,030
Alright.

380
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,680
Sorry.

381
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,510
I have to go,

382
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,160
Ms. Shen.

383
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,190
You're quite popular.

384
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,300
There are always girls coming to see you.

385
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,160
Who was that?

386
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,390
A colleague of Song Ran's.

387
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,830
Chinese female reporters are all pretty.

388
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,680
But I still prefer Ms. Song.

389
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,070
I choose Ms. Song.

390
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,720
[Happo, Orphanage]

391
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,510
Song,

392
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,270
I thought you were trying to look cool earlier,

393
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,160
but you're actually so good at riding a motorcycle.

394
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,380
Carrying me and all this stuff,

395
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,790
you still rode so steadily.

396
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,640
When I first came to Eastern Country,

397
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,700
I was nothing like this.

398
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,470
I practiced it on purpose.

399
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,110
I was worried about

400
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,440
being left behind again

401
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,500
or stepping on a landmine...

402
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,080
Stop.

403
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:36,720
Don't jinx it.

404
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:38,790
It's fine.

405
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,440
Zan will protect me.

406
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,510
What?

407
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,460
Nothing.

408
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,540
I'm a journalist.

409
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,920
I just want to interview you.

410
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,820
The interview will be watched by people all around the world,

411
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,640
and it could really benefit you.

412
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,830
Ms. Shen?

413
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,920
Oh, it's nice to see you.

414
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,270
Song and Sasin.

415
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:03,960
Hey, kids.

416
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,920
Come here, come.

417
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,110
Ms. Shen,

418
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,750
are you here for an interview?

419
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,480
Let me introduce you.

420
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,350
That's the local reporter, Sasin.

421
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,000
He's also my good friend.

422
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,000
Sasin,

423
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,110
she's a reporter from my station.

424
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:31,880
Her name is Shen Bei.

425
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,350
She's also my team leader.

426
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,390
Thank you.

427
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
You're smart.

428
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,160
I should have known

429
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,310
I'd be refused if I came empty-handed.

430
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,980
Look at this. It's so cute.

431
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,430
You misunderstood.

432
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:53,750
Hello,

433
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,160
Lea.

434
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,070
I apologize.

435
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,070
I didn't think it through just now.

436
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,240
Please accept this

437
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,030
as a token of my appreciation.

438
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,970
It might not be of much help.

439
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,270
But once the interview is broadcast,

440
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,680
you'll definitely receive

441
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,250
more attention and assistance.

442
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,460
Excuse me.

443
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,110
Everyone, follow me.

444
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,810
Follow me.

445
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,350
Follow me.

446
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,040
Song,

447
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,200
I don't like that colleague of yours.

448
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,720
You know me.

449
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:34,990
I'm leaving.

450
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,920
I'll leave the motorcycle to you.

451
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,270
Ms. Shen,

452
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,830
you don't understand the people here.

453
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,110
Whether or not they agree to an interview

454
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,920
completely depends on their mood.

455
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,960
It's not about money.

456
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,270
And in Eastern Country,

457
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,920
money isn't of much use.

458
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,070
There's a shortage of resources here.

459
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,160
Many things can't be bought with money.

460
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,960
The things we brought here

461
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,440
were all donated.

462
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,070
By being so direct,

463
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,000
you'd hurt their feelings.

464
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,960
They'd become more resistant.

465
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,240
Wait for me.

466
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,110
I like it.

467
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,420
Good girl.

468
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,030
Hi, Lea.

469
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,480
That is my colleague.

470
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,310
She wants to do an interview and ask you some questions.

471
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,160
Okay. I trust you,

472
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,590
but she can't take photos.

473
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,720
Okay.

474
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,720
I just explained to the head of the orphanage.

475
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,550
She said you can go in,

476
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,440
but no cameras.

477
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,440
That's fine.

478
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,160
If there's anything you want to photograph,

479
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,070
you can tell me.

480
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,750
They're more familiar with me.

481
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,760
It should be okay if I take the photos.

482
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,470
Song Ran, are you showing off?

483
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,240
Are you showing off how well you fit in here,

484
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,830
or hinting that I shouldn't compete with you?

485
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,290
Are you suggesting that whether it's the interview in Eastern Country

486
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,160
or Li Zan,

487
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,590
I can't win against you?

488
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,920
When did I say I needed your help?

489
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,870
Do you think I can't

490
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,590
do this interview without you?

491
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,110
Enough, Ms. Shen.

492
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,310
You might see this place as a workplace

493
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,880
or a love battlefield.

494
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,200
That's your business.

495
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,510
But to me,

496
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,680
this is a war zone.

497
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,040
I don't want to compete with you here for Li Zan

498
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,380
or for interviews

499
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,310
because it's not appropriate.

500
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
If you want to compete,

501
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,320
fine,

502
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,400
back home,

503
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,590
I'll be ready anytime.

504
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,160
And you're not guaranteed to win.

505
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,460
I was provoked by her.

506
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,920
I lost my composure.

507
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,400
Does this mean I've admitted defeat?

508
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,030
Of course, it's not easy for the latecomer to take the lead,

509
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,660
but I'm the kind of person

510
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,520
who loves challenges.

Fei.

517
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,070
Song Ran,

518
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,580
I'm going to the camp for an interview today.

519
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,030
I just talked to Shen Bei.

520
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,880
She said she's been very busy recently

521
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,889
and asked me to team up with you.

522
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,960
You want me to go with you?

523
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:30,800
Yes.

524
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,760
Alright.

525
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,280
Then let's meet at the camp entrance later.

526
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,830
Okay, see you later.

527
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,480
Rina.

528
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,800
Benjamin?

529
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,550
Thanks.

530
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,360
Rina,

531
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,070
how did you end up like this?

532
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,320
Coming to Happo with two kids by yourself

533
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,210
is so dangerous.

534
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,330
Did someone bully you again?

535
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:43,840
No.

536
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,190
I came willingly.

537
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,400
No one bullied me.

538
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,370
I'm a volunteer now.

539
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,810
How could anyone bully me?

540
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,570
Being a volunteer

541
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,120
doesn't mean you have to do such a dangerous thing.

542
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,000
It's not that dangerous.

543
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,600
It's just that some road signs were destroyed,

544
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,800
and I got a bit lost

545
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,220
and took a mountain path,

546
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,480
but I still made it to Happo in the end.

547
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,400
Didn't you say

548
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,400
there's nothing I can't do?

549
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,550
Rina.

550
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,150
Your head...

551
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,550
I'm fine.

552
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,280
It doesn't hurt.

553
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:29,480
Get in the car.

554
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,150
I'll take you to the hospital

555
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,870
to get it treated.

556
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:32,800
No need.

557
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:33,850
It's on the way.

558
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,420
Get it treated.

559
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,440
Otherwise…

560
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,480
Sasin would blame me again

561
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,600
when he sees it.

562
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,360
Do you see Sasin often?

563
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,510
How has he been lately?

564
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,150
Has he gained weight or lost weight?

565
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,480
Don't worry.

566
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,550
He's fine.

567
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:14,960
Everything is fine.

568
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,360
Isn't he protected by the little star

569
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,150
you gave him?

570
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,030
The little star...

571
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,720
He's wearing it.

572
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,060
Does he wear it every day?

573
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,880
He always wears it.

574
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:36,990
[Happo Hospital]

575
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,960
The wound isn't deep.

576
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,430
Just make sure to keep it dry.

577
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,280
Oh, okay.

578
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,030
Thank you, Doctor.

579
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,550
Did you come alone?

580
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,330
Is there any family with you?

581
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,190
If so, they can go get the medicine for you.

582
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,550
No need.

583
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,840
I'll get it myself.

584
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,150
Then wait a moment. I'll give you the prescription.

585
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,440
Where has Benjamin

586
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,140
wandered off to?

587
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,380
Rina, right?

588
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,030
I'm heading to the pharmacy anyway.

589
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,100
I'll get your medicine for you.

590
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,750
Just wait here for me for a moment.

591
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,990
Hey, soldier.

592
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:38,960
I'm sorry.

593
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,400
Sasin came to find me the next morning

594
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,110
and explained what happened that night.

595
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,550
That boy really is meddlesome.

596
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,680
He didn't leave me the chance to clear up the misunderstanding.

597
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,650
I don't think you'd come to me to clear up the misunderstanding.

598
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,160
Otherwise,

599
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,690
you wouldn't have left Rina alone

600
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,680
in the examination room.

601
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,440
This is Rina's medicine.

602
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,110
Her wound has been treated.

603
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,320
I'll go call her out.

604
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,190
Dr. Pei.

605
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,780
Since the misunderstanding has been cleared up,

606
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,280
can I buy you a couple of drinks?

607
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,230
Are you here to be a soldier

608
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,910
or to drink?

609
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,260
Before meeting you,

610
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,440
I was here to be a soldier,

611
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,570
but after meeting you,

612
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,800
I think having a couple of drinks is fine too.

613
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,900
Today,

614
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,740
I should get off work early.

615
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,570
I may go to Dreaming Bar to unwind.

616
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,070
If someone's willing to pay for the drinks,

617
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,710
I wouldn't mind.

618
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,160
Sir, I'm looking for Instructor Li.

619
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,670
You and she look different from behind.

620
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,110
Here.

621
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,880
I think he likes you.

622
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,410
You can always make him laugh,

623
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,690
and you get him to laugh nonstop.

624
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,310
Song Ran.

625
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,810
Ms. Song.

626
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,360
Zan, you're here too.

627
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,400
Ms. Song.

628
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,110
Guess who I just ran into on the street?

629
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:28,880
Who?

630
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:30,590
Rina.

631
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:31,640
Rina?

632
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,510
What is she doing here?

633
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,290
She was taking two kids to the orphanage.

634
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,590
I think their names are

635
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,960
Sia and Zo...

636
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,000
Sia and Zoro?

637
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,060
From Uglai to Happo,

638
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,760
it was such a dangerous journey.

639
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,170
Rina's really tough.

640
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,250
Sasin takes after Rina in that regard.

641
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,590
Fei.

642
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,190
Rina

643
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,400
is Sasin's mother.

644
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,400
Those two kids

645
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,150
are the ones in the photo called "Carry."

646
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,440
I want to check on them

647
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,070
and find out why they've become orphans.

648
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,440
So...

649
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:13,920
Okay.

650
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,400
No problem.

651
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,190
Go ahead.

652
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,680
Today's interview isn't complicated.

653
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,360
I can handle it.

654
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,230
Go,

655
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:23,760
Ms. Song.

656
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,630
We'll take good care

657
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,150
of your colleague.

658
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,510
Thanks.

659
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,070
Be careful.

660
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:33,760
Thanks,

661
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,230
Benjamin.

662
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,870
Why have they become orphans?

663
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,290
It's just fate.
