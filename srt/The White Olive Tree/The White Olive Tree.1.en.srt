Counting today,

8
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,030
I've been here in Uglai City

9
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,590
for three months now.

10
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,400
In the past three months,

11
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,560
I gradually felt

12
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,680
the unique temperament of this city.

13
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,840
It's ancient,

14
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:05,950
mysterious,

15
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,790
pure,

16
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,680
and beautiful.

17
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,710
Such a city

18
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:11,940
fascinates me.

19
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,590
I want to be part of it.

20
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,140
Before I knew it,

21
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,710
today

22
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,140
is my last day in Uglai.

and concerns for this place

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,120
did not end with the arrival of the return date.

27
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,870
Thank you, Luke.

28
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,280
I hope my fate with this place

29
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,120

34
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,160

Song.

39
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,430
Am I interrupting you?

40
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,360
No.

41
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,290
Chatting with you in Chinese is

42
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,290
the most relaxing part of my day.

43
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,360
But you came earlier than usual.

44
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,520
Your coffee

45
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,240
and your breakfast.

46
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,000
Thank you.

47
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,460
No need.

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,840

send him a photo.

00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,910
That sounds like an explosion.

Is there a problem?

No.

Let's start.

00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,560
I'm Song Ran.

There have just been multiple explosions

112
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,620
in Uglai City, where I'm at right now.

113
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,680
Currently, we can clearly see

114
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,430
the cars burning on the street

115
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,240
and the destroyed houses.

116
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,750
A primary school is at the far end of the street.

117
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,340
Luckily, the school holiday started two days ago.

118
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,990
But at the moment,

119
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,950
I haven't seen any military officers

120
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,570
or medical staff at the scene.

121
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,290
The people on the street

122
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,260
are in chaos and panic.

123
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,160
Ms. Shen.

124
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,310
Do you hear that?

125
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,000
Do you hear the siren?

126
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,380
Thank goodness.

127
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,370
The government has reacted.

128
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,360
This means this ancient city

129
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,830
is still running normally.

00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,070
I hope the situation can be controlled as soon as possible.

Everyone did a good job.

Especially Song Ran.

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,150
She was calm and composed.

Director,

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,480
this is the basic professional quality of a reporter.

145
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,960
It's not praise-worthy.

00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,030
Keep it up.

00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,270
Ms. Shen.

148
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,550
Don't be so modest.

149
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,400
Isn't that worthy of praise?

00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,230
How many people can be like Song Ran?

151
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,910
Really?

152
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,230
If it were you,

153
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,960
wouldn't you be able to do it?

154
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,270
If you can't,

155
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,140
you can consider changing your job.

156
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,360
Was...

157
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,090
Was Ms. Shen being serious?

158
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,000
Of course.

159
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,870
When have you seen

160
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,080
Ms. Shen pretend to be modest?

161
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,840
If she says it's a basic quality,

162
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,090
then it is one.

163
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,150
There's nothing to be proud of.

164
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,480
You're just bragging.

165
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,440
I cannot comment on Ms. Shen,

166
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,550
but I doubt

167
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,470
you have that basic quality.

168
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,710
Don't move. Stay down.

169
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,620
Don't move.

170
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,000
What are you doing here?

171
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,110
You got accomplices?

172
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,640
You two go over there and check

173
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,200
to see if there are any suspicious situations.

174
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,460
Stop!

175
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,180
Hey!

176
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,320
Stop!

177
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,510
Stop!

178
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,550
Stop!

179
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,420
Stop!

180
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,000
Stop!

181
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,070
Don't move!

182
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:08,910
Zan!

183
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,510
It's okay.

184
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,270
Don't move.

185
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,620
Help me.

186
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,510
Help.

187
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,360
Help me.

188
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:45,890
You're Chinese?

189
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,740
Yes.

190
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,630
A reporter?

191
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,550
Yes.

192
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,390
Did I

193
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,390
step on a mine?

194
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,150
Yes.

195
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,750
Right on target, too.

196
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,610
But it's unlucky today.

197
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,150
It met me.

198
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,110
Are you joking with me?

199
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,190
I'm not joking.

200
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,690
Don't worry.

201
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,680
I won't let it blow you up.

202
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,120
Really?

203
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm right next to you.

204
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,200
Does lying to you benefit me?

205
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,920
Balance your weight on your right foot.

206
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,150
Hang in there.

207
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,040
If you move again,

208
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,910
I'll become a martyr.

209
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,630
Does this...

210
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,480
Does this mean there are eight minutes left?

211
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,400
You must have watched a lot of movies.

212
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,220
Then what is this?

213
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,120
I can stop and explain to you for three minutes.

214
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,360
Do you need it?

215
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,000
No.

216
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,150
No need.

217
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,510
Look at me.

218
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,120
Don't look at it.

219
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,830
Okay.

220
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:59,910
♫Stepping on my heart alone♫

221
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,870
Captain.

222
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:09,740
♫You're triggering a bomb unknown♫

223
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,120
The captured insurgent has confessed.

224
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,440
There are a total of five landmines buried in this area,

225
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,270
intended to destroy our reinforcement trucks.

226
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,270
One mother mine

227
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,910
and four secondary mines connected in series.

228
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:21,330
♫The sun of life reflects♫

229
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,030
Each mine contains approximately 400 grams of explosives

230
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,630
Zan!

231
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:29,920
♫Stay where you are, don't move♫

232
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,750
You lied to me.

233
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,040
♫Exploding into pieces♫

234
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,270
I can't believe I was fooled.

235
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:49,800
♫We fall, we're falling slow♫

236
00:15:53,080 --> 00:16:00,860
♫We fall, we're falling slow♫

237
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,960
You're a good person.

238
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,030
Run while you can.

239
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,720
I don't want to drag you with me.

240
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,750
Don't be afraid.

241
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,740
I won't leave you.

242
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,270
How fast can you run?

243
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,320
Huh?

244
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,670
In five seconds,

245
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,160
how far can you run?

246
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,120
I can buy you five seconds

247
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,320
so that your foot

248
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
won't detonate the mines right away.

249
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,150
So, in five seconds,

250
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,450
how far can you run?

251
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,280
I don't know.

252
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,710
Ten meters?

253
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
Twenty meters?

254
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,080
I don't know.

255
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,590
I've never run like this.

256
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,190
Try it today.

257
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,200
Okay.

258
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,750
Ready.

259
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,400
Three.

260
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,880
Two.

261
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,510
One.

262
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:26,609
Run!

263
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,540
Zan!

264
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,400
You'll feel a little dizzy.

265
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,200
It's okay.

266
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,350
There's no rush.

267
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,920
Stand up slowly.

268
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,200
Zan!

269
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,750
Take your time.

270
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,420
Are you okay?

271
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:42,870
I'm fine.

272
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,110
Are you okay too?

273
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,640
Do you want to check?

274
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,270
What's wrong with you?

275
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,470
You're a volunteer.

276
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,110
Why did you step forward so quickly?

277
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,350
We soldiers should do this first.

278
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,700
Don't rush forward

279
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,590
without my order in the future.

280
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,550
Do you hear me?

281
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,200
Got it.

282
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,790
Hey!

283
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,030
Don't get close.

284
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,160
Morgan.

285
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,440
Stay away from there.

286
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,280
You're a reporter from China?

287
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,090
Are you also Chinese?

288
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,720
I'm from Eastern Country.

289
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,640
But my race is Chinese.

290
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,200
Then he is...

291
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,440
He is our demining volunteer,

292
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,160
Zan.

293
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,050
Zan.

294
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,400
Oh,

295
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,310
I'm a Chinese reporter.

296
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,680
My name is Song Ran.

297
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,700
I visited China when I was young.

298
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,520
I loved that place.

299
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,510
Thank you for saving me.

300
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,850
Can I take a photo of you?

301
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,070
Sure.

302
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,440
Three.

303
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,270
Two.

304
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,440
One.

305
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,240
Let me see.

306
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,350
Is Gamma that way?

307
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,090
You're going to Gamma?

308
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,440
Yes.

309
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,720
I'm taking the flight back home today.

310
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,750
What time is your flight?

311
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,270
Three in the afternoon.

312
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,310
Three in the afternoon?

313
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,880
But now all transportation has come to a halt.

314
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,050
You won't make it in time.

315
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
What should I do?

316
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,720
Why don't you

317
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,830
wait till we round up these goons?

318
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,720
The traffic will resume after that.

319
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,510
But...

320
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,160
Jiang Lin.

321
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,770
Stop teasing her.

322
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,960
Did you bring your passport?

323
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:00,920
Yes.

324
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,750
The industrial park in the western suburbs has an evacuation site.

325
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,750
A group of Chinese are evacuating today.

326
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,330
I'll send you there later.

327
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,590
Okay.

328
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,480
Have a safe trip.

329
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,110
Aren't you guys coming too?

330
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,640
We're taking that car.

331
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,830
These familiar sounds again.

332
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,310
How nice.

333
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,480
What date is it already?

334
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,880
It's the end of June.

335
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,350
You already got your graduation certificate,

336
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,680
but you haven't found a job yet?

337
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,440
Isn't the company your Aunt Chen recommended

338
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,510
quite good?

339
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,920
It's only 2,500 yuan a month.

340
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,960
I won't do it.

341
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,920
You're too arrogant.

342
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,450
Your sister went to a prestigious university.

343
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,880
But she's not as delicate as you.

344
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,160
You share the same father.

345
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,920
Why don't you learn from her?

346
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,440
Maybe it's because

347
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,680
we have different mothers.

348
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,720
Hey, you...

349
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,830
Hey, Ran.

350
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,790
You're back.

351
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,680
Aunt Yang.

352
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,240
Ran.

353
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,070
My mom is abusing me again.

354
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,770
Song Yang, come here!

355
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,930
Look at you.

356
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,750
Don't expose your family shame.

357
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,470
You made a fool of yourself in front of Ran again.

358
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,080
You're the nonsensical one here.

359
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,030
Ran is not an outsider.

360
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,030
It doesn't matter.

361
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,510
Am I right, Ran?

362
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,060
Ran.

363
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,360
Sit down and take a rest.

364
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,670
The meal will be ready soon.

365
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,640
I'll get you some water.

366
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,070
After my parents divorced,

367
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,270
Aunt Yang married my dad.

368
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,440
Although she's my stepmother,

369
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,760
she's always nice to me.

370
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,640
She doesn't scold or beat me.

371
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,550
But there's always

372
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,190
-Thank you.
-an invisible distance between us.

373
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,960
Find a job and move out soon.

374
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,120
Where will I live if I move out?

375
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,200
Ran's mom left her a house.

376
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,590
My mom didn't.

377
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,280
Mom!

378
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,400
Come on.

379
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,920
How old are you?

380
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,110
-Stop acting cute.
-Mom.

381
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,070
Ran, you're back.

382
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:26,860
Dad.

383
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,270
Is this considered a work injury?

384
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,160
Shouldn't the TV station compensate us?

385
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,750
It's just a minor injury.

386
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,720
Compensate for what?

387
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,310
Compensate for the emotional damage.

388
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,000
Emotional damage

389
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,240
is much more serious

390
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,310
than physical injury.

391
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,590
Dad.

392
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,640
All right.

393
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,830
Let's not talk about this.

394
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,270
But

395
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,790
I watched the video of your live broadcast

396
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,050
in Eastern Country.

397
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:55,970
Not bad.

398
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,240
You're brave.

399
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,470
You're indeed my daughter.

400
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,480
Keep up the good work.

401
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,060
Did your mom say anything?

402
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,590
She said

403
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,040
not to go to Eastern Country anymore.

404
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,240
What else?

405
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,880
Nothing else.

406
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,750
She just doesn't want to admit it.

407
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,000
I can educate my daughter well too.

408
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,520
You did a great job on the report.

409
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,750
It was practically perfect!

410
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,600
Your mom is stingy.

411
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,440
She doesn't know how to praise anyone.

412
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,440
Song,

413
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,070
your daughter wants to eat your signature ribs.

414
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,110
The oil is hot.

415
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,240
Come here.

416
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,680
Ran, take a seat.

417
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,080
I'll talk to you later.

418
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,610
Just praise Song Ran.

419
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,000
Why do you keep mentioning her?

420
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,650
Is her comment that important?

421
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,440
I was just saying.

422
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,040
Song Yang has grown up.

423
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,790
Dad.

424
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,400
The station wants to see me.

425
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,290
I have to go.

426
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,440
All of a sudden?

427
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,680
The meal will be ready soon.

428
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,510
Eat before you go.

429
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,590
Next time.

430
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,450
Aunt Yang,

431
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:03,920
Song Yang,

432
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,750
I'm leaving.

433
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:07,750
Ran.

434
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,460
See?

435
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,760
It's all your fault.

436
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,610
Why are you blaming me?

437
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,440
Song Ran said

438
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,160
she's busy with work.

439
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,110
My life

440
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,920
is back to normal.

441
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,130
But I don't want everything in Eastern Country

442
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,790
to leave me like this.

443
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,510
Since no one wants to...

444
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,000
I do.

445
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,790
I want to talk about

446
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,150
the life of ordinary people in Eastern Country.

447
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,900
I have 837 hours worth of

448
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,790
video data,

449
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,270
including

450
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,440
269 hours of interviews,

451
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,370
over 4000 photos,

452
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,230
and 70,000 words worth of materials.

453
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,970
I tried my best to hold on to something.

454
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,180
Because there were

455
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,880
so many people and things

456
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,530
in Eastern Country that I can't forget.

457
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,030
Especially that mine,

458
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,110
that explosion,

459
00:27:59,400 --> 00:27:59,920
and...

460
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,400
Him.

461
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,090
Zan?

462
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,850
He is our demining volunteer,

463
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:10,750
Zan.

464
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,390
Zan.

465
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,470
Is this 'Zan'

466
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,000
him?

467
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:25,120
[20 days ago]

468
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:29,840
[Eastern Country, Evaluation Point]

469
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,930
Let us in.

470
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,510
Let us in!

471
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,750
This is my passport.

472
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,440
Don't push.

473
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,030
Back off!

474
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,830
Don't push!

475
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,200
Back off!

476
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,720
Don't rush in if you don't have a passport.

477
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,160
Go there with your passport.

478
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:03,050
Then, wait for the bus. It'll take you to the airport.

479
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,790
Thank you.

480
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,480
Good luck.

481
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,200
You too.

482
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,160
Hey, bro.

483
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,200
What are they squeezing for?

484
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,320
Maybe they're worried that they can't leave

485
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,510
and will be left here.

486
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,350
Why are they worrying about that?

487
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,030
Can't they have some confidence in their country?

00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,010

Do you have

528
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,090
a volunteer named Zan?

529
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,590
I haven't found any record

530
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,750
of the demining volunteers

531
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,880
China sent to Eastern Country.

532
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,200
Thank you.

533
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,550
Hello, Pin.

534
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
You are my last hope.

535
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,010
This person is very important to me.

536
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,000
Coming.

537
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,550
Hello, Miss.

538
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,160
Excuse me.

539
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,160
Hello.

540
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,480
I'm the renovator of the unit above your unit.

541
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,550
Their house is leaking.

542
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,960
The property management should have called you,

543
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,880
but couldn't get through.

544
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,680
So I came to check on you.

545
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,400
There's no leak in my house.

546
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,030
How about

547
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,160
you take a look for me?

548
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,160
Okay.

549
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,480
Okay.

550
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,430
Thank you.

551
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,630
I'll take this call.

552
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,310
Okay.

553
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,270
Excuse me.

554
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,240
Hello, Pin.

555
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,290
Song Ran.

556
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,150
I asked around.

557
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:26,860
How is it?

558
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,240
I couldn't find anyone matching your description.

559
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,000
You couldn't find one?

560
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,000
What about other volunteers

561
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,720
who are not demining volunteers?

562
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,810
No.

563
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,640
Did you make a mistake?

564
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,590
What?

565
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,310
I mean,

566
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,640
maybe the person you're looking for

567
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,750
is not from China.

568
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,270
He can speak Chinese,

569
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,790
but he might just be Chinese.

570
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,960
You can ask your leader.

571
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,940
Shen Bei?

572
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,400
Yes.

573
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,080
She knows someone in the International Rescue Organization.

574
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,150
Last time I did a show, I asked her for help too.

575
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,350
I'm hanging up.

576
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,240
Bye.

577
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,280
Miss.

578
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,650
Sir.

579
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,150

pardon me for saying this.

Looking for someone

is like looking for something.

00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,800
The harder you try, the more you can't find it.

If you stop looking for him...

maybe he will

00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:45,179

Fortunately, it's a red light now.

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,880
we'd have crashed into that stray dog.

But their participation

703
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,710
depends solely

704
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,960
on the volunteers' decision.
