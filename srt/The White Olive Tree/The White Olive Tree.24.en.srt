00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:50,539
[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

4
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,000
Ran.

5
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,550
Zan.

6
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:56,590
What's wrong?

7
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,880
My mom...

8
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,990
has been diagnosed with cancer.

9
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,660
I feel...

10
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,940
she can't hold on much longer.

11
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,380
Ran, don't be afraid.

12
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,500
I'll go back now.

13
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,800
Zan,

14
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,310
come back quickly.

15
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,600
I can't handle it

16
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,810
on my own anymore.

17
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,050
Okay.

18
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,590
Wait for me.

19
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,079
You ran away before I

20
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:51,840
finished my words.

21
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,280
I was worried.

22
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,030
You didn't look well,

23
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,120
so I came to check on you.

24
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,770
Don't worry about me.

25
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,150
Li Zan just called me

26
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,000
and said he would come back soon.

27
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,190
Why didn't he come back earlier?

28
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,710
He made you deal with

29
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,630
such a big matter here alone.

30
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,910
I didn't tell him.

31
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,670
I thought

32
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,460
I could hold on until he finishes his work

33
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,810
and comes back.

34
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,980
I'm so useless.

35
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,710
Sorry.

36
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,780
I crossed the line.

37
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,710
Things will get better after Li Zan comes back.

38
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,220
Look,

39
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,430
everything will get better.

40
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't worry too much

41
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,310
or cry.

42
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:47,640
Your eyes

43
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,530
are still recovering.

44
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,950
You can't cry often.

45
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,520
I'm not crying.

46
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,310
I never cried.

47
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,150
I washed my face just now. Maybe I

48
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,390
didn't wipe the water off completely.

49
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,520
What happened to my mom?

50
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,150
Doctor!

51
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,150
You should wait outside.

52
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,680
What happened to my mom?

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,710
Ran.

54
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,710
Don't go there now.

55
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,190
Mom!

56
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,960
Let them handle it first.

57
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,070
If you go there now,

58
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,120
you'll only hinder them from saving her.

59
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,160
I will

60
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,240
help you ask about her condition later.

61
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,339
Don't go there now.

62
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,130
Mom.

63
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,230
What's wrong with her?

64
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,480
What's wrong with her?

65
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,240
Mom.

66
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,160
You must hang in there, Mom.

67
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,480
Mom.

68
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,310
Mom.

69
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,510
Mom.

70
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,310
Mom.

71
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,570
Mom.

72
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,830
Mom.

73
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,120
The diagnosis has been confirmed.

74
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,600
It's a severe case of pneumonia

75
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:57,420
resulting from a bacterial infection in the lungs.

76
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,830
Currently, active treatment is underway.

77
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,050
We'll do our best.

78
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,630
Okay, thank you.

79
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,680
Ran,

80
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,630
Auntie has an accidental

81
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,850
bacterial infection in her lungs,

82
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,570
which has developed into severe pneumonia.

83
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,000
Dr. Tang and the medical team will do their best to treat her.

84
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,030
Don't worry too much.

85
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,920
Ran,

86
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,950
why don't you go home and rest first?

87
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,720
She's in the ICU now.

88
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,310
There's nothing you can do.

89
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,120
If anything happens,

90
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,600
I'll let you know immediately.

91
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:45,810
No.

92
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,310
I'll stay here with her.

93
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,390
Okay.

94
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,510
Zan.

95
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,210
My mom is in the ICU.

96
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,240
I'm scared.

97
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,750
I'm so scared.

98
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,430
Ran,

99
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,740
I'm making a layover in Tokyo.

100
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,120
Six hours.

101
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,550
I'll be there in six hours.

102
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,560
The plane is going to take off.

103
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,540
I have to hang up.

104
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,650
Don't be afraid. Wait for me.

105
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,680
Six hours.

106
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,190
Six hours.

107
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,870
Six hours.

108
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,040
Zan.

109
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,170
Ran.

110
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,850
Ran, it's me.

111
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,630
I'm here to check on your mom.

112
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,240
Sorry.

113
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,950
I didn't sleep last night,

114
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,010
so I didn't see clearly.

115
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,930
Zan said he'd be here soon.

116
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,310
Why hasn't he arrived here yet?

117
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,480
Ran.

I'm here, Ran.

126

♫Just stay where you are, don't go♫

127
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,730
It's my fault.

128
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,630
I made you suffer.

129
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,690
I won't leave.

131
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,270

Ran,

136
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,310
don't be afraid.

137
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,420
But the patient is still unconscious.

Our medical team

141
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,910
will monitor the patient's condition closely.

142
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,010
If there is any progress,

or if we need your cooperation,

144

we will let you know in time.

Zan.

148
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,250
Zan!

149

Zan!

150
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,070
Ran.

151
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,270
What's wrong?

152
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,630
Where did you go?

153
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,240
Why did you leave?

154
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,340
Ran,

155
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,190
I went to buy you some food

156
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,080
and washed my face by the way.

157
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,670
I thought

158
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,270
when your mom wakes up,

159
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,600
I can't let her

160
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,150
see my dirty face, right?

161
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,310
I fell asleep just now.

162
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,780
When I woke up, I didn't see you.

163
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,820
So I was a bit anxious.

164
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,290
Eat something first.

165
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,760
Come on.

166
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,570
Since this morning,

167
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,670
you've only eaten an apple.

168
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,380
You need to replenish some energy.

169
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,050
You definitely won't go back

170
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,530
before your mom wakes up.

171
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,160
You can't

172
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,330
sleep well here,

173
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,450
so you should eat well.

174
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,570
Understand?

175
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,830
Here.

176
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,790
I already had a sandwich

177
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,930
when I went to buy you food.

178
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,310
Eat.

179
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,830
Just now, you didn't see me

180
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,800
when you woke up.

181
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,260
Did you think I left?

182
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,410
My girlfriend is here.

183
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,070
Where can I go?

184
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,210
You silly girl.

185
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,860
A little.

186
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,580
Silly

187
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,390
but cute.

188
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,790
I like it.

189
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,060
And I'm a little worried.

190
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,400
Eat.

191
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,300
I'm going to throw it away.

192
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:18,890
I'll go.

193
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,780
You eat.

194
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,720
Have some water.

195
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,360
It feels so good to have someone dote on me,

196
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,950
especially when that person is you.

197
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,720
Zan,

198
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
I want to keep you

199
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,390
by my side forever

200
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,680
and never leave you.

201
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,560
Ran, what is on your mind?

202
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,660
I'm worried something might happen to her.

203
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,640
If so, I'd lose my mother.

204
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,170
Ran.

205
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,000
It's not

206
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,280
that serious.

207
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,430
Don't frighten yourself.

208
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,480
The medical team for your mom

209
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,670
is the best in Dicheng.

210
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,360
When you were asleep just now,

211
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,870
I already spoke with Dr. Tang.

212
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,550
She told me

213
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,510
the targeted drug your mom is taking

214
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,140
is the best available.

215
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,430
It's just there was an unexpected infection during treatment.

216
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,660
It has something to do

217
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,880
with your mother's overexertion before.

218
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,010
But now,

219
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,240
they've put her on an ECMO machine.

220
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,800
Once the bacteria are eliminated,

221
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,140
as long as she can pull through this critical phase,

222
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,590
there's a high probability she'll recover.

223
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,050
What if...

224
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,880
she can't?

225
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,850
The chances are slim.

226
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,840
But what if?

227
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,190
Then we'll have to say goodbye.

228
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,710
But I'm not ready to part from her yet.

229
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,220
I know.

230
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,690
Zan.

231
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,030
Do you miss your mom?

232
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,000
Yes.

233
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,770
But I've gotten used to it.

234
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,030
You were little at that time.

235
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,390
Do you still remember what happened?

236
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,510
Yes.

237
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,260
My dad said the same thing.

238
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,600
He thought I couldn't remember

239
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,720
because I was little.

240
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,210
But I remember.

241
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,940
And...

242
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,320
I remember it very clearly.

243
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,849
My mom passed away on a morning

244
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,050
in autumn.

245
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,650
The leaves outside the window were yellow.

246
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,599
And the sunlight was bright.

247
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,270
My mom looked pale,

248
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,589
but

249
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,790
I could still tell

250
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,210
she was pretty.

251
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,530
She smiled at me

252
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,840
and touched my face with her hands.

253
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,240
She said to me

254
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,530
Zan was so little.

255
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,960
She spoke

256
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,770
with tears streaming down her face.

257
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,610
I didn't understand at that time.

258
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,880
I didn't know why someone can

259
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,550
cry and laugh simultaneously.

260
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,670
So I climbed onto her bed

261
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,670
and

262
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,720
wiped her tears with my hands.

263
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,250
She smiled at me

264
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,270
and held my hands.

265
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,840
And she said, "good boy."

266
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,140
Then she closed her eyes

267
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,100
and never woke up.

268
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,570
And then?

269
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,350
Has your life been

270
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,520
different since then?

271
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,560
Since then...

272
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,140
there haven't been any notable differences.

273
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,290
Maybe it's because I really was

274
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,000
too little at that time.

275
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,390
It's just that every time I see

276
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,130
other people with their mothers,

277
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,960
I'd miss her very much.

278
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,210
When I miss her,

279
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,530
I feel heartbroken.

280
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,700
Every time I was praised

281
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,440
for my achievements,

282
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:50,100
♫We're at the farewell station again♫

283
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,730
I'd feel a bit sorry.

284
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,600
If she could be there,

285
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,680
♫I wait with you but don't want the train to come♫

286
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,950
and if she could see that,

287
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:57,900
that would be great.

288
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,600
♫I can't find you♫

289
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,050
When I was in difficulty,

290
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,060
♫You don't belong to me anymore♫

291
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,430
I'd wish she could still be with me.

292
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,480
♫We look at each other from afar♫

293
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,200
♫Far away from each other♫

294
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,790
Then maybe I could

295
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,480
complain and vent my frustration

296
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,590
in front of her.

297
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,450
♫Now, on other ends of the earth♫

298
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,550
I could even...

299
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,700
cry in her arms.

300
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:27,720
♫How many places do you want to go?♫

301
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,760
She definitely would indulge me.

302
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:32,080
♫When the flight and distance♫

303
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,820
This may be the difference

304
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,330
between a father and a mother.

305
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,830
♫Are no longer problems♫

306
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,520
With her,

307
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,900
♫Unfortunately♫

308
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,430
♫We lost contact long ago♫

309
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,660
I'd always be a child.

310
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,720
Now that she's gone,

311
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,910
♫When love is deeply buried in♫

312
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,720
I can only act as an adult.

313
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,970
♫The castle piled up on the beach♫

314
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:57,000
♫Time washes it away♫

315
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,580
♫Let me guess♫

316
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,700
♫Have you ever walked into♫

317
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,620
♫The castle you built for me♫

318
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,160
♫And disappeared at dawn?♫

319
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,470
It's okay.

320
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,070
I've gotten used to it.

321
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:18,990
♫This love is deeply buried♫

322
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,610
I've acted

323
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,920
♫In the castle on the beach♫

324
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,680
as an adult for 20 years.

325
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,510
♫Time washes it away♫

326
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:32,330
♫Let me guess, have you ever walked into♫

327
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,710
♫The castle you built♫

328
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,310
Zan.

329
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:40,940
♫And disappeared at dawn?♫

330
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,660
Go ahead.

331
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,450
♫Let me guess♫

332
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,860
♫Have you ever walked into♫

00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:52,100
♫The castle you built for me♫

334
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,580
If my mom really

335
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:58,590
♫And disappeared at dawn?♫

336
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,450
can't be cured,

337
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,120
there will always be

338
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,220
a void in my heart,

339
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,850
just like you.

340
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,510
But I have you.

341
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,400
So the void in my heart

342
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,600
will be smaller.

343
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,340
And I want to fill a little of the void

344
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,060
in your heart too.

345
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,990
In the future,

346
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,510
if we ever face

347
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,100
anything upsetting,

348
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,780
let's talk about it with each other,

349
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,100
vent our frustration,

350
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,450
and even cry if we need to.

351
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,750
It's all okay.

352
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,200
Okay?

353
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,580
Okay.

354
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,050
Okay.

355
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,620
Ran,

356
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,690
I really want to tell you

357
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,660
I have another void in my heart.

358
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,260
But I'm very scared.

359
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,360
It's not just a void.

360
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,370
It might be an abyss.

361
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,750
It will drag you down with me.

362
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,830
The patient is awake!

363
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,880
The patient is awake!

364
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,020
Hurry up!

365
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,030
Hurry up!

366
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,730
It's good news.

367
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,950
Your mother is out of danger now.

368
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,310
The bacteria causing the infection

369
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,830
have been completely eradicated.

370
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,880
Although she is still a bit weak,

371
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,860
there is no longer any life-threatening risk.

372
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,440
After some more rest and recovery,

373
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,830
she can continue with the targeted therapy.

374
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,500
The most difficult time has already passed.

375
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,400
What's wrong, Ran?

376
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,270
There is nothing in the fridge

377
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,550
except these things.

378
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,260
It's okay,

379
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,970
as long as they can fill the stomach.

380
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,100
No.

381
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,310
There's nothing in my mom's fridge.

382
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,080
I never opened the fridge before.

383
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,060
I didn't even know she had nothing in there.

384
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,090
She's been living so miserably.

385
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,060
But Ran,

386
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,400
she still has you.

387
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,590
Zan,

388
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,540
am I

389
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,510
an unfilial daughter?

390
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,270
I just hope

391
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,050
it's not too late

392
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,720
and there is still a chance

393
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,750
for us to make up for the lost time

394
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,920
we could have spent

395
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,840
together.

396
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,330
You will.

397
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,620
Let's go to the kitchen.

398
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,940
Why didn't you dodge

399
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,460
when the bottle fell?

400
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,180
I subconsciously thought

401
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,800
it wouldn't hit me

402
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,670
because you'd catch it.

403
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,230
I didn't expect you

404
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,350
to be so eloquent.

405
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,080
If you really were hit by it,

406
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,960
looks like the blame would be on me.

407
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,310
In our future home,

408
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,300
let's just avoid installing

409
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,560
cabinets above the head level.

410
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,070
In that way, you won't be able

411
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,080
to blame me for them.

412
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,500
I'll still have plenty of other things

413
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,080
to hold you accountable for.

414
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,930
For example, I'm starving.

415
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,400
Done?

416
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,140
Yes.

417
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,400
We can eat in a minute.

418
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,150
Here.

419
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,640
It's such a simple bowl of noodles,

420
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:00,920
yet you made it taste

421
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,210
incredibly delicious.

422
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,070
I didn't expect you

423
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,750
to be such a good cook.

424
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,030
This is called

425
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,400
Yang Chun Noodles.

426
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,280
My dad taught me how to make it.

427
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,440
I only learned it

428
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,560
because it's easy.

429
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,740
I'm not much of a cook.

430
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,600
If only someone could teach me

431
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,370
how to cook when I was little.

432
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,830
Then I wouldn't have had to

433
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,330
sit through those awkward meals

434
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,240
with Aunt Yang and my father

435
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,610
at their place.

436
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,720
Whenever I was hungry,

437
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,700
I could just make myself a bowl of Yang Chun Noodles.

438
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,390
Ran,

439
00:30:59,130 --> 00:30:59,930
in the future,

440
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,720
we will have our own home.

441
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:04,830
At home,

442
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,920
there won't be anyone who makes you feel awkward.

443
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:11,960
Okay?

444
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,240
Ran.

445
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,810
Why are your eyes

446
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,790
always so red?

447
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,970
They even look a bit swollen.

448
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,960
Maybe I've been too tired recently.

449
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,330
And I've been crying a lot.

450
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,000
Plus the injury my eyes suffered

451
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,110
back in Eastern Country,

452
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,550
they're a little inflamed.

453
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,550
I'll go to Dr. He tomorrow

454
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,880
to get some eye drops.

455
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,140
It'll be okay.

456
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,790
When you go to the hospital tomorrow morning,

457
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,990
make sure you go see him.

458
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,640
Don't brush it off.

459
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,300
Got it.

460
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,070
I didn't know

461
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,460
you're so nagging.

462
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,750
I'm

463
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,580
not like this with others.

464
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,000
You're only like this with me?

465
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,250
You don't like it?

466
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,480
I like it.

467
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,740
I'll accept

468
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,510
everything you give me.

469
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:56,620
Come.

470
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,040
She hasn't woken up yet.

471
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,850
You go have your eyes examined first.

472
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,360
I'll stay here with her.

473
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,330
Okay.

474
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,030
Here.

475
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,860
So nagging.

476
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:25,720
Zan.

477
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,520
Auntie.

478
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
You're awake, Auntie.

479
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,120
Where is Ran?

480
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,000
Ran

481
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,440
went to get two bottles of eye drops from the ophthalmology department.

482
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,750
Her eyes are a little red,

483
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,310
probably due to some inflammation.

484
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,310
Auntie, are you thirsty?

485
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,520
I'll get you some water.

486
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,030
I... I don't want it now.

487
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,110
Sit down.

488
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,700
I want to talk to you.

489
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,200
Be careful.

490
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:58,840
Okay.

491
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:00,510
That's enough.

492
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,400
What do you like about Ran?

493
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,219
I've never thought about it.

494
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,070
I just like...

495
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,400
the feeling of being with her.

496
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,400
There must be some specific reasons, right?

497
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:42,929
She's good in every way.

498
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,110
Very good.

499
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,659
Why do I think she's full of flaws?

500
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,290
Too sensitive

501
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,400
and fragile.

502
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,580
Sometimes,

503
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,530
she's inexplicably headstrong

504
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,580
and stubborn.

505
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,500
I actually think

506
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,400
those things are good.

507
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,650
I just...

508
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,730
When I see her happy,

509
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,860
I feel happy too.

510
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,230
When I see her sad,

511
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,880
I feel heartbroken.

512
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,110
All my feelings are beyond my control.

513
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,190
You think she's good now.

514
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,660
What if you

515
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,510
start to see her flaws in the future?

516
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,630
Everyone has flaws.

517
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,560
Everyone's personality

518
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,950
has two sides.

519
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,080
What others see

520
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,620
as Ran's weakness,

521
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
to me,

522
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,630
is her soft-heartedness and kindness.

523
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,190
What others see

524
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,170
as her stubbornness

525
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,660
is her perseverance.

526
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,800
No one is perfect

527
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,990
in this world.

528
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,260
Ran is not perfect either.

529
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,080
But in my eyes, everything

530
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,070
about her is good.

531
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,150
So it's not that I

532
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,630
don't see her flaws.

533
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,440
It's just that what I see

534
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,450
is different from what others see.

535
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,930
Why is everything about her always good

536
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,240
in your eyes?

537
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,280
Because I like her.

538
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,620
I like her very much.

539
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,460
Auntie,

540
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,900
I'm actually

541
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:38,960
a slow burner.

542
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,000
Like Ran,

543
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,680
I'm stubborn too.

544
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,810
For people like us,

545
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,360
it's hard to fall in love

546
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,140
with someone.

547
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,880
It's even harder

548
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,380
to let go.

549
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,190
Auntie,

550
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,070
I know what you're worried about.

551
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,590
Don't worry.

552
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,860
I won't let Ran down.

553
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,260
Will you still go to Eastern Country?

554
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,180
I asked her this question a few times,

555
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,350
but she wouldn't answer me.

556
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,240
I will.

557
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,030
Auntie, I don't want to hide it from you.

558
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,320
I'll go to Eastern Country

559
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,420
because some of my friends

560
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,320
need my help there.

561
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,570
They're not just ordinary friends.

562
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,400
They're people

563
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,890
I've been through life and death with.

564
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,200
Also,

565
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,230
there are

566
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,070
some unfinished matters

567
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,400
I need to resolve.

568
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,230
Perhaps some problems

569
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,150
can only be solved in Eastern Country.

570
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,260
I understand you.

571
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,260
But it's chaotic and dangerous in Eastern Country after all.

572
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,550
I'm ill now.

573
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,940
Ran needs to stay in China for a while.

574
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,930
How will you tell her?

575
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,580
Auntie,

576
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,190
this happened

577
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,110
rather suddenly.

578
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,410
I haven't figured out how to tell her yet.

579
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,030
But don't worry.

580
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,190
I will think about it carefully.

581
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,670
Mom.

582
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,190
You're awake.

583
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,030
How are you feeling?

584
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,450
Are you feeling better?

585
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:12,650
I'm fine.

586
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,910
Don't make a fuss.

587
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,070
How are you?

588
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,360
How are your eyes?

589
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:18,970
It's fine.

590
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,460
Just now, Dr. He

591
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,910
prescribed two bottles of eye drops for me.

592
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:24,690
He told me

593
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,420
to get more sleep

594
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,670
and not to cry often.

595
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,000
How could Dr. He say that?

596
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,250
Our Ran

597
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,430
never cries often.

598
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,950
You've never cried, right?

599
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,080
Yes.

600
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,820
Auntie.

601
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,550
Ran

602
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,430
is actually very strong.

603
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,140
She hardly ever cries.

604
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,190
She only

605
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,440
gets moved to tears

606
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,960
when she watches cartoons.

607
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,400
Recently,

608
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,650
she must have watched too many cartoons.

609
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,260
What kind of lame reason is that?

610
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,000
Who would believe that?

611
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,350
I believe.

612
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,960
You've loved watching cartoons since you were little.

613
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,640
I remember you

614
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,120
standing in your crib,

615
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,370
giggling at the cartoons

616
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,630
on TV.

617
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,050
They say you can tell a person's future from how they are at three.

618
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:22,670
It's really...

619
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,220
Mom,

620
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,320
why are you

621
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,830
on Zan's side so quickly?

622
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,530
Could it...

623
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,270
really be like you said —

624
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,210
the more a mother-in-law sees her son-in-law,

625
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,620
the more she likes him?

626
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,020
I see.

627
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,970
It's not that you like him very much.

628
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,460
You only like him a little.

629
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,960
That's not true.

630
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,480
I like him very much, okay?

631
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,390
Good night.

632
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,100
Good night.

633
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,000
The infection you have now

634
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,200
and the last episode

635
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,760
are caused by two different bacteria.

636
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,140
But if antibiotics don't work,

637
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,710
the only option left is a corneal transplant.

638
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,720
The success rate in the past cases is not very high.

639
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,460
You should be mentally prepared.

640
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,760
In fact, what Eastern Country needs most right now

641
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,550
are volunteers for demining like you.

642
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,220
When do you plan to go?

643
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,920
How will you tell her?
