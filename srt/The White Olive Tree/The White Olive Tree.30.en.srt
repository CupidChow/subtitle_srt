[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

4
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,590
Thank you for helping me yesterday.

5
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,280
This is an apple as a thank you gift.

6
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,590
Ms. Song,

7
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,690
you're here.

8
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,360
Didn't I tell you not to wander around?

9
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,520
It's dangerous here.

10
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,520
I'm sorry, Ms. Song.

11
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,680
If it were you,

12
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,650
would you choose to get married at a time like this?

13
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,890
No.

14
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,890
We have many young nurses here

15
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,480
who are interested in Li Zan.

16
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,480
My eyes...

17
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,120
Where am I?

18
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:42,840
It's me.

19
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:52,700
It's too dark here.

20
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,290
Your eyes are not good.

21
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:55,800
Follow me.

22
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,440
I'll lead you out.

23
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,360
Okay.

24
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,340
Why did you leave without saying anything to me?

25
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,880
I saw you were busy.

26
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,510
You're angry?

27
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,170
No.

28
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,490
Why would I be angry?

29
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,120
You're jealous?

30
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,440
I'm just kidding.

31
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,070
Why would you be jealous?

32
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,790
At most, I'm just...

33
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,510
an ex-boyfriend.

34
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,890
We broke up,

35
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,950
didn't we?

36
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,270
We...

37
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:31,800
broke up.

38
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,080
Zan,

39
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,750
I'm not jealous.

40
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,790
I'm not only jealous.

41
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,230
I regret it.

42
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:58,870
I regret–

43
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,310
Ran.

44
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,110
The mission the special forces are carrying out this time,

45
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,340
I'll be going too.

46
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,710
If you have anything to say,

47
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,000
wait until I come back.

48
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're going too?

49
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,930
Is it very dangerous?

50
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,790
♫We're at the farewell station again♫

51
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,570
It's not dangerous.

52
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,360
♫I wait with you but don't want the train to come♫

53
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,800
Don't worry about me.

54
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,390
When the mission is completed,

55
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,290
♫I can't find you♫

56
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,130
I'll come find you.

57
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,740
♫You don't belong to me anymore♫

58
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,170
♫We look at each other from afar♫

59
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,890
♫Far away from each other♫

60
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,310
If...

61
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,140
♫Now, on other ends of the earth♫

62
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,220
If the special forces receive a new mission,

63
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,390
we'll have to move to another location.

64
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:11,410
♫How many places do you want to go?♫

65
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,480
So if you don't see me

66
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,240
when that time comes,

67
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,770
♫When the flight and distance♫

68
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,770
don't jump to conclusions.

69
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,850
I've just gone somewhere else.

70
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,520
♫Are no longer problems♫

71
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,960
It's very chaotic now.

72
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,590
♫Unfortunately♫

73
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,430
Don't go around looking for me.

74
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,110
♫We lost contact long ago♫

75
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,750
Okay?

76
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,600
♫When love is deeply buried in♫

77
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,659
♫The castle piled up on the beach♫

78
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,760
Are you leaving?

79
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,690
♫Time washes it away♫

80
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,870
This is our assembly whistle.

81
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,270
♫Let me guess♫

82
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,390
♫Have you ever walked into♫

83
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,240
♫The castle you built for me♫

84
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,850
♫And disappeared at dawn?♫

85
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,360
I'm leaving.

86
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,780
♫Let me guess, have you ever walked into♫

87
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,890
♫The castle you built for me♫

88
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,430
♫And disappeared at dawn?♫

89
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,040
Song Ran.

90
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,200
Are you looking for Li Zan?

91
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,670
They...

92
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,000
have already left.

93
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,960
I know.

94
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,440
You know,

95
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,200
but you can't bear to part with him,

96
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,600
right?

97
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,340
Just now, that young nurse from our department came to look for me.

98
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,920
She told me she invited Li Zan to dance

99
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,790
but was rejected.

100
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,750
Li Zan said

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,270
he already has someone he likes.

102
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,960
The person Li Zan said he likes,

103
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,000
it's you, isn't it?

104
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,020
Benjamin has left too.

105
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,720
How are you?

106
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,810
Are you worried?

107
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,690
Do you know how he said goodbye to me?

108
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,150
He paid for three months

109
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,230
at Vinyl.

110
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,280
Then he told me

111
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,790
before the money runs out,

112
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,430
I'm not allowed to find a new boyfriend.

113
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,240
If the money runs out

114
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,390
and he hasn't shown up,

115
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,950
it means he's found new love.

116
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,550
That means I shouldn't wait for him

117
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,240
and can start a new relationship too.

118
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,910
He's...

119
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,840
He's always full of nonsense.

120
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,440
Not a word of truth comes out of his mouth.

121
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,090
The worst injury he ever had

122
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,520
took three months to heal.

123
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,090
He almost lost his life.

124
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,550
So he knows

125
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,670
if after three months

126
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,440
he still can't come to find me...

127
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,840
even if he's not dead,

128
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,870
he's probably only half alive.

129
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,600
With his personality,

130
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,080
if he really got that badly injured,

131
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,240
it wouldn't be much different from being dead.

132
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,320
So,

133
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,510
he only asked me to wait for him for three months.

134
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,080
I'm not the kind of woman

135
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,240
who sits at home waiting foolishly.

136
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,030
I've signed up for the medical rescue team in Happo.

137
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,600
We're leaving tomorrow at noon.

138
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,300
Just imagine how he'll react when he sees me in Happo.

139
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,950
I can't help but laugh.

140
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,790
Xiaonan.

141
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,110
I'll go with you.

142
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,280
Where to?

143
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,480
Happo?

144
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,060
I'd like you to take me along.

145
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,030
I've learned some first aid before.

146
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,790
There must be something I can help with.

147
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:33,830
Is that okay?

148
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,200
Sure.

149
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,960
No problem.

150
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,360
I didn't expect you to be so brave,

151
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,880
considering how delicate you look.

152
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
Then it's settled.

153
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,080
I'll go pack my things now.

154
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,310
I'll meet you at the hospital tomorrow.

155
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,440
All right.

156
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,150
See you tomorrow.

157
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,270
See you tomorrow.

158
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,880
Here!

159
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,860
Please help!

160
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,110
It's okay.

161
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:14,860
Xiaonan.

162
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,550
What happened?

163
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,960
How did this happen?

164
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,100
I don't know either.

165
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,370
It happened in the blink of an eye.

166
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,050
Is there anything I can do to help?

167
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,320
Look, they all have labels on them.

168
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,440
Those with green labels have minor injuries.

169
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,370
You can help treat them.

170
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,790
Come here! We need help!

171
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,840
Song Ran.

172
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,960
There's some disinfection equipment in the ambulance.

173
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,100
You can get it over there.

174
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,160
It's closer.

175
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,840
Okay.

176
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,920
Okay...

177
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,720
Thank you.

178
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,470
Be careful.

179
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,800
Here.

180
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,140
Okay, thank you.

181
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,720
Captain.

182
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,960
Why are you here?

183
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,180
Many areas in Uglai City were attacked.

184
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,420
We're understaffed.

185
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,690
We're ordered to reinforce them.

186
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,900
You've all been called in here.

187
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,840
Seems that it's really bad.

188
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,840
Yeah.

189
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,440
Ark was snatched away last night.

190
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,990
This is his revenge.

191
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,420
That bastard really stops at nothing.

192
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,480
Oh my god.

193
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,240
Matuman was taken.

194
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,360
What?

195
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,570
How could they do that?

196
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,370
Song Ran.

197
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,850
Look at this.

198
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,130
Adjutant.

199
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,010
Your Matuman soldier,

200
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,790
your hero!

201
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,980
Beneath my feet

202
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,290
lies the sacred soil of your Matuman Temple.

203
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,550
The holiest of your lands.

204
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,720
In just five hours,

205
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,390
to commemorate

206
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,270
our glorious battle battle for Matuman,

207
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,110
we will execute him.

208
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,030
This will be a lesson for you. For defying us,

209
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,390
and for taking our leader Ark!

210
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,900
His blood

211
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,330
is to teach you some respect.

212
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,510
That bastard Ark

213
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,960
is doing such a heinous thing

214
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,250
the moment he escaped.

215
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,330
Since we arrive at Matuman first

216
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:57,850
and are seeing this,

217
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,430
we can't ignore it.

218
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,200
Prepare to attack.

219
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,280
Just the 12 of us?

220
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:09,960
Yes,

221
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,420
just the 12 of us.

222
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,440
Yes, Captain.

223
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,510
Wish me luck.

224
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,290
Good luck.

225
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,040
We fell for these bastards' diversion tactic.

226
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,130
Everyone, get on the car.

227
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,180
We are heading back to Matuman Hill.

228
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,750
Crying won't help.

229
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,910
Can't you just step on it and drive faster? God damn it.

230
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,080
Yes, sir!

231
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,550
Dr. Pei.

232
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,440
Song.

233
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,120
Sasin.

234
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,550
It's great that you're here.

235
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,130
We have a wounded soldier.

236
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,480
He's seriously injured.

237
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,830
The medic says

238
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,090
he might need immediate surgery.

239
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,070
Where is he?

240
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,050
In the medical tent of the Matuman garrison.

241
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,240
How did you end up here?

242
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,790
We saw the live broadcast.

243
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,000
We thought we might be able to help

244
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,350
so we came along with the captain.

245
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,110
Captain,

246
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,160
please forgive us for using the garrison's

247
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,170
command center without informing you.

248
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,700
The situation is really urgent.

249
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,390
We conducted a side combat deployment.

250
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,940
We failed in first attack.

251
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,440
I've seen it all.

252
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,730
The terrain of Matuman is incredible.

253
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,310
You don't want to affect the sentry.

254
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,070
Without any cover,

255
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,480
you still charged into the battle.

256
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,590
You...

257
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,710
You are the bravest soldiers I've ever seen.

258
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:51,650
Thank you.

259
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:55,920
Captain,

260
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,640
it's good to see you.

261
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,720
You're more familiar with this place.

262
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,400
Our captain will meet you.

263
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,590
Okay.

264
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,590
Let's go.

265
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,640
Sasin.

266
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,260
Who's the injured person?

267
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,920
Morgan.

268
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,320
It's a good you're here.

269
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,000
Dr. Pei can save Morgan.

270
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,000
I really wish I were a real nurse.

271
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,550
That way I could help that bride

272
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,360
protect her husband.

273
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,240
Song,

274
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,580
we need to go find Benjamin and the others now.

275
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,480
Wait here for a while.

276
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,270
Take a rest.

277
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,240
Oh, by the way.

278
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,150
Photography is not allowed here.

279
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,750
Okay.

280
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,630
Ben.

281
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,400
I've found some new leads.

282
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,120
He's fine.

283
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:13,880
He's fine...

284
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,110
I can't go over right now.

285
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,590
I'll wait.

286
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,070
I'll wait...

287
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,240
What did you find?

288
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,510
Sir.

289
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,310
Captain.

290
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,120
Right on time. I found the clues.

291
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,800
Look closely.

292
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,920
Explosives?

293
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,070
They want to blow up the Holy Temple?

294
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,240
They're using the execution of the soilder as a cover.

295
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,880
There is a reason why they're waiting

296
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,920
five hours to do that.

297
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,240
It's not just to wait for

298
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
that sacred moment.

299
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,270
I think it's because of the temple's arched structure,

300
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,290
its structure's materials,

301
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,470
as well as their limited supply of explosives.

302
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,160
To destroy the entire temple in one go,

303
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,070
they need to precisely

304
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,750
locate the blast points and wire placement.

305
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,250
This takes time.

306
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,550
You've already found a solution?

307
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,170
The terrain of Matuman Hill is easy to defend but hard to attack.

308
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,920
Plus, the front of the slope

309
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,270
is covered with their heroes' tombstones.

310
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,050
We're now hesitant to act and our hands are tied.

311
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,960
That's why our first attack failed.

312
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,020
For the second attack to succeed,

313
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,810
we must have cover.

314
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,290
So I think

315
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,350
we need to create our own cover.

316
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,770
Create our own?

317
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,890
We can't bomb the Holy Temple

318
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,350
nor the tombstones,

319
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,630
but we can bomb the ground.

320
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,920
You mean using artillery to blast craters on the back hill

321
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,340
and use the craters as cover?

322
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,480
But if we really make it up there

323
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,680
and they get desperate, blowing up the temple first,

324
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,070
even if they're not fully prepared

325
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,110
and only blow up a small part of it,

326
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,830
we'll still be condemned for eternity.

327
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,450
So before I remove those explosives,

328
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,550
you can't actually attack.

329
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,610
You can only feign an attack to cover my approach.

330
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,580
It's best if we can lure them out.

331
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,750
We need to make them believe

332
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,240
this is another futile attack.

333
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,150
All right.

334
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,450
I will lead the people to draw the fire and protect you.

335
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:11,930
Okay.

336
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,910
I'll take four.

337
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,900
You'll lead the others of the special forces.

338
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,240
Gentlemen.

339
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,830
Sasin.

340
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,030
You shoot the bomb.

341
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,440
I want to go–

342
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,560
If you say one more word,

343
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,310
I'll have someone else shoot the bomb instead.

344
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,190
Song.

345
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,400
Zan is going on a mission

346
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,510
with Benjamin and the others.

347
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,640
It's best not to disturb him now.

348
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,760
Okay.

349
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,030
Benjamin.

350
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,470
Call me Captain.

351
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,720
Why are you back here

352
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,840
instead of getting ready?

353
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,030
If you can't aim properly later

354
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,270
and hit me in the head,

355
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,270
I'll be dead.

356
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,270
You...

357
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,640
Don't worry.

358
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,790
I'll keep an eye on you.

359
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,160
Be very careful.

360
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,510
You're quite unusual today.

361
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,030
You're not actually sassing me.

362
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,790
If I can't trust you,

363
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,960
then in this special forces team,

364
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,420
there's no one I can trust.

365
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,460
Go, go, go!

366
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,790
All units up the hill!

367
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,690
Go!

368
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,550
They're attacking again.

369
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,010
Seems like they have reinforcements

370
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,510
which are stronger than last time.

371
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,070
Go.

372
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,310
Sasin!

373
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,000
Fire.

374
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,610
Fire!

375
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,680
Come on! Go!

376
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,550
Go, go, go!

377
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,720
Launching cover missiles!

378
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,400
Ready, fire!

379
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,280
You got to be kidding me.

380
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,140
You're done.

381
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,550
Don't celebrate too early.

382
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,550
Let's see if you can keep this smile

383
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,680
when I level this place to the ground!

384
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,480
This is our Matuman!

385
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,720
Hurry, hurry!

386
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,110
Cover!

387
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,400
Take them out!

388
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,880
Move forward!

389
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,640
Open fire!

390
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,200
Sasin!

391
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,960
Fire!

392
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,750
Fire!

393
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,170
Bu.

394
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,170
Sir.

395
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,780
If they breach our defense,

396
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,150
blow it up right away.

397
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,040
Neglect my order.

398
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,910
We need both bombs. I will bring two shells

399
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,070
and get ready to fire anytime.

400
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,310
Good.

401
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,090
Everyone else! Stick to my lead.

402
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,440
We storm out and put a break on them.

403
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,350
One dead enemy

404
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,960
is one step to victory!

405
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,660
Come on, let's go!

406
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,030
Take them out!

407
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,960
Prepare to fire.

408
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,590
Sasin.

409
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,890
Those bastards are coming out of the temple.

410
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,020
Get down!

411
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,160
The captain and his team are advancing upwards.

412
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,310
Sasin, be extremely careful with your aim.

413
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,110
Ready!

414
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,730
Fire!

415
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:50,800
Go!

416
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,510
Cover fire!

417
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,160
Sasin.

418
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,740
The next two times

419
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,610
must be consecutive.

420
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,090
They will find out if the intervals are the same.

421
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,680
It's up to you whether we can take this chance

422
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,240
amidst the choas.

423
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,880
Quit nagging.

424
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,200
Fire!

425
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,560
Good job, kid.

426
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,400
Benjamin's team is back down.

427
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,090
Increase force in covering fire!

428
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:28,880
Go quickly!

429
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,510
Don't worry about me.

430
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,310
Once the mission is complete,

431
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,960
I'll come find you.

432
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,680
So if you don't see me

433
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,200
when that time comes,

434
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,470
don't jump to conclusions.

435
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,960
I must have gone somewhere else.

436
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,840
It's very chaotic now.

437
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,350
Don't go around looking for me.

438
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,570
Okay?

439
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,400
No.

440
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,640
Zan...

441
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,400
We haven't made up yet.

442
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,200
No...

443
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,550
No...

444
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,200
Zan.

445
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,330
Zan!

446
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,480
Zan!

447
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,760
♫I got a feeling in my veins♫

448
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,270

Hey, you! Who's that?

492
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,210
Don't you move!

493
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,090
I've been out of patience.

494
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,290
Go to hell with your sentry!

495
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,790
Somebody, help!

496
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,480
We've evacuated.

497
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,680
Covering fire!

498
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,110
Ready, fire!

499
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,070
Ambush!

500
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,960
Song Ran?

501
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,680
Xiaonan.

502
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,550
How is it?

503
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,000
Is the surgery finished?

504
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,720
Was it successful?

505
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,590
We've saved the person.

506
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,100
That's great.

507
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
That bride

508
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,210
won't have to live in painful memories anymore.

509
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,790
This should be a good omen, right?

510
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:22,960
Zan...

511
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Will he be alright?

512
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,400
How's it going?

513
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,640
Did we win?

514
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,200
They've already stormed the Holy Temple.

515
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,030
Victory is near.

516
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,060
What about Benjamin and the others now?

517
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,520
I just saw them up there,

518
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,030
through the camera.

519
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,030
But there's too much dust now,

520
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,110
I can't see clearly anymore.

521
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
Don't worry,

522
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,440
they'll be fine.

523
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,400
I'm not worried at all.

524
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,550
Benjamin is so cunning,

525
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,830
killing him

526
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,179
won't be that easy.

527
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,000
It's from the locals.

528
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,719
You don't like snacks?

529
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,000
Then why did you take it?

530
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,710
This way,

531
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,590
he'd feel happier.

532
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,880
If we don't,

533
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:37,510
he might think

534
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,440
we don't like the things he gave us.

535
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,230
It doesn't taste good, does it?

536
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,920
You knew it tasted bad,

537
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,510
yet you still accepted it?

538
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,630
Are you teasing me?

539
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,590
Because someone once said,

540
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,110
if you refuse,

541
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,000
others might think you're looking down on them.

542
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,440
Who told you that?

543
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,440
Anyway,

544
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,580
I'm not deliberately teasing you.

545
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:12,800
Dr. Pei!

546
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,150
Doctor!

547
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,670
Zan!

548
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,510
It's nothing.

549
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:41,710
Just a flesh wound.

550
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,480
I'll wait until they're less busy

551
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,550
then I'll have them take care of it.

552
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:46,800
All right.

553
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,590
Where are Benjamin and the others?

554
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,510
They're still wrapping things up on the mountain.

555
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,510
They told me to come down first,

556
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,000
so I wouldn't distract him.

557
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,310
As if he's the only capable person in the world.

558
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,550
Oh, by the way, Zan,

559
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,620
I just saw Song at the camp.

560
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,960
I even took her to the command center to see you.

561
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,150
But at that time,

562
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,110
you were preparing for the mission with Benjamin.

563
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,190
I was worried she might affect your mood,

564
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,800
so I didn't let her meet you...

565
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,740
♫Heartache♫

566
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:36,060

00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,610
♫Lost in the waves♫

570
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,300
♫Can't find my way back♫

571
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,220
♫Like two lonely islands♫

572
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,800
♫Drifting far apart♫

573
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:04,990
♫Feeling like a castaway♫

574
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,750
♫Stranded here alone♫

575
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,250
♫No place feels like home♫

576
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:18,890
♫Feeling like far from home♫

577
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,560
♫You don't belong to me♫

578
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:26,140
♫I know, not anymore♫

579
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,680
♫In this darkness♫

580
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:34,130
♫Search for a light♫

581
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,010
♫Hoping some day♫

582
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:42,810
♫I'll find my way back to life♫

583
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:45,750
♫Ocean of sadness♫

584
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,950
♫I'm under attack♫

585
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,800
♫Hoping some day♫

586
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:57,650
♫I'll find my way back to life♫

587
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:04,510
♫Find my way back to life♫

588
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:55,950
Hey, doc.

589
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:56,870
How about Morgan?

590
00:39:59,110 --> 00:39:59,980
Dr. Pei?

591
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,200
He's alright now.

592
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,480
We just need to send him to the hospital

593
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,630
for a few days of observation.

594
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,410
That's good.

595
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,000
Dr. Pei.

596
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,490
I've put some coffee in the flask.

597
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,220
The taste isn't great,

598
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,890
but it'll help you stay awake.

599
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,840
Dr. Pei.

600
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,600
It's so dangerous here.

601
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,330
Why have you come here?

602
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,870
You should stay in the hospital,

603
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,790
listening to music to relax in the evening.

604
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,670
This is no place for a beautiful lady like you.

605
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,270
If I hadn't come,

606
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,030
that groom's wife

607
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,120
would ask you to return her husband.

608
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,790
It's also because of you.

609
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
I think the money you left

610
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,780
at Vinyl for three months

611
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:29,910
is not quite enough.

612
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,630
So I came to see if Captain Benjamin

613
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,530
could give more.

614
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:43,870
No problem.

615
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,790
I went around the battlefield today,

616
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:48,160
and no one caught my eye.

617
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,070
So,

618
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,580
I will pay the bill

619
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,350
for Vinyl.

620
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,230
Really?

621
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,190
For how long?

622
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:07,820
For how long?

623
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,380
For how long…

624
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,310
Sasin!

625
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:24,850
Stop!

626
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,220
-Captain!
-Captain!

627
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,440
Sasin.

628
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,840
You were supposed to handle the artillery,

629
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,850
not go onto the battlefield.

630
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:54,600
Why did you–

631
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,350
Lock me up if you want.
