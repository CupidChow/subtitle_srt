[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

4
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,120
For the past two months back in East Country,

5
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,400
I've been living every day to the fullest.

6
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,270
My new friends here

7
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,150
have given me a deeper understanding

8
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,680
of East Country.

9
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,560
I'm taking my leave.

10
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,280
Okay.

11
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,230
Reporter Song,

12
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,000
what was your shooting schedule today?

13
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,280
Did you get attacked?

14
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,430
I followed a squad and filmed

15
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,560
their crackdown on the remaining armed rebels.

16
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,850
Yet we first ran into a dozen of civilians.

17
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,640
While rescuing them,

18
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,390
those jerks spotted us.

19
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,680
So the fight broke out earlier than planned.

20
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,280
But it was not big in scale.

21
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,240
No big deal.

22
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,710
No big deal? Seriously?

23
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,590
Reporter Song, you're really something.

24
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,300
By the way,

25
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,079
we have a special mission tomorrow.

26
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,370
If you're interested,

27
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,270
you can follow us to film.

28
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,520
Brilliant!

29
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:49,770
Captain Jiang,

30
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,490
can I use that water

31
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,730
to wash my hair?

32
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,380
I'll do it real quick.

33
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,170
And it can still be used to water the plants.

34
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,260
Your accommodation's been having

35
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,290
water and power cuts lately, right?

36
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,660
Here, we use the water to wash rice first and then water the plants.

37
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,660
Okay,

38
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:08,940
it's perfect.

39
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,380
Water soaked with rice is nutritious.

40
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,290
It works wonders for hair.

41
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,730
I won't waste it.

42
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:15,960
Thanks, Captain Jiang.

43
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:32,540
Song! You're here to wash your hair again?

44
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,450
Is there another blackout?

45
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,380
Song,

46
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,570
you're using the rice water to wash your hair.

47
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,820
And the grains are sticking to your hair.

48
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,480
Do you need a comb?

49
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,290
Reporter Song,

50
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,490
come in, please.

51
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,290
Dry your hair.

52
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,290
It's a new one.

53
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,290
Totally clean.

54
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:46,610
Well,

55
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,170
I just don't want to mess up your towel.

56
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,980
A comb will be enough.

57
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:00,730
Here.

58
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:06,910
Thank you.

59
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,130
There's a mirror over there.

60
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,880
Why is he here?

61
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,100
Does Shen Bei know that?

62
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,220
Or did something happen?

63
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,970
Are you so surprised

64
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,170
to see me here?

65
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,730
But I'm not surprised

66
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,540
to meet you here at all.

67
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,220
Since I arrived here two days ago,

68
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,810
I've heard a lot about you from the soldiers here.

69
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,420
They refer to you

70
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,050
as a gorgeous and brave

71
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,140
female reporter from China.

72
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,909
They're just joking around.

73
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,290
I don't think that's a joke.

74
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,960
There's hot water here.

75
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,420
But I was quite surprised to know

76
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,660
you came to East Country.

77
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,170
I thought...

78
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,610
You thought stepping on the bomb would scare me off

79
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,630
from coming here again?

80
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,130
Sorry,

81
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,010
I underestimated you.

82
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,100
It's okay.

83
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,100
Honestly,

84
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,100
I'm still scared.

85
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,080
Like, really scared.

86
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,990
But I just heard from the soldiers here that

87
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,470
during the mission this morning,

88
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,950
you were charging

89
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,850
at the front so boldly.

90
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,680
As reporters,

91
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,540
we must charge forward,

92
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,690
not back off.

93
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,660
What about you?

94
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,900
What brings you here?

95
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,220
I'm a volunteer.

96
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,810
I should also charge forward,

97
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,370
not back off.

98
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,290
My volunteer service here

99
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,590
is not finished yet.

100
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,350
Last time I went back

101
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,580
just for a temporary break.

102
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,980
Actually, the day we met at the hotpot restaurant,

103
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,100
it was not...

104
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,730
Just forget

105
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,850
about that day.

106
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,340
You just returned.

107
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,830
You must have a lot to handle.

108
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,710
I'll leave you to it.

109
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:03,600
See you around.

110
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,820
Why did she bolt

111
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,150
faster than a rabbit just like last time?

112
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,670
So fast that I didn't even have time to answer your question.

113
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,610
Captain Jiang.

114
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,390
Reporter Song.

115
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,010
I...

116
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,130
I'm here to take my bag.

117
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,409
Reporter Song,

118
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,940
what's the rush today?

119
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,179
I...

120
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,870
Did someone bully you?

121
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,559
Just tell me.

122
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,290
I'll make him run ten kilometers.

123
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:46,650
Nope.

124
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,110
Is tomorrow's mission

125
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,170
explosion-proof demining?

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,720
How'd you know...

127
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,160
You met Zan today, didn't you?

128
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,300
I gotta go.

129
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,130
Can you really make him run ten kilometers?

130
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,930
[The Next Day]

131
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,280
Come on! Let's go!

132
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,030
Are you strong?

133
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,280
Are you fast?

134
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,800
Sorry.

135
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,130
Due to another blackout at the hotel,

136
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,440
my phone died,

137
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,320
and the alarm didn't go off.

138
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,400
Am I late?

139
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,410
No.

140
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,370
We're just on time.

141
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,580
We also just got ready.

142
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,460
Hop in.

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,490
Okay.

144
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,250
Come on.

145
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,580
Thank you.

146
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,250
Zan.

147
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,220
Give me a hand too!

148
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,580
You take this car too?

149
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,250
Of course!

150
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,590
I'm going to protect Reporter Song.

151
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,180
Reporter Song,

152
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:17,880
see?

153
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,360
Our Zan's a perfect gentleman,

154
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,370
totally outperforming me.

155
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,360
You're right about Instructor Li.

156
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,400
Why did I humiliate myself?

157
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,560
Reporter Song.

158
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,340
Please take a seat inside.

159
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,100
This truck's turn really gives

160
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,060
a strong centrifugal force.

161
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:58,840
The floor's wet.

162
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:01,890
Thanks.

163
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,730
Look,

164
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,980
Zan is the best gentleman.

165
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,510
Let me check your scanner.

166
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,510
Alright, here.

167
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:21,890
Oh, no.

168
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,680
Why is he smiling?

169
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,070
Did he spot something?

170
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,520
Give me your bag.

171
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,730
It's quite heavy.

172
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,650
Thank you.

173
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,610
Let's go.

174
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,270
Why is there no one in this village?

175
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,860
They all evacuated in a hurry.

176
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,160
The minefield left by the armed riots

177
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,580
is way too close to the village.

178
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,660
Yesterday, some farmers stepped on a mine

179
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,180
on their way to the field.

180
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,210
A couple died.

181
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,950
So the villagers were all evacuated to another area.

182
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,590
They won't be back until we finish demining.

183
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:54,890
Reporter Song.

184
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,820
Please strictly follow our trail.

185
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,090
Be careful

186
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
and stay safe.

187
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,460
Oh, okay.

188
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,610
Don't scare her.

189
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,610
If something happens to us, it'll be a heroic sacrifice.

190
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,770
But if something happens to Reporter Song,

191
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,390
it's gonna be your negligence.

192
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,550
If something happens to you two, it'll be my dereliction of duty anyway.

193
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,010
Reporter Song,

194
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,730
how about you follow Zan today?

195
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,220
Let our Instructor Li

196
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:22,860
take full responsibility for you.

197
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,180
Don't bother.

198
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,450
I'll be extra careful.

199
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,130
Can you at least act like a captain?

200
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,850
You brought it up first, remember?

201
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,670
Okay.

202
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,100
Attention!

203
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,020
Operation.

204
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:42,770
Go!

205
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,450
Be careful.

206
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,010
September 4th,

207
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:05,940
1 p.m.—

208
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,130
I've followed a squad led by Lieutenant Jiang Lin

209
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,880
from the East Country Army

210
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,640
to a village 60 kilometers away from Uglai City

211
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,960
for a demining mission.

212
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,880
Put on your vest.

213
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:35,770
Let me help you.

214
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,190
Thank you.

215
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,300
Done.

216
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:58,490
Let's go.

217
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,100
Take it slowly.

218
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,170
Roger.

219
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:37,730
Zan.

220
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,940
There's a tripwire grenade here!

221
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,250
Be careful, everyone!

222
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,250
What is a tripwire grenade?

223
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,780
Literally a mine that explodes with one trip.

224
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,250
Be careful.

225
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,330
Stay here.

226
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,090
Don't get any closer.

227
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,700
Stop.

228
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,080
There's a grenade underneath.

229
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,360
Stay back.

230
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,820
You're still here.

231
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,120
Sure!

232
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,710
Thought you ran away out of fear.

233
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,350
Don't underestimate me.

234
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:03,300
I dare not.

235
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:05,890
Clear!

236
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,710
There used to be

237
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,170
a safety pin here,

238
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,380
yet it's been pulled out.

239
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,210
The handle of the grenade

240
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,650
was placed under the mine.

241
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,260
Once the mine was removed,

242
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,480
it'd explode.

243
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,410
So dangerous.

244
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,750
What should we do with this mine?

245
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:26,950
That's it.

246
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,040
That's all?

247
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,920
Then will it explode?

248
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,260
Are you laughing at me?

249
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,760
I should really have made you run ten kilometers.

250
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,420
Pardon?

251
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,470
Nothing.

252
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,160
No worries.

253
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,300
I've already deactivated the grenade.

254
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:02,300
Captain.

255
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,130
We just found an anti-personnel bounding mine

256
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,610
and a grenade.

257
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,790
But there's a crack on the handle of this grenade.

258
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,340
Should we just get rid of it on the spot?

259
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,780
Throw it over there.

260
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,300
Have you ever seen a grenade detonation?

261
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,540
Do you want to film this?

262
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,290
Come on.

263
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,330
Cover your ears.

264
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,280
Stand behind me.

265
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,930
Detonation!

266
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,540
Be careful! OK!

267
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,810
Done.

268
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,210
Thank you.

269
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:09,780
See

270
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,370
if the recording is good.

271
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,410
I told you I'm a doctor.

272
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,540
I need to go into the village to get medicine.

273
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,170
I told you

274
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,930
there's a minefield on the way to the village.

275
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,650
You must wait until we clear the mines before we allow you in.

276
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,410
What's going on here?

277
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,580
Captain Jiang,

278
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,580
here's the thing.

279
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,500
A patient bitten by a viper

280
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,060
is in dire need of antivenom.

281
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,930
But the hospital just ran out of stock.

282
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,100
Only the warehouse in this village

283
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,020
has some of it.

284
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,280
It took me ten minutes to come here.

285
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,410
I need ten more minutes to go back.

286
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,330
I must get the antivenom within half an hour.

287
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,890
Or my patient's life will be in danger.

288
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:36,780
Dr. Pei,

289
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,400
we know you're desperate to save the patient.

290
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,040
The patient's life matters,

291
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,060
and so does yours.

292
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,210
We must ensure your safety.

293
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,420
You have your duty,

294
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,880
and I have mine.

295
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:47,970
Captain,

296
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,060
please let me in.

297
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,100
It'll be too late if you still stop me.

298
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,140
I'll go get you the antivenom.

299
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,170
Zan,

300
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,370
don't try to act like a hero.

301
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,340
Don't worry.

302
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:02,860
I know what to do.

303
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,720
I can nail it faster than others.

304
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:05,630
I'll guarantee safety.

305
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,720
Tell me the name of the antivenom.

306
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,210
Go and come back quickly.

307
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:19,970
Here you are.

308
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:24,460
Thank you.

309
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,850
And the key.

310
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:34,830
Okay.

311
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,840
Is he also a volunteer?

312
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:41,610
Yep.

313
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,610
He's a pro at bomb disposal and demining.

314
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,710
He lives in our camp like you.

315
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,580
Be careful!

316
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,230
Thank you.

317
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,490
Are you also Chinese?

318
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,110
What a coincidence.

319
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,060
I'm also Chinese.

320
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,130
My name's Pei Xiaonan.

321
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,750
Are you a reporter?

322
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,410
Yes.

323
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,140
Some time ago,

324
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:20,960
a TV channel in China

325
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,220
aired a show about East Country.

326
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,540
I quite like it.

327
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,510
But the frequent power cuts here

328
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,860
made me watch it in bits and pieces.

329
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:31,740
Captain Jiang,

330
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:32,370
sorry.

331
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,100
I was too anxious.

332
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,880
I'm just kind of a hothead.

333
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,440
But I'm actually a nice guy.

334
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,740
It's okay.

335
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,370
Zan must've destroyed an unblown bomb

336
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,120
on the spot.

337
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,490
Here you are.

338
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,390
Thank you.

339
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,390
Thank you so much.

340
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,710
You've been a big help.

341
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,270
You're welcome.

342
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:29,650
Here.

343
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,710
Thank you.

344
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,860
See you at the camp.

345
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:01,890
Thanks.

346
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,370
Well, my hands got dirty. Help me wipe them.

347
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,600
You hit me?

348
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,320
Zan...

349
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,710
On the way,

350
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,610
we just ran into a local old man

351
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,490
with a huge sack on his back.

352
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,110
Sir,

353
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,020
don't be afraid.

354
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,130
We're a team sent to clear the mines

355
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,260
for the village.

356
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,500
We are curious.

357
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,370
How heavy is the package you're carrying?

358
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:58,890
So heavy!

359
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,340
Come on, let's try.

360
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,370
Are you in your 80s?

361
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,650
83.

362
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,300
You're here to help us with the mines.

363
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:12,260
But I don't have much to offer.

364
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,210
Thank you.

365
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,850
Your camera

366
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,660
is always on.

367
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:41,840
My bad?

368
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,420
The old man is 83 years old.

369
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,370
You're not into snacks, right?

370
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,540
It's mine now.

371
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,530
Thank you.

372
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,330
Bye.

373
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,340
You don't like snacks?

374
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,370
Then why did you take it?

375
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,320
This way,

376
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,560
he'd feel happier.

377
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,170
Otherwise,

378
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,340
he might think

379
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,290
we don't appreciate the things he gave us.

380
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,450
Goodbye.

381
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:17,130
Children's happiness is easy to come by.

382
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,210
I want to be a soldier!

383
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,890
Give me!

384
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,100
Give me,

385
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,970
Zoro!

386
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,820
Give me back my ring!

387
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,500
Thanks.

388
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,930
Zoro!

389
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:42,210
I'm getting angry if you don't give me back!

390
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,140
Give me!

391
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,260
Give me!

392
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,460
Little one,

393
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,780
did you get lost?

394
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,720
It's mine.

395
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,340
Here.

396
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,140
Zan, where have you been?

397
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,190
I've met her before.

398
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,650
I'm really getting angry now!

399
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,650
Give me!

400
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,700
Don't bully the girl.

401
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,580
Give me!

402
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:14,860
Give me!

403
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,320
You naughty boy.

404
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,890
What are you doing?

405
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,370
Zan!

406
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,300
Hi, Sia.

407
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,610
Why did you bully her?

408
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,500
Thank you.

409
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,970
He doesn't bully me.

410
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,500
We're just having fun.

411
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,820
Did he take your ring?

412
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,890
You seemed anxious.

413
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,300
Because my mom gave that to me

414
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,780
as my wedding gift.

415
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,020
Sooner or later, it will be mine.

416
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,460
You are going to marry me when you grow up anyway.

417
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,740
No way!

418
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:49,540
Sia!

419
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,690
This is between me and my wife.

420
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,770
Mind your own business.

421
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,540
If I hadn't known Sia before

422
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,610
and seen them have fun together a lot,

423
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,280
I'd have misunderstood it too.

424
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:12,300
So you knew each other?

425
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,500
May I ask

426
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,930
how you got to know her?

427
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,360
[The Day of the Bombing Attack in Uglai]

428
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,830
I gave her a puppy before.

429
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,740
Zan!

430
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,110
I just heard that you pulled off

431
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,860
another heroic rescue of a damsel in distress.

432
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,580
Who did you save?

433
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,540
How old is she?

434
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,500
What does she look like?

435
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,340
Did she plan on

436
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,740
devoting herself to you?

437
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,130
Unknown age.

438
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,720
Pretty looks.

439
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,510
She did already give herself to me.

440
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:01,610
Here.

441
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,170
So you saved a dog?

442
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,580
What's wrong?

443
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,490
A dog is a life too.

444
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,060
Just like you.

445
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,170
Zan,

446
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,740
how can you compare me to a dog?

447
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,210
This is a dog.

448
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,300
Yes.

449
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,500
It's indeed a bit cuter than you.

450
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:20,450
Zan!

451
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,450
There's someone looking for you.

452
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,300
It's a girl.

453
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,740
It's a real girl this time.

454
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,320
Hey little miss,

455
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,740
what do you want from him?

456
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,650
Did he snatch your candy?

457
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,890
Are you the teacher here who teaches landmine disposal?

458
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,340
I want to learn from you

459
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,010
how to dismantle landmines.

460
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,490
Do I have to pay tuition fees?

461
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,690
How much is it?

462
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,480
Can I pay later?

463
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:51,970
Wait, wait.

464
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:52,690
Just hold on.

465
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,890
Little miss,

466
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,330
you want to learn how to defuse bombs?

467
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,300
Do you know how dangerous it is?

468
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,210
Look.

469
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,260
Don't fool around

470
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,260
and go home.

471
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,780
Little miss,

472
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,660
could you tell me why you want to learn it?

473
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,650
Because...

474
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,640
Because my dog was killed

475
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,410
by a landmine yesterday.

476
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,890
Could you please wait a minute here?

477
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,300
Don't worry.

478
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,580
I will protect and take care of it

479
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,050
as my own dog.

480
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,060
What's your name,

481
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,690
little miss?

482
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,860
Sia.

483
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:44,890
Sia.

484
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,650
I believe in you.

485
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:48,690
Thanks,

486
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,200
Sia.

487
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,340
Won't you miss it?

488
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,060
How can I find you

489
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,330
if you want to see it?

490
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,910
This is my name.

491
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,810
Just ask for Zan here,

492
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,370
and you'll find me.

493
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,130
Zan.

494
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,060
I knew it.

495
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,690
What happened after that?

496
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,420
And then I went on a mission.

497
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:42,810
Hey!

498
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:43,890
Stop!

499
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,130
And afterward,

500
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,300
when we were on our way,

501
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,910
-we met someone on a motorbike...
-Someone on a motorbike...

502
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,450
Some unlucky guy?

503
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,370
Just over here.

504
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,740
Yes, Captain.

505
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:08,969
Captain Jiang.

506
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,150
Reporter Song.

507
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,570
Look at your radiant smile!

508
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,860
Is it because you're satisfied with today's shoot?

509
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:20,860
Indeed.

510
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,219
Reporter Song also wants to do an interview with you.

511
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,239
Yes.

512
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,030
Captain Jiang,

513
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,139
I am wondering if you're available now.

514
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,780
I'd like to interview you about some details

515
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,300
of the mine clearance this time.

516
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,710
I-Interview me?

517
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,770
You want to ask about the demining, huh?

518
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,010
Our demining expert

519
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,659
is a way better person to ask than me!

520
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,409
Zan,

521
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,340
I'll leave you two to it.

522
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,520
Do your best for the interview.

523
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,020
Remember to wash your face and hair.

524
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,370
Make sure you look good on camera!

525
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:51,300
Don't disgrace me.

526
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,010
There you are.

527
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,580
Please take this seat.

528
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,260
It's okay.

529
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,620
If you find anything wrong,

530
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:48,700
we can stop the recording

531
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:49,660
and redo it.

532
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,370
Then let's begin.

533
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,090
Please briefly introduce today's mission.

534
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,140
Our mission today was to

535
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,730
clear a newly discovered minefield.

536
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,050
It was located...

537
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,510
What's wrong?

538
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,610
You don't have to speak like me.

539
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,930
Just be yourself.

540
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,820
Because I'm a reporter,

541
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,930
a less important role,

542
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,720
yet you're the protagonist.

543
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,300
I see.

544
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,700
Then let's start over.

545
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,040
Okay.

546
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:57,780
Hold on a minute.

547
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,010
What's wrong?

548
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:00,970
Should I look at the camera

549
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,700
or look at you?

550
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,120
Either works.

551
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,340
I think I'll just look at you.

00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,010
Today's demining operation

576
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,890
was carried out by a squad from East Country.

♫How I wish I could hear you say♫

00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,090
♫That you like me too♫

♫The melody hidden in my heart is made for

587
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:48,020
♫I really want to tell you♫

588
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,050
I'm their technical instructor.

589
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,100
♫I'm so into you♫

590
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:59,020
♫I'm so into you♫

591
00:38:59,340 --> 00:38:59,820
What's wrong?

592
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,120
Nothing.

593
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,880
So,

594
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,980
will you confront armed rioters

595
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,340
head-on?

596
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,510
Will it be dangerous?

597
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,080
As a volunteer,

598
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,750
my main task

599
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,920
is to train East Country's soldiers

600
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,180
in demining and bomb disposal,

601
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,930
so I mainly work in the back.

602
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,290
Technically, it's not too dangerous.

603
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,890
But

604
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,100
given the complicated

605
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,230
situation here,

606
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,940
I had been mentally ready

607
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,560
for any possible dangers

608
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,860
during the rescue

609
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,870
before I came to East Country,

610
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,310
just like you, Reporter Song.

611
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,350
This is the last question.

612
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,750
If I remember correctly,

613
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,650
this should be the last question.

614
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:22,670
Yes.

615
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:24,770
You have a good memory.

616
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,830
The interview is over.

617
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,390
Thank you for your time.

618
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:29,860
You're welcome.

619
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,670
How do I dismantle this?

620
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,530
I can do it myself.

621
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,200
Pull this.

622
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,020
Here.

623
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,200
Thank you.

624
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,060
Can I interview you too?

625
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:14,750
Me?

626
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,450
Did your station only send you to East Country?

627
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,050
Two male colleagues of mine were here last week.

628
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,130
But they all went to Hepu.

629
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,130
I saw them switch

630
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,960
from the studio to an outdoor live broadcast on TV.

631
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,260
You usually need two people for the latter one, right?

632
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,010
One is in charge of filming,

633
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,620
and the other is for speaking.

634
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,970
It could be a solo job too.

635
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,520
You just need to find a good angle,

636
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:41,270
just like when you are taking a selfie.

637
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,190
So you cover

638
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,550
both the on-camera and directing duties?

639
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,570
Recording,

640
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,480
editing,

641
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:52,940
and satellite transmission

642
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,020
are also part of my job.

643
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,280
Thank you.

644
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,220
You're not exactly what you seem.

645
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,330
What do you mean?

646
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,050
You are not quite the crybaby you appear.

647
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:27,820
Nothing.

648
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,800
I'll walk you out.

649
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:31,770
Okay.
