[The White Olive Tree]

00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,750
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,500
[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

4
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,640
I might never see him again.

5
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,520
Even if I do,

6
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,640
can I still recognize those eyes?

7
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,470
Ms. Song.

8
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,630
I'm Mr. Luo's friend.

9
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,000
He's giving a speech,

10
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,930
so he asked me to bring you an umbrella.

11
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,530
The moment I saw him again,

12
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,690
I knew

13
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,470
no matter how much time had passed,

14
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,230
I'd always recognize those eyes.

15
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,750
The rain is too heavy.

16
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,560
Your face is all wet.

17
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,750
Here, wipe it.

18
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:55,630
I'll walk you over.

19
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,870
Where are you headed?

20
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,520
North Gate Street.

21
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,790
It's quite far,

22
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,150
but my car is over there.

23
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,680
That's your car?

24
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,150
The chassis is too low.

25
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,310
Let me give you a ride.

26
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,280
Where on North Gate Street?

27
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,000
Green Alley.

28
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,560
Looking for someone

29
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,280
is like looking for something.

30
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,680
The harder you look, the less likely you'll find him.

31
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,240
But if you stop looking,

32
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,959
he might just show up

33
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,860
one day.

34
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,560
That man did have a point.

35
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,830
Do you want the AC on?

36
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:31,800
No, thanks.

37
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,790
When the AC is on,

38
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,870
I get carsick.

39
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,360
Carsick?

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,360
Reporters often have to go out on field assignments, right?

41
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,920
What do you do then?

42
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,870
I usually try to sleep through it.

43
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,630
Close your eyes and rest then.

44
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,659
I'll let you know when we're close.

45
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,870
I don't feel like sleeping now.

46
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,160
Are you Chinese?

47
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,720
Is your home in Liang City?

48
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,800
I'm of Chinese descent,

49
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,710
but by nationality,

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,830
I'm from Xi Country.

51
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,360
You seem familiar with Liang City.

52
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,240
You don't even need navigation.

53
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,390
After my dad retired,

54
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,960
he wanted to return to his roots,

55
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,600
so he settled in Liang City.

56
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,440
I stay here for some time

57
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,510
whenever I'm free.

58
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,040
In Eastern Country,

59
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,170
you saved me.

60
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,430
Do you remember?

61
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,080
Of course.

62
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,750
I thought you forgot.

63
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,680
How could I forget?

64
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,920
I just wasn't sure

65
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,110
if bringing it up

66
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,600
would make you feel uncomfortable.

67
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,000
You saved my life.

68
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,600
Back then,

69
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,070
I even forgot to say thank you.

70
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,040
I've always wanted to find you

71
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
to express my gratitude.

72
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,870
You're welcome.

73
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,120
It was my duty.

74
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,390
Why did you interview Mr. Luo?

75
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,620
I want to do

76
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,440
a special report on Eastern Country.

77
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,600
Volunteers are one of the topics.

78
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,950
That sounds interesting.

79
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,820
Would you watch

80
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,680
a show like that?

81
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,030
I would watch it.

82
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,120
Then if I needed to interview you,

83
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,160
would you agree?

84
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:14,870
Yes.

85
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,480
Rainy days are so good.

86
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,659
This pagoda has nearly 3,000 years of history.

87
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,980
It's the place the people of Eastern Country dream of visiting.

88
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,909
Sorry.

89
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,570
I'm late.

90
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,750
No worries.

91
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,180
You eat first.

92
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,650
Give me a minute.

93
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,430
Okay.

94
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,440
How's my mentor been lately?

95
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,640
To be honest,

96
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,720
I don't know.

97
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,980
I've barely seen him

98
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,750
since I came back.

99
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,230
He's out early and back late.

100
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,270
He said he just got a new job,

101
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,650
and it was recommended by you.

102
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:44,670
I totally forgot.

103
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,750
I just set him up with some home renovation work

104
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,260
in an old neighborhood.

105
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,310
So,

106
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,510
after this volunteer task,

107
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,750
would you come back to help me?

108
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,540
I'd love to.

109
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,000
It's a deal.

110
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,600
Great!

111
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,890
You know what?

112
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,320
It's so hard to get you to agree.

113
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,600
To convince you,

114
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,700
I'm going with you to Eastern Country for volunteer work.

115
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,750
If you still said no after that,

116
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,670
I'd have to give up.

117
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,670
Mr. Luo,

118
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,870
most people

119
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,600
wouldn't say that out loud

120
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,750
because the other person might change their mind,

121
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,830
thinking you're not committed enough.

122
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:50,960
But you wouldn't.

123
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,440
Instead, you'd see me as

124
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,000
sincere

125
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:56,960
and frank.

126
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,670
And,

127
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,960
you're the gentlest

128
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,720
yet…

129
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,010
most determined person I've met.

130
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,440
The first half of that

131
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,630
was very sincere,

132
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,050
but the second half...

133
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,780
You've got something else you need from me, don't you?

134
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,360
When you start awkwardly praising someone,

135
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,360
it usually means you want a favor.

136
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,590
What do you think about…

137
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,960
reporters?

138
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,910
Reporters?

139
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,870
Pretty good.

140
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,320
Knowledgeable,

141
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,910
thoughtful,

142
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,270
and socially responsible.

143
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
And...

144
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,960
You're a good person.

145
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,810
You should go now.

146
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,750
I don't want you to die here with me.

147
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,320
Also brave.

148
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,510
That makes things easier.

149
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:11,910
Forget it.

150
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,440
I'll talk to you when they start

151
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,320
pressuring me again.

152
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,470
Eat up.

153
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,390
After dinner,

154
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,480
I need to discuss a case with you.

155
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,930
After Song Ran's short film was aired,

156
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,540
the response was unexpectedly good.

157
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,000
Shen Bei,

158
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,870
we've discussed it.

159
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,570
For next month's topic,

160
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,750
we want both

161
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,890
the Eastern Country idea from Song Ran

162
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,630
and your original topic

163
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,840
to be developed into detailed proposals.

164
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,110
We'll decide the final topic

165
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,030
based on those proposals.

166
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,550
Isn't this what you wanted?

167
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,600
Why are you looking so down?

168
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,420
Were you hoping

169
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,510
to win without a fight with that short film?

170
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,400
I guess whatever I say now,

171
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,600
you'd think I'm being hypocritical, right?

172
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,390
Don't get me wrong.

173
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,630
I have no issue

174
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,650
with this fair competition.

175
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,880
Let's each do our best.

176
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,530
Today's the weekend.

177
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,960
I came to return the umbrella

178
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,440
without knowing if he'd be here.

179
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,790
If I don't leave soon,

180
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,450
the guard might think I'm here to steal a car,

181
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,080
not to retrieve one.

182
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,320
Zan.

183
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,440
Ms. Song?

184
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,550
You're here for your car?

185
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,510
Yeah.

186
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,060
It's been parked here for a week.

187
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,820
Sorry for the trouble.

188
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,630
No trouble at all.

189
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,720
And that umbrella.

190
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,410
Are you planning to return it like this?

191
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,360
No.

192
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,840
I was just thinking about

193
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,750
where I should put it.

194
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,920
What was your major?

195
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,790
I saw your books.

196
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,390
I studied

197
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,840
structural demolition.

198
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,270
Here.

199
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,020
It's too hot.

200
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,200
Have a bottle of water.

201
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,000
My red string bracelet,

202
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,640
do you still have it?

203
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:34,920
It's okay.

204
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,150
If you can't find it, don't worry about it.

205
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,720
I do have it.

206
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,100
I just didn't bring it

207
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,750
with me today.

208
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:48,640
Well,

209
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,180
I'll bring it to you next time then.

210
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,160
Alright.

211
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,930
Is that bracelet

212
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,440
for good luck?

213
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,720
Is it a gift from your family?

214
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,220
-My show…
-I watched…

215
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
What do you think?

216
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:23,840
Pretty good.

217
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,920
It's very authentic,

218
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,030
not forced at all.

219
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,640
I really like it.

220
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,590
I also watched a few other TV shows

221
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,800
about Eastern Country.

222
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,310
They overplayed the tragedy,

223
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,680
which might evoke sympathy,

224
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,300
but that's not the real Eastern Country.

225
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,720
Exactly.

226
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,730
The Eastern Country I visited,

227
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,590
though filled with turmoil,

228
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,410
is also

229
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,510
brimming with vitality.

230
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,700
I feel the same way.

231
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,000
Unfortunately,

232
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,590
that film is too short.

233
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,890
There is so much more

234
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,070
I want to say.

235
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,080
That's a pity.

236
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,830
I'd love to see it.

237
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,830
Really?

238
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,240
Yeah.

239
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,510
So if I were to

240
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,350
compile the content

241
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,440
that isn't in the show

242
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,550
into a book

243
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,920
to give everyone a true picture of Eastern Country,

244
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,030
what would you say?

245
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,270
A book?

246
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,350
That's a good idea.

247
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,210
I actually enjoy reading.

248
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,400
That's great.

249
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,000
Wish you all the best

250
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:31,850
with your writing.

251
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,310
Thanks.

252
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:35,880
I should get going.

253
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,310
Wait a sec.

254
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,480
Last time I mentioned wanting to interview you,

255
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,990
you said it was okay.

256
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,480
Does that still stand?

257
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,240
Of course.

258
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,960
Then let's set up a time.

259
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,070
Sure.

261
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,230
how can I get in touch with you?

262
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,240
Can we add each other on WeChat?

263
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,480
I'll scan your code.

264

I'm really sorry.

265
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,680

268
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,140
Give me your phone.

269
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:34,960
Done.

This is my number.

271

What's your name?

272
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,960
Li Zan.

273
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,550
Zan, with the "wang" radical

274
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
and the "zan" for "praise."

275
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,240
You can just call me Zan.

276
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,160
You know that.

277
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,400

278
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,590
I'll be on my way.

279

By the way,

280
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,470
that pagoda was once damaged by a fire

281
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,310
and rebuilt later.

282
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,350
In your film,

283
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,230
you mentioned the pagoda in Uglai City,

284
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,830
saying it

285
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,640
has nearly 3,000 years of history.

286
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:24,830
Bye.

Ladies and gentlemen,

289
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,240
the plane has landed at Liang City Airport.

290
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,720
The temperature outside is 35 degrees Celsius.

291
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,310
The plane is now taxiing.

292
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,920
For your safety and that of others,

293
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,590
please remain seated and do not open the overhead compartments.

294
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,280
I watched that short film of yours.

295
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,160
After all that time in Eastern Country,

296
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,550
you made a video that's just about 10 minutes long.

297
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,680
It's too rough.

298
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,310
The content is scattered,

299
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,550
the theme isn't clear,

300
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,830
and it's overly sentimental.

301
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,350
It might be seen as fresh in your station,

302
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,350
but on a national scale,

303
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,590
it wouldn't make the cut.

304
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,720
Don't let this bit of achievement

305
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,630
blind you.

306
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,400
If you don't step out of this circle,

307
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,880
you'll never see your true self.

308
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,260
Whether you're gold or scrap iron,

309
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,550
you need to test it out there.

310
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,400
It's too dry there.

311
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,160
I can't handle it.

312
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:35,920
The air is bad too.

313
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,000
Don't be so delicate.

314
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,920
Have a good rest at home.

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,480

to go with Song Ran's topic this time.

320
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:02,680
Then,

321
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,030
can I see Song Ran's proposal?

322
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,130
Of course.

323
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,240
It's your team's topic after all.

324
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,330
Song Ran's proposal

325
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,760
is really good.

Do you know someone from the International Rescue Organization?

329
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,110
Is it for work or personal matters?

330
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,720
It's…

331
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,590
a personal matter.

332
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,880
I'm not interested in personal matters.

00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,030
Can you afford a house with your salary?

383
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,070
If I can't, I'll just rent one.

384
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,960
It's not like I'll be sleeping on the streets.

385
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,070
Fine.

386
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,680
You've got spirit.

387
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,890
I'm going back this weekend.

388
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,160
The flight is at 2 PM on Sunday.

389
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,720
You'll give me a ride.

390
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,250
This Sunday…

391
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,070
You'll give me a ride.

392
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,830
The new round of overseas assignments

393
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,680
is about to start.

394
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,000
If you have any ideas,

395
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,830
just tell me.

396
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,480
Ran,

397
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,920
your show has the highest ratings

398
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,290
and engagement in the station.

399
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,440
I'm sure the Reporter of the Year

400
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,310
will be you.

401
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,680
Thank you.

402
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,510
Alright, alright.

403
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,010
Let's discuss these matters after the meeting.

404
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,590
Submit

405
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,200
your application forms

406
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:45,960
by this Friday.

407
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,630
The second thing is about

408
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,460
the Reporter of the Year.

409
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,880
Let's congratulate…

410
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,880
Shen Bei.

411
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,700
It's really Ms. Shen.

412
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,200
I knew it.

413
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,310
Ran.

414
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,920
Don't be upset.

415
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,860
In my heart, you're the best reporter.

416
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:41,880
I'm not upset.

417
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,240
I'm just thinking.

418
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,400
Well,

419
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,240
if I submit an application

420
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,550
to go to Eastern Country now,

421
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,550
would the station approve it?

422
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,270
Eastern Country?

423
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,910
It's so dangerous there right now.

424
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,750
Ran,

425
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,710
even if you didn't win the award this time...

426
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,830
What are you thinking?

427
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,920
I'm not that fragile.

428
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,920
I'm just asking.

429
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,920
Everyone worked hard today.

430
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,350
I'm treating you to hot pot tonight.

431
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,570
Thanks, Ms. Shen.

432
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:33,960
That's great!

433
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,090
Sorry, I'm late.

434
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,440
Ms. Shen,

435
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,160
everyone from our team is here.

436
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,760
Why is there still an empty seat?

437
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:45,880
Who else is coming?

438
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,750
I forgot to tell you all.

439
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,580
I invited my boyfriend to come today.

440
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,270
Boyfriend?

441
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,240
Who is he?

442
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,780
I didn't invite him here

443
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,360
to show off.

444
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,730
We're working on the Eastern Country special, right?

445
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,680
My boyfriend has done volunteer work in Eastern Country,

446
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,110
and he was a demining volunteer.

447
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,880
Song Ran's short film

448
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,170
was so successful.

449
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,070
We must keep up the good work.

450
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,290
Maybe my boyfriend

451
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,100
can help us.

452
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,750
A demining volunteer.

453
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,480
That sounds impressive.

454
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,520
Drop the "sounds" part.

455
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,950
Anyone worthy of Ms. Shen

456
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,910
must be excellent.

457
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,270
Here comes my boyfriend.

458
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,440
Over here.

459
00:30:53,340 --> 00:31:01,450
♫Stepping on my heart alone♫

460
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,640
Isn't he the handsome guy in the short film?

461
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,860
You've got sharp eyes.

462
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:11,650
♫You're triggering a bomb unknown♫

463
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,150

♫Where the light reaches, shadows ripple in return♫

465
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:32,030
♫Stay where you are, don't move♫

466
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,570
Here, wipe it.

467
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,440
This is my number.

468
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,550
I'd watch it.

469
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,200
You're welcome.

470
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,000
You can keep it.

471
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,660
He looks more handsome in person than in the film.

472
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:41,320
♫We fall, we're falling slow♫

473

♫We fall, we're falling slow♫

00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,310
I'll go get a dip.

475
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,270
She got so emotional.

476
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,770
I'm going to the bathroom.

477
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,710
Excuse me.

478
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,900
Ms. Song.

479
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,950
Y-Your bracelet...

480
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,100
I was afraid I'd forget to bring it

481
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,130
when I met you,

482
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,750
so...

I'm sorry.

499
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,190
I didn't give you a heads-up

500
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,920
before inviting my colleagues over.

501
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,660
Are you and Song Ran…

502
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,470
very close?

503
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,210
It's okay.

504
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,360
I have something to do.

505
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,030
I have to go.

506
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,960
Dad, I met Li Zan.

507
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,310
Did the meeting go well?

508
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,270
No.

509
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,090
I think I might have upset him.

510
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,850
Upset him?

511
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,600
What I mean is,

512
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,100
I like

513
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,350
Li Zan,

514
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,910
but the meeting didn't go well.

515
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,210
However, I won't give up.

516
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,480
He's…

517
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,390
indeed unique.

518
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,560
[Uglai City, Eastern Country]

519
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,000
Ms. Song.

520
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,300
Although my name is Sasin,

521
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,550
which sounds very Eastern Country,

522
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,740
I'm part Chinese.

523
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,580
That's why the station specifically sent me to receive you.

524
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,780
No wonder your Chinese is so good.

525
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,150
Eastern Country,

526
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,070
I'm back.

527
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,550
A female journalist.

528
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,920
And a pretty one.

529
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,140
Why would they send a female journalist?

530
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,430
I bet she'll be frightened into crying.

531
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,600
Sasin.

532
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:01,980
Good morning, Song Ran.

533
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,410
Morning.

534
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,340
Captain Jiang.

535
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,090
You've brought the volunteers back.

536
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,550
Yeah.

537
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,590
Ms. Song.

538
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,030
Captain Jiang.

539
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,390
You have a shoot today?

540
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,360
Yes,

541
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,550
in a town 60 kilometers away.

542
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:15,710
Alright.

543
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:16,740
When you come back,

544
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,630
stop by our camp.

545
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,720
I have something to discuss with you.

546
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:19,630
Okay.

547
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,700
Captain Jiang.

548
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:31,820
I heard today that you are growing vegetables at your camp.

549
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,030
Who's in charge?

550
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,480
Did you

551
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,700
get a volunteer just for that?

552
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,280
So what?

553
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,900
Planting vegetables isn't unusual.

554
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,180
Seriously?

555
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,820
No wonder you needed us to come.

556
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,250
I'll be helping too.

557
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,580
We're also raising chickens.

558
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,690
And we even sent some to the field hospital

559
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,150
to provide extra nutrition for the injured mercenaries.

560
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,880
Haven't you heard about this?

561
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,320
Then I should thank you on behalf

562
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,570
of those mercenaries,

563
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,300
Miss Journalist.

564
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:28,400
Miss Journalist,

565
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,480
could you honor me with a drink?

566
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,020
Are you here to do your job

567
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,540
or to harass girls?

568
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,280
Where's your team leader?

569
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:38,680
The leader,

570
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:40,810
the leader…

571
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,400
Where's the leader?

572
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,400
Oh, right,

573
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,350
I am…

574
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,760
the team leader today.

575
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,110
They actually let a mercenary lead?

576
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,720
What's wrong with mercenaries?

577
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,670
Mercenaries only care about money.

578
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,440
If we weren't here to make money,

579
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,610
who would protect your precious lives?

580
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,360
A baby who hasn't grown up

581
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,630
came to be a war correspondent.

582
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,070
Later on,

583
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,440
won't we have to be his babysitters?

584
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,510
Nonsense!

585
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,060
I don't need your protection.

586
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,230
Alright.

587
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,340
Then be a good kid, and don't go back on your word.

588
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,190
Let's go.

589
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,000
Get in the truck.

590
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:50,210
Ben, can you teach me some Chinese?

591
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,070
Why?

592
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,370
Are you attracted?

593
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,740
This girl is actually prettier than the other.

594
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,120
I like both of them.

595
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,550
These foreigners are all mercenaries,

596
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,710
hired to work for money.

597
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,480
You can't judge them

598
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,590
by military standards,

599
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,980
and you don't need to be too polite to them,

600
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,800
or they'll act like animals in heat.

601
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,030
Watch your mouth,

602
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,070
young boy.

603
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,480
With your attitude,

604
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,710
how did you become a journalist?

605
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,080
Are you Chinese?

606
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,230
Don't I look like one?

607
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:33,000
Or is my Chinese not fluent enough?

608
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,300
I practiced my Chinese hard

609
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,790
just so

610
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,710
I could marry a Chinese woman.

611
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,110
No wonder.

612
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,510
Kid,

613
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,190
you're from Eastern Country

614
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,600
but speak fluent Chinese.

615
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,720
Are you planning to marry a Chinese woman too?

616
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,070
Mr. Mercenary,

617
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,130
can't you tell

618
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,550
I'm also Chinese?

619
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,550
And I bet you haven't been to college, huh?

620
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,550
Naturally, you wouldn't know

621
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,560
that many colleges now

622
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,360
offer Chinese as an elective.

623
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,400
Having been to college is not so impressive.

624
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,880
Bullets don't care if you're a college graduate.

625
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,410
A college graduate, huh?

626
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,440
When a fight broke out, all you did was hide at the back.

627
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,320
You ran around

628
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,630
all over the place when you should

629
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,480
have covered the news.

630
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,800
Can you even finish your task?

631
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,920
Won't you get scolded when you go back?

632
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,110
Shut up!

633
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,280
Mind your own business.

634
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,030
Watch out!

635
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,440
Clear.

636
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,760
If I minded my own business,

637
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,230
you'd have died.

638
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,540
It's okay.

639
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:15,700
He wasn't hiding at the back.

640
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,490
He was trying to protect the civilians over there.

641
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,090
Protecting civilians is our job.

642
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:22,710
Yes,

643
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,920
but this is his country,

644
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:25,880
his people.

645
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,470
He wants to protect this place more than you or I do.

646
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,470
Okay. Let's go.
