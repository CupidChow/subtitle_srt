have a quarrel?

224
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,840
Guys only fight.

225
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,270
We don't quarrel.

226
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,080
Did you fight?

227
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,750
Why are you so daffy?

228
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,270
No.

229
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,280
Mr. Luo...

230
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,270
Maybe something happened to him.

231
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,830
And he's always been

232
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,080
a bit of a strange character.

233
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,440
I'm already used to it.

234
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,830
You scared me.

235
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,900
I thought you had a fight.

236
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,440
Come here.

237
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,990
This is the beautiful reporter

238
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,820
I told you about.

239
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,510
She's so pretty in person.

240
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,320
Right?

241
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,150
Hello.

242
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,640
Hello.

245
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,550
was taken by her.

246
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,110
Awesome, right?

247
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,470
I need to use the bathroom.

248
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,370
Really?

249
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,920
We finally get to meet her in person today.

250
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,810
Hello.

251
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,680
-Awesome, right?
-You're so pretty.

252
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,550
Thank you.

[Meeting Room]

254
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,910
Dr. Liang.

255
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,890
I'm sorry.

256
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,240
I didn't know

257
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,820
Li Zan would bring his girlfriend here today.

258
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,080
I meant to ask you

259
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,960
to talk to Li Zan.

260
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,800
It's okay.

261
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,600
I didn't come here to talk to Li Zan to begin with.

262
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,400
I'm here to talk to you.

263
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,840
Me?

264
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,790
Li Zan came to me a few days ago

265
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,170
for a psychological test.

266
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,910
He said he wanted to be a volunteer again

267
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,760
and go back to Eastern Country.

268
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,770
Dr. Liang.

269
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,750
I plan to go back there to be an EOD volunteer.

270
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,060
The EOD certificate

271
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,150
requires annual

272
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,270
re-examination,

273
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,600
testing, and re-verification,

274
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,080
including psychological assessment.

275
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,630
So,

276
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,720
I'd like to ask you to give me another psychological test.

277
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,740
Sure.

278
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,910
I'd also like to see

279
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,120
how your treatment is going.

280
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,030
Thank you.

281
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,630
What's the assessment result?

282
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,210
He passed the test.

283
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,030
Everything is normal.

284
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,180
What?

285
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,240
He's fully cured?

286
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,890
At least from the assessment result,

287
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,030
he's qualified.

288
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,920
That won't make a difference.

289
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,300
I won't grant him the leave to go.

290
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,010
When we were playing real-life CS

291
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,510
during the company's team building last time,

292
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:08,960
he couldn't...

293
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,510
He couldn't even stand that.

294
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
How could I let him go to Eastern Country now?

295
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:19,960
Take a look at this.

296
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,550
Don't worry.

297
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,630
♫I got a feeling in my veins♫

298
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,750
This way.

300
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,740
♫A fire burning deep inside♫

♫Ready to fly, yeah♫

304
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,260
♫I'm breaking all the rules♫

305
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,020
♫I'm tearing down the walls♫

306
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,600
♫An explosion of sound♫

307
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,130
♫As your voices drop and call♫

308
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,470

309
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,440

♫On fire, on fire♫

315
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,480
Li Zan showed me this.

316
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,050
That's why I agreed to give him the psychological test.

317
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,080
This...

318
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,120
How could this be?

319
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,650
Li Zan said

320
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,920
he was not mentally prepared that time.

321
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,910
It was too sudden.

322
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,060
Besides, it was during the time when his memory was recovering.

323
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,730
He could be relatively sensitive and fragile at that time.

324
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,790
When his memory recovers,

325
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,270
the patient will generally enter

326
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,920
a relatively stable state.

327
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,240
But it was just a game.

328
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,440
It's completely different from the situation in Eastern Country.

329
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,310
I saw it with my own eyes

330
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,270
how his condition was after he returned from Eastern Country last time.

331
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,200
If he has to experience it again,

332
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,760
I'm afraid he'll never recover.

333
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
This time, he fully cooperated with the treatment.

334
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,090
That means he's very determined himself.

335
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,720
I think it's a good thing.

336
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,110
He needs

337
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,120
full support from you,

338
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,720
his leader and friend.

339
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,170
I got it.

340
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,270
Dr. Liang.

341
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,030
I'll think about it.

342
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,610
Okay.

343
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,620
-Dr. Liang.
-Dr. Liang.

344
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,790
Dr. Liang told you

345
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,160
about the result of my psychological assessment, right?

346
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,350
Yes.

347
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,680
She said you've made up your mind,

348
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,400
and I couldn't stop you.

349
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,230
Can you listen to

350
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,470
the reason why I made up my mind

351
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,930
before you decide whether to stop me?

352
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,600
Your reason is too great

353
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
for me to understand.

354
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,000
I do want to go back to Eastern Country

355
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,020
to do something more

356
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,660
for the people there.

357
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,240
It also has a lot to do with

358
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,480
how Jiang Lin was my friend

359
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,940
and how he died to save me.

360
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,740
Jiang Lin was a soldier.

361
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,550
Even if that person weren't you,

362
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,000
he would've saved him regardless.

363
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,790
For him, it might be true.

364
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,150
But for me,

365
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,680
I owe him my life.

366
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,400
But...

367
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,980
But that's not the only reason.

368
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,900
I also have my own selfish thoughts.

369
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,070
Even without Jiang Lin,

370
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,310
I still have special feelings

371
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,790
for Eastern Country

372
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,920
and the people there.

373
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,410
Because I saw with my own eyes

374
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,920
what they went through.

375
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,810
I can feel their pain.

376
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,960
I want to help them

377
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,680
from the bottom of my heart.

378
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,440
Isn't that

379
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,790
why I volunteered in the first place?

380
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,690
You were once a volunteer, too.

381
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,630
You should know

382
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,230
this feeling.

383
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,570
But now...

384
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,110
Your situation is different now.

385
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,360
It's exactly because

386
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,480
I'm different now that

387
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,510
I want to go even more.

388
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,260
Because I don't want to be different.

389
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,290
I want to be a normal person

390
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,480
like I used to be.

391
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,190
I don't want to

392
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,970
hide from the so-called stimulus

393
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,300
and pretend that I've recovered.

394
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,160
I can't stand this fragile feeling.

395
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,350
"It is better to die a broken piece of jade

396
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,060
than to live a life of clay."

397
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,640
I think you understand

398
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,410
this sentence too.

399
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,160
Because you've seen me

400
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,330
at my worst.

401
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,110
My ears

402
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,810
and my physical injuries have healed.

403
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,410
But there's still

404
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,060
a time bomb buried deep in my heart.

405
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,830
It could explode anytime

406
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,510
and blow me back to that mess again.

407
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,510
I want to demolish it completely.

408
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,480
Dr. Liang must have told you

409
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,920
it's risky

410
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,160
to face the stimulus head-on.

411
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,400
But there're also chances that

412
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,550
I can completely recover.

413
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,610
I want to give it a try.

414
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,710
I have

415
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,480
Ran now.

416
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,480
I don't want her

417
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,000
to protect my feelings carefully

418
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,840
for the rest of our lives.

419
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,480
I hope that after coming back from Eastern Country,

420
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,240
I can also give her

421
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,240
a normal and happy wedding

422
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,560
like this one.

423
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,550
So, have you told Reporter Song

424
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,460
that you're going to Eastern Country?

425
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,000
Not yet.

426
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,750
I want to wait until

427
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,970
I get the EOD certificate

428
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,240
before I tell her.

429
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,010
After all,

430
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,270
there'll be a simulation of a real explosive ordnance disposal.

431
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,370
I...

432
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,240
I don't know if I can pass.

433
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,000
If I fail,

434
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,200
there's no need for her

435
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,200
to go through the disappointment with me.

436
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,800
Don't go if you're so unconfident.

437
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,190
Alright.

438
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:08,880
Come on.

439
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,470
I'm sorry.

440
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,000
Everyone, please be quiet.

441
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,760
You must've waited long.

442
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,640
The next game...

443
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,680
It's been a while, Reporter Song.

444
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,830
It's time to test your tolerance.

445
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,500
Hello, Mr. Luo.

446
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,750
Let's see whose cheesy lines

447
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,300
are the most unbearable.

448
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,720
Let's start with the bride and groom.

449
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,920
Come on.

450
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,000
Do you know...

451
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,680
Cheesy lines.

452
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,770
What the

453
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,030
closest distance

454
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,180
between two hearts is?

455
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,510
What is it?

456
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,350
This.

457
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,600
Next.

458
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,680
I'll go.

459
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
Do you know

460
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,200
where my heart is?

461
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,200
On the left.

462
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,110
No.

463
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,820
It's in your heart.

464
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,680
What should we do when it's our turn?

465
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:55,720
Who'll say it?

466
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,680
Do you know any lines?

467
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,270
I hear them

468
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,440
talk about this a lot.

469
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,310
I know a few lines.

470
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,470
Mr. Li.

471
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,340
It's your turn.

472
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,110
Your eyes

473
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,050
are quite pretty.

474
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,540
Really?

475
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,270
But they're not as pretty as mine.

476
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:32,860
You're right.

477
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,680
That's not how you're supposed to respond.

478
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,520
What should I say then?

479
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,190
You need to play along.

480
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,720
How?

481
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,440
You need to ask me

482
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,510
why.

483
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,440
I'll ask you again.

484
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,150
Okay.

485
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,650
Your eyes are quite pretty.

486
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,290
Really?

487
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,920
But they're not as pretty as mine.

488
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,640
Why?

489
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,850
Because I've got you in my eyes.

490
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,000
I used to think

491
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,800
weddings were boring.

492
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,720
A lot of weddings are just formalities,

493
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,480
with ceremonies on the stage

494
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,400
and people below eating with their heads down.

495
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,280
It's so embarrassing.

496
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,280
But today is different.

497
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,370
Everyone is sincere.

498
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,010
I found that

499
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,680
you science geeks

500
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,710
are all goofy.

501
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,590
That's cute.

502
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,400
I found that

503
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,630
you said "embarrassing" twice today.

504
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,880
Are you afraid of embarrassment?

505
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:06,890
Yes.

506
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,920
It's like I have a phobia about embarrassment.

507
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,070
And it acts up a lot.

508
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,770
A phobia about embarrassment?

509
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,760
Then

510
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,910
when we get married,

511
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,020
we won't invite

512
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,330
so many irrelevant people,

513
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,400
so that you won't feel embarrassed.

514
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,640
Whether they're relevant

515
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,640
or not,

516
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,320
it doesn't matter who doesn't come.

517
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,420
As long as you're there.

518
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,480
Zan.

519
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,320
Am I humorous?

520
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,470
Am I?

521
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,320
Not really.

522
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,960
Not very humorous.

523
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,070
I'm not humorous,

524
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,340
so why do you keep smiling at me?

525
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,550
Why?

526
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,350
Because...

527
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,050
Because I like you.

You drank so much yesterday.

I'm so sleepy.

555
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,220
I didn't know

556
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,910
you'd be grumpy when you got out of bed.

557
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
I'm not.

I have a meeting

561
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,990
this morning,

562
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,690
so I can't take you to the airport.

563
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,920
But I called a taxi for you.

564
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:31,970
It'll be there soon.

565
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,120
Zan.

566
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,310
There's something

567
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,670
I forgot to tell you yesterday.

568
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,330
What is it?

569
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,480
Go ahead.

570
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,210
I'm almost done with

571
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,650
my program at the TV station.

572
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,110
They want to invite me to stay.

573
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,140
But I feel like I've been out of job for too long.

574
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,550
I'm too scattered

575
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,230
to be employed now.

576
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,030
It's okay.

577
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:12,760
Just do as you wish.

578
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,000
I'll support you anyways.

579
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,110
However,

580
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,760
although the show is over,

581
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,650
I need to stay in Dicheng

582
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,020
for a while longer.

583
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,440
I've made some adjustments

584
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,370
to The Chronicles of Eastern Country.

585
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,710
I need to stay in Dicheng

586
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,560
and have meetings with Mr. Luo and the others for discussion.

587
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,230
You've made some adjustments?

588
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,900
What kind of adjustments?

589
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,620
It's a secret.

590
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,840
Could it be...

591
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,920
Related to me?

592
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,960
Stop guessing.

593
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,230
Ran.

594
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,720
Did you make those adjustments

595
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,610
because you don't want to go back to Eastern Country?

596
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,890
What about you?

597
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:24,840
Yes.

598
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,210
But I can't really do it.

599
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,590
Or is it because of me?

600
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,710
It's because I'm not sure...

601
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,320
I'm not sure

602
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,550
if I can face

603
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,330
those things.

604
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:49,960
I...

605
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,110
I want to wait a bit longer.

606
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,760
I'm sorry, Ran.

607
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,840
I shouldn't have asked.

608
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,070
No one will

609
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,830
force you to face anything.

610
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,950
Don't worry.

611
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:18,760
Take your time.

612
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,080
By the way,

613
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,190
this is for you.

614
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,460
I hope you

615
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,170
will be safe forever, Zan.

616
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,920
This is only for my safety?

617
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,240
What about marriage?

618
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,030
You can rely on it for safety.

619
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,290
As for marriage,

620
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,370
you can rely on me.

621
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,350
Okay.

622
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,750
The car is here.

623
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,480
Text me

624
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,760
when you get on the plane.

625
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,570
I'll text you as soon as I get to the airport.

626
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,460
I'll text you when I board,

627
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,980
when the plane is about to take off,

628
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,350
and when I land.

629
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,550
Will you be tired of it?

630
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,520
Go.

631
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,790
Have a safe journey.

632
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,130
Be careful.

633
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,580
Sir.

634
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,450
We can go now.

635
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,280
Okay.

636
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,790
I wouldn't dare drive unless you let me.

637
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,040
I didn't want to disturb you.

638
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,190
Maybe there's some kind of ceremony or something.

639
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,230
We can go now.

640
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,180
Thank you, Sir.

641
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,550
Hello, Mr. Li.

642
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,410
Your volunteer application has been approved.

643
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,320
Our staff

644
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,710
will confirm the volunteer service period with you as soon as possible.

645
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,070
Please check carefully.

646
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,110
[Luo Zhan]

647
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,070
Li Zan.

648
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,800
Have you heard anything lately

649
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,190
about Eastern Country volunteers recently?

650
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,930
A bit.

651
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,590
Many volunteers are going to Eastern Country recently

652
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,180
because Eastern Country is in urgent need of them.

653
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,630
But I don't know

654
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,630
why they are in urgent need of them.

655
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,880
I didn't hear any news about it either.

656
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,360
What's wrong?

657
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,810
I just submitted the application,

658
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,080
and it already got approved.

659
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,920
The feedback was so fast,

660
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,430
so there must be a reason.

661
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,920
So I wanted to ask you

662
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,540
if you knew anything.

663
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,030
It's indeed a bit strange.

664
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,430
Hello.

665
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:02,920
Who's that?

666
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:03,930
Ben.

667
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,440
It's me.

668
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,500
Li Zan.

669
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,310
Zan.

670
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,860
I didn't expect it was you.

671
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,000
What's up?

672
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,550
How have you been?

673
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,410
I'm fine.

674
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,400
How are you?

675
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,890
How's the situation in Eastern Country now?

676
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,760
We're okay,

677
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,510
but Eastern Country...

678
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,480
How should I put it?

679
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,250
Ever since Ke was arrested,

680
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,280
the armed riots

681
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,060
have been negotiating with the government

682
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,010
for Ke's release.

683
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,400
Release Ke?

684
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,410
How is that possible?

685
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:43,710
Exactly.

686
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,110
The government turned down their request.

687
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,750
As a result, these bastards

688
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,420
started to expand the layout

689
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,440
and took revenge on the civilians.

690
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,960
They even used

691
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,360
those kind of dirty tricks.

692
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,000
The losses and casualties of civilians

693
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,530
are even more serious than before.

694
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,250
And we soldiers

695
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:03,580
can't really put our strength into use.

696
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,230
In fact, what Eastern Country

697
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,590
needs the most right now

698
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,540
is demining volunteers like you.

699
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,640
By the way,

700
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,280
how's it going between you and Song?

701
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,810
She's my girlfriend now.

702
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:24,930
I knew it.

703
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,320
The way you asked for assistance before

704
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,610
wasn't like you at all.

705
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:29,710
If it weren't for

706
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,920
the girl you love,

707
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,000
you wouldn't have done that.

708
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,840
Has there been any progress between you and Dr. Pei?

709
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,150
Our situation is different from yours.

710
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,710
You two are in love with each other.

711
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,510
And I dare say that

712
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,930
Song fell in love with you first.

713
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,690
As for Dr. Pei and I,

714
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,740
we've been blowing hot and cold.

715
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,000
It's quite hard to say.
