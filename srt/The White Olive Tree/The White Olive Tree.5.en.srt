00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,970
[Episode 5]

3
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,610
[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

4
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,400
What's happening?

5
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,509
Why's everyone running out?

6
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,940
There's a bomb inside. Don't mill around.

7
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,120
It's dangerous!

8
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,560
Excuse me.

9
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,430
Have you seen Rina?

10
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,470
Rina is in charge of

11
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,190
the VIP floors,

12
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,470
but I didn't see her come out.

13
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,260
I'll go ask Ben

14
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,080
if he needs help.

15
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,800
I'll help Sasin find Rina.

16
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,360
Ben.

17
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,320
What's going on?

18
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,190
A bomb was found in the VIP room on the fifth floor.

19
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,190
Have you found Rina?

20
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,510
She should be on the VIP floor.

21
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,990
It should be the top floor.

22
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,829
Oh no!

23
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,900
The bomb is below that floor.

24
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,150
Sasin!

25
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,810
I'm glad you're here.

26
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,430
I'll ask him to take you to see the bomb.

27
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,680
Let me in.

28
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,520
Okay.

29
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,680
My mom is still in the hotel.

30
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,000
There's no one inside.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,890
That's not possible.

32
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,130
No one saw my mom come out.

33
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,310
It's dangerous. You cannot get in.

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,470
-Go back!
-No, no, no.

35
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,000
Please.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,120
His mom is inside.

37
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,840
Please.

38
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,470
Sasin.

39
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,430
Stay back.

40
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,840
You cannot get in.

41
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:55,890
Benjamin,

42
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,140
my mom may still be inside.

43
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,200
I need to go in and find her.

44
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,120
Let him in.

45
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,500
If something goes wrong,

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,980
I'll take the hit.

47
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,950
Let him in.

48
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,210
Thank you.

49
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,079
I'll only give you five minutes.

50
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,280
The stairs.

51
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,720
Rina!

52
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,430
Rina!

53
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,700
Rina!

54
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,640
Rina!

55
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,520
Rina!

56
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,079
Stop taking things.

57
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:45,400
Song.

58
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,150
Stop taking things.

59
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,850
Sasin.

60
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,010
What are you doing?

61
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,690
These are the customers' important things.

62
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,590
If they're damaged, I'll lose my job.

63
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,960
Those customers ran for their lives

64
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,280
while risking your life.

65
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,240
Come with us.

66
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,600
Give it to me. Don't take this.

67
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,750
This is your trophy.

68
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,780
I think it's

69
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,190
more important than my life.

70
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,510
Then you have to leave quickly even more.

71
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,810
You're carrying two lives now.

72
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:16,600
Hurry.

73
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,410
Go.

74
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,329
Such silly words.

75
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,130
Sasin, hurry!

76
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,400
Where are the things the guests asked you to take?

77
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,700
Why did you come out empty-handed?

78
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,180
You only cared about your escape

79
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,600
and ignored their instructions.

80
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,190
They are VIPs, influential people.

81
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,360
They can make you disappear

82
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,560
with a snap of their fingers.

83
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,610
Do you know you're putting me at risk?

84
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,270
Do you understand?

85
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,510
You fool!

86
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,190
Shut up!

87
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,900
I told her to leave those things behind.

88
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,240
If there are any losses,

89
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,560
your VIPs can come to me.

90
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,120
You?

91
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,560
Who are you?

92
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
I'm her son.

93
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,160
My name is Sasin,

94
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,000
a journalist.

95
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,530
Rina.

96
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,110
I didn't expect you have

97
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,890
a journalist son backing you up.

98
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,310
I won't be kind either.

99
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,670
Since you didn't retrieve those items,

100
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,210
you don't need to come back to work anymore.

101
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,659
You go get 'em yourself

102
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,070
if those are so important.

103
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,930
Stop!

104
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,230
You're just a mercenary.

105
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,360
If you dare to make trouble,

106
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,190
I bet you won't get a penny

107
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,460
when you leave East Country.

108
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,470
You think you know our service better than we do?

109
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,180
Then you must know

110
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,540
we can do anything for money.

111
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,390
I'm afraid

112
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,930
you'll complain to our commander.

113
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,170
So, as I want to keep you quiet,

114
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,080
we will have to bring you back to the hotel.

115
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,700
The bomb is going to explode anyway.

116
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,670
Stop!

117
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,380
How dare you, you crazy man!

118
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,970
Let me go!

119
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,510
The bomb has been defused.

120
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,340
Ben knows it too.

121
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,360
He's just scaring the manager.

122
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,530
Instructor Li,

123
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,700
you play pranks too?

124
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,270
Is it bad?

125
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,360
It's good.

126
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,280
The manager said

127
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,560
they don't need those things anymore.

128
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:58,200
Rina's job is also saved.

129
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,600
Who do you think you are?

130
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,720
People like you

131
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,340
have no shame!

132
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,870
You took your things and ran away

133
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,120
and left my things behind.

134
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,190
That is inexcusable!

135
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,240
Shit.

136
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,530
Sasin!

137
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,240
Out.

138
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,120
Let's go.

139
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,870
I only knew that you're good at

140
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,320
demining and defusing bombs.

141
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,210
I didn't expect

142
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,360
you to be so good at fighting too.

143
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,909
I just took advantage

144
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,610
of the surprise factor.

145
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,530
Really.

146
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Fighting takes technique.

147
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,980
If you learn it,

148
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,980
you can also make great achievements with little effort.

149
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,830
You're good at dangling carrots.

150
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,680
Today,

151
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,310
it was relieving

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,960
to have you, Sasin,

153
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,560
and Benjamin.

154
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,030
But

155
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,710
I don't know what will happen

156
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,650
to Rina after we leave.

157
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,500
Can she really keep her job?

158
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,200
Will they give her a hard time?

159
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,550
You're really thinking far ahead.

160
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,700
Indeed.

161
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,270
Many things in this world

162
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,570
can't be changed easily.

163
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,180
We can only try our best to do more.

164
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,750
I want to go to the explosion site again.

165
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,620
See...

166
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,670
if I can do a bit more.

167
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,320
I'll go with you.

168
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,170
Help me.

169
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,200
Help me!

170
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,750
Help me!

171
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,690
Sia.

172
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,270
Sia.

173
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,340
Zan!

174
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,520
Zan,

175
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,650
Zoro is still inside.

176
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,970
Can you help me?

177
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,910
Zoro.

178
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,540
Is he the boy who played with you last time?

179
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,190
Sia.

180
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,150
Are you sure about that?

181
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,510
Yes.

182
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,310
He lives here.

183
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,570
But I can't tell which room is it.

184
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,640
Zan.

185
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,610
That's Zan.

186
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,850
Sia.

187
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,360
It's too dangerous.

188
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,380
If you go there, you'll distract Zan.

189
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,380
Just stay here and wait for us, okay?

190
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,000
okay?

191
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,290
Zoro!

192
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,880
Zoro!

193
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,320
Zoro!

194
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,920
Zoro!

195
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:27,610
Zoro!

196
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,150
Three...

197
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,100
Two.

198
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,030
One.

199
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,510
Zoro.

200
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,560
Zoro.

201
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,800
Zoro!

202
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,160
Zoro!

203
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,840
He's not in immediate danger,

204
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,000
but he still needs further examination in the hospital.

205
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,870
Please carry him onto the ambulance.

206
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,250
Thank you.

207
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,100
Thank you, doctor.

208
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:17,770
No worries.

209
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:22,700
Sia.

210
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,070
He's safe.

211
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,650
Don't worry.

212
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,270
We will stay together with him.

213
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,090
Okay?

214
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,790
Let's go.

215
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,790
Zoro!

216
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,430
Are you his family member?

217
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,970
I'm sorry.

218
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,990
You can't come along.

219
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,120
Now, I am his family member.

220
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,170
I am his wife.

221
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,480
Sorry.

222
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,230
Please let her follow.

223
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,530
They grew up together.

224
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:22,970
Okay.

225
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,690
Zan.

226
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,260
Thank you.

227
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,640
Sia.

228
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:40,960
Sia.

229
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,860
You can have it together

230
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,450
when he wakes up.

231
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,200
Take it.

232
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,950
Please take good care of them.

233
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,740
Okay.

234
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,430
Don't worry.

235
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,060
Thank you.

236
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,119
Zoro will be fine.

237
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,680
I'm sorry.

238
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,020
Actually,

239
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,200
the apple was meant for you.

240
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,970
But you can't taste it anymore.

241
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:50,960
Thank you.

242
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,180
The apple was sweet.

243
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,140
I'm sorry.

244
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,530
Your hand...

245
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,120
I didn't notice it just now.

246
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,640
I didn't notice

247
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,570
your hand as well.

248
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,320
You're more injured than me.

249
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,610
I'm fine.

250
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,990
It's just a minor injury.

251
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,750
I know.

252
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:50,940
If

253
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,830
I didn't let you treat my injury,

254
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,110
you wouldn't let me do it either.

255
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,890
You...

256
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,510
go to dangerous places

257
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,550
often as a volunteer.

258
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,890
Do you get hurt often?

259
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,370
No.

260
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,170
My main task is demining.

261
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,170
If I get hurt,

262
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,390
I'll usually get dismembered.

263
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,320
Look at me.

264
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,920
I'm fine, aren't I?

265
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,300
This is

266
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,440
the best I can do.

267
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,530
The bandaging is a mess.

268
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,360
I may not be able to

269
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,750
treat your shoulder injury.

270
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,220
Thank you.

271
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,790
I might

272
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,630
go to the hospital again.

273
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,960
Because of Jiang Lin...

274
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,670
Me too.

275
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,850
I...

276
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,910
Go...

277
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,830
I...

278
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,160
I'll go see

279
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,240
if I can schedule an interview with him.

280
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,360
Zan.

281
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,940
Captain Jiang.

282
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,500
Reporter Song?

283
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,700
Don't get up.

284
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,570
Why are you here?

285
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:30,450
I...

286
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,370
Reporter Song pities you because you're injured,

287
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,490
so she wants to interview you

288
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,980
as compensation and consolation.

289
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,160
Me?

290
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,240
An interview?

291
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,840
Yes.

292
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,770
Didn't you keep wanting to go on TV

293
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,420
after seeing my interview last time?

294
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,540
Really?

295
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,700
It's finally my turn.

296
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,200
You finally stepped aside.

297
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,580
I thought Reporter Song

298
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,670
only wants to interview you.

299
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:02,920
Captain Jiang,

300
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,200
let's discuss the content

301
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,310
of the interview first.

302
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:07,620
Okay.

303
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,000
[Jiang Yu]

304
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,010
Oh no.

305
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,470
Reporter Song.

306
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,920
I'm afraid today's interview will be postponed.

307
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,400
I have a brother in China.

308
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,990
I don't want him to

309
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,460
see my injuries and get worried.

310
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,170
This interview...

311
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:51,810
No problem.

312
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,640
When you're discharged,

313
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,160
we can schedule another time.

314
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,720
That'll be great.

315
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,160
It's not easy to get an interview

316
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,160
with Reporter Song.

317
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,790
I don't want to miss this chance.

318
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,230
Have a good rest.

319
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,400
Get well soon.

320
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,640
I’m looking forward

321
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,010
to interviewing you.

322
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,830
If you still don't answer the phone,

323
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,140
your brother

324
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,750
will be more worried.

325
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,030
Jiang Lin,

326
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,960
what's wrong with you?

327
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,240
Why didn't you answer my call?

328
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,630
I answered it now, didn't I?

329
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,200
I'm a soldier.

330
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,590
I have missions to complete.

331
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,620
I don't have time to stare at my phone all day.

332
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,280
What was your mission?

333
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,680
The explosion at the market, right?

334
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:04,460
Yes.

335
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,730
Did you watch the news?

336
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,130
Were you worried

337
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:07,910
I might get hurt?

338
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,590
Turns out it's good to have a brother.

339
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,680
I didn't dote on you for nothing.

340
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,410
Stop talking so much.

341
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,860
Are you hurt?

342
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:20,890
Are you kidding me?

343
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,200
The enemy who can hurt me

344
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,270
hasn't been born yet.

345
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,110
Really?

346
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,440
Why do I feel you're acting strange?

347
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,400
Are you lying to me again?

348
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,500
You don't believe me?

349
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,210
How about I video call you now

350
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,920
to show you how healthy I am?

351
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,640
No need.

352
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,420
I'm hanging up.

353
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,000
Well,

354
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,640
Jiang Yu.

355
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,260
You helped me just now

356
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,340
and got hurt.

357
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,700
Let me treat you to something nice.

358
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,150
No need.

359
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,160
I'm not hungry.

360
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,640
Can you stop being such a wimp?

361
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,700
You just let them snatch things from you?

362
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,300
Judging from the current situation,

363
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,110
we can kill these bastards by the end of the year.

364
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,140
At that time, I'll bring you to East Country.

365
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,520
I promise.

366
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,990
I don't believe you.

367
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,120
Let's go.

368
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,830
I'm hungry.

369
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,270
Buy me something to eat.

370
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,510
It seems Captain Jiang and his brother

371
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,630
are very close.

372
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,810
I've never heard

373
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,950
he has a younger brother.

374
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,990
That's actually his cousin in China,

375
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,660
but their relationship

376
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,370
is like real brothers.

377
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,510
Jiang Lin keeps saying

378
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,530
he wants to bring his brother to East Country.

379
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,880
So I hope

380
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,280
you won't mind.

381
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,050
I don't mind.

382
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,880
I just didn't expect

383
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,320
Captain Jiang to have such a delicate side.

384
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,060
He’s a bit like you, Instructor Li.

385
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,670
Weren't you worried Captain Jiang

386
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,000
would see your shoulder injury,

387
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,210
so you put on the jacket when you walked in?

388
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,840
Reporter Song.

389
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,220
You're quite observant.

390
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,230
That's why I could become a reporter.

391
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,550
How annoying.

392
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,430
I met a suspicious person who go thurt

393
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,530
and had to bring him to the hospital.

394
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,200
If he dies,

395
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,510
who will tell you useful information?

396
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,310
You're really ungrateful.

397
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,550
Stop talking.

398
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,780
You're injured too.

399
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,990
You want to stay here and get people's sympathy?

400
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,470
He needs more examinations.

401
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,750
Don't take it so seriously.

402
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,620
Just make sure he won't die, okay?

403
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,740
I won't be careless.

404
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,440
You do it, if you think you can.

405
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,600
He's also wounded.

406
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,380
Could you please check on him?

407
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:27,770
Okay.

408
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,720
You are so irresponsible to me.

409
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,880
She's a nurse,

410
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,670
and such a mean nurse too.

411
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:35,610
That's all you're getting for me?

412
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,920
You have to at least find a...

413
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,490
Find a doctor.

414
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,510
[Pei Xiaonan]

415
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,440
So you are a doctor?

416
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,590
And you're Chinese.

417
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,240
So you heard everything I just said?

418
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:22,610
The wound is so deep,

419
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,920
you're bleeding so much,

420
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,240
and you're still being picky?

421
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,980
I guess you don't want your arm anymore.

422
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,310
He needs a few stitches.

423
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,370
I'll get the anesthetic.

424
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,030
Please wait a moment.

425
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,030
Okay.

426
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,980
Don't bother.

427
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,920
Hurry up with the stitching.

428
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,230
It's getting dark.

429
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,750
Don't delay my drinking.

430
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,730
You're so willing to act tough.

431
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,300
Then don't blame me for not warning you.

432
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:08,540
It'll hurt.

433
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,870
You just need to get another tetanus shot later.

434
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:40,460
A shot?

435
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,050
That's not necessary.

436
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,640
No need for all that.

437
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,030
Don't go.

438
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,200
You need a shot.

439
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,160
Why are you running?

440
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,020
You're not afraid of stitches,

441
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,260
but you're afraid of shots?

442
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,760
It's a pity you wear a mask.

443
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,760
You're pretty.

444
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:22,830
Fine.

445
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,920
Sit down and get a shot.

446
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,820
I won't wear the mask.

447
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,010
Add one more condition.

448
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,750
Don't wear the mask

449
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,540
and you have to smile.

450
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,200
Hello, Director.

451
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,750
Song Ran.

452
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,180
Are you still sleeping?

453
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,920
Wake up.

454
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,020
Your photo

455
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,200
was very popular after the official website was uploaded.

456
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,400
Everyone is saying

457
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,110
your photo made the whole world

458
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,600
pay attention to East Country.

459
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,510
Hurry up and get dressed.

460
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,990
Connect with the station in half an hour

461
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,760
and do an online live interview.

462
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,820
Talk about the story behind the photo.

463
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,790
But Director...

464
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,050
Song Ran,

465
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,200
this is a rare opportunity.

466
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,640
Don't miss it.

467
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,110
You must seize it.

468
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,720
As of the ninth,

469
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,880
Uglai City has more than

470
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,880
187,000 new refugees.

471
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,280
Many of them

472
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,350
evacuated to School of Relief and Works Agency.

473
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,160
Other than casualties,

474
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,720
the explosion happened

475
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,830
in the heart of the ancient city of Uglai.

476
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,000
You scared me.

477
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,050
I thought you were a nurse.

478
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,920
The nurse doesn't allow you to check your phone?

479
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,720
Exactly.

480
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,200
Isn't it annoying?

481
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,960
They said I can get emotional easily

482
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,000
if I use my phone.

483
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,450
It's not that easy...

484
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,400
These bastards!

485
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:04,880
They're crazy.

486
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,020
I applied to the volunteer organization

487
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,650
to go to Happo.

488
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:27,670
You?

489
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,889
To Happo?

490
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,230
Are you kidding me?

491
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,150
You saw the news, right?

492
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:37,580
Happo

493
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,530
is indeed the most dangerous city in East Country right now.

494
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,000
Then why are you going there?

495
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,920
Things like what happened at the market

496
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,330
will only be 10 or 20 times more serious in Happo.

497
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,570
Zan.

498
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,030
You are neither a soldier

499
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,330
nor an East Country citizen.

500
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,820
You're just a volunteer.

501
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,990
You're taking the initiative to go to such a dangerous place?

502
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,110
Have you thought it through?

503
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,360
Yes.

504
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,560
I've also made it clear to the volunteer organization.

505
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,670
Going to Happo is my personal wish.

506
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,880
I'm a demining volunteer.

507
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,690
I'm more useful in Happo.

508
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,360
Also,

509
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,590
you know

510
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,230
I have a sense of admiration for soldiers.

511
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:35,920
So,

512
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,770
this is like paying tribute.

513
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,670
Hey, Jane.

514
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,100
Just bring me a transfer application form

515
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,790
and come to the hospital today.

516
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,110
Just bring it as I told you. No nonsense.

517
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,000
Are you...

518
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,480
I'm applying to go to Happo.

519
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,800
You just paid tribute to me.

520
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,320
How can I let you go alone?

521
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,200
I have to protect you.

522
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:25,960
What?

523
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,590
Am I not a soldier?

524
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,000
Why are you laughing?

525
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,940
Besides being a soldier,

526
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,460
I'm also older than you.

527
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,590
Two months and three days older than you.

528
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,810
I'm your older brother.

529
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,710
Do you disagree?

530
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,710
Can I disagree?

531
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:02,760
No.

532
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,110
By the way,

533
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,320
if you want to follow the military to Happo,

534
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,590
you must pass the military's physical test.

535
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,650
I know.

536
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,170
The volunteer organization told me about it.

537
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,850
What's wrong?

538
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,360
Zan,

539
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,930
you're so delicate and elegant.

540
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,680
What if you fail the test in the end

541
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,470
and I go to Happo alone?

542
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,360
Who should I protect?

543
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,670
Then I really can't let you down.

544
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,700
[Shen Bei]

545
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,190
Ms. Shen.

546
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,020
What's the name of your hotel?

547
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,070
Roya Hotel.

548
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,960
I heard it's dangerous over there.

549
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,070
Has the crisis been lifted?

550
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,060
Is it safe?

551
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:30,960
Yes.

552
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,840
It’s safe here now.

553
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,800
Besides, the hotel is near the military station...

554
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,380
Do you need supplies,

555
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,720
water, food, or clothes?

556
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:40,990
If you need them,

557
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,440
we'll send you some from China.

558
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:43,880
No need.

559
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,700
We don't lack anything.

560
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,590
No need to bother.

561
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,120
You hurt your hand.

562
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,360
How?

563
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,160
Is it serious?

564
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,320
My hand is fine.

565
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:54,510
Just...

566
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:58,350
Ms. Shen,

567
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,590
is there something you need from me?

568
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,440
Yes.

569
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,840
Director Liu said that,

570
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:08,060
as your supervisor, I should show more concern for you.

571
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,930
I'm showing concern for you now.

572
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,430
Fine, then...

573
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,380
Ms. Shen?

574
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,510
By the way,

575
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,100
next time you see Zan,

576
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,110
send my regards.

577
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:33,590
Okay.

578
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,280
I should be able to see him in the next few days.

579
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,760
The next few days?

580
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,760
If...

581
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,760
-She can see Li Zan often?
-If you have anything to say to him,

582
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:41,640
I can...

583
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,110
Thank you.

584
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,350
Is Shen Bei...

585
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,890
angry?

586
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,110
I heard someone applied to go to East Country this time.

587
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:23,880
Who is it?

588
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,360
I think it's Hu Chunwei.

589
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,280
Director,

590
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,320
I've asked all the questions you told me to ask.

591
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,400
I have completed the task you assigned.

592
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,440
Shen Bei.

593
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,330
I have something

594
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,660
to report to you.

595
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,550
I want to go to East Country.

596
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,010
I'm officially applying for it.

597
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,450
I already told you.

598
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,410
I know.

599
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,840
I just talked to Hu Chunwei.

600
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,300
He's willing to switch with me.

601
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,690
You’re making decisions way too arbitrarily.

602
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,800
Director,

603
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,440
I genuinely want to go to East Country for training.

604
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,460
I've always been too proud.

605
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,660
But what happened to Song Ran recently

606
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,900
made me reevaluate myself.

607
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,070
I can't stay in the office

608
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:12,870
and talk without taking action,

609
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,640
acting like I care about my subordinates.

610
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,190
I want to

611
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,090
experience the hardships she suffered

612
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,540
and report on things I haven't seen

613
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,700
or heard of before.

614
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,090
When you were young,

615
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,060
you also did

616
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,840
all the dangerous and difficult jobs

617
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,390
to gain your prestige today, right?

618
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,400
It's not wrong

619
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,160
to learn from you.

620
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,540
Shen Bei,

621
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,150
nowadays, I can't tell which things you say

622
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,190
are fake and which are true.

623
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,280
All of it is true.

624
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,960
It's just that

625
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,620
there's another reason I didn't mention.

626
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,510
Good morning, Song.

627
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,060
Good morning.

628
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,110
Reporter Song.

629
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,110
Instructor Li.
