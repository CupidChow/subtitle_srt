After everything that happened in Happo,

They're absolutely shocking.

It has caused an uproar internationally.

Many countries have started sending aid to Eastern Country.

Every traveler from afar

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,540
can reach out, take something from the tree,

21

named Li Zan before.

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,800
A patient who had been transferred by the volunteer organization

40
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,130
had been in a coma.

41
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,120
He finally woke up today.

He said that his name was Li Zan.

The skull was damaged. The ribs were broken.

44
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,810
The liver was punctured. The calf was broken.

45
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,570
And many organs were damaged.

Not to mention the external injuries.

47
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,300
He was too close to the explosives.

48

72

Whether you'll need them in the future

77
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,800
depends on how well the treatment works.

78
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,920
Right now, compared to the hearing loss,

79
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,680

87
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,720
are expected.

88
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,190
Your body is still weak,

89
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,000
which will definitely affect the healing process.

90
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,720
So,

91
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,360

Tinnitus is common in recovery,

105
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,960
but from his description,

106
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,320
the severity he's experiencing

107
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,590
goes beyond

108
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,290
what I'd expect medically.

109
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,650
Are you suggesting…

110
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,630
a psychological issue?

111
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,390
Given the extent of his symptoms,

112
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,320
I suspect

113
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,200
it's not just the physical impact of the blast.

114
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,960
There might be

115
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,870
reasons you don't know about.

116
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,870
Anyway,

117
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,150
I recommend

118
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,600
a psychological evaluation

119
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,250
for the patient.

120
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,440
You're coughing so badly.

121
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,800
Did you forget to take your medicine?

122
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,530
Hurry up and take it.

123

128
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,840
Pick two.

129

Your perspective might be more accurate.

138

Alright then,

139
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,050

164
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,420

To be honest,

there's no progress.

00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,270
I feel like

196
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,640
an isolated island floating in the darkness.

everything with me

200
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,290
and shares this pain with me, Li Zan,

201
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,710

Didn't you hear what those technicians said?

I have a last-minute meeting.

284
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,350
Dr. He will take you for your check-up later.

285
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,090
He's the son of a good friend of mine.

286
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,700
Just follow his instructions.

287
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,920
Don't forget to treat him to lunch

288
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,950

Are you Ms. Song?

00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:34,680
Nice to meet you.

293
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,860
I'm He Shanran.

00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,070
You're back.

295
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,400
How was everything?

296
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,020
Are you asking about the check-up

297
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,480
or the blind date?

298
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,070
How was the check-up?

299
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,490
How was the blind date?

300
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,670
The check-up went smoothly.

301
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,100
The blind date…

302
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,990
not so much.

303
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,360
You don't have feelings for Dr. He, do you?

304
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,440
Then what kind of guy do you like?

305
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,680
I'll help you find one.

306
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,390
Feelings aren't something

307
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,640
you can search for.

308
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,070
It's all about fate.

309
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,590
But if you find someone yourself, it's fate?

310
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,700
What's that supposed to mean?

311
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,510
You really don't know what I mean?

312
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,590
Don't think I don't know anything.

313
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,270
When you were injured and unconscious,

314
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,110
you kept calling someone called Zan.

315
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,230
In the videos you shot in Eastern Country,

316
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,410
there's someone who keeps appearing—

317
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,570
Li Zan.

318
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,330
It's him, isn't it?

319
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,790
He's the so-called fate

320
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,490
you're looking for.

321
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,480
All you think about is Li Zan.

322
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,440
I honestly don't know if you went to Eastern Country for work

323
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,260
or for dating.

324
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
How long have you been back?

325
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,160
I haven't seen you two meet even once

326
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,250
or make a phone call.

327
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,110
Look at yourself now,

328
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,480
lost in a daze all day long.

329
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,690
What's wrong?

330
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,170
Has fate run its course?

331
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,470
Since you've chosen to be a journalist,

332
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,330
then commit to it.

333
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,000
It's okay if you want to build your career

334
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,960
in the country.

335
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,310
Don't let your emotions cloud your judgment.

336
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,200
There are so many promising talents in this industry,

337
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,440
but in the end,

338
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,960
very few make it as renowned journalists.

339
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,240
I've seen that too many times.

340
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,420
You should strike while the iron is hot.

341
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,350
But look at you.

342
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,310
What are you thinking?

343
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,960
All this time, you haven't made any progress!

344
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,510
You've been sensitive and emotional

345
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,360
since you were a child.

346
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,920
I've always worried that

347
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,000
romantic relationships

348
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,200
would hold you back.

349
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:11,040
Great.

350
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,510
Just as I feared.

351
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
I'm telling you,

352
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,390
I absolutely won't allow you

353
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,540
to keep going down this road!

354
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,760
Whether I date or not, who I date,

355
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,280
whether I come to Dicheng,

356
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,070
and how I build my career—

357
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,750
those are all my decisions!

358
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,110
Can you just stay out of it?

359
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,750
You want me to stay out of it?

360
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,400
Fine.

361
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,190
Then who will look out for you?

362
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,720
Your dad's family is already a complete mess!

363
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,550
You're just an outsider there!

364
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,200
Do you want Li Zan to take care of you?

365
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,110
Fine.

366
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,720
Call him right now.

367
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,680
I'll leave you in his care this instant.

368
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,950
From now on,

369
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,880
whether you live or die, it'll be his responsibility.

370
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,920
I won't meddle again!

371
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,160
Why do you always have to

372
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,520
be so harsh?

373
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,310
Why do you

374
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,400
never care about

375
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,270
other people's feelings?

376
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,760
How am I…

377
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,710
I was too naive.

378
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,460
Open the door.

379
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:22,550

384
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,880

385
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,200
make me miss him less.

386
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,520

387
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,830
when Zan was far away in Eastern Country,

388
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,860
I couldn't stop missing him,

389
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,450
so what difference could the short distance between Liangcheng

390
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,820
and Dicheng really make?

00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,110
