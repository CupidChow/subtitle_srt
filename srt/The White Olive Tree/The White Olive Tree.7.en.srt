00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,550
[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

4
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,590
Li Zan.

5
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,450
What's the situation over there?

6
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,440
Reporter Song and I are on the No. 7 Highway.

7
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:00,710
What about you?

8
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,310
The battle is over.

9
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,400
We've wiped them out.

10
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,710
Let's meet up at the garrison

11
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,000
outside Happo.

12
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,190
I happen to be going to Happo for interviews too.

13
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,960
Okay.

14
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,060
Zan.

15
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,720
Is our beauty reporter alright?

16
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,500
Yes.

17
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,380
Is she hurt?

18
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,490
No.

19
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,480
Was she scared?

20
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,210
Why do you ask so many questions?

21
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,510
Can't I care about her?

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,850
No.

23
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,329
What's wrong?

24
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,400
Why are you blushing?

25
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,160
Were you scared?

26
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,470
No.

27
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,190
It's too hot here.

28
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,190
It's hotter than an in Uglai.

29
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,510
Also, I ran so much just now.

30
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,930
I was too nervous.

31
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,420
The might have rushed up my face.

32
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,250
Why are you here?

33
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,120
Jiang Lin and his team

34
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,520
received a mission

35
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,380
to head to Happo

36
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,470
so I followed them.

37
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,920
I'm sorry I didn't have time to tell you.

38
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,680
There was no signal on my phone.

39
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,400
But when I passing the checkpoint,

40
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,460
I heard that you were on your way there too.

41
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,079
How did you know I came to this town?

42
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,150
Fortunately, you drew a circle on the map.

43
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,360
Otherwise...

44
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,300
Otherwise, I would be a corpse now.

45
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,240
That's not funny at all.

46
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,720
What about you?

47
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,630
Why were you there?

48
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,000
I applied to do interviews

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,070
at Happo.

50
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,150
I thought I was being smart by taking a shortcut.

51
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,950
Actually, I went to the barracks to look for you today.

52
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,890
But you weren't there.

53
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,580
I asked them to send you a message.

54
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,720
At that time,

55
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,940
we should have left already the barracks.

56
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,870
We were going to the warehouse outside the city to get equipment.

57
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,830
So we left early.

58
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,630
I guess I'm not the only one who stood someone up.

59
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,270
What?

60
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,990
Nothing.

61
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,550
What's wrong?

62
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,180
I think there's a small wound on your neck.

63
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,640
I don't think so.

64
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,980
There's one. Stop the car. Let me have a look.

65
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,100
Stop the car. Hey!

66
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,200
You're bleeding.

67
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,240
I'm fine.

68
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,070
Don't touch it with your hands.

69
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,880
Your hands are dirty.

70
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,080
It must be from a glass shard that flew

71
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,940
♫Have you ever found someone♫

72
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,000

♫And say, Te Amo♫

83
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,270
Isn't erythromycin for treating eyes?

84

♫Still we don't know love♫

85

86

That's the eye ointment you're referring to.

♫When I'm with you♫

88
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,690
Either way, it is an antibiotic that can kill bacteria.

No.

♫Would you take the lead♫

103
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,870

Mom.

129
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,240
My baby.

130
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,090
They're coming!

131
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,990
They got food! Come on, get up!

Reporter Song.

133
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,280
We need food.

134
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,790
Hurry up.

135
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,120
Give me some food.

136
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,790
Give me some food.

137
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,400
Wait a minute.

138
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,790
I have more in my car. I'll go get it.

139
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:45,860
Here.

140
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,550
Sorry.

141
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,620
That can't be it.

142
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,310
I'll go look for food again.

143
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,270
Why is there none left?

144
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,220
There has to be some.

145

Reporter Song.

146
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,200
This can't be.

147
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,940
I'm sorry.

148
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,480
I'm sorry.

149
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,490

153
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,910
It's not your fault.

154
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,030
Let's share. Give me some for mine.

155
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,000
These people from Eastern Country

156
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,470
have gone through a lot of hardships.

157
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,690
Even at the brink of death,

158
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,550
they can still maintain order,

159
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,310
manners,

160
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,170
and the kindness in their hearts.

161
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,570
This is their dignity.

162
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,790
What we should give them

163
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,900
is not just water and bread,

164
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,390
but also respect.

165
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,560

168
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,880
What is that?

169
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,160
That's...

170
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,520
A white olive tree.

171
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,030
I know what you want.

172
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,720
It will help you.

173
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,830
If you can plant it,

174
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,030
the white olive tree

175
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,750
makes your wishes come true.

176
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,200
That's a white olive tree.

177
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,200
This is a mirage.

178
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,000
A mirage?

179
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,420
Can I make a wish to it?

180
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,680
You can make a wish to any thing the nature gives us.

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,510
♫In this world♫

191
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:26,670
♫Let every wish fly freely♫

192
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,360
♫Listen to the sound of peace♫

193
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,160
♫Sing gently♫

194
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:38,020
♫Filled with love and hope♫

195
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,450
♫When a mirage♫

196
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,230
♫Disappear quietly♫

197
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,460
♫The olive tree heard it♫

198
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,710
♫The wish we made♫

199
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,880
We can stay here to watch this for a little longer.

200
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,240
Sure.

201
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,360
Now that I think about it,

202
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,240
it's fascinating.

203
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,060
A few years ago,

204
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,850
I couldn't have imagined myself

205
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,550
driving and walking

206
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,640
on the tattered path

207
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,030
of a turbulent country.

208
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,200
While running for my life,

209
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,540
I'd be sitting here watchign the mirage.

210
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,640
You didn't think

211
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,030
you would become a reporter?

212
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,590
No.

213
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:03,880
You know

214
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,880
I don't like to deal with people.

215
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,570
I thought

216
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,640
I would work in a history museum.

217
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,790
But now,

218
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,240
I think it's good to be a reporter too.

219
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,840
I can record many things.

220
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,830
Maybe one day

221
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,720
I would record history

222
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,240
without myself knowing.

223
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,600
I don't think

224
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,140
you have to wait for that one day.

225
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,400
Every day in this world

226
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,230
for anyone

227
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,640
is a part of history.

228
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,550
You...

229
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,310
Me...

230
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,200
Same goes for everyone here.

231
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,030
Even if it's not written in black and white,

232
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,750
this land will remember it.

233
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,090
What about you?

234
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,230
Why did you volunteer?

235
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,200
There's no special reason.

236
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,400
If I have to say one,

237
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,150
it may have something to do with a childhood experience of mine.

238
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,070
I was naughty when I was a kid.

239
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,920
One time, I accidentally fell into a dried well.

240
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,440
The well was dark.

241
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,030
I was very scared.

242
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,240
I kept crying.

243
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,590
I felt like I was crying for a century.

244
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,250
My throat was hoarse.

245
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,920
But it probably wasn't that long.

246
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,120
Anyway, when I thought

247
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,400
I was going to die in that well,

248
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,400
a passerby heard my cry

249
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,700
and saved me.

250
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,640
I still remember those big hands

251
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,310
holding me now.

252
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,200
They were warm

253
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and reliable.

254
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,830
I think

255
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,590
that's the feeling of hope.

256
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,470
Maybe I became a volunteer

257
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,610
because I want to spread that feeling.

258
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,720
Don't be afraid.

259
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,200
I won't leave you.

260
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,160
It's new.

261
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:25,940
Not dirty.

262
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,060
♫Have you ever found someone♫

263
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,020
Reporter Song.

264
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,050
♫Who sees right through your smile♫

265
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,400
♫Your eyes♫

266
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,240
It's not your fault.

267
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,260
♫You're sick from the miles♫

268
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,870
♫Tires are low♫

269
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,760
♫But in his heart♫

270
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,440
Zan.

271
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,370
♫There's a place to go♫

272
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,310
You've long become someone like this.

273
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,370
♫He will be the light and the darkness♫

274
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,380
♫In your highs and lows♫

275
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,330
Warm

276
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,160
and reliable.

277
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,850
♫And say, Te Amo♫

278
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,200
♫Still we don't know love♫

279
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,200
♫But I feel strong♫

280
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,380
♫When I'm with you♫

281
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:16,860
♫Just say, Te Amo♫

♫When I'm with you♫

285
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,430
Captain Jiang.

286
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,030
Please answer if you hear me.

287
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:50,650
Copy that.

288
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,300
Zan.

289
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,730
Where are you?

290
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,830
We met a groupof

291
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,670
homeless villages

292
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,920
on our way just now.

293
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,240
That delayed us a little.

294
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,550
We are still on the No. 7 Highway now.

295
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,240
We can reach the barracks in about an hour and a half.

296
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,190
Villagers?

297
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,450
Please be more specific.

298
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,990
There are about 30 to 40 of them.

299
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,510
Majority of them are elderly, women, and children.

300
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,240
Most of them have malnutrition.

301
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,800
Zan telling Jiang Lin these...

302
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,000
Reporter Song and I...

303
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,830
-Is to...
-Distributed all the food we had

304
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,070
to them.

305
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,510
Unfortunately, we didn't have many on us

306
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:33,980
and it wasn't of big help.

307
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,510
Can Jiang Lin...

308
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,440
help?

309
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,640
Tell me their exact location.

310
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,790
We met these villagers

311
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,610
on the No. 7 Highway

312
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,160
about 150 KM

313
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,880
southeast of Happo.

314
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,060
There is an abandoned village.

315
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,350
It should be their temporary shelter.

316
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,450
Got it.

317
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,810
Jiang Lin will find a way to help those villagers.

318
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,920
Look.

319
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,720
The wish we just made

320
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,360
is starting to come true.

321
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,710
How nice.

322
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,140
Are you sleepy?

323
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,370
When people relax after being nervous,

324
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,500
they tend to get sleepy.

325
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,480
There's still some distance from the barracks.

326
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,390
Get some sleep.

327
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,750
Isn't it the same for you?

328
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,640
I won't sleep.

329
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,110
I'll talk to you

330
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,750
as you drive.

331
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,440
No need.

332
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,550
Look!

333
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,290
A white olive tree.

334
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,320
It's real this time.

335
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,090
Check.

336
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,070
Kid!

337
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,790
Who said that you could play here?

338
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,260
This is the barracks.

339
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,730
No!

340
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,750
Run! Run!

341
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,720
How did you come inside?

342
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,240
Hey, kid!

343
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,440
Don't go away, stay there!

344
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,110
Let me down!

345
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,680
There's a hole.

346
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,030
Come.

347
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,150
Go.

348
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,480
It's hard to be a good person.

349
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,910
I have to do manual labor too.

350
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,140
Hey, soldier.

351
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,710
Could you do me a favor?

352
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,240
That's my luck.

353
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,680
Only time I try to be nice.

354
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,430
Pei Xiaonan?

355
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:05,920
Dr. Pei.

356
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,530
You seem to be a blessing for me today.

357
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,880
It's you.

358
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,070
This is for you.

359
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,190
Let's officially get to know each other.

360
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,880
My name is Benjamin.

361
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,720
Where did you steal the flowers?

362
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,160
Don't talk nonsense.

363
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,640
I saved a life in exchange for this.

364
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,450
Whether you stole

365
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,720
or exchanged for it,

366
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,750
we can't waste such beautiful flowers.

367
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,790
Since

368
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,890
you've accepted the flowers,

369
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,830
will you go on a date with me?

370
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,730
Sure.

371
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,040
Help me move these things in.

372
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,280
Then you can ask me to go on a date.

373
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,020
I'll go discuss the takeover with the doctor here.

374
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,270
Thank you,

375
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,620
soldier.

376
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,750
Sasin.

377
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,770
You can come in!

378
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,320
What's going on?

379
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,790
Why do you look unhappy

380
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,650
when you see me flirting with girls?

381
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,990
You like Dr. Pei too?

382
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,130
She doesn't suit you.

383
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,400
You're too young.

384
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,160
Do you think everyone

385
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,400
has nothing better to do like you?

386
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,080
I'm in Happo to do interviews.

387
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,179
I don't have time to listen to your nonsense.

388
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,400
Stop there.

389
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:19,960
They sent a little boy

390
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,270
like you to interview in Happo?

391
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,510
There's no one better in your TV station?

392
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,170
Don't you know it's dangerous here?

393
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:31,010
Am I going to be your babysitter again?

394
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,530
You're flirting with girls

395
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,100
while on a mission.

396
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,590
That's more dangerous.

397
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,550
He's so small-sized

398
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,480
but so full of anger.

399
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,760
In order to get a beauty,

400
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,350
let's do my best.

401
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,870
We are here.

402
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:19,920
Instructor Li.

403
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,610
Reporter Song.

404
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,290
Dr. Pei?

405
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,600
Dr. Pei.

406
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,230
What a coincidence.

407
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,110
You're here too?

408
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,110
Yes.

409
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,360
I heard you had an accident on the way here.

410
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:39,800
Are you okay?

411
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,230
I'm okay.

412
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,360
Thankfully Instructor Li arrived on time.

413
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,580
Instructor Li.

414
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:47,960
You're injured.

415
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,080
Do you want me to take a look?

416
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:51,920
It's all right.

417
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:52,920
It's just a scratch.

418
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,840
Besides,

419
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,650
I've applied some erythromycin ointment to it.

420
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,100
Erythromycin ointment?

421
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,480
I heard that

422
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,230
it's an antibiotic that can kill bacteria anyway.

423
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,550
Is that right, Dr. Pei?

424
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,410
Reporter Song.

425
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,530
Sorry.

426
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,720
I have an interview scheduled.

427
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,780
I have to go.

428
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:30,960
Bye.

429
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,440
Here.

430
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,440
Thank you.

431
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,500
Instructor Li.

432
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:43,920
How did you save

433
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,230
Reporter Song?

434
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,380
Tell me about it.

435
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,070
It's nothin.

436
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,280
I just brought Reporter Song to the barracks.

437
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,440
It was Captain Jiang

438
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,920
and Benjamin who saved her.

439
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,480
You're here?

440
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,360
Do you need help?

441
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:04,660
No.

442
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,170
Don't ruin my date.

443
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,630
Dr. Pei.

444
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,170
Don't break your promise.

445
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,100
Of course I won't/

446
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,510
There are still many things left.

447
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,760
Hurry up.

448
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,360
I won't disturb you then.

449
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,480
Instructor Li.

450
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,070
Wait for me.

451
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:31,710
Come on!

452
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,630
That's it.

453
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,180
Today's drink is worth it.

454
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:58,510
It's thrilling, exciting, and romantic.

455
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,400
Thank god.

456
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,360
What are you talking about?

457
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,940
Thank god, nothing happened between you two.

458
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,170
Otherwise, I won’t have a chance anymore.

459
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,490
Instructor Li is handsome

460
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,160
and righteous.

461
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,540
He's good at martial arts too.

462
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,600
He's my type.

463
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,360
You're not bad either.

464
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,230
You survived a great disaster.

465
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,150
It's worth celebrating.

466
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,590
Celebrate!

467
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,440
There's no more?

468
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,480
There is.

469
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,030
That's really it.

470
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,570
I have another bottle.

471
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,320
Wait for me.

472
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:56,960
I'll get it.

473
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,980
Let's finish it today.

474
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,190
Survived a great disaster...

475
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,190
That should be followed

476
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,670
with a blessing then.

477
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,530
Why are you so slow?

478
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,840
You took so long to get the wine.

479
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,990
Come and watch cartoons with me.

480
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,200
But don't tell others

481
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,030
I like watching cartoons.

482
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:09,030
People will laugh at me for being childish.

483
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:13,320
That'd ruin my reputation.

484
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,150
Hurry up–

485
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,150
Why were you eavesdropping?

486
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,440
Sorry.

487
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,440
I was just passing by.

488
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,070
I didn't mean to hear that

489
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,460
you like to watch cartoons.

490
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,150
But...

491
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:42,350
I don't think it's childish to like cartoons.

492
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,200
I think it's cute.
