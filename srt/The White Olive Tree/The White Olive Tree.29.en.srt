00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:45,850
[Episode 29]

3
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,759
[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

4
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,460
Zan.

5
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,400
Have you experienced something

6
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,790
that you don't want to tell me about?

7
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,740
It's okay if you don't want to talk about it now.

8
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,360
I can wait.

9
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,190
Tomorrow,

10
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,440
I want to visit the cemetery in Matuman for inspiration.

11
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,280
I heard it's difficult to get in.

12
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,480
Can you take me there?

13
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,020
Attention!

14
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,840
Just got an order.

15
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,800
The special forces will be transferred to Happo together

16
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,960
with other troops.

17
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,910
The specific departure time is tomorrow midnight.

18
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,960
So, everyone go to prepare.

19
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,470
Yes, Sir!

20
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,400
Dismissed!

21
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,520
Ben.

22
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,000
What's up?

23
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,960
You're relocating to Happo this time.

24
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,870
I want to go with you.

25
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,710
They're transferring us to Happo at such short notice.

26
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,870
Although they didn't tell me the specific reason,

27
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,630
I have a feeling something must have happened.

28
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,250
This mission could be very dangerous.

29
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,280
So you...

30
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,240
I know.

31
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,920
But the more dangerous it is,

32
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,310
the more I can help.

33
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,510
Besides,

34
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,600
I want to do more.

35
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,870
Not only for you,

36
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,600
but also for myself.

37
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,720
Okay.

38
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,750
I'll go talk to the special forces.

39
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,190
Zan.

40
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,850
I think you should go say goodbye to Song.

41
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,000
Instructor Li.

42
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,480
Tomorrow,

43
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,830
I want to visit the cemetery in Matuman for inspiration.

44
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,830
I heard it's difficult to get in.

45
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,850
Can you take me there?

46
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,000
Sure.

47
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,390
I'll pick you up at the hotel at 10 AM tomorrow.

48
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,650
Captain.

49
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,190
Captain.

50
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,190
Here we go again.

51
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,160
Captain.

52
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,080
Sasin, come with me.

53
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,120
Captain, if you're done making a show of your authority,

54
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,830
I'll go back and pack my gear.

55
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,920
What are you talking about?

56
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,190
Making a show of my authority?

57
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,040
I'm not so childish as you.

58
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,270
I was inspecting your military bearing and discipline.

59
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:54,990
Now I have a mission to assign you.

60
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,720
Alright, Captain.

61
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,510
What's the mission? Go ahead.

62
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,290
This time, Zan will be going with us to Happo.

63
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,760
I want him to stay with you.

64
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,800
Unless there's a special situation,

65
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,900
you must stay in an absolutely safe place.

66
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,350
Zan is going too?

67
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,200
The higher-ups agreed?

68
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,080
I went there in person.

69
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,230
How could they not agree?

70
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,360
You just went there

71
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,480
and bragged about

72
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,390
Zan's expertise in engineering blasting.

73
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,930
What are you so smug about?

74
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,310
You went out

75
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,190
to ask for permission from the higher-ups?

76
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,159
Of course.

77
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,260
Why else?

78
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,120
Why else would I go out?

79
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,860
I thought you went to say goodbye to Dr. Pei.

80
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,060
It was such a good opportunity,

81
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,680
and you'd let it slip by?

82
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,070
I told you how young and naïve you are,

83
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,270
yet you weren't convinced.

84
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,620
How could I possibly use

85
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,050
this kind of trick that everyone has used?

86
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,430
Besides,

87
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,020
I hate those sentimental parting scenes the most.

88
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,190
What a nag.

89
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,750
Compared to life-and-death farewells,

90
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,000
I prefer leaving without saying goodbye,

91
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,120
suddenly disappearing,

92
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,320
without letting her know whether I'm dead or alive.

93
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,360
That's how you make a girl worry about you

94
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,660
and unable to forget you.

95
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:34,510
Captain.

96
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,740
I really feel sorry for Dr. Pei.

97
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,060
Why did she get stuck with someone like you?

98
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,870
Besides,

99
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,960
it's one thing for you to talk nonsense about yourself,

100
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,030
but don't just go on about life and death like that.

101
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,360
You're dragging us all into this.

102
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,200
All that talk about suddenly disappearing

103
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,150
and not knowing if one's alive or dead.

104
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,360
There wasn't a single word of good fortune.

105
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,270
If you keep talking nonsense,

106
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,360
give me back Rina's little star.

107
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,030
It's useless to bless you anyway.

108
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,600
It's exactly because I have Rina's blessings

109
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,150
that I dare to talk nonsense.

110
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,630
You want to take the little star from me?

111
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,030
Dream on.

112
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:25,920
Captain.

113
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,750
Sasin.

114
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,120
Dismissed.

115
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,720
Yes, Sir.

116
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,110
You ran down here?

117
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,650
I got up too early

118
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,090
and fell asleep again.

119
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,270
I almost didn't make it.

120
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,210
What time did you wake up?

121
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:20,690
Six o'clock.

122
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,030
Six o'clock?

123
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,390
Why did you get up so early?

124
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,960
The light woke me up.

125
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,270
Haven't you hung the drapes?

126
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,900
I failed to hang them.

127
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,600
I'm too clumsy.

128
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,300
I'll go help you hang the drapes first.

129
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,330
I don't know where your room is.

130
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,840
You'll have to lead the way.

131
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,030
I'm still staying in the same room as before.

132
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,320
Fortunately, the hotel's not too crowded,

133
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,910
so there are guest rooms available.

134
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,530
You're quite nostalgic.

135
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,600
Aren't you nostalgic too?

136
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,430
These drapes are so high.

137
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,870
It must have been tough for you.

138
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,070
Done.

139
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,870
Thank you.

140
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,030
It's nothing.

141
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,910
There are mice here?

142
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,640
Come on, girl.

143
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,670
I love you.

144
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,320
Baby.

145
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,440
I love you.

146
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,960
Come on.

147
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,480
Give me your promise.

148
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,840
Let's go now.

149
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,910
I'll have the waiter put it away.

150
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,430
Okay.

151
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,240
We'll hit the road now.

152
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,650
Put your helmet on.

153
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,120
Okay.

154
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,580
Done.

155
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,750
Do you know

156
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,340
the legend of this place?

157
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:25,720
I do.

158
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,120
Several centuries ago,

159
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,030
Eastern Country suffered an invasion.

160
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,440
This war

161
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,870
brought the Eastern Country back then

162
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,540
to the brink of national extinction and genocide.

163
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,480
Uglai was the capital of the ancient Eastern Country.

164
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,620
That counter-encirclement battle

165
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,720
lasted for a full year.

166
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,960
The soldiers defended Matuman Hill, the last line of defense,

167
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,390
to the death,

168
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,490
waiting for reinforcements to arrive.

169
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,030
The battle was extremely fierce.

170
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,000
Eventually, reinforcements arrived,

171
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,870
and they managed to defend the ancient Eastern Country.

172
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,960
The soldiers who sacrificed their lives in the Battle of Matuman Hill

173
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,180
were all buried here,

174
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,890
including General Matuman himself.

175
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,180
Later generations specially built

176
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,880
a memorial hall on the hilltop

177
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,580
for these martyrs,

178
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,760
known as the Matuman Holy Temple.

179
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,390
It seems you're well prepared for this field trip.

180
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,150
It's about 15 meters tall here.

181
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,050
The reliefs on it are characteristic of Eastern Country.

182
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:43,690
Hey, Max.

183
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,670
Instructor Li.

184
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,860
Am I that scary?

185
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Instructor Li.

186
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,120
It's you.

187
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,340
Captain.

188
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,360
She's my friend.

189
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,820
Her name is Song Ran.

190
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,360
"Carry."

191
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,720
"Candy."

192
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,600
Yes.

193
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,480
I took these pictures.

194
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,680
Ma'am.

195
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,090
You're a passionate journalist

196
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,780
who capture moments for our country with true feelings.

197
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,090
I'm ready to help you.

198
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:31,990
Shall we?

199
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,880
Thank you.

200
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,310
Song.

201
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,320
Li will show you the temple.

202
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,190
Excuse me.

203
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,589
Zan.

204
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,849
I've always wondered,

205
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,069
if the Battle of Matuman Hill had been lost back then,

206
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,109
would the ancient Eastern Country still exist?

207
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,030
What would happen to its people?

208
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,640
It wouldn't have failed.

209
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,480
The soldiers would have regrouped,

210
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,510
come back with renewed strength,

211
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,110
again and again,

212
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,920
until victory was achieved.

213
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
What's this?

214
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,000
Is it an epitaph?

215
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,030
Don't bury me too deep.

216
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,030
Brother.

217
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,310
If someone invades my country,

218
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,030
please wake me up.

219
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,000
I will rise and continue to fight.

220
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,070
These were General Matuman's last words

221
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,350
before he died in battle.

222
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,110
Later generations carved them

223
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,070
to clarify their resolve.

224
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,070
This has also become the oath

225
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,240
of all the soldiers buried here,

226
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,370
passed down to this day.

227
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,550
The squad of soldiers you saw just now

228
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,610
are the ninth patch of soldiers

229
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,880
guarding Matuman Hill.

230
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,680
Since the day of the riot,

231
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,020
those rioters have been trying to occupy

232
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,350
this place of extraordinary significance

233
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,200
to Eastern Country.

234
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,510
Even if it's just for one day,

235
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,510
they would feel

236
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,350
they've defeated Eastern Country's army.

237
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,570
But these successive batches of soldiers

238
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,000
haven't let them succeed.

239
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,600
They've firmly held their ground at Matuman Hill.

240
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,310
Captain.

241
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,200
You're so incredible.

242
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,030
They want to blow the city,

243
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,720
destroy the temple,

244
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,840
and desecrate the remains of our heroes.

245
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,730
If this were your homeland,

246
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,540
would you allow it?

247
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,240
This is a little present we prepared for you.

248
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,750
Ms. Song.

249
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,790
Li never mentioned to you

250
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,920
what he has done for Matuman, did he?

251
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,060
After these jerks failed in their attacks several times,

252
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,640
they sneaked around and planted landmines all over this area.

253
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,530
We can die for Matuman,

254
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,110
but exploding those mines with our own bodies

255
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,820
and ruining this city of hero

256
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,520
would make us sinners through the ages.

257
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,030
Fortunately, Li and his buddies

258
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,650
cleared the mines for a straight 36 hours,

259
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,180
wracking those bastards' despicable scheme.

260
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,750
So he's also a guardian of Matuman.

261
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,640
Crafted

262
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,350
by our own hands.

263
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,640
She will survive.

264
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,640
Max.

265
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,640
Didn't you tell me that Song Ran is your idol?

266
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,560
Then why are you keeping your distance from her now?

267
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,390
Come over.

268
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,310
Take a photo?

269
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,510
Captain.

270
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,620
I'd like to take a photo of your adjutant.

271
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,740
Is that okay?

272
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,440
Don't be nervous.

273
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,400
Smile.

274
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:19,920
One more.

275
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,700
Sorry.

276
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,400
The battery is dead.

277
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,030
It doesn't matter.

278
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,390
One photo is enough.

279
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,400
No.

280
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,750
I will come back

281
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,270
and take a picture of your smile.

282
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:38,950
Deal.

283
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,380
Deal.

284
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:49,840
♫In the land of Matuman♫

285
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:55,010
♫There's a place where heroes stand♫

286
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,150
♫Through the ages♫

287
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,750
This was the song that child sang

288
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,820
♫Your story aligns♫

289
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,410
♫We sing our oath to the sky♫

290
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,200
when you were disposing bombs in Happo.

291
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,490
Yes.

292
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,140
♫In the land of Matuman♫

293
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,310
That's the song.

294
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,390
♫From the sea to desert lands♫

295
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,120
♫All the beautiful souls♫

296
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,170
♫Forever friends♫

297
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,090
I feel that this time coming to Eastern Country,

298
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:28,490
♫We sing our oath to you♫

299
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,480
you're different from before.

300
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,110
You were so determined to come to Eastern Country.

301
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,100
♫Oh white, white♫

302
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,670
Is there any special reason?

303
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,990
♫White olive tree♫

304
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:44,080
♫Can you see♫

305
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,450
There's no special reason.

306
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,490
♫Those wishes we've dreamed♫

307
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,160
I'm just annoyed with those bastards.

308
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,710
I can't stand them.

309
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,240
♫Oh white, white♫

310
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,630
I've never heard you talk like this before.

311
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,930
♫White olive tree♫

312
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,010
♫Can you hear us?♫

313
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,160
I guess Benjamin's a bad influence.

314
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:15,350
♫We sing our oath to you♫

315
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:07,960
No.

316
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,500
It's very cool.

317
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,710
Indeed.

318
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,350
I also came to Eastern Country for my book.

319
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,300
There's no special reason.

320
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,150
During your stay in Eastern Country this time,

321
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,490
have you been injured?

322
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,820
Have you heard of

323
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,010
a safety ranking circulating in Uglai?

324
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:53,840
What is it?

325
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,630
It goes soldiers, journalists, Doctors without Borders,

326
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,070
Red Cross, volunteers.

327
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,880
Volunteers rank last,

328
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,040
while journalists rank second,

329
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,440
just behind soldiers.

330
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,590
So I'm very safe.

331
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,260
How could I get injured?

332
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
Some injuries

333
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,350
can only be seen by oneself.

334
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,600
They're invisible to others.

335
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,200
You're not an ordinary volunteer.

336
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,640
You must be extra careful.

337
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,030
Okay.

338
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:02,590
Excuse me.

339
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,390
What happened?

340
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,530
I heard a soldier from the special forces

341
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,230
is having a wedding on the rubble.

342
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,910
Everyone is there to celebrate.

343
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,390
Everyone can go?

344
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,960
Of course. For such a joyous occasion,

345
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,990
who wouldn't want to share the happiness?

346
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,920
Too bad

347
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,480
I'm on duty.

348
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,830
Thank you.

349
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,030
Do you want to go?

350
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,070
I do.

351
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,690
I'd like to take some photos.

352
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,750
Reporting, Captain.

353
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,110
We've completed

354
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,350
Morgan's work for him.

355
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,860
We're all geared up

356
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,360
and ready to go.

357
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,750
Got it.

358
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,750
Today is Morgan's wedding.

359
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,130
Don't be so serious.

360
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,720
Lighten up a bit.

361
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,440
I'm not like you.

362
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,680
We have a mission tonight,

363
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,300
yet you're still in the mood to approve a wedding at a time like this.

364
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,550
I've always been a carpe diem kind of person.

365
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,160
Are you just realizing this now?

366
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,310
Then enjoy yourself.

367
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,470
I won't join your craziness.

368
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,190
Why are you so unromantic?

369
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,270
Marriage is

370
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,720
a beautiful thing.

371
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,510
It shouldn't be prevented

372
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,350
for any reason.

373
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,570
What reason do I have not to help them achieve their happiness?

374
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,310
Besides, the mission is at night.

375
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,920
We still have plenty of time.

376
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:07,610
I can't argue with you.

377
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,400
You're the captain.

378
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:10,450
You make the call.

379
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,800
Look how disgruntled you are.

380
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,330
Are you jealous of Morgan?

381
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,880
Jealous that there's no girl to propose to you?

382
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,480
No matter what tragedy may happen tomorrow,

383
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,830
it can't rob us of today's happiness.

384
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,880
This is a life philosophy I learned

385
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,420
when I was in the orphanage.

386
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,400
Why?

387
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm an orphan too.

388
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
My parents were said to have

389
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,820
died in a traffic accident.

390
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,340
By the time I could remember things,

391
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,880
I was already in an orphanage

392
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,640
in Chinatown.

393
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,200
If it weren't for this principle,

394
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,510
I'm afraid I'd be moping around every day.

395
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,550
You should learn this attitude too.

396
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,160
Don't keep a poker face all the time.

397
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,750
I have something to ask you.

398
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,290
If the war ends,

399
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,480
will you go back to school?

400
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,160
I haven't thought about it.

401
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,920
I'll see when the time comes.

402
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,240
Then let me tell you now.

403
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,130
If the war ends

404
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,160
and I'm still alive,

405
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,030
it'll be up to you whether you go back to school or not.

406
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,750
You can decide for yourself.

407
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,110
But if I die,

408
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,960
you must go back to school and finish your journalism degree.

409
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,240
Because this was my original dream.

410
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,350
Complete it for me.

411
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,550
Did you hear me?

412
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,790
This is an order.

413
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,400
What kind of bullshit order is that?

414
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,200
What if I die?

415
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,290
I won't let that happen.

416
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,240
Do you know what another good thing

417
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,160
about this wedding is for me?

418
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,200
That is I can say goodbye to Dr. Pei

419
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,680
in a very cheerful way.

420
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,750
Dance a little,

421
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,590
have some drinks,

422
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:29,750
and flirt a bit.

423
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,310
It's perfect.

424
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,240
What's your dream?

425
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,510
Same as yours.

426
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,030
To get into the journalism department at Todewell University

427
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,130
and become a journalist.

428
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,610
So what happened?

429
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,680
You didn't get in?

430
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,240
Are you looking down on me?

431
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,400
I got admitted,

432
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,750
but I couldn't afford to go.

433
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,960
My test scores

434
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,830
weren't nearly good enough to qualify for a scholarship.

435
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,960
I had no idea

436
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,920
that getting into college would cost so much money.

437
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,270
The money I earned working at a Chinese restaurant

438
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,240
was nowhere near that astronomical figure.

439
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,050
That's when I realized

440
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,000
what it means to have no family.

441
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,780
There's no one to help you.

442
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,590
You have to do everything on your own.

443
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,440
You can only rely on yourself.

444
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,720
It's a very painful thing.

445
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,480
So then you thought about

446
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,680
becoming a mercenary to make money?

447
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,000
That's risking your life for money.

448
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,060
What else do I have besides my life?

449
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,160
Hi.

450
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,960
Hey, Instructor Li.

451
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,590
Buze.

452
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,220
So who's getting married today?

453
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,650
Morgan and his love, you know.

454
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,770
Ms. Song, hello.

455
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,130
Instructor Li.

456
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,240
Morgan.

457
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,160
Welcome.

458
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,530
Morgan.

459
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,890
Hello, Instructor Li.

460
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,750
So it's you getting married today.

461
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,920
What a good secret keeper.

462
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,590
Congratulations, Morgan.

463
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,160
Thank you, thank you.

464
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,180
It's her who insisted

465
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,110
to make it done before we go.

466
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,960
You have a pretty and brave bride.

467
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,720
Thanks.

468
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,070
It's really rushed.

469
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,590
We didn't have time to find a venue.

470
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,640
So we decided

471
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,590
to have our wedding here eventually, where both of us

472
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,790
were born.

473
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,640
She said that it's a place being blessed here.

474
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,030
I see.

475
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,000
It's such a meaningful place for you.

476
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,270
You will be safe and sound.

477
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,720
Because you're blessed twice,

478
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,160
from you and your wife.

479
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,480
Thanks.

480
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,520
Morgan.

481
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,000
Morgan.

482
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,030
Come on. Welcome.

483
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,880
Come over here.

484
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,030
Of course.

485
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,920
Hey, here.

486
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,530
Come over here.

487
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,440
Actually, this kind of wedding is quite nice.

488
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,480
Even strangers come to give their blessings.

489
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,710
No need to greet anyone.

490
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,320
No formalities.

491
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,840
Only the most sincere wishes.

492
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,449
It's not awkward at all.

493
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,110
I knew you'd like this kind of

494
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,060
natural atmosphere.

495
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,480
You hate awkwardness the most.

496
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,670
I've attended two weddings with you.

497
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,180
♫She is a white island♫

498
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,320
I liked them both.

♫The colorful wind rushes past♫

500
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,550

♫Heading toward her shore♫

512
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,480
we won't invite so many irrelevant people.

513
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,360
To spare you from feeling awkward.

514
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,730
♫The sky turns a deeper blue♫

515
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,150

♫The brilliant night♫

517
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,070

This scene is beautiful.

525
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:30,960
Indeed.

526
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,680
If it weren't for all this turmoil,

527
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,230
it would be even more beautiful.

528
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:43,510
♫She is a white island♫

just minor injuries.

I entrust my daughter to you.

551

Whether in prosperity or adversity,

552
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,340
wealth or poverty, health or sickness,

553
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:22,770
joy or sorrow, you must take good care of her.

00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,320
Zan.

555
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,000
If it were you,

556
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,990
would you choose to get married at a time like this?

557
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,840
You're relocating to Happo this time.

558
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,760
I want to go with you.

559
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,440
This trip could be dangerous.

560
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:44,170
I think you should go say goodbye to Song.

561
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,070
No.

562
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,940
I don't want my loved one to be hurt

563
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,370
because of any accident that might happen to me.

564
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,710
I don't want this happiest moment

565
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,760
to become her most painful memory.

566
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,800
But I think this is happiness.

567
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,020
At least there are memories,

568
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,360
don't you think?

569
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,860
The happier they are now,

570
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,010
the more painful the memories will be.

571
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:33,030
If it were me staying behind to bear everything,

572
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,230
I would be willing.

573
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,590
But if it were you,

574
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,930
I wouldn't want that no matter what.

575
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,600
It seems

576
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,030
this question has no easy answer.

577
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,510
So,

578
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,800
I hope the sun won't rise,

579
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,280
and tomorrow won't come.

580
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,560
Look how happily they're dancing.

581
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,150
Look,

582
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,040
Ben and Pei Xiaonan are dancing.

583
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,540
I'll go take some footage.

584
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,800
Thank you for helping me yesterday.

585
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:47,420
This is an apple as thank-you gift.
