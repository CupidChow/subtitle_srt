[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

4
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,509
Thank you, Ms. Fu.

5
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,750
I hope when I return to China,

6
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,120
he will have forgiven me.

7
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,710
No need to wait until you come back.

8
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,190
He's already stopped blaming you.

9
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,380
The essay topic for the midterm exam was

10
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
My Family.

11
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,400
I guess

12
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,829
he wrote about you.

13
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,320
So to me, family transcends the confines

14
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,470
of blood relations.

15
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,040
It's not about living under the same roof and spending each day together.

16
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,820
It's someone who supports me

17
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,000
when no one else believes in me.

18
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,410
It's someone who stands by me unwaveringly

19
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,210
even when I wilfully hurt him.

20
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,700
It's someone who shows me the scenery I've never seen

21
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,030
even when we are apart

22
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,650
and separated by miles.

23
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,550
I pray for the safe return of my family,

24
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,840
so that I can tell him in person

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,420
that he's my family.

26
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,190
Jiang Lin,

27
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,040

28

Your volunteer service period is almost over, right?

32
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,310
It's time to return to work, isn't it?

33
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,040
You've timed it just right.

34
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,310
You never contacted me over the past six months,

35
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,210
and the first call is to urge me back to work.

36
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,700
There was nothing important,

37
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,310
so why would I call you?

38
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,659
And...

39
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,040
you didn't call me either, right?

40
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
You're right.

41
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,240
After Chinese New Year,

42
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,120
my volunteer service period will be over.

43
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,430
I can go back to work after Chinese New Year.

44

45
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,240

the past six months

48
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,000
have been truly worthwhile.

49
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,560

I've already cleaned this room.

58
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,260

138
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,200

139
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,190

Yes.

153
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,440
In the future, you'll be able to watch TV

154
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,880
if you look up while you're having meals.

155
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,600
What can we see on TV?

156
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,960
You can see cartoons,

157
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,150
people singing and dancing,

158
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,330
and news.

159
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,650
Through the news, you can see what's happening in Eastern Country,

160
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,820
even the whole world.

161
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,750
We might be able to see Song as well?

162
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,250
Maybe.

163
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,600
When I was in the orphanage,

164
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,380
the happiest part of my day

165
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,800
was eating in the dining hall.

166
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,340
It wasn't because the food was particularly tasty,

167
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,170
but because when I was eating,

168
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,770
I could look up

169
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,890
and watch TV.

170
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,820
At that time,

171
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,580
the only thing I could see on TV

172
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,720
was news.

173
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,650
The reporters on TV

174
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,130
were calm and composed,

175
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,330
reporting on big and small events.

176
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,880
It allowed me, an orphan in the orphanage,

177
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,150
to see so many things happening outside.

178
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,340
At that time, I thought

179
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,330
it was a cool profession.

180
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,550
This place will do.

181
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,320
You're going to teach me archery?

182

Do you want to try?

183
00:13:59,250 --> 00:13:59,720
Here.

184
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,370
When did you learn archery?

185
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,560
When I came to Eastern Country this time.

186
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,560
Have you tried this before?

187
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,530
No.

188
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,720
Stand like me,

189
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,750
feet shoulder-width apart.

190
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,880
Hold the bow with your left hand.

191
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,200
Hold it steady.

192
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,890
A little lower.

193
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,000
Eyes focused straight ahead.

194
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,170
Nock the arrow.

195
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,080
Like this?

196
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,170
Your right hand should be like this.

197
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,560
Three fingers.

198
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,530
Focus on the target.

199
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,350
You're not concentrating.

200
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,770
I'm just thinking...

201
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,960
I hope I won't hit that tree.

202
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,600
It wouldn't be good to damage the forest.

203
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
Don't worry.

204
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,510
You won't hit it.

205
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,350
Let's try.

206
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,680
Take aim.

207
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,800
Three.

208
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:39,930
Two.

209
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,200
One.

210
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,750
There must be something wrong with the arrow.

211
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,320
You really are good at making excuses.

212
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,920
You missed the shot,

213
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,580
and you're blaming the arrow.

214
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,190
Then you do it.

215
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,600
Show me.

216
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,170
To prevent you from accusing me of damaging the forest,

217
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,770
I'll aim the arrow at that paper bag.

218
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:24,720
Okay.

219
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,410
I told you you couldn't hit it.

220
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,440
I'll try again.

221
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,100
Go ahead.

222
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,060
I won't let you succeed.

223
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,720
I can't hit it alone.

224
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,320
We need to do it together.

Zan, you're...

283
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,040
My volunteer service period

284
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,480
is about to end.

285
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm packing up in advance.

286
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,760
Right,

287
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,280
everything is almost finished.

288
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,210
Of course you'll go back.

289
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:14,810
Well, it seems

290
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,440
I can only ask for your help one last time.

291
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,650
What is it?

292
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,410
According to the information,

293
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,700
Ark is hiding in the valley ahead.

294
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,790
There's only one path into the mountain,

295
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
but the problem is

296
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,020
Mount Cangdi used to be a mine.

297
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,610
It has many tunnels left from excavation.

298
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,650
So we have to take them all down

299
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,000
in one go.

300
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,480
If we alert them,

301
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,410
Ark could easily escape through any

302
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,680
of the mine entrances.

303
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,840
If so, it would be much harder

304
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,760
to trace him.

305
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,430
Those who are hiding in the mountain

306
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,050
are the last main forces of the armed insurgents.

307
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,930
There should be about 40 to 50 people.

308
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,570
According to our reconnaissance

309
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,040
and related geological data,

310
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,540
there are a total of 19 escape tunnels.

311
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,480
I don't have enough troops

312
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,670
to secure all the 19 tunnels.

313
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,960
Even if I can get enough troops,

314
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,400
once they enter the mountain

315
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,670
and spread out to each tunnel,

316
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,330
they'll be noticed immediately.

317
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,960
I understand what you mean now.

318
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,190
You want me to see

319
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,930
if we can use explosives

320
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,000
to block these tunnels simultaneously.

321
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,130
I want to take a look ahead.

322
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,410
What's wrong?

323
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,960
It's him.

324
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,090
Zan.

325
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,540
I know him.

326
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,480
He got my face.

327
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,810
Look at you! Coward.

328
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,370
Ben,

329
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,080
in this USB drive,

330
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,330
there are specific blasting plans for each tunnel,

331
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,240
including the blast point locations,

332
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,970
explosive amounts,

333
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,370
and the methods of planting the explosives.

334
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,410
All the details are in there.

335
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,380
The blast points are very discreet.

336
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,020
Each tunnel only requires one or two people

337
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,920
to get it done.

338
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,280
You just need to be a little cautious,

339
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,270
and the enemies shouldn't notice you.

340
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,960
When do you plan to launch the attack?

341
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,130
Next Wednesday,

342
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,790
which is your Chinese New Year's Eve.

343
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,520
Many people in Eastern Country

344
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,200
like to celebrate Chinese festivals.

345
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,000
They're lively.

346
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,590
We'll take advantage of their relaxation

347
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,960
and launch the attack,

348
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,370
catching them off guard.

349
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,230
Good.

350
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,980
According to the plans in this proposal,

351
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,280
when you launch the attack,

352
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,200
you'll detonate the 19 tunnels simultaneously.

353
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,530
Within five minutes,

354
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,970
you should be able to block

355
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,790
all their escape routes.

356
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,480
Then,

357
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,560
give them a surprise,

358
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,290
and catch turtles in the jar.

359
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,330
Zan,

360
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,480
those Chinese girls

361
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,260
didn't teach me such difficult idioms.

362
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,520
Does Dr. Pei know

363
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,870
you have other Chinese girls?

364
00:23:58,890 --> 00:23:59,770
You're bragging again.

365
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,330
You...

366
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,320
I didn't see you guys all day yesterday.

367
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,400
Where did you go?

368
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,630
Why are you here again?

369
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,720
I'm the captain.

370
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,410
Do I need to report to you where I go?

371
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,720
It's confidential. Don't pry.

372
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,820
You went to Mount Cangdi?

373
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
Just the two of you?

374
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,950
We went for reconnaissance.

375
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,140
Should we have taken the entire special forces team?

376
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,030
Why are you...

377
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,500
What?

378
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,930
Don't be nervous.

379
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,740
Didn't you just hear what Zan said?

380
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,850
Catching...

381
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,890
Catching turtles...

382
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:11,980
Um...

383
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,010
Catching turtles...

384
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,230
Catching you in the jar.

385
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,870
Why are you still standing here?

386
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,170
Zan and I are about to discuss the operation plan.

387
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,660
Your rank isn't high enough.

388
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,340
If there's something, we'll talk later.

389
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,130
Go out.

390
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,840
Yes. Captain.

391
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,700
My rank is not high enough?

392
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,330
Your rank is not high enough

393
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,940
to see my picture either!

394
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,200
Zan.

395
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,770
That difficult idiom you just used

396
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,000
gave Sasin a chance to show off.

397
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,030
Can you teach me a few more

398
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,570
so that I can show off a bit too?

399
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,040
Sure.

400
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,200
When you go to China,

401
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,480
I'll teach you properly.

402
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,370
I almost forgot.

403
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,220
You're about to go back to your country.

404
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,720
Ben.

405
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,330
There's something I want to tell you.

406
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,930
Go ahead.

407
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,960
I'm not going with you

408
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,260
on the last mission.

409
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:29,510
Ran and I plan to return to our country in three days.

410
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,720
I'm actually a bit surprised

411
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,640
to hear those words from you.

412
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,810
Yes.

413
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,370
I never thought

414
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,520
I would make such a request.

415
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,130
But...

416
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,930
this is something I owe Ran.

417
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,280
I want to go home with her as planned.

418
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,550
I don't want any more unexpected events

419
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:07,880
to derail our plan.

420
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,080
And I don't want her to worry about me anymore,

421
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,460
not even...

422
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,850
once more.

423
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,330
For Ran,

424
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,680
I want to be selfish, just this once.

425
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:31,520
Zan,

426
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,280
for the girl you love,

427
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,760
nothing you do is too much.

428
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,890
And

429
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,410
you've done so many things

430
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,650
that others can't do.

431
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,890
You and Song are the most perfect couple I've ever seen.

432
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,850
Right now, all I feel is jealousy.

433
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,170
But please, make me jealous forever.

434
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:33,680
Song Ran,

435
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,510
why are you standing there grinning?

436
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,850
Back at the station,

437
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,200
I would never believe

438
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,000
Shen Bei would do something like this.

439
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,520
Really?

440
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,780
What's even more surprising is

441
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,370
I plan to do these things

442
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,750
for a long time to come.

443
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,450
I resigned.

444
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:56,960
What?

445
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,460
I guess it's because of this orphanage,

446
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
I received

447
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,040
a job offer from a children's rescue organization.

448
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,530
I thought about it for a long time

449
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,110
and decided to accept the offer.

450
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,760
On one hand, I want to try a different way of life.

451
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,280
On the other hand,

452
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,330
I want to go find Sia.

453
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,810
Do you think I'm being too restless?

454
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:36,950
No.

455
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,390
I actually understand you completely.

456
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,650
When I first returned to Liangcheng from Eastern Country,

457
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:52,720
I had a restless urge

458
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,130
in my heart.

459
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,680
I didn't want to go back

460
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,500
to that so-called normal life.

461
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,800
I wanted to return to Eastern Country.

462
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,090
I wanted to find Li Zan.

463
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,040
I wanted to live

464
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,000
a different life.

465
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,570
Maybe that's what you call

466
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,040
"reckless."

467
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,420
That's pretty much it.

468
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,410
Then I can rest assured.

469
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,900
Because I've found a kindred spirit.

470
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,680
Shen Bei,

471
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,930
what I'm about to say

472
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,680
might disappoint you.

473
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,040
What are you going to say?

474
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,540
Li Zan and I will return to China in three days.

475
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,650
His volunteer service period is over,

476
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,370
and I've gathered enough material for my book.

477
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,090
We...

478
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,020
We plan to go back

479
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,360
and return to our normal lives.

480
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,810
I hope that one day,

481
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,720
I can also find someone.

482
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,290
Someone

483
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,760
who makes me want

484
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,150
to return to a normal life with him.

485
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,610
If I say you will

486
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,410
find someone like that,

487
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,480
would it be a bit...

488
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,570
Annoying.

489
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,570
Then I'm not gonna say it.

490
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:41,650
Don't go.

491
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,890
I said don't go.

492
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,100
Stay until the orphanage is officially completed.

493
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,180
Based on the current progress,

494
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,220
it'll only keep you here... for five more days.

495
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,430
I've also been waiting

496
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,280
for the day the orphanage is officially finished.

497
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,950
This place

498
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,650
holds special meaning to me.

499
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,620
I want to see it officially completed with my own eyes.

500
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:24,950
I want to see it become a home for those orphans.

501
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,240
What about you? Don't you want to?

502
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:33,890
I do.

503
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:38,700
Okay.

504
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,170
I'll wait with you for the orphanage to be completed.

505
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:44,870
Okay.

506
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:49,790
Five days.

507
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,090
In five days,

508
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,000
it'll be the first day of Chinese New Year, right?

509
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:55,880
That's right.

510
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,880
The orphanage will officially open on the Spring Festival.

511
00:33:58,990 --> 00:33:59,560
How wonderful!

512
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,600
The special forces team will go camping and training in the mountains.

513
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,239
Ben asked me to go with them.

514
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:23,530
Do you want to come?

515
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,960
You can use it as material for your book.

516
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,110
I'll go to you right away.

517
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,010
It's not for writing the book.

518
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,960
Go live your normal life.

519
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:34,520
You'll just annoy me here.

520
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,340
Then I'm going.

521
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,630
Zan!

522
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,090
Why did the special forces team invite us

523
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,600
to their camping trip?

524
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,210
Probably because

525
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,370
I told Benjamin yesterday

526
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,290
that we're leaving soon.

527
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,200
I guess this is

528
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,230
the special forces team's unique way of saying goodbye.

529
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,000
What's wrong?

530
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,920
I just promised Shen Bei today

531
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:24,830
that we'd stay until the Spring Festival.

532
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,930
Why?

533
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,730
Shen Bei said

534
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,000
the orphanage will be completed in a few days.

535
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,640
It will officially open on the Spring Festival.

536
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,170
She wants us to stay until then.

537
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:44,520
I also want to see it open,

538
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,410
so I agreed.

539
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,210
I haven't had a chance to tell you yet.

540
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:53,600
Does this count as making a decision on my own?

541
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,760
Yes.

542
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:04,400
Let's go.

543
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,000
Just... yes?

544
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,080
That's it?

545
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,080
You don't have anything else to say?

546
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,040
You asked me if it counted.

547
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,680
I said yes.

548
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,480
What else is there to say?

549
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,370
Shouldn't you say something

550
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,210
to comfort me?

551
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,980
Something like "it's okay"

552
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,080
or "you can make decisions if you want."

553
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,250
Get on.

554
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,250
I'm not very good at saying comforting words like that,

555
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,600
but I will comfort you...

556
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,320
in my own way.

557
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,010
This way is good too.

558
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,660
I prefer this way.

559
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,290
Let's go.

560
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,790
Sasin always ends up being

561
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,640
the champion except for the captain.

562
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,000
This pattern seems unbreakable.

563
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,440
Sasin, you should accept your fate.

564
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,930
Second place isn't bad either.

565
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,640
That's right.

566
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,870
Come on, come on.

567
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,290
Giving up?

568
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,850
Are you kidding?

569
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,410
Sasin won!

570
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,080
My God!

571
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,440
Sasin won.

572
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,600
Sasin actually defeated the captain.

573
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,560
Great job.

574
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,520
You did great.

575
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,690
It doesn't count

576
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,460
because of my broken leg.

577
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:35,890
It doesn't count!

578
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:39,690
Come on.

579
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:41,210
When you just kicked me,

580
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,240
why didn't you mention your broken leg?

581
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,810
It has to count.

582
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,250
You have to accept the punishment.

583
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:52,520
Punish!

584
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,440
Okay.

585
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,520
Punish.

586
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,040
Let's see what you've got in mind.

587
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,390
Push-ups?

588
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,380
Or pull-ups?

589
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:07,770
Swimming in the river.

590
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,770
Swimming in the river!

591
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:15,640
-Swim!
-Swim!

592
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,890
That's a bit too much.

593
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,010
It's winter now.

594
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,940
How could it be a punishment to swim in summer?

595
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,890
Great idea.

596
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:31,290
-Swim!
-Swim!

597
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,030
Ben! Do it.

598
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,010
Every time I won,

599
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,480
I just made you do laundry,

600
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,330
cook a meal, or sing a song for me.

601
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,010
Shut up.

602
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:48,600
What are you doing?

603
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,370
It's not so cold!

604
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,520
Quite comfortable!

605
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,080
Why don't you all come down and take a bath?

606
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,440
The punishment is for you, not for us.

607
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,920
I don't believe you. It must be so cold!

608
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,260
It's not so cold! Come on!

609
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,960
The water must be so cold!

610
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,410
I don't want to get wet.

611
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,440
No.

612
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,290
We don't want to go.

613
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,770
Fall in!

614
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,160
Attention!

615
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,760
Take off your shoes!

616
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,130
Right now!

617
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,260
Come on!

618
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:58,690
♫And say, Te Amo♫

619
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:01,710
♫Still we don't know love♫

620
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:10,670
♫Just say, Te Amo♫

621
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,040
What happened? Are you okay?

622
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,840
♫I can feel the love♫

623
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:12,460
I'm okay.

624
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:15,810
Captain.

625
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:18,700
Stop it.

626
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,400
I'm ticklish.

627
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,380
What did I do?

628
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,250
Stop pretending.

629
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,290
I'm really curious now.

630
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,490
What exactly did I do?

631
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,040
Why did you pinch my foot?

632
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:40,560
Forget it. Someone like you would never admit it.

633
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,960
Sasin,

634
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,640
let me see what you mistook for me.

635
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,870
I've found the culprit that's been harassing you.

636
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Can the culprit in your hand

637
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,050
pinch people?

638
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:22,370
I won't let you wrongfully accuse me.

639
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:23,640
Hey, guys!

640
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,560
Go down and catch the fish!

641
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,540
Zan! You come down too!

642
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,180
Happo is too short of water!

643
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:38,650
This is a natural bathing pool!

644
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:43,100
Zan! He's not lying to you this time!

645
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:44,210
Come down quickly!

646
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:46,690
Come on!

647
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,250
Zan, come down quickly!

648
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,410
Come down for a bath!

649
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:51,410
-Come on!
-Zan, come down!

650
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,200
You should go too.

651
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,690
I'll go make some food.

652
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:55,410
It's really not cold.

653
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,200
Really.

654
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,160
I plan to let everyone taste my cooking.

655
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,120
Don't think about taking the credit.

656
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,290
Go now.

657
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,220
Go.
