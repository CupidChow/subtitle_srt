[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

4
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,120
What's going on?

5
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,400
You came to see me and even brought your laptop along.

6
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,800
Are you thinking that

7
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,160
if we get caught,

8
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,290
you'll say we're revising?

9
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:08,860
Revising what?

10
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,760
Ways to elope?

11
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:15,920
Sure.

12
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,200
Let's revise the ways to elope.

13
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,680
I'm here for serious matters.

14
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,020
I want to watch cartoons with you.

15
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,810
I've downloaded the video.

16
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,030
So this is the serious matter?

17
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,860
It's much more serious than revising.

18
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,850
Why aren't you watching the video

19
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,100
and keep looking at me instead?

20
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,030
I've seen it many times.

21
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,860
What?

22
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,470
You didn't tell me

23
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,050
you like to watch cartoons too?

24
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,240
I was just curious

25
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,310
about the cartoon you watched with Dr. Pei that day.

26
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,400
So entertaining

27
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,120
that you drank so much.

28
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,280
So I secretly watched it when I got back.

29
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,079
After watching it,

30
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,150
I actually find it fun.

31
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,150
So I watched it a few more times.

32
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,470
Every time I think of you,

33
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,240
I would watch it.

34
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,870
Zan,

35
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,240
will you always be this nice to me?

36
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,810
Will you betray me?

37
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,450
Will you break up with me?

38
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,490
I won't.

39
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,050
If I break up with you,

40
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,680
shot me to death.

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,310
What era is it now?

42
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,200
Why would there be shooting.

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,870
Stop talking nonsense.

44
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,280
Don't worry.

45
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,140
It won't happen.

46
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,480
Still, you shouldn't talk nonsense.

47
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,810
Touch wood.

48
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,750
Touch the head.

49
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,810
Quick, touch it.

50
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,670
What's wrong?

51
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,000
If one day,

52
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,160
we really do break up,

53
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,590
I don't want anything bad to happen to you.

54
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,480
Auntie is coughing again.

55
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,070
Could it be that my mom noticed

56
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,570
because we were too loud just now?

57
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,020
I think Auntie

58
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,970
coughed several times today.

59
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,550
Yeah.

60
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,450
She caught a cold some time ago

61
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,170
and started coughing since.

62
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,280
She was clearly getting better though.

63
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,420
Let's bring her to see a doctor tomorrow.

64
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,040
If this goes on,

65
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,080
it may turn into bronchitis.

66
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,750
And I feel like

67
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,510
your mom didn't look well today.

68
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,120
She only looked better after putting on some makeup.

69
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,120
But my mom hates going to the hospital.

70
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,680
I'm counting on you

71
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,400
to take her there.

72
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,830
Didn't you say the more times they meet,

73
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,180
the more mother-in-laws like their son-in-laws?

74
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,160
Who else can I count on?

75
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,260
Let's watch a while more.

76
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:30,890
Okay.

[Dicheng People's Hospital]

78
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,990
Alright. Stop following me.

79
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,030
As if I have some serious illness.

80
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,430
Li Zan, don't you need to do a checkup on your ears?

81
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,250
Let's split up.

82
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,270
Don't waste time.

83
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,100
Okay, Auntie.

84
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,450
Mom.

85
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,510
Text me when you're done.

86
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,390
We'll wait for you in the lobby on the first floor.

87
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,180
I'm so mad.

88
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,920
No matter how much I nag her,

89
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,160
she would never come to the hospital.

90
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,040
Why did she come with you immediately

91
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,020
when you said so this morning?

92
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,940
Is she my mom or your mom?

93
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,470
Ours.

94
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,430
That's right too.

95
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,660
Later,

96
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,590
you can wait for me here while having coffee.

97
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,320
There's no place to sit upstairs.

98
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,360
The checkup will be quick this time.

99
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,130
You don't have to follow me around.

101
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,730
Dr. He.

102
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,050
What a coincidence.

103
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,310
It's not a coincidence.

104
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,150
I ran into Aunt Ran just now.

105
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,760
She told me you came with your boyfriend.

106
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,370
I was curious

107
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,840
so I came to see you.

108
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,610
He just went for a checkup on his ears.

109
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,070
His ears...

110
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,720
Previously,

111
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,170
he got injured in the Eastern Country.

112
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,990
But he's much better now.

113
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,280
Then I'm relieved.

114
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,390
What's wrong?

115
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,550
Dr. He,

116
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,910
do you know if Li Zan

117
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,200
has other health problems?

118
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,390
That's not the case.

119
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,910
Ran.

120
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,200
You're done?

121
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,820
I...

122
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,440
am taking a walk.

123
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,450
I'm not bored.

124
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,770
I just like to take a stroll.

125
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,360
Okay.

126
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,520
I'll let you get on with it.

127
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,130
I was thinking

128
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,100
he'd better not be fooling the Ran I know.

129
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,770
Now it seems like

130
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,520
he was probably visiting the ear doctor

131
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,770
and didn't want you to worry.

132
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,220
Am I

133
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,660
being busybody?

134
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,820
No.

135
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,910
You're not.

136
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,080
The person you describe is so much like him.

137
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,450
He's always like this.

138
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,680
He doesn't want me to worry

139
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,570
and shoulders everything by himself.

140
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,790
Just like when he came for the checkup today.

141
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,780
He's much better now,

142
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,380
but he still doesn't let me follow him.

143
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,330
It means he cares about you,

144
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,650
and you're happy.

145
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,120
I'm taking my leave.

146
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
If you need anything,

147
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,470
feel free to come to me.

148
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,630
Don't hesitate.

149
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,390
Don't you want to see him?

150
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,720
You're not waiting for him anymore?

151
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,870
We met last time.

152
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,630
He's handsome.

153
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,240
Seems like I can't avoid him now.

154
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,420
Zan.

155
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,030
Let me introduce.

156
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,690
This is Li Zan.

157
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,700
He's my boyfriend.

158
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,550
This is He Shanran.

159
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,540
He's a doctor in this hospital.

160
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,910
She's a friend of my mother.

161
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,240
Hello, Dr. He.

162
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,440
Hello.

163
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,140
I ran into Aunt Ran at my department.

164
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,040
She said Ran is here too,

165
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,690
so I came to say hello.

166
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,120
Dr. He.

167
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,340
Which department are you in?

168
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,470
Ophthalmology.

169
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,030
In the future, if Mr. Li

170
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,350
has any issues with your eyes,

171
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
feel free to come to me.

172
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,780
Don't be afraid of troubling me.

173
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,240
Only

174
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,910
my ears are not good.

175
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
My eyes are fine.

176
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,520
I...

177
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,330
Dr. He.

178
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,790
Thank you.

179
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,120
Ran must have

180
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,160
troubled you before.

181
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,720
Thank you for taking care of her.

182
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,740
You're welcome.

183
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,410
I'll get back to work.

184
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,720
Nice to meet you.

185
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,550
Me too.

186
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,480
My mom hasn't made a move for a long time.

187
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,200
Let's go check on her.

188
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,720
Ran.

189
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,480
I think we might have been tricked by her.

190
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,900
The departments of ophthalmology and respiratory medicine

191
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,510

And the ophthalmology department

193
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,710
is near the exit of the hospital.

194
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,080
Dr. He saw Auntie near the ophthalmology department.

195
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,790
I think

196
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,130
she might have left.

197
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,840
She just didn't want to embarrass me

198
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,480
so she agreed to come to the hospital.

199
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,820

The way he looked at you was different.

215
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,150

216
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,830

00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,750

376
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,760
our time together anymore.

377
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,160
As for these messy things,

378
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,340
let's leave them to fate.

379
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,310
Ran,

380
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,390
I've received the Level 3 demining certificate.

381
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,160
[Xi Country]

382
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,940
In two weeks,

383
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,360
I can take the Level 3+ exam.

384
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,510
I told you you'd be fine.

385
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,950
Congratulations.

386
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,090
Does that mean you'll be back soon?

387
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,030
If

388
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,490
I pass it successfully.

389
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,930
Otherwise, I'll have to wait another two weeks.

390
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,240
There's still one more chance to sit for a makeup exam.

391
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,130
That won't happen.

392
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,920
You'll definitely pass it at once.

393
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,270
You have so much confidence in me.

394
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,590
I don't.

395
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,790
I just miss you.

[Luo Zhan]

397
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,400
Hello, Luo Zhan.

398
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,840
I need your help.

399
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,830
Two weeks later,

400
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,880
I'll be taking the Level 3+ exam.

401
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,350
It's mainly on

402
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,590
the demolition of explosives.

403
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,000
Don't your friend in the Xi Country

404
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,830
have a simulation training base?

405
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,000
I want to practice it first.

406
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,550
I haven't touched a bomb for a long time.

407
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,040
I'm worried that I've lost the skills.

00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:54,890
Song Ran.

409
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,720
Your previous script

410
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,630
really touched me.

411
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,720
Your description of the Eastern Country,

412
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,850
including the ordinary people,

413
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,430
the scenery of cities

414
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,330
like Happo and Uglai,

415
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,110
and the people living there,

416
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,430
such as the reporters,

417
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,510

418
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,880

419
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,770
has impressed me.

420
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,900
It made me want to visit the Eastern Country myself

421
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,920
to see the natural scenery there

422
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,580
and to take a look

423
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,810
at the people and things there.

424
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,770
I didn't expect that

425
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,190
you would write such an great amount

426
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,870
and with such high quality again this time.

427
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,610
You have really changed

428
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,020
my opinion of you.

429
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,170
Maybe it's right for you to resign.

430
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,470
You're really suitable for writing.

431
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,150
Mr. Luo,

432
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,620
stop praising me.

433

I've just

434
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,710
found myself

435
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,350
a suitable standpoint.

436
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,480
All words are written with heartfelt emotions.

437

you're my editor.

441
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,170
You can't always be praising me.

442
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,000
You should give me some advice.

443
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,040
Okay.

[Dicheng People's Hospital]

447
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,760
It doesn't seem very serious at the moment.

448
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,160
I'll prescribe some eye drops for you.

449
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,470
Keep dripping it every day.

00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,860
If it doesn't get any better,

451
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,310
you may need to have a minor surgery

452
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,110
to remove your eye lesion.

453
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,190
Don't worry.

Thank you, Dr. He.

Wait.

Is it serious?

463
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,850
That's not the issue, Auntie.

464
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,960
It's just that Ran isn't very cooperative.

00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,750
How old are you now?

467
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,720
You’re supposed to listen to the doctor when you're sick.

468
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,160
Can't you understand that?

469
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,510
The older you get, the more ridiculous you are.

470
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,960
Aren't you sick too?

471
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,490
And you don't want to see a doctor.

472
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,670
How is that the same?

473
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,750
How is that different?

474
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,480
This is called

475
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:28,560
like mother,

476
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,580
like daughter.

00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,400
If you want me to cooperate,

478
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,020
you...

479
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,730
You have to see a doctor too.

480
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,830
Are you threatening me

481

482
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,160
Mom.

483
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,950
This is not threatening.

484
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,880
In a normal mother-daughter relationship,

485
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,680
this would just be called acting spoiled, right?

486
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,900
Can...

487
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,210
Can we

488
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,020
have some

489
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,670
normal mother-daughter interactions?

490
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,100
I think you're not being normal at all.

491
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,860
I'm afraid you need to check your brain too.

492
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,190
Shanran.

493
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,420
You're also messing around with her.

494

Auntie.

495
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,110
I think what Ran said

496
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,640
makes a lot of sense.

497
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:33,780
If you're not feeling well,

498
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,400
you should go for a checkup.

499
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,450
I've heard you cough several times too.

500
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,110
Once you've gotten it checked thoroughly,

501
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,470
Ran would stop being worried.

502
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,720
As for now,

503
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,070
although her eyes are fine,

504
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,480
she still have to keep her mood light.

505
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,000
Alright.

506
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,750
Enough.

507
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,700
If I still believe you now,

508
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,780
I would be a real fool.

509
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:54,390
Fine.

510
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,000
I'll go check it now.

511
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:57,960
Are you satisfied?

512
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,750
No.

513
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,500
You fooled me so many times.

514
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,860
I don't believe you anymore.

515
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,600
Dr. He,

516
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,630
Can you hire a nurse

517
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,110
to accompany my mom,

518
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,780
and supervise her at the same time?

519
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:17,970
Sure.

520
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,650
No problem.

521
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,790
You're going too far now.

522
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,550
I'm warning you.

523
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,330
Don't act like a spoiled child.

524
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,480
So pretentious.

525
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,260
I can't stand it.

526
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:34,920
Wen.

527
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,830
Can you bring Auntie

528
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,110
to the respiratory department for a checkup.

529
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:37,850
Okay.

530
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,550
Dr. He,

531
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,000
do you also

532
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,920
think I'm being awkward

533
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,310
and pretentious?

534
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,950
No.

535
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,790
This is the first time

536
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,550
I act spoiled towards her.

537
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,000
I don't even know

538
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,710
if my brain is really messed up,

539
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,200
I actually acted spoiled towards her.

540
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,340
She hates this the most.

541
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,640
I think

542
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,350
Auntie Ran

543
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,830
doesn't hate you acting spoiled at all.

544
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,160
You can't see clearly now,

545
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,680
but I saw that

546
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,880
she couldn't help but smile.

547
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,090
That expression

548
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,550
didn't look like dislike.

549
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Instead,

550
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,810
it seems like she likes it.

551
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,690
Really?

552
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,110
Yes.

553
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,880
I don't think I've mistaken it.

554
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,910
I think you should try to have

555
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,130
more normal mother-daughter interactions

556
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,440
in the future.

557
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:56,790
Mom.

558
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,440
Has your

559
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,230
medical report come out?

560
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,970
How could it be so quick?

561
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,110
There are still a few test results left.

562
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,960
Don't worry about me.

563
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,889
You're too naggy.

564
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:15,219
It's a scam call.

565
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,020
I'm hanging up.

566
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,969
Don't.

567
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,440
This number is obviously a scam call.

568
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,320
It's not.

569
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,550
Why did you simply hang up my calls?

570
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,030
Did it start with 0069?

571
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:30,880
It really does.

572
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,400
Do you know this number?

573
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,030
Of course I do.

574
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,360
Call it back.

575
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,900
It's Zan.

576
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,400
Here.

577
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:52,820
Don't eavesdrop.

578
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:53,980
Go away.

579
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,670
You’ve got guts now?

580
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:09,990
Ran.

581
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,440
I'm here.

582
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,040
I was too eager

583
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,180
and pressed the wrong button.

584
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,370
I have good news for you.

585
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,360
The Chronicles of Eastern Country

586
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,630
is going well.

587
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,670
Mr. Luo said

588
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,840
I wrote well.

589
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,360
He said I've found

590
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,670
my own inspiration.

591
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,540
Guess

592
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,780
what my inspiration is?

593
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,310
What is it?

594
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,510
Is it me?

595
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,200
You're so shameless.

596
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,570
Not only shameless,

597
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,540
but also self-indulgent.

598
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,200
How are you self-indulgent?

599
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,280
It's you.

600
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,570
Of course it's you.

601
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,630
You don't believe me?

602
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,360
Then come back

603
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,920
ask Mr. Luo yourself.

604
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,260
He can't wait

605
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,160
to see my source of inspiration.

606
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,370
Please.

607
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,320
Stay there.

608
00:37:59,340 --> 00:37:59,890
Stay there.

609
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,440
I will blow up everyone here.

610
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,880
Zan.

611
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,590
Ran.

612
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,000
It seems that

613
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,130
the medicine I prescribed for you

614
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,000
are not working

615
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,760
in your case.

616
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,680
We may need to perform a minor surgery

617
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,550
to scrape the lesion from your eye.

618
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,480
But like I said before,

619
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
you don't have to worry.

620
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,440
It's just a minor surgery.

621
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,580
How long will it take to recover?

622
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,590
It can take effect in three to five days after the surgery.

623
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,190
If everything goes well,

624
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,070
you can recover

625
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,280
in two to three weeks.

626
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,230
Xiaoyi.

627
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,400
Go ahead.

628
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,550
Please call Zan.

629
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,300
I didn't hear you clearly.

630
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,780
Please say it again.

631
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,400
Xiaoyi.

632
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,360
Please...

633
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,880
What silly thing are you doing agaim?

634
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,710
Dr. He said

635
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,370
I still need a week to recover.

636
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,400
But Zan

637
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,950
will be back in two days.

638
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,510
I don't want him to worry about me,

639
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,990
nor be mad at me for not telling him.

640
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,020
So I want to find a way

641
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:11,910
to drag him on,

642
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,850
and make him come back a few days later.

643
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,710
But I still haven't

644
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,410
figured out a good excuse.

645
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,030
Ran.

646
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,140
Now that you're having issues with your eye,

647
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,320
it's the perfect time for Li Zan to come back

648
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,240
and take care of you.

649
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,150
But look at you.

650
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,200
You're thinking of ways to not let him come back.

651
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,630
Why do you need a boyfriend?

652
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,240
You don't show weakness when you need to.

653
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,830
When no one cares for you,

654
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:45,770
don't come crying to me.

655
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,260
I won't cry to you.

656
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,740
Didn't you say

657
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,600
you can't stand it

658
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:53,710
when I show my weakness?

659
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,060
That's towards me.

660
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,000
I wasn't talking about you showing it to your boyfriend.

661
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,190
Alright.

662
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,710
I need to rest.

663
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,040
Here.

664
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,710
Slowly.

665
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,420
I can't accompany you forever.

666
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,490
Li Zan didn't pass the certification assessment?

667
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,970
It's not that he didn't pass.

668
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,600
He didn't even take the exam.

669
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,510
What?

670
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,760
That's impossible.

671
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:07,880
If he didn't take the exam,

672
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,590
what was he practicing for

673
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,350
at your place every day?

674
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,190
I find it strange too.

675
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,660
So I went to check the CCTV.

676
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,990
See for yourself.

677
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,960
Anyway, your friend

678
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,820
definitely has something going on.
