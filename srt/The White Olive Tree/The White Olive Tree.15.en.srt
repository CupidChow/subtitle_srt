[The White Olive Tree]

00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,000
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,530
[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

4
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:52,789
You even avoid doctors now.

5
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,229
When will you ever recover completely?

6
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,920
I forgot about it today.

7
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,560
I didn't mean it.

8
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,400
Besides,

9
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,169
I'm fine now.

10
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,030
Let it be.

11
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,310
If you really want to let it be,

12
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,750
why bother making these things?

13
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,470
Mr. Luo.

14
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,030
Do you know what it means

15
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,750
to see through but not expose?

16
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,220
I know that.

17
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,490
But, I also know that

18
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,240
without destruction, there can be no construction.

19
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,150
Besides,

20
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,360
when I was waiting for you downstairs,

21
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,760
I thought about ways to

22
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,990
not expose you.

23
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,370
But you came back

24
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,780
before I could figure out.

25
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:56,600
So,

26
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,700
I can only be frank.

27
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,030
Li Zan,

28
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,280
I know you already believe

29
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,910
that you had something to do with Jiang Lin's death.

30
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,080
But you can't recall what happened.

31
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,080
This is your biggest trouble.

32
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,360
But, regarding this matter,

33
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,750
why are you so stubborn

34
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,630
and insist on thinking negatively?

35
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,079
Mr. Luo.

36
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,240
I...

37
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,860
I can't recall what happened

38
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,430
due to my self-protection mechanism.

39
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,960
And the reason for the protection

40
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,630
is that this memory

41
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,600
hurts me.

42
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,140
Do you think

43
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,800
there could be any other explanation

44
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,590
besides the fact that Jiang Lin's death is connected to me?

45
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,190
Even if Jiang Lin's death is connected to you,

46
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,910
based on your own understanding of yourself,

47
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,339
I don’t believe you don’t know

48
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,500
that it must not have been intentional

49
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,830
and that it must have been because you were trying to save someone.

50
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,000
I know that.

51
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,630
But having the right purpose

52
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,950
doesn't guarantee a good result.

53
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,310
You...

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,040
I really wish

55
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,800
you could spare some of your kindness and compassion

56
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,580
for yourself.

57
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,870
Mr. Luo,

58
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,700
I'm actually doing well.

59
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,950
This is a small program I developed.

60
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,360
It can simulate and predict explosions.

61
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,160
It's more convenient to use than yours.

62
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,190
By the way,

63
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,750
I ran into Reporter Song in front of the hospital today.

64
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,480
I looked very flustered.

65
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,270
I don't know if she will think much about it.

66
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,240
Hospital?

67
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,150
Reporter Song.

68
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,280
I want one too.

69
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,120
You're so handsome.

70
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,240
I want one too.

71
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,060
Can you make one?

72
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,010
It's really cute.

73
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,000
It's so cute.

74
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,870
It's calling for you.

75
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,500
Reporter Song.

76
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,830
Good morning.

77
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,430
See you next time.

78
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,240
I heard that the application for the next round of expatriate

79
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,360
is delayed till next month.

80
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,190
Yeah.

81
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,390
I think it is still to the Uglai City of Eastern Country.

82
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,560
Would Zan

83
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,940
want to return to the Eastern Country too?

84
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,000
Ran,

85
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,920
Director Liu wants to see you.

86
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,360
He wants you to follow up

87
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,310
on the topic of

88
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,510
the International Youth Science and Technology Competition.

89
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,190
Okay.

90
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,340
I'm here to pass you your student ID

91
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
and this jacket.

92
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,510
Can I talk to you for a while more?

93
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,390
As my reward for running errands for you.

94
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,390
That's not too much, is it?

95
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,080
Jiang Yu.

96
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,440
I understand

97
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,070
that Jiang Lin's sacrifice

98
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,550
has made you angry

99
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:23,960
and sad.

100
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,630
But I don't understand

101
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,440
your hatred towards him.

102
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,010
Shouldn't he be hated?

103
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,980
Since I was six, he'd been saying

104
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,400
he would take me to live with him.

105
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,000
He said it throughout primary school,

106
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,430
and throughout middle school.

107
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,540
Even if he didn't die,

108
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,410
he will never take me with him.

109
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,360
He is such a hypocrite.

110
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,790
Shouldn't I hate him?

111
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,520
In my eyes,

112
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,880
he is a deceitful person

113
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,720
and a liar.

114
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,170
Enough.

115
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,030
Jiang Yu.

116
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,790
You've gone too far.

117
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,200
I don't want to talk to you.

118
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,520
You can't leave until I finish.

119
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,120
I don't want to.

120
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,340
Before I finish,

121
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,350
you can't go anywhere.

122
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,560
Jiang Yu.

123
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,240
If Jiang Lin really is a hypocrite

124
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,200
like you said,

125
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,680
if everything the said to you is a lie,

126
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,670
he wouldn't have mentioned you often.

127
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,750
As his friend,

128
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,630
I

129
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,080
shouldn't have known of your existence,

130
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,080
let alone travel thousands of miles

131
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,440
after Jiang Lin's sacrifice

132
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,720
to look for you,

133
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,020
help you,

134
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,850
and even

135
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,600
tolerate your nasty attitude.

136
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,510
Jiang Yu.

137
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,490
You blamed the uncertainty and cruelty of a war

138
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,240
all on him.

139
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,120
Is it fair?

140
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,150
Isn't it too much?

141
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,480
There are many ways

142
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,670
to miss someone.

143
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,430
But the verbal abuse and violent outbursts

144
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,020
is definitely the worst way.

145
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,720
Since you are a good brother in the eyes of Jiang Lin,

146
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,580
I believe

147
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,890
you can understand these principles.

148
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,630
I'll leave you alone

149
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,550
to think about it.

150
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,030
I'll come to you again soon.

Ms. Fu,

173
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,040
thank you for recommending the fews students

174
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,670
to participate in the Science and Technology Competition.

175
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,030
I will still have to trouble you

176
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,050
another time.

177
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,650
You're welcome, Reporter Song.

178
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,120
Goodbye.

179
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,900
It's none of your business.

180
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,080
Don't follow me around anymore

181
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,120
and don't bother me again.

182
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,790
I won't meddle in your problems anymore.

183
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,200
Take care of your own business.

184
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,000
What are you doing?

185
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,400
Let go of him!

186
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,270
Let go!

187
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,040
Another busybody.

188
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,700
If you dare to follow me,

189
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,540
I'll beat you up.

190
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,630
Are you okay?

191
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,790
You didn't get hurt, did you?

192
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,080
Don't be afraid.

193
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,030
I'm a reporter.

194
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,600
My name is Song Ran.

195
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,320
No matter what it is,

196
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,390
if you need help,

197
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,000
you can come to me.

198
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,070
No, thanks.

199
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,790
Thank you.

200
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:58,690
Hey!

201
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,080
Ran.

202
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,340
A student is looking for you downstairs.

203
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,750
He said his name is Wang Han.

204
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,810
A student from Bai Xi Experimental High School.

205
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:50,960
Wang Han.

206
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,370
Ms. Reporter,

207
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,870
can you help me?

208
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,360
What happened?

209
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,840
Who did this to you?

210
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,790
It's Jiang Yu.

211
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,840
Mr. Li,

212
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,040
I have great news.

213
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,120
Today, Jiang Yu

214
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,750
apologized to the student he beat up.

215
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,200
Although his tone is still tough,

216
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,590
it is till considered great progress.

217
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,440
Our class teacher

218
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
is so naggy.

219
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,460
Why is she telling you every single thing?

220
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,270
Don't flatter yourself.

221
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,850
I apologize

222
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,790
because I did beat him too hard.

223
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,890
It has nothing to do

224
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:46,990
with what you said that day.

225
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,160
I know.

226
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,870
You know?

227
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,840
Then why did you still come?

228
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,450
I'm here

229
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,530
because both of us

230
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,030
have something in common

231
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,980
that is hard to find in others.

232
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,160
Us?

233
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,920
An engineer

234
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,270
and a high school hooligan.

235
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:13,480
What can we have in common?

236
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,160
We do.

237
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,510
We both

238
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,720
miss Jiang Lin a lot.

239
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,520
Jiang Yu.

240
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,400
Every time I see you,

241
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,870
I feel as if

242
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,640
Jiang Lin is not that far away from me.

243
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,720
You are like

244
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,550
the linkage

245
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,960
between Jiang Lin and I.

246
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,290
With your existence,

247
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,680
Jiang Lin no longer

248
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,480
seems so distant

249
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,550
and intangible to me.

250
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,880
Do you have this feeling?

251
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,540
I don't feel this way.

252
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,430
This is our most recent photo together.

253
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,670
But that was also several years ago.

254
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
We look a little silly.

255
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,830
Your choice of word is inaccurate.

256
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,510
It's not silly.

257
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,070
It's cute.

258
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,670
Using the word "cute" on two grown men.

259
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,150
I think your choice of word is inaccurate.

260
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,590
I'd rather be silly.

261
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,160
It's getting late.

262
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,550
Let me send you home.

263
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,960
Wait for me here.

264
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,560
I'll drive the car over.

265
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,550
It would be silly

266
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,050
not to use a free driver.

267
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,270
Excuse me,

268
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
are you Jiang Yu?

269
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,130
I'm a reporter.

270
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,180
My name is Song Ran.

271
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,110
We met yesterday.

272
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,440
You were

273
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,950
beating Wang Han at that time.

274
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,230
What nonsense are you talking about?

275
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,130
Am I talking nonsense?

276
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,200
I saw it with my own eyes.

277
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,020
Both yesterday

278
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,500
and today.

279
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,520
What yesterday and today?

280
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,090
Don't be nosy.

281
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,400
Reporters are nosy.

282
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,960
Are you sick in the mind?

283
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,160
Jiang Yu!

284
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,010
Zan?

285
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,680
What happened?

286
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,200
Do you know this person?

287
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,540
Reporter Song is my friend.

288
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,510
Keep your friend in check.

289
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,480
Tell her to mind her own business.

290
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,070
Jiang Yu.

291
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,550
Are you okay?

292
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,030
I'm fine.

293
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,590
Just a small scratch.

294
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,990
I have a first-aid kit in my car.

295
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:18,910
Zan.

296
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,790
Why are you here?

297
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,040
How do you know Jiang Yu?

298
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:26,680
Jiang Yu

299
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,130
is Jiang Lin's younger brother.

300
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,030
Jiang Lin's younger brother?

301
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,920
Do you remember on the day

302
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,320
when the explosion at the Uglai Market happened,

303
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,430
Jiang Yu called Jiang Lin?

304
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,350
I remember.

305
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,030
At that time, I even commented

306
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,800
that the brothers are so close.

307
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,350
From Jiang Lin,

308
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,420
I heard a lot about Jiang Yu.

309
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,470
I think

310
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,190
he's not a bad kid.

311
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,310
But after all,

312
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,510
he just lost his brother.

313
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,830
So it's possible for him

314
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,350
to do extreme things.

315
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,030
I'm thinking

316
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,680
if you could let me talk to him for a bit

317
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,200
before you do?

318
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,830
Jiang Yu's personality

319
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,880
is quite stubborn.

320
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,680
Towards me,

321
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,750
he might be less cautious.

322
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,590
Okay.

323
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,920
Thank you.

324
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,000
I should thank you.

325
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,510
I didn't expect our next meeting

326
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,640
to be in this situation.

327
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,030
Me too.

328
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,240
It reminds me of our time in the Eastern Country.

329
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,490
It seems like something unexpected would happen

330
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,400
every time we meet.

331
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,800
Maybe,

332
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,440
that is why

333
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,210
our relationship

334
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,880
is different from others.

335
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,450
I'll send you home.

336
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,070
I drove.

337
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,790
Then I hope

338
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,400
Reporter Song is not driving next time.

339
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,640
Then...

340
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,510
I'll see you next time.

341
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,550
Be careful.

342
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,110
Ran.

343
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,030
Song Yang is coming home today.

344
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,310
Come back too.

345
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,200
Let's have dinner together.

346
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,650
Is depression just a bad mood?

347
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,920
Song Ran's mother called and talked to your dad.

348
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,560
I didn't want to ask much.

349
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,390
Yes,

350
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,160
but also not really.

351
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,920
You won't understand.

352
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,270
You can interpret it

353
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,310
however you want to.

354
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,310
How did your sister get this disease?

355
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,370
She was never a person with bad temper.

356
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,750
But now when I talk to her,

357
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,340
I'm always so cautious.

358
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,000
I said you won't understand.

359
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,700
This is called psychological trauma.

360
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,640
Psychological trauma?

361
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,330
She seems fine.

362
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,700
Her work is doing well,

363
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,760
and her photograph won an award.

364
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,340
Isn't it just getting bashed for a bit?

365
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,270
Does she have to take it so hard?

366
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,640
She

367
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,340
is always frowning.

368
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,420
Who can stand it?

369
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,520
I don't know what time your sister will be back.

370
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,410
But I didn't dare to ask either.

371
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,070
She yelled at me on the phone last time.

372
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,510
I'm still scared till this day.

373
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,400
If she does it again,

374
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,660
I'm going to be depressed too.

375
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,880
Oh jeez.

376
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,310
You still remember that from so long ago?

377
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,920
[Zan]

378
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,110
Stop beating me.

379
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,740
This video

380
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,400
was spread online just now.

381
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,190
Many viewers hope that our TV station

382
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,140
will pay attention to this.

383
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,510
-So...
-Sir.

384
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,960
I know

385
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,590
the student who got beaten.

386
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,110
I'll figure it out.

387
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,550
Song Ran.

388
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,960
Both of the parties

389
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,000
are still students.

390
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,750
And you are a reporter.

391
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,830
You must know your boundaries.

392
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:36,750
Okay.

393
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,720
Hello, Ms. Fu.

394
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,730
I'm Song Ran who have contacted you before.

395
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,070
I'm looking for Wang Han.

396
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,270
Can you help me...

397
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,640
What?

398
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,470
Wang Han didn't come to school today.

399
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,380
Alright.

400
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,870
Thank you.

401
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,020
Bye.

402
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,240
Hello.

403
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,720
I'm a reporter.

404
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,670
My name is Song Ran.

405
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,350
I know Wang Han.

406
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,960
Is he at home?

407
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,860
Can I see him?

408
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,270
You are that reporter?

409
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,880
Sorry.

410
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,000
Wang Han doesn't want to see anyone now.

411
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,960
Wang Han said this is for you.

412
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:52,920
I hope

413
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,320
you won't let him down again.

414
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,070
After the last time I looked for you,

415
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,460
I think you haven't fully trusted me.

416
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
This notebook

417
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,920
records the time and place of

418
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,590
every time I got beaten,

419
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,690
stalked, and assaulted.

420
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,160
They are all recorded immediately after

421
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,770
I got beaten up.

422
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,680
Can this make you

423
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,590
trust me more?

424
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,310
Does this...

425
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Does this make you more willing

426
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,160
to help me?

427
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,600
Sorry, Wang Han.

428
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,970
I failed to protect you right away.

429
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,620
At the Eastern Country,

430
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,890
I couldn't protect those kids.

431
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,550
Can't I do that either

432
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,180
over here,

433
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
in Liangcheng?

434
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,680
Let me explain.

435
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:00,960
Stop beating me!

436
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,030
Stop beating me!

437
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,310
Schools

438
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,400
should be a pure and safe space.

439
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,590
Children’s growth

440
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,880
requires the care and attention

441
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,230
of teachers, parents,

442
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,550
and us adults.

443
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,000
Incidents of school bullying

444
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,030
may be happening right around us.

445
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,470
[Qiu Tian]

446
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:54,630
Ran.

447
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,190
Did you post a comment last night?

448
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,790
Do you know the comment section got out of hand?

449
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,480
I'm talking about the video of a student beating people.

450
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,540
I...

451
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,310
I just watched the video

452
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:12,690
and spoke from my heart.

453
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,030
I didn't expect...

454
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,240
You're different now.

455
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,830
You're now very influential.

456
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,370
Director Liu came looking for you as soon as he came to work.

457
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,200
He saw that you weren't arounf

458
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,160
and asked me to tell you

459
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,750
to delete your comment immediately.

460
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,240
I couldn't wait till you arrive

461
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,440
so I called you.

462
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,750
Why?

463
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,900
This is just my personal behavior.

464
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,070
It has nothing to do with the station, right?

465
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,880
He didn't mention this.

466
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,050
Anyway, he looked worried.

467
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,860
Arrive soon.

468
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,630
I'll wait for you.

469
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,300
Did you see my comment?

470
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,750
Are you

471
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,360
angry?

472
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,240
No.

473
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,680
I just thought you would tell me

474
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,750
before you post it.

475
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,240
At that time,

476
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,760
I was just very moved

477
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,610
and said what I felt.

478
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,110
And it was very late at night.

479
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,270
I didn't want to disturb you.

480
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,510
As soon as the video was posted,

481
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,310
I've been looking for Jiang Yu

482
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,570
and I just found him.

483
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,160
I'm going to see him now.

484
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,030
I came

485
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,390
hoping you won't jump to a conclusion

486
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,890
before I talk to him.

487
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,880
Okay?

488
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,040
Of course.

489
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,440
I want to go with you.

490
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,550
I also want to talk to Jiang Yu.

491
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,880
Look.

492
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,250
Actually, my comment yesterday

493
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,120
did not express any opinion on this matter.

494
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,880
I don’t have any stance

495
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,250
for the time being.

496
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,550
I was simply speaking from the heart based on the content of the video.

497
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,200
But your comment

498
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,640
assumes that the video

499
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,240
is about school bullying.

500
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,490
Let's get going.

501
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,110
I'm not...

502
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,710
Jiang Yu.

503
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,140
Anger can't solve any problem.

504
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,960
Yes, Jiang Yu.

505
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,680
We just want to know

506
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,820
the truth.

507
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,030
Besides,

508
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,070
you did beat Wang Han.

509
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:03,710
Right?

510
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,320
Yes.

511
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,739
That's right.

512
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,480
I did hit him.

513
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,730
I just wanted to beat him up.

514
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,110
I get angry whenever I see him.

515
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,590
Not only this time,

516
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,480
I'll beat him up the next time I see him.

517
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,110
This is the truth.

518
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,320
Are you satisfied?

519
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,510
Jiang Yu,

520
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,320
I want to hear the truth,

521
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,920
not words spoken in anger.

522
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,030
Trust me,

523
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,320
Reporter Song has no ill intentions.

524
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,670
Trust you?

525
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,290
You said she wouldn't write nonsense.

526
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,699
And what happened?

527
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,630
You said you wanted to see me,

528
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,889
but you brought her along.

529
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,760
How can I trust you?

530
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,110
You're a liar

531
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,670
just like Jiang Lin.

532
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,830
You're all liars!

533
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,190
Jiang Yu.

534
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,650
Jiang Yu is emotional now.

535
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,390
Give him some time.

536
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,190
But,

537
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:35,640
the other child

538
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,630
has been waiting for a long time.

539
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,820
This is Wang Han's record.

540
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,480
Every time he was beaten

541
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,440
is clearly recorded here,

542
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,070
and the handwriting varies in age.

543
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,550
This definitely wasn’t written last minute just to make things up.

544
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,590
I believe this is real.

545
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:15,980
But it only

546
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,800
records the time and location,

547
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,920
it didn't mention who did it.

548
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,820
Besides...

549
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:23,530
This one here.

550
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,940
This particular incident

551
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,320
was the first time

552
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,670
I saw Jiang Yu beating Wang Han.

553
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,170
The time and place match.

554
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,920
I saw it with my own eyes.

555
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,230
It can't be fake, can it?

556
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,000
Li Zan.

557
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,120
He is Jiang Lin's younger brother.

558
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,280
I understand

559
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,820
why you don't want to believe it.

560
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:11,840
But...

561
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,440
Song Ran.

562
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,670
I can understand

563
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,310
why you're willing to believe it's him.

564
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,320
Now, Jiang Yu is hostile towards you.

565
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,280
I think it's better for me

566
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,320
to look for him alone.

567
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,720
You should go back first.

568
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,460
Zan.

569
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,400
Why don't even you understand me?

671
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,070
you're famous now.

672
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,030
Your speech is very influential.

673
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,380
That is a good thing.

674
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,480
But,

675
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,670
influence is a double-edged sword.

676
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Because of fame,

677
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,100
you have to

00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,660

679
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,360
Don't affect your future.

680
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,400

690
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,220

692
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,060

693
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,520
