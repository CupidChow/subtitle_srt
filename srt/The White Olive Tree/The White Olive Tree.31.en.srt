[Episode 31]

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,300
[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

4
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,820
Captain.

5
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,000
Sasin.

6
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
You were supposed to handle the artillery,

7
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,560
not go onto the battlefield.

8
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,190
Why did you…

9
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,940
Lock me up if you want.

10
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,710
The war is over.

11
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,910
Why would I lock you up?

12
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:32,900
Forget it.

13
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,790
Since you just helped me out,

14
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,740
I'll let it slide this time.

15
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,880
Don't let it slide.

16
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,600
I don't want to be your scapegoat

17
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,790
and used as your excuse.

18
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,150
You know nothing.

19
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,960
Paying for drinks is not a big deal,

20
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,360
but freedom is.

21
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,950
Jerk.

22
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,630
What did you say?

23
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,600
At such a young age,

24
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,920
do you even know what a jerk is?

25
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,670
Where is your star?

26
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,910
Your star.

27
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,590
Stop.

28
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,210
Where are you going?

29
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,670
I need to find my star.

30
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,030
I'll go with you.

31
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,650
I don't need your help.

32
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,530
I can find it myself.

33
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,680
It's an order!

34
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,810
That bastard Ark escaped again.

35
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,250
We just took back the Holy Temple.

36
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,110
The battlefield hasn't been cleared yet.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,760
You may be caught off guard and get shot.

38
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,190
And strictly speaking,

39
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,400
the star you lost is mine.

40
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,050
Take this.

41
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,720
Stop looking.

42
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,430
Let's go back.

43
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,480
I've given the star to you.

44
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,530
Why are you still looking?

45
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,480
The lost one is yours, but I still need to find it.

46
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,720
It's none of your business!

47
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,070
How can you find it in such a big place?

48
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,870
I'm talking to you!

49
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,190
Can you stop being so childish?

50
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,630
No.

51
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,500
Otherwise, Rina would blame me.

52
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,070
Cut the crap.

53
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,680
Come here!

54
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,750
Get down!

55
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,590
You got shot?

56
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,690
It hurts so much.

57
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,150
Zan.

58
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,180
The Holy Temple at Matuman

59
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,020
is still so beautiful.

60
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,830
Song.

61
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,160
Song.

62
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,060
Dr. Pei needs your help.

63
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,800
Just keep pressing on it.

64
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,000
Benjamin?

65
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,970
Why is it you?

66
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,740
Saline and gauze may not be enough.

67
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,490
Go get some for me.

68
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,150
Okay.

69
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,360
What happened to you?

70
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,840
An enemy shot at us.

71
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,180
He saved me.

72
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,190
I didn't take the bullet for you.

73
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,650
It was for…

74
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,260
For this.

75
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,390
You found it?

76
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:26,870
Don't move!

77
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,820
Do you want to have a limp for the rest of your life?

78
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,040
Dr. Pei, don't worry.

79
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,210
Even if I had a limp,

80
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,500
I'd still make it

81
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,540
to our Vinyl date.

82
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,390
No need for that.

83
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,640
You want to look at it, don't you?

84
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,320
Keep it to yourself.

85
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,190
I'm not looking at it.

86
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,200
I found the star,

87
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,920
but as Dr. Pei said,

88
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,480
I'll have to

89
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,410
walk with a limp in the future.

90
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,910
You'll need to provide for me.

91
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,660
Your leg is fine.

92
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,710
The bullet didn't hurt any bones or nerves.

93
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,620
You'll be fine after going to the hospital for some stitches.

94
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,120
Dr. Pei.

95
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,640
We got a patient here who needs your attention.

96
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,390
Okay.

97
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,380
You're in charge.

98
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,230
Just like this.

99
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,270
Okay.

100
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,270
Thank you.

101
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,610
For what?

102
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,010
Thank you.

103
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,510
I want to thank Zan too.

104
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,600
And him.

105
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,960
Eastern Country is like a big tree.

106
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,280
Thank you all for watering it.

107
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,200
Without you,

108
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,910
this tree

109
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,390
might never bear fruit again.

110
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,390
I…

111
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,970
I can't tell you

112
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,190
how grateful I am.

113
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,320
Sasin.

114
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,540
I always believe

115
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,870
Eastern Country and its people will make it through.

116
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,510
One day, you'll put down your gun

117
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,650
and pick up your pen again.

118
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,870
Song Ran.

119
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,410
That adjutant's injury

120
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,660
needs to be treated in the hospital.

121
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,660
Come with me.

122
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,280
Okay.

123
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,600
Take care of him.

Instructor Li.

134
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,800
It's me.

135
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,390
Sorry.

136
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,270
You're actually so fast

137
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,690
and so strong.

138
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,640
Sorry to scare you.

139
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,170
Here, wipe your face.

140
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm good.

141
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,800
I'll clean it later.

142
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,530
There are so many bruises on your face.

143
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,370
And you did a lot for my country,

144
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,660
so I need to do something good for you as well.

145
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,030
You're welcome.

146
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,380
There are some basic medicines in the camp.

147
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,530
I'd better go back and clean my wounds first.

148
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,910
Well.

149
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,160
What is it? Did something go red?

150
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,380
It's okay.

151
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,540
Is it a gift from your family?

152
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,720
Yeah.

153
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,210
It's from my girlfriend

154
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,120
for safety and love.

155
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,120
Zan.

156
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,520
Song and the injured went to the hospital.

157
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,590
She asked me to tell you.

158
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,090
Did she just…

159
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,340
What?

160
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,150
Nothing.

161
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,870
Sasin.

162
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:20,910
I gotta go.

163
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,390

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,230
No. He's not here.

We took Matuman back!

198
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,570

00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,110
I didn't think too much back then.

275
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,160
I thought you would…

276
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,020
But so much time has passed.

277
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,240
Ran.

278
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,440
Back then…

279
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,640
I know.

280
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,510
There was something on your mind.

281
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,680
Me too.

282
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,110
So you don't have to…

283
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,760
[Paroxetine hydrochloride]

284
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,920
Ran.

285
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,510
It has nothing to do with you.

286
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,440
It's not because we broke up.

287
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,250
I had this disease before.

288
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,270
The 926 Explosion…

289
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,030
Ran.

290
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,320
Why didn't you tell me about it?

291
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,030
I thought I had recovered.

292
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,980
Later, my mom got sick, and I…

293
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,510
Anyway, I'm fine now.

294
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,030
I haven't taken that medicine in a long time.

295
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,510
Don't… Don't…

296
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,000
Sorry.

297
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,480
I shouldn't have gone abroad when you

298
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,310
needed me the most.

299
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,590
No.

300
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,230
Don't say sorry to me.

301
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,400
You have nothing to apologize for.

302
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,620
I was…

303
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,510
I was…

304
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,000
I was in a bad mood.

305
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,590
I…

306
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,860
I shouldn't have said

307
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,730
I didn't want to hear from you anymore.

308
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,240
I was wrong.

309
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,720
I really regret it.

310
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,640
I wanted you to come back.

311
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,510
But

312
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,760
I didn't want you to change your mind

313
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,090
because I was ill.

314
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,820
Zan.

315
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,500
Things couldn't be like that.

316
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,640
I understand.

317
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,160
Ran.

318
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,110
It's not because of that.

319
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,720
I…

320
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,400
I've never thought about

321
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,100
cutting ties with you.

322
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,160
I just…

323
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,520
I said sorry

324
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,180
not because of that medicine.

325
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,880
I apologized because I knew it was very dangerous,

326
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,110
but I still came.

327
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,880
I knew you would find out

328
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,070
but still didn't tell you immediately.

329
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,080
I knew after I came here this time, I might…

330
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,330
I might die,

331
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,440
but I still kept moving forward.

332
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,920
Ran.

333
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,240
You're the person

334
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,110
who I owe the most in this world.

335
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,680
Because I knew I'd make you

336
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,110
endure a lot of pain…

337
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,240
but I still fell for you.

338
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,310
I still want to be with you.

339
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm too selfish.

340
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,640
I let you bear

341
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,720
all the possible consequences. Sorry.

342
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,620
Sorry.

343
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,510
No.

344
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,310
Zan.

345
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,880
It was my choice.

346
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,250
I chose to be with you.

347
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,970
I fell for you.

00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:21,250
♫A blue sailboat♫

381
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:24,720
♫Heading toward her shore♫

382
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:31,590
♫The sky turns a deeper blue♫

383
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:38,010
♫The night has never been so dazzling♫

384
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,940
♫A white island♫

385
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,400
♫Blooms in the vast sea♫

386
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,720
♫I wish I could pick it♫

387
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,580
♫And give it to you♫

388
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:13,770
♫And she will remember you and me♫

389
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,680
Ran.

390
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,150
When I fell asleep at Matuman,

391
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,400
was it you?

392
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,790
So it wasn't a dream.

393
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,110
At that moment,

394
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,090
I smelled you.

395
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,720
But I was too tired

396
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,790
to wake up.

397
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,830
I could only snuggle up to you

398
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,510
as a response.

399
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,110
Zan.

400
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,400
You did respond to me.

401
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,830
It wasn't in your dream.

402
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Otherwise,

403
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,350
maybe I wouldn't have...

404
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,640
I wouldn't have tried so hard to find you.

405
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,240
Luckily, I responded to you.

406
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,160
Zan.

407
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,640
Actually,

408
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,530
I'm a nice person.

409
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,500
Back then,

410
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,120
I was a bit weird because I was ill.

411
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,310
But I'm actually very nice.

412
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:11,940
I mean it.

413
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:14,820
I know.

414
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,440
Don't worry.

415
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,010
It's okay to be ill.

416
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,000
I don't mind.

417
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,190
Actually, there are many things I can't get over either.

418
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,920
Just like you.

419
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,270
Then,

420
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,200
tell me about them when you want to.

421
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,110
We have plenty of time ahead of us.

422
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:02,460
Okay.

423
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,240
Zan.

424
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,400
I want to tell you

425
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,920
a story about a tree and a bird.

426
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:32,920
Okay.

427
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,070
Go ahead.

428
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,680
Once upon a time,

429
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,200
there was a little bird.

430
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,790
It got injured

431
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,030
and fell from the sky.

432
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,000
A big tree caught it

433
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,440
and protected it from the wind and rain.

434
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,190
After the bird recovered,

435
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,610
it built a home in the tree,

436
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,690
sang for the tree every day,

437
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,330
and told the tree stories outside.

438
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,370
Then winter came.

439
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,510
The bird had to go to the south.

440
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,830
Before it left, it told the tree,

441
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,550
"I'll come back to you next spring."

442
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,710
But when the bird came back,

443
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,800
the tree

444
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,460
had been cut down.

445
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,360
Only a stump was left.

446
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:51,389
Then what happened?

447
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,400
The bird asked the grass nearby,

448
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,440
"Where is my tree?"

449
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,320
The grass answered,

450
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,520
"Your tree was cut down by a lumber mill.

451
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,810
You may find it in the lumber mill."

452
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,390
♫When the moonlight♫

453
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,690
The bird flew to the lumber mill

454
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,520
♫Glows on you♫

455
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,980
and saw tall piles of logs.

456
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,390
♫Each step is singing in the light♫

457
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,170
♫The song of snowing the white♫

458
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,410
But none of them were its tree.

459
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,080
♫Moonlight♫

460
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,360
So it asked a log,

461
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,470
"Have you seen my tree?"

462
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,380
♫Touch your face♫

463
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,820
♫All the shine of a thousand spotlights♫

464
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,760
The log said,

465
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,710
"Your tree has been sent to the match factory."

466
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,230
♫All the feelings♫

467
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,050
♫I can't deny♫

468
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,710
Then the bird flew to the match factory.

469
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,320
The production line was full of boxes of matches.

470
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,170
♫As you're moving close to me♫

471
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,280
It asked the matches,

472
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,160
♫My heart will never believe♫

473
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,260
"Have you seen my tree?"

474
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:48,860
The matches answered, "Your tree has been made into matches

475
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,030
and sold to a store."

476
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,800
The bird then flew to the store.

477
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,960
It was bought?

478
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,400
The last box of matches was sold a few days ago.

479
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,710
The bird was too tired.

480
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,710
It couldn't fly anymore.

481
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,590
On a stormy night,

482
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,800
its wings got all wet.

483
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,590
When it was about to fall into the mud,

484
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,400
it saw light from a cabin in the forest.

485
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,190
It flew in and fell on the table.

486
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,030
There was a lit candle and an empty matchbox

487
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,100
on the table.

488
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,440
The flame of the candle warmed the bird.

489
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,490
It finally woke up.

490
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,830
The bird asked the candle,

491
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,320
"Have you seen my tree?"

492
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,360
The candle said,

493
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,150
"Yes.

494
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,760
The last match

495
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:51,960
♫Cause you're so beautiful♫

496
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,110
that lit me to keep you warm

497
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,710
was your tree."

498
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:55,210
♫This love will never change♫

499
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,710
♫Halo on your side♫

500
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,640
It's a good story.

501
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:04,460
♫You are so beautiful♫

502
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,030
What's good about it?

503
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,960
I felt sad when I read it as a young girl.

504
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,590
♫Like angel from the stars♫

505
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:12,910
♫Over in the sky, tonight♫

506
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,360
But after thinking about it,

507
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:15,350
I think it might not be a love story.

508
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,960
The tree

509
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,350
might embody some kind of faith or belief.

510
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,390
The bird never gave up pursuing it.

511
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,880
Despite all the hardships in the process,

512
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:35,800
there would still be a warm ending.

513
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,470
You're trying to comfort me.

514
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,020
Zan.

515
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,320
Just go your way.

516
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,630
Everything will be fine.

517
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,410
Okay.

518
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:19,530
But I still think it's a love story.

519
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,410
Ran.

520
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,770
I don't want you to get too tired flying

521
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,620
or look for too long.

522
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,590
But if you can't fly anymore,

523
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,410
I promise to be the match that warms you.

524
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:32,880
Sasin.

525
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,000
Sasin!

526
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,920
It's getting dark.

527
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,880
Push me to the bar next to the hospital.

528
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,280
You want to drink in this condition?

529
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,870
I'm just going to the bar.

530
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,770
I don't plan to drink.

531
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,590
Why go to the bar if you're not drinking?

532
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,960
I have a date with Dr. Pei.

533
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:12,210
Usually, it's fine

534
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:12,930
to just cancel it.

535
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,110
But when I met her on the front lines this time…

536
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,310
I said something women hate to hear.

537
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,900
I need to make it up to her tonight.

538
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:27,920
Besides,

539
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:28,760
I bought a three-month

540
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,880
membership to Vinyl.

541
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,150
It'd be a waste not to go.

542
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,320
That's your business.

543
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,250
Why do you always like to sabotage

544
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,800
the relationship between Dr. Pei and me?

545
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,670
Is it because you don't have love in your life,

546
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,690
so you're worried that once I find true love,

547
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,040
there won't be anyone to take care of you?

548
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,500
-If that's the case…
-Shut up, Benjamin.

549
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:19,710
When have I ever sabotaged

550
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,000
your relationship with Dr. Pei?

551
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,930
You're doing it right now by not pushing me

552
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,020
to Vinyl.

553
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,040
Climb onto it.

554
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,030
I'll push you there now.

555
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,480
My leg is injured.

556
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,000
Why did you sit down?

557
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,900
This is not a place you should be.

558
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,280
You think I want to be here watching you?

559
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,970
If you could walk,

560
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,360
I wouldn't want to stay a minute longer.

561
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,450
Dr. Pei will push me back later.

562
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,020
You don't need to wait for me at the hospital.

563
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,590
Go back to camp and get some sleep…

564
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,430
He has a really bad temper these days.
