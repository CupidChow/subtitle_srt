Dad.

5
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,650
You landed two hours ago.

6
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,579
What took you so long?

Sit here.

Okay.

11
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,760
It's damp and cold in the south.

The air conditioner

13
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,270
is not warm enough.

Get ready to eat.

15
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,329
By the way,

16
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,810
this time,

17
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,410
you went to Dicheng straight from Eastern Country for a checkup.

18
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,390
You didn't get hurt, did you?

19
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,410
No.

20
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,670
Just some scratches.

21
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,780
The checkup is mandatory

22
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,840
as required by the volunteer organization.

23
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,520
Okay, let's eat.

24
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,970
Well, this chicken soup

25
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,530
has been simmering all afternoon.

26
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,750
Here.

27
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,520
Okay.

28
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,630
The soup is really good.

29
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,310
I’ve been simmering it the entire afternoon.

30
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,510
It's delicious.

31
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,620
Where did you get these from?

32
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,500
Luo Zhan brought them.

33
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,360
He said,

34
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,550
the nutritious products

35
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,580
are to replenish my health;

36
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,120
the books

37
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,220
are to relieve my boredom.;

38
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,730
the drawings are your work.

39
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,430
He said,

40
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,940
there are too few professional people like you.

41
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,800
So,

42
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,390
your leave can't be too long.

43
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,360
You need to return to work sooner.

44
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,860
During your break,

45
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,760
you can take a look at the drawings.

46
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,860
Don't be too idle.

47
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,600
Anyway, he said a lot of things.

48
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,780
If I don't know him well,

49
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,000
I would suspect that

50
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,600
you are often

51
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,110
wronged by him.

52
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,000
I am indeed often wronged by him.

53
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,050

81
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,710
Is the award something you can present

82
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,080
or withdraw at your discretion?

83
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,420
This will cause a big stir.

84
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,000
Of course I know.

85
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,420
But compared to the harm

86
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,220
this photo brings to Song Ran,

87
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,580
it is nothing.

96
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,830

the selection of these photos

was done with Song Ran's input.

102

Stop being so full of yourself, okay?

103
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,360
The person who is scared to face it

104
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,120
is probably yourself.

105
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,250
Director Liu, you're right.

106
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,390

You still like it

114
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,230
frame yourself as the bad person.

115
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,070
Do you think that

116
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,480
you've let down the Eastern Country?

117
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,250
Because I think so too.

118

Ever since I came back from the Eastern Country,

119
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,510
I dare not watch

120
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,920
any news about the Eastern Country,

121
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,150
and I dare not even more

122
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,420
look at the things I've taken.

123
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,600
So I don't even want to know

124
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,750
which photo was submitted

125
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,340

00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,600

After these days,

129
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,520
I've also understood

130
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,510
that human's joy and sorrow are not mutual.

131
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,290
Without experiencing the same things

132
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,340

133
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,860

00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,750
to hear your voice.

196
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,360
Is this genuine?

197
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,690
I feel like you all don't really want to see me.

198
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,290
You all disappeared without a trace.

199
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,080
Disappeared?

200
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,600
You're in the Eastern Country,

201
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,150
and you still don't get to meet Sasin

202
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,320
and Benjamin?

203
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,870
I couldn't reach them.

204
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,770
I did hear about Benjamin.

205
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,580
He has been in the Special Forces.

206
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,370
He even refused to take rotations

207
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,320
and remained in

208
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,480
the most dangerous team among the Special Forces.

209
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:38,870
I

210
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,950
met him once while treating the wounded.

211
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,780
Honestly,

212
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,940
considering how he was covered in wounds,

213
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,190
it's a miracle that he's still alive.

214
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,000
As for Sasin,

215
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,730
I only know that he quit his job as a reporter

216
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,480
and disappeared.

217
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,630
What?

218
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,670
Dr. Pei.

219
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
There's a patient.

220
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,600
Alright.

221
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,589
I'm hanging up.

222
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,160
I know how to find you now.

223
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,829
I'll call you often.

224
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,650
By the way,

225
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,410
send my regards to Li Zan.

226
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,200
Dr. Pei.

227
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,270
You're up.

228
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,160
Dad.

229
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Did you go grocery shopping?

230
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,630
What happened to your face?

231
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,490
You hurt yourself while shaving?

232
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,990
Accidentally.

233
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,380
Dad.

234
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,000
how about you

235
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,270
try my cooking today?

236
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,640
Sure.

237
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,790
I'd love to.

238
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,060
You're in a good mood today.

239
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,170
Are you celebrating something?

240
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,200
Here, Dad.

241
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,600
Try it.

242
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,550
Not bad.

243
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,940
Are you celebrating the female reporter winning the award?

244
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,370
Are you in a relationship?

245
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,110
Dad,

246
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,960
how did you come to this conclusion?

247
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,810
No one knows the son better than his father.

248
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,550
When you saw the news that day,

249
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,200
your smile

250
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,830
looked suspicious.

251
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,400
I'm sorry to tell you

252
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,270
that you're wrong.

253
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,680
I'm not wrong.

254
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,940
At most, it is for now

255
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,160
that she's not your girlfriend yet.

256
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,400
But when I saw her photo,

257
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,030
I feel

258
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,750
as if

259
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,480
we've met before.

260
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,510
What does this mean?

261
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,260
Connection at first sight.

262
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,750
The fact that she received an award

263
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,350
means she is outstanding.

264
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,420
I have a feeling

265
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,430
that she is destined to have a special connection with us Li family.

266
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,230
Our neighbour, Aunt Liu,

267
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,240
knows you're back.

268
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,880
She told me that day

269
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,960
that you loved her glutinous rice balls.

270
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,260
Dad,

271
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,880
I'm going back to Liangcheng tomorrow.

272
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
If I stay longer,

273
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,320
you'll find out sooner or later.

274
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,270
I saw that you won an award.

275
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,480
You're so incredible.

276
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,440
Song Ran, your photos are taken so well.

277
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,750
-Next time, if there's such a chance,
-I need to learn from you.

278
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,790
you have to take me with you.

279
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,750
Ran.

280
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,660
[Song Zhicheng]

281
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:21,540
Congratulations.

282
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,850
What did I say?

283
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,720
You'll definitely win the award.

284
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,020
To celebrate for you,

285
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,420
I specially invited our colleagues

286
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,850
to have dinner together.

287
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,030
Congratulations.

288
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:31,920
Song.

289
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,880
Thank you, Dad.

290
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,640
Enjoy your meal.

291
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:35,940
Today

292
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,610
is my treat.

293
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,950
My daughter said it's her treat today.

294
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,720
Let's get drunk.

295
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:42,810
Come on.

296
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,640
Cheers.

297
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,590
Drink up.

298
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,350
I saw the photo.

299
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,840
This is not my expertise,

300
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,350
but since you won,

301
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,400
it's probably quite good.

302
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,030
Don't get arrogant nor impatient.

303
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,830
The typical Ran-style congratulations.

304
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,700
[Zan]

305
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:27,880
It's me.

306
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,110
Congratulations.

307
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,750
Reporter Song.

308
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,510
Thank you.

309
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,160
Are you

310
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,990
doing fine?

311
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,550
The photo winning an award,

312
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,990
making more people aware of and pay attention to

313
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,640
the Eastern Country

314
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,830
was definitely my wish,

315
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,670
but I'm not doing fine.

316
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,450
I'm fine.

317
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,640
After knowing the story

318
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,750
behind the photo

319
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,310
and experiencing

320
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,600
all these incidents,

321
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,810
how could I be fine?

322
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,880
Are you hanging up?

323
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:45,790
No.

324
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,310

363
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,210
Mr. Li,

364
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,060
Jiang Yu caused trouble again.

365
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,160
I'm sorry,

366
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:21,780
Ms. Fu.

367
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,100
Jiang Yu has troubled you.

368
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,510
Jiang Yu's

369
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,680
family background is complicated.

370
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,620
So his personality

371
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,080
might be flawed.

372
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,680
I hope for your understanding.

373
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,680
Logically speaking,

374
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,640
it's only right for teachers to tolerate students.

375
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,590
But Jiang Yu

376
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,630
can't always be solving problems through fighting.

377
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,540
This will lead to big mistakes in the future.

378
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,750
Of course, I understand.

379
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,320
His parents are not here anymore

380
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,810
and his grandparents are old.

381
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:58,590
He indeed lacks family education.

382
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,680
As teachers,

383
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,680
we also hope to bear some responsibilities.

384
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,330
But,

385
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,070
I'm also afraid it'll affect him.

386
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,790
I understand.

387
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,640
You're right.

388
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,310
Ms. Fu,

389
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,120
I'll find a way.

390
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:14,770
Okay.

391
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:15,830
That's all for now.

392
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,110
Mr. Luo.

393
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,920
Why are you here?

394
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,820
I'm not a nosy person.

395
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,790
But, your problems

396
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,610
are not irrelevant to me.

397
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,550
They'll affect my work.

398
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,190
Last time at the Dicheng Hospital,

399
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,320
the doctor said your ears were ringing

400
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,090
and you felt dizzy

401
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,160
because of...

402
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,150
because of reasons I don't know.

403
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,890
You didn't tell me

404
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,590
nor tell the doctors.

405
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,020
So I have to find out myself.

406
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,960
Theoretically,

407
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,950
everything that happened before can be traced.

408
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,950
If I could find the cause,

409
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,700
I'm sure I can help.

410
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,600
Then,

411
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,300
I...

412
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,270
Then you found out

413
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,160
it was Jiang Lin who was with me that day

414
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,350
and found out he died

415
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,210
that day.

416
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
Finding out these

417
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,270
is not difficult for you.

418
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,230
But to be able to find Jiang Yu's school

419
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,970
shows you've put a lot of effort.

420
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:17,750
Not sure

421
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,680
if you really think I've put in effort

422
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,240
or if you're mocking me.

423
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,550
But if you could tell me

424
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,720
about the past

425
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,810
you can't let go,

426
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,180
even if you're mocking me,

427
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,430
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

428
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,440
I can't tell you.

429
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,720
Because I don't know either.

430
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,220
You...

431
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,970
You...

432
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,510
don't remember?

433
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,830
I don't know.

434
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,240
I only know

435
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,370
we were together

436
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,440
till the very last moment

437
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,050
and then the explosion happened.

438
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,400
I don't remember

439
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,150
how did Jiang Lin die.

440
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,880
But I think it must have something to do with me.

441
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,310
Luo Zhan.

442
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,340
Did I kill Jiang Lin?

443
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,160
No way.

444
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,630
I've known you for so long.

445
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,610
You only know how to save people.

446
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:20,960
You won't harm anyone.

447
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,270
Even if I do,

448
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,270
you won't.

449
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,510
If the bomb goes off,

450
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,620
naturally there will be casualties.

451
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,210
Why do you think so much?

452
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:30,750
You...

453
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,130
You being alive now

454
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,470
can only prove that you are luckier.

455
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,920
Lucky?

456
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,080
Sometimes,

457
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,980
I really don't wish to have this sort of luck.

458
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,880
As the most authoritative

459
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,240
news award

460
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,110
in the world today,

461
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,480
the Boshi International News Award chooses such a photo.

462
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,630
Is the act of exchanging hardships for fame and fortune

463
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,360
to be sorted after by millions of people

464
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,690
a social progress

465
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,830
or a setback?

466
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,350
This reporter, Song Ran,

467
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,270
has always been proud of hunting for the strange and miserable,

468
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:36,080
distorting human nature and pursuing fame and profit.

469
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,830
If you have warned those kids,

470
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,610
instead of taking pictures,

471
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,870
they wouldn't have died.

472
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,140
Morally bankrupt.

473
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,410
Song Ran, you don't deserve to be a journalist.

474
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,110
Is fame more important than human life?

475
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,980
Do you have any conscience?

476
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,360
You're exploiting someone's tragedy

477
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,490
for personal gain.

478
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,710
The children died for nothing because of you.

479
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,940
Vulture.

480
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,880
Do Song Ran's parents know about this?

481
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:14,750
Ran.

482
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,160
Ran.

483
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,090
Ran.

484

00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:52,390

00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:46,670
Reporter Song.

494
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,400
Are you okay?

495
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,150
I'm fine.

496
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,110
I'm just busy right now.

497
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,400
I'm in a meeting.

498
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,460
Is there any problem?

499
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,460
Nothing.

500
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,360
Go ahead with your tasks.

501
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,670
Give me one.

502
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,960
Give me one.

503
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,240
Hi there.

504
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,150
Could you help me play a game?

505
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,670
I can get a balloon if I win the game.

506
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,480
Adults must be smarter than kids.

507
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,760
Please help me.

508
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,230
I...

509
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,160
She's helping me play the game.

510
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,000
Come here, quick!

511
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,880
I want one too.

512
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,360
That's so cute.

513
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,070
He's calling for you.

514
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,880
Coming.

515
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,230
Help him catch us.

516
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,260
Thank you.

517
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,670
Thank you.

518
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,570
You have to win, okay?

519
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,000
You have to win, okay?

520
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,420
So adults can't win either.

521
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,230
Adults fall for it too?

522
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,360
Forget it.

523
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:18,920
Let's go.

524
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,440
He's right.

525
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,730
How difficult can a kid's game be?

526
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,690
It's my fault for being absent-minded

527

You...

00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,320
You are in no position to judge her!

562
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,020
How irresponsible of you

563
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,930
to stand on moral high grounds

564
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,630
and comment on things you haven't witnessed

565
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,290
and people you don't even know!

566
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,730
