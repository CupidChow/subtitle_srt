[Episode 32]

00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,820
[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

4
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,200
How dare you sit down?

5
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,120
This is not a place where you should be.

6
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,470
You think I want to be here watching you?

7
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,070
If you could walk,

8
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,460
I wouldn't want to stay for even a minute longer.

9
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,660
Dr. Pei will wheel me back later.

10
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,290
You don't have to wait for me at the hospital.

11
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,900
Hurry back to the camp and get some sleep...

12
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,710
He's got quite a temper now.

13
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,470
Waiter.

14
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,510
Ratafee.

15
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,520
Okay.

16
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,750
Dr. Pei.

17
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:33,750
Don't worry,

18
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,840
Even if I have to hop there.

19
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,230
I'll still make it to our Vinyl date.

20
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,000
That won't be necessary.

21
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,640
Why are you here?

22
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,040
Your aim is pretty bad, huh?

23
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,080
Don't tell me you never left.

24
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,390
If Dr. Pei had came,

25
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,430
I'd have left.

26
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,600
It's really weird.

27
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,270
Why do people around me all have such bad tempers?

28
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,460
You all get angry so easily.

29
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,390
Don't you think

30
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,830
it's because you provoke others easily?

31
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,040
Is that so?

32
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,390
I didn't feel that way.

33
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,310
Let me ask you,

34
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,760
do you like Dr. Pei or not?

35
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:38,950
Of course.

36
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,870
If I didn't like her,

37
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,830
why would I have paid three months' fee for her?

38
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,070
Here we go again.

39
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Money, money, money. That's all you know.

40
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,240
What Dr. Pei wants isn't money.

41
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,480
You must know that.

42
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,510
What do I know?

43
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,750
All I know is that besides money,

44
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,300
I have nothing else to give to others.

45
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,100
Then tell me.

46
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
What can I give her?

47
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,480
Commitment.

48
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,190
Commitment?

49
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,030
I'm an orphan.

50
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,830
I've got no roots and no family.

51
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,480
I even used to be a mercenary.

52
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,050
Living day by day without a future.

53
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,430
Commitment...

54
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,600
Commitment is the one thing I can't afford to give.

55
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,000
If she wants commitment,

56
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,510
she's really got the wrong person.

57
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,630
So maybe it's for the best that she didn't show up for this date.

58
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,120
Is that so?

59
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,670
You knew Dr. Pei wouldn't come,

60
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,310
yet you still waited here alone until closing time.

61
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,930
You knew joining the special forces wouldn't pay well,

62
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,150
and you could die at any time,

63
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,270
yet you still stayed and became the captain.

64
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,560
You never promised Rina to take care of me,

65
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,870
yet every time we go on a mission,

66
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,750
you shield me from danger,

67
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,240
fearing that I might die before you.

68
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,190
Tell me,

69
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,510
what are all these?

70
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,280
It's not that you don't like commitments.

71
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,830
You just like to say one thing and do another.

73
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,080

I'll go see a friend first.

86
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,180
Wait for me here with Ben.

87
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,880
I'll be back soon.

88
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,030
Okay.

89
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,910
Song Ran.

90
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,960
Xiaonan.

91
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,630
You're here to see Benjamin?

92
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,860
Yes.

93
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,840
That's perfect.

94
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
Please take this medicine to him for me

95
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,960
and tell him to take it in one dose.

96
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,600
What about you?

97
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,200
I still have a few patients to check on.

98
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,000
Thanks.

99
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,910
Come in, please.

100
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,840
Song?

101
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:04,910
How are you?

102
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,950
Are you feeling better?

103
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,840
The war is already over.

104
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,270
Why are you still doing a nurse's job?

105
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,380
Are you thinking of changing your career?

106
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,750
Dr. Pei asked me to bring this to you.

107
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,410
Here. It's time to take your medicine.

108
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,720
Where's Sasin?

109
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,850
Why isn't he here taking care of you?

110
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,870
This little injury is nothing.

111
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,360
Besides, every time he comes,

112
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,320
he always gets in the way.

113
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,630
If...

114
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,720
If a nurse comes to check on me

115
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,240
or change my dressing,

116
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,260
wouldn't he take advantage of it?

117
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,870
What about Zan?

118
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,140
Did you find him?

119
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,050
I heard from Sasin

120
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,320
that you went to the military camp to look for Zan.

121
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,440
He's here too.

122
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,670
He went to see a friend.

123
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,630
He'll be here shortly.

124
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,200
He's here too?

125
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,510
Did you two come together?

126
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,510
Ran.

127
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:12,760
Where's Zan?

128
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:13,640
Why's he still not here yet?

129
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,270
He should be here soon.

130
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,750
Zan.

131
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,240
Zan.

132
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,210
You've treated your wound?

133
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,520
Yes, it's been taken care of.

134
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,030
Who took care of it?

135
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,630
Ran.

136
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,480
Zan.

137
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,030
You've gone astray, haven't you?

138
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,870
Who taught you that?

139
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,340
Wasn't it you?

140
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,390
Sasin, you're here.

141
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,390
Shouldn't you be in the military camp,

142
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,610
sleeping soundly?

143
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,460
Why are you here again?

144
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,790
You seem to really enjoy taking care of me.

145
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,910
There's a mission.

146
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,720
We need to relocate.

147
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,840
Zan.

148
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,320
Do you want to relocate with the special forces?

149
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,380
I want to help Ben and the others more.

150
00:14:59,320 --> 00:14:59,840
I...

151
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,360
Zan.

152
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,150
Just focus on doing what you want to do.

153
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,870
I saw it all.

154
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,670
You can help them a lot.

155
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,600
I also hope

156
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,550
you can see it through to the end.

157
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,670
I know you're here,

158
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,410
and you know I'm here.

159
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,600
That's enough.

160
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,840
Ran.

161
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,440
No matter where you relocate,

162
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,990
I'll come find you.

163
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,390
Okay.

164
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,840
You must be careful and stay safe.

165
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,030
However,

166
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,200
you need to promise me one thing.

167
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,100
Okay.

168
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,910
Go ahead.

169
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,200
What is it?

170
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,840
I haven't learned this game yet.

171
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,630
You have to teach me.

172
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,550
Didn't I already teach you last time?

173
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,790
That doesn't count.

174
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,600
You weren't teaching me,

175
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,570
but that little girl.

176
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,750
You need to make up for it this time.

177
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,720
Okay.

178
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,790
I'll stop laughing.

179
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,359
There's only one shot left.

180
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,270
Wait a second.

181
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,160
Try using this.

182
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,710
It might bring you good luck.

183
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,310
Here.

184
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,240
Use the method I taught you.

185
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,730
Use your wrist.

186
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,000
Give it a try.

187
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,130
Ben and the others are about to relocate.

188
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,200
You remember I told you

189
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
the reason why I came to Eastern Country, right?

190
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,310
You said

191
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,310
you were unlucky in love,

192
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,160
and you wanted a change of scenery.

193
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,660
It's a bit embarrassing to say it out loud.

194
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,550
My ex-boyfriend was a jerk.

195
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,880
I caught him cheating red-handed.

196
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,310
In a fit of anger, I signed up to be a volunteer

197
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,720
and came to Eastern Country.

198
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,830
Then I swore

199
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,310
I'd never trust men's words again

200
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,960
and never be fooled by sweet talk anymore.

201
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,200
This time,

202
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,830
I really wasn't fooled by sweet talk.

203
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,000
That should have been a relief,

204
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,880
but why do I feel so bad?

205
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:03,340
I even wish he would say something to deceive me.

206
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,510
Tell me,

207
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,310
do I deserve to be treated like trash?

208
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,960
Actually,

209
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,000
I don't know Benjamin very well either.

210
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,030
I should say, about him,

211
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,920
other than knowing

212
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,750
that he was once a mercenary,

213
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,880
I know nothing else.

214
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,070
He seems to never talk

215
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,150
about himself.

216
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,030
Now that you mention it,

217
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,670
I feel like I'm just like you,

218
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,600
knowing nothing about him.

219
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,350
But

220
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,270
falling in love with someone

221
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,720
doesn't necessarily require knowing them well.

222
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,940
When I fell for Zan,

223
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,480
I didn't even know his name.

224
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,510
I didn't expect you to be even crazier than me.

225
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:19,310
I just think that when it comes to love,

226
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,440
it's best to follow your heart.

227
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Sometimes,

228
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,880
what we see with our own eyes

229
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:29,320
or hear with our own ears isn't reliable, either.

230
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,590
Under the current circumstances in Eastern Country,

231
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,110
everyone has their own difficulties and concerns.

232
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,310
Give it some more time.

233
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,590
Everything will become clear eventually.

234
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,070
You're right.

235
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,550
Anyway, he's paid for another

236
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,980
three months in Vinyl for me.

237
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,240
That's enough time for me to think things through.

238
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,410
Temporarily leaving Uglai,

239
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,950
with reluctance in my heart.

240
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,410
[Mom]

241
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,480
Mom.

242
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,030
So you still remember you have a mom.

243
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,880
You only called to let me know you were safe

244
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,830
when you arrived in Eastern Country.

245
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,030
Since then,

246
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,200
the only way I could only know what you're up to

247
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,350
is from your social media updates.

248
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,240
But my secretary

249
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,160
receives your check-in calls every few days.

250
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,030
Wasn't it you who asked me

251
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,680
not to bother you unless it's something important?

252
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,430
Your skill at blame shifting

253
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,510
has certainly improved.

254
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,400
Mom.

255
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,200
I missed you.

256
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,470
It seems you've made up with Li Zan.

257
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,340
Yes.

258
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,510
But that's not the reason.

259
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,480
I-

260
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,400
Alright.

261
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,300
I surrender.

262
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,270
Ran.

263
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,000
No matter how old you are

264
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,590
and how capable you become,

265
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,880
you'll always be my daughter.

266
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,240
How could I not know what you're thinking?

267
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,510
I missed you too.

268
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,030
Take care of yourself.

269
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,830
Song.

270
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,030
Are you really Song?

271
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,240
The Song who took "Candy"?

272
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,030
How do you know?

273
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,750
I have my ways.

274
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,880
My god.

275
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,750
It took me so long to realize.

276
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,110
Can we take a picture together?

277
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,040
Of course.

278
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,830
Are you leaving?

279
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,960
Where? Let me give you a ride.

280
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,240
The place I'm going this time is very far away.

281
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,590
You can't take me there.

282
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,000
Are you looking down on me

283
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,030
or on it?

284
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,440
Neither.

285
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,270
I won't charge you.

286
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,550
If I could be your chauffeur,

287
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,680
I could brag about it for the rest of my life.

288
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:41,790
Please.

289
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,740
Please.

290
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,880
Okay then.

291
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,480
But you have to promise me two things.

292
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,900
One, I must pay.

293
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,790
And two, you have to take my car.

294
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,480
Okay, no problem.

295
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,580
Whatever you say, ma'am.

296
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,200
You already know my name is Song,

297
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,480
so don't call me ma'am.

298
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,510
Call me Song.

299
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,440
Okay, no problem.

300
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,160
Song.

301
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,480
Let's go.

302
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,440
Let's go.

303
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,810
Zan!

304
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,440
Ran.

305
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,620
Go.

306
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,440
You're here.

307
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,420
You told me your departure time.

308
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,720
I thought I could still make it,

309
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,920
so I came to see you off.

310
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,970
Luckily, I made it in time.

311
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,880
Wipe your sweat.

312
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,710
Look.

313
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,580
Is that his girlfriend?

314
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,480
Where are you going this time?

315
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,230
Can you tell me?

316
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,000
I can.

317
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,270
This transfer isn't a secret mission.

318
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,790
Last time in Matuman, Ark managed to escape.

319
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,650
We just received reliable intelligence.

320
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,310
This time, he really fled back to Happo.

321
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,000
So we're also going to Happo this time.

322
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,070
That's great.

323
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,900
I'm also going to Happo to see Shen Bei.

324
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,000
What a coincidence.

325
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:39,510
Then we'll be able to meet soon again this time.

326
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,240
How are you going to Happo?

327
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,200
Are you going alone?

328
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,120
Don't worry.

329
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,110
There's someone to protect me.

330
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,440
You should go now.

331
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,090
Don't keep everyone waiting.

332
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,190
I'm leaving.

333
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,110
Zan.

334
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,030
Your car has been requisitioned.

335
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,000
Song, rest assured.

336
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,550
I'll keep an eye on Zan for you.

337
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:44,880
You?

338
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,640
You'd better take care of yourself first.

339
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,440
Zan.

340
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,650
I think you should give Song a kiss goodbye.

341
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,920
You don't have a girl to kiss goodbye,

342
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,180
yet you're saying this kind of thing.

343
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,240
You just enjoy others' PDA, don't you?

344
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,000
I'm leaving.

345
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,720
Zan.

346
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,090
Song, you're really something.

347
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,850
Be careful.

348
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,840
Be careful.

349
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,920
We're leaving.

350
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,680
Stop looking. Let's go.

351
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,640
He's so handsome.

352
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,240
Your boyfriend.

353
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,440
Boyfriend.

354
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,180
Is he a special forces soldier?

355
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,270
No.

356
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,310
He's a demining volunteer.

357
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,550
Demining?

358
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,200
Can he teach me?

359
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,030
When we arrive in Happo,

360
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,480
you can ask him yourself.

361
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,030
Are they also going to Happo?

362
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,720
That's great.

363
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,200
Let's get going too.

364
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,590
We need to make a run to the hospital first.

365
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,270
I forgot something yesterday.

366
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,400
Also,

367
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,550
we can't follow them.

368
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,940
We still need to take some photos along the way.

369
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:30,610
Oh, right.

370
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,750
You're right.

371
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,480
Excuse me.

372
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,110
Where is that soldier?

373
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,110
He's helping us move stuff.

374
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,750
His condition is much better recently.

375
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,350
He said he wanted to do something

376
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,680
in case of being useless.

377
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,350
Thank you.

378
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,110
Are you...

379
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,480
Li's girlfriend?

380
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,830
How do you know that?

381
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,240
He has the same one.

382
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,680
He told me it's from his girlfriend.

383
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,510
May I ask,

384
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,200
when did he say that?

385
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,080
In Matuman.

386
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,790
So he really never wanted to break up with me.

387
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,820
He's always considered me his girlfriend in his heart.

388
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,590
Sorry.

389
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,030
I shouldn't ask.

390
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:28,640
I...

391
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,160
You don't need to say sorry.

392
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,960
But you make me think about him again,

393
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,820
so...

394
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,120
I need to go.

395
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,940
You can wait for him right over here.

396
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,020
Okay.

397
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:38,540
Bye.

398
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,250
It's your song

399
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,070
for Matuman's heroes,

400
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:19,990
right?

401
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,390
I believe everything will be fine,

402
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,350
both for you and your country.

403
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,680
Song, what is he listening to?

404
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,240
Guess.

405
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,860
No need to guess. I know.

406
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,190
He's listening to the Song of Matuman.

407
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,830
Let's go.

408
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,030
I can't wait.

409
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:09,510
Okay.

410
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,380
Shen Bei.

411
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,440
I'm on my way to Happo.

412
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,470
We'll meet soon.

413
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:22,200
♫In this desert♫

414
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:27,230
♫Let every wish fly with strength♫

415
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,240
♫Fly♫

416
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,290
♫In your eyes♫

417
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:38,560
♫Let every light and warmth fly♫

418
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,020
♫Fly♫

419
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:46,240
♫Fly to every corner of the world♫

420
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,850
♫Let love take root freely♫

421
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,310
♫Sprout and grow♫

422
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,910
♫Can I make a wish?♫

423
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:03,110
♫That there's no sadness under every ray of sunshine♫

424
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,639
♫Can I make a wish?♫

425
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,159
♫For every story in spring to bloom♫

426
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:21,159
♫Blossom and travel far♫

427
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,070
Song,

428
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:26,960
you drive.

429
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,430
What's this?

430
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,920
My dad.

431
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,230
It's his ashes.

432
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,480
He's never traveled

433
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,550
out of Uglai.

434
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,360
So I took him with me

435
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,730
to scatter some of his ashes along the way.

436
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,000
He'd be happy.

437
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,000
He's been scattering

438
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,110
his dad's ashes along the way?

439
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,150
I can't believe I didn't notice.

440
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,110
The people here

441
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,070
always give me unexpected experiences.

442
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,000
Your wound is healing quite fast.

443
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,770
With my physical condition,

444
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,100
this is just a scratch.

445
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,940
I could have been limping around long ago.

446
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,070
Give this to Sasin for me later.

447
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,920
He's going to the orphanage.

448
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,550
These are the blueprints Shen Bei requested.

449
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,320
Sasin

450
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,800
should be back soon after his shower.

451
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,290
You can't even wait a little longer?

452
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:17,890
What's the rush?

453
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,580
Is Song here?

454
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,320
No.

455
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,670
I have a class to teach at the Happo demining team.

456
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,510
Ran will be here soon.

457
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,360
I also want to

458
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,760
reserve some time for her.

459
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,190
I'm off.

460
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:35,800
Zan.

461
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,800
You and Song are the best

462
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,110
and the most selfless people I've ever met.

463
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,440
There are many things we can't change.

464
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,180
Just do your best.

465
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:56,990
You...

466
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,510
Don't be too hard on yourself.

467
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,510
I know.

468
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,510
Thank you, Ben.

469
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:36,920
What are you looking at?

470
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,030
The blueprints from Zan to the orphanage.

471
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,150
Take them to Shen Bei later.

472
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,320
Can you understand them?

473
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,760
I can't.

474
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,550
But I can tell

475
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,280
these must have been difficult to draw.

476
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,760
I wonder when Zan drew them.

477
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,490
It's only at times like this that I remember

478
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,280
he's a trained architectural engineer.

479
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,960
He's been with us for so long that

480
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,710
I almost think of him as one of us.

481
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,520
Zan has a certain toughness about him that makes him

482
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,790
look very much like a soldier.

483
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,730
But not a soldier like you.

484
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,360
What kind of soldier am I?

485
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,750
You're the kind who pretends to be sick when you're not,

486
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,380
tricking others into taking care of you.

487
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,960
You...

488
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:46,790
How did you know?

489
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,750
When we were in Uglai,

490
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,030
I asked Dr. Pei.

491
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,480
Your wound would be fine after getting stitches.

492
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,480
All these bandages on your leg

493
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,960
are completely useless.

494
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,200
You insisted on wearing them yourself.

495
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,630
Then why have you been

496
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,350
pretending to be dumb and taking care of me all this time?

497
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,760
Did you lose your mind,

498
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:19,860
or do you just enjoy serving me?

499
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,590
After all, you saved my life.

500
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,440
Consider this as me repaying the favor.

501
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,440
As of today, we're even.

502
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:31,960
Please take care of yourself from tomorrow on.

503
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,320
Turn left ahead,

504
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,640
and you'll see the orphanage.

505
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,790
I know what you mean.

506
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,190
Maybe the trimmer arch can use a harder one.

507
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,720
And this part...

508
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,800
Shen Bei.

509
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,320
Song Ran.

510
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,230
Good morning, Zan.

511
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:04,670
Good morning.

512
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,170
I've arrived in Happo.

513
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,930
I'm at Shen Bei's orphanage.

514
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:34,920
Ran.

515
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,920
I'm sorry.

516
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,550
I was just teaching a demining class.

517
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,320
I only saw my phone after the class ended.

518
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,840
It's okay.

519
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,360
I had a fulfilling day here.

520
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,400
Instructor Li.

521
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,150
You've finally shown up.

522
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,510
Ran.

523
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
Before you came,

524
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,770
Instructor Li hadn't been here even once.

525
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,400
Even the blueprints

526
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,700
were brought by Sasin.

527
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:03,880
He must have been very busy then.

528
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,670
Yes, I was indeed very busy.

529
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,280
I apologize, Ms. Shen.

530
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,000
Today,

531
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,700
I finally understand what it means to be a harmonious couple.

532
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,510
Instructor Li.

533
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,150
Please take Ms. Song away quickly.

534
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,840
If you stay any longer,

535
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:22,860
I might just get so jealous that I'll spit blood.

536
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,250
Alright.

537
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,480
I'll take Ran to have dinner first.

538
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,920
If you still have something to do later,

539
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,320
I'll bring Ran back.

540
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,480
No need.

541
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,840
I don't want to be the bad guy.

542
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,190
Song Ran, let's get in touch tomorrow.

543
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:35,880
Okay.

544
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,110
Shen Bei.

545
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,710
Could you tell Jose for me

546
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,760
to take my luggage and bag

547
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,840
to the hotel?

548
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,710
I'm staying at the same one as last time.

549
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,930
Alright, I got it.

550
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,480
Let's go.

551
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:50,840
Are you tired?
