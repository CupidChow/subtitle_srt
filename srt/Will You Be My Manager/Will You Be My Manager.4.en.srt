How is this?

193
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,110
Here's the second one.

00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,210
Sure.

208
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:38,010
What's wrong? Did something happen?

209

What are you talking about?

217
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,650
I hate her to the bone

218
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,630

219
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,350
- Hana-chan?
- Yeah.

220
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:15,360
But she is really trash.

221
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,880
Isn't that why you tossed her away?

222
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,000
Cut the crap and get to the point.
