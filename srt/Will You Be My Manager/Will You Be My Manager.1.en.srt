00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,910
Hey, can I find this book in the library? I want to read it, too.

180
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,830
But it might be tough since it isn't in Japanese.

181
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:03,350
Not at all, now I'm eager to read it no matter what.

Do you like Madeleines?

186
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,880
Yeah.

187
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,340
Hang on.

188
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,910
I found this by accident.

189
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,000
It's nothing, you'll think I'm fooling you.

190
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,960
What is it?

00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,050
It's true.

Want to check for yourself?

196
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,840

Wow!

207
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,170
Did this really come from the book?

208
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,400
- Yeah.
- Do other pastries appear, too?

209
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,670

Pizza, appear!

219
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,460
Gosh.

220
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,490
A pizza won't appear.

221
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,370

We're here for your major's practical course.

This is a combined class with a long history and tradition.

228

Each team has one management major and two acting majors.

You should help her if she's inexperienced.

242
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,180
Ji Ah, help Hana too.

243
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,780
I will.

244
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,430

249
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,700
Yeah.

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,860
Of course, I'll be there. I'm your manager.
