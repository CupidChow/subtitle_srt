00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,480
And that's how it goes.

185
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,600
If you don't want to answer, you take a shot of soda.

186
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,080
Ba Reun, how did you start dating Ji Ah?

187
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,180
I gave her a bracelet and confessed to her.

188
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,420
Gu Eun Ho, do you like Hana-chan?

189
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,350
Cheon Si Woo, what about you?

190
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,320
- Hana-chan.
- Yes?

191
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,700
Which one of us will you give a "like"
for the boyfriend series?

192
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,690
Eun Ho.

193
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,620
Si Woo.

194
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,290
I have to choose both, right?

195
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,600
That's a given for a manager.

196
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,280
Why ask that?

197
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,170
Enough of this game. No more.

198
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,730
Dopamine doesn't exist in your bodies, huh.

199
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,090
Yeah, exactly. No more fighting.

200
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,110
You shouldn't really ask anything.

201
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,320
Was Truth or Dare fun?

202
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,350
Yeah.

203
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,690
It was really fun.

204
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,100
Hana-chan, do you have anyone you like?

205
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,290
I'd rather drink soda.

206
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,890
So, there is someone.

207
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,210
I'm not telling you. Soda, please.

208
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,680
My gosh, who is it?

209
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,890
We can't get soda now. The stores are all closed.

210
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,930
In that case... the question isn't valid!

211
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,840
Who is it? Are you keeping it from me, too?

212
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,350
It's a secret!

213
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,730
Wait for me!

214
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,240
The teacher's here! Come gather round!

215
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,530
So freaking tired.

216
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,470
- Are all of you here?
- Yes, sir!

217
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,910
Good morning!

218
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,750
You know you've got to move about
as much as you deliver your lines, right?

219
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,180
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

220
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:00,230
So, let's start with a long jog.

221
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,550
Nice.

222
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,080
The group that returns first gets...

223
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,910
five extra points. Five.

224
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,400
- Sounds great.
- Five points.

225
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,660
All right, run like your life depends on it.

226
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,450
Let's go.

227
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,720
Over there.

228
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,720
Make sure you don't hurt yourself.

229
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,360
Ready...

230
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,960
- You can do it!
- Go for it!

231
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,670
- Eun Ho, Si Woo! Do your best!
- Cheer them on.

232

- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

235
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,700
Run on!

236

You can do it!

- Let's go!
- Nam Min Soo! Run faster!

240

Go, go, go!

241
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,400
Oh dear.

242
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,030
Are you feeling unwell?

243
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,120
Run!

244
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,470
Well done!

245
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,870
Let's keep going!

246
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,000
Run! Quickly!

247
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,340
Three rounds left!

248
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,470
Oh, I didn't click it.

249
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,140
Don't force yourself! Make sure you don't get hurt!

250
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,260
Come on, only a few rounds left.

251
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,350
- Is she asleep?
- What are you doing?

252
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,700
You can do it!

253
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,820
Just admit it. When did you fall for her?

254
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,670

255
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,410

You're last.

266

Last round!

267
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,040
Those two are really fast.

268
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,290
Just a little bit more!

269
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,060
Okay!

270

Stop this!

273
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,700
Our group's a real mess.

274
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,550
You two aren't worthy of being in the director's film.

275
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,300
You're the worst.

276
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,710
Ugh, so noisy.

That's youth, huh.

278
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:02,620

00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,750
Can you help me move this?

370
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,470
Help me out here.

371
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,060
Come on.

372
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:06,540
Si Woo, here's my answer.

373
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:26,090
<i>I'll cheer you on from here on out,
as your friend and your manager.</i>

374
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:30,300
<i>Thank you for liking me.</i>

375
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,420
I'm playing it! Right now!

376
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,980
Hurry up.

377
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,920
[Start]

378
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,030
<i>Hello! I'm Hana Hirose from Japan!</i>

379
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,680
<i>Wait! Stop!</i>

380
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,090
<i>Enough!</i>

381
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:11,250
I thought all you did was play.

382
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,510
You worked hard filming everything.

383
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,930
Hana-poof should be an actress.

384
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,250
You look really good on camera.

385
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:23,210
- The filming's great.
- You can be the manager and Hana-chan...

386
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,990
And she can be an actress?

387
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,540
Min Soo can be the manager.

388
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,020
Min Soo as a manager?

389
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,060
No way, I should be the actor.

390
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,930
Yes, exactly.

391
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,760
Applause!

392
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,700
Clap!

393
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,520
This is the best!

394
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:50,140
Nam Min Soo, you spent a lot of time filming this.

395
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,350
Hana-poof did the editing.

396
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,560
She insisted on doing it.

397
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,520
While I was editing,

398
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,350
I was surprised by how much I laughed.

399
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:12,710
Everyone made me so happy.

400
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,550
I know I shouldn't be laughing.

401
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,880
But I just couldn't hold my laughter back once I started.

402
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,560
Why shouldn't you be laughing?

403
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:40,180
Actually, I'm returning to Japan this week.

404
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:44,380
I heard that Suzu's condition is a lot better now.

405
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,060
That's great.

406
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,950
But you won't be coming back?

407
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,010
Thank you so much for everything.

408
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:01,070
You tried to understand me and accepted me.

409
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,970
That's good news.

410
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,980
You should meet your friend.

411
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,690
In that case, let's all take turns to share our feelings.

412
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,660
Nam Min Soo, you can start.

413
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,220
Me?

414
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,320
Damn it, Hana-poof's not coming back,
but the rain's approaching.

415
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,640
The gear's crazy expensive.

416
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,270
Damn it. Guys, move it.

417
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,550
Get moving!

418
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,440
- It's freaking expensive!
- What do we do?

419
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,600
Freaking hell!

420
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,420
Hana...

421
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,200
Will you...

422
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,320
become my exclusive manager?

423
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:23,000
You once asked me what was most important to me.

424
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:30,900
<i>What's the most important thing to you?</i>

425
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,160
It's you.

426
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,900
Hana Hirose.

427
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:49,510
I'll go to wherever you are.

428
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,720
When I'm with you, everything becomes a romance.

429
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,620
[Epilogue]

430
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,530
So hot.

431
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,380
Don't you feel hot?

432
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,300
Ugh, don't touch me!

433
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,200
Damn, she's so pretty.

434
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,310
- So cute.
- It's even hotter in Japan.

435
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,720
You'll be steamed into dumplings there.

436
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,850
I guess Hana-chan's become a dumpling then.

437
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:45,670
Let's eat something refreshing,
like cold buckwheat noodles!

438
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:49,050
That's even more delicious in Japan.

439
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,210
Wanna go to Japan?

440
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:57,880
I'll really go.

441
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,210
Fine, I'll go too!

442
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:00,970
- Now?
- Let's go.

443
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,150
I'm off.

444
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,790
No, me first! Hey, wait up!

445
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,580
Wait for me!

446
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,060
We should call Hana-chan.

447
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,920
[Fate]
