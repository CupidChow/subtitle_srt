I guess that's true.

I should've spoken about her strengths,
but I just listed her weaknesses.

108
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,600
I did that even when she didn't make the cut
for a role she really wanted.

109
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,920
I didn't spare a thought for her feelings.

Suzu was always so kind and did her best.

111

Suzu will definitely become a fabulous actress.

00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,210
Lower the difficulty and leap straight for it.

169
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,580
You can eat and drink it.

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,240
Cheon Si Woo, the protagonist's friend.

185
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,490
What about you?

186
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,780
I'm the male lead, duh.

187
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,830
G, P.

188
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,470
Gu Eun Ho, come practice lines with me.

189
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,710
Just do it yourself.

190
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,290
We can film without him.

191
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:25,930
It's Si Woo's scene anyway. I'll do the protagonist's lines.

192
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,500
Is it your hobby to drop out of auditions?

193
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,470
Try sky diving or bungee jumping instead.

194
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:38,150
If I fall now, who'll hurt more? You or me?

195
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,550
Tighten your vocal cords.

196
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,990
Yawn and lower your larynx.

197
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,990
Okay.

00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:08,420
[Suzu's Setting]

199
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,040
[Before Suzu decides to commit suicide]

200
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,570
Suzu will definitely become an actor.

201
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,980
An amazing one.

202
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,400
When Suzu wakes up,

203
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,160
and if she gives me a chance,

204
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,010
I will become someone she'll need.

205
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:32,550
<i>Gu Eun Ho pretends he doesn't notice,
but he's already a step ahead.</i>

206
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,580
Cut! Okay!

207
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,340
I still have another interpretation.

208
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,980
Sure.

209
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,030
Hang on.

210
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,490
Let's redo everything.

211
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,810
Huh?

212
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,530
Gu Eun Ho.

213
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,300
Do the lines with me this time.

214
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,230
You can't tell anyone.

215
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,110
I have no other friends, except you.

216
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:24,190
Will someone as ordinary as me become an actor?

217
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:28,170
Of course, you have a great voice and wonderful skin.

218
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,040
Well, will you be my manager?

219
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,830
Your manager?

220
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,680
Do I have what it takes?

221
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,050
When I waver, you'll be there to hold me.

222
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:44,240
Sure! I'll become a manager for you, Suzu!

223
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:50,840
Don't I have strengths?
Why do you only talk about my flaws?

224
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,330
Who are you to tear me down?

225
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,970
So, you're trying to run away.

226
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,720
No.

227
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,200
You don't want to act.
It's just the delusion of fame you're after.

228
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,220
That's not it!

229
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,290
I was clueless and so earnest.

230
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,130
What are you doing there?

231
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,180
Suzu, come down.

232
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:24,440
Do you know when I'm with you, I feel like dying?

233
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,930
N-No.

234
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,390
Suzu!

235
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:44,980
Suzu will definitely become an actor. An amazing one.

236
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:50,410
And I'll become his manager.

237
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,640
No doubt about that.

<i>- and wonderful skin.</i>

<i>Do I have what it takes?</i>

246
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,940

My head hurts like hell!

251

Hana-chan's one thing, but what about Shin Ji Ah?

252
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,860
You picked the wrong girl.
Maybe you'll end up transferring schools this time.

253
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,190
Say that again.

254

I-I mean...

255
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:30,330
Actually, she hacked your group's account.

256
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,910
She uploaded the article.

257
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,540
Damn you.

258
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,470

00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,360
I'm sorry.

264
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,630
It seemed like it'd be the last.

265
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,440
You said you didn't post it.

266
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:36,490
You're better off dumping a guy like me.

267
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,470
What are you doing?

268
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:47,630
Why would I dump a kind boyfriend
who understands me better than I do...

269
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,720
Does that mean... you aren't dumping me?

270
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,700
I won't.

271
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,030

310
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:44,990
But an ordinary girl like me
dreaming of being an actress is ridiculous.

311
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:49,900
Why's that? Your voice is great, and your complexion is amazing.

312
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,150
But I have to go on a diet, huh.

313

Polka dotted clothes are good.

333

Really? You have to start today then.

334
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,300
Today, I should take note of the color black.
