1
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:54,011
DEAR X

2
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:56,722
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:58,432
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:04,855
Ah Jin.

5
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:08,609
Help me.

6
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:27,294
You've woken up.

7
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:32,966
It would've been better
if you hadn't woken up at all.

8
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:38,097
Seeing you alive
wasn't part of my plan.

9
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:54,279
Dad.

10
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,952
You understand me, don't you?

11
00:02:07,543 --> 00:02:10,129
Even if you don't,
there's nothing I can do.

12
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,641
You're the one who made me this way.

13
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:29,773
Think of this as your punishment
for ruining my childhood.

14
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:32,568
Repay me...

15
00:02:34,486 --> 00:02:36,405
with your death.

16
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:41,368
Dad?

17
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:54,506
Goodbye.

18
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:59,887
I hope we never see each other again,
not even in Hell.

19
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:51,438
EPISODE 4: NO TURNING BACK

20
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:54,107
The bag.

21
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,739
- Could you also check the bathroom?
- Excuse me.

22
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:32,229
ST. JOSEPH'S UNIVERSITY
SEONGSIM HOSPITAL

23
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:37,234
The patient is awake.

24
00:04:37,317 --> 00:04:38,318
Thank you.

25
00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:46,326
Are you saying that your father,
Baek Seon Gyu

26
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:49,830
died because Choi Jung Ho
attacked him?

27
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:53,792
Yes.

28
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:55,460
I see.

29
00:04:56,545 --> 00:05:00,549
Baek Ah Jin claims that you hit
Baek Seon Gyu with a baseball bat.

30
00:05:01,174 --> 00:05:02,301
Is that true?

31
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,721
That baseball bat
is also yours, correct?

32
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,851
The bat's mine...

33
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:15,772
but I thought he was a stalker.

34
00:05:16,356 --> 00:05:20,193
You knew he was a stalker
even in the dark?

35
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,782
A man wearing a beanie
was choking Ah Jin.

36
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:28,827
I charged at him, and in the scuffle

37
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:32,873
I swung the baseball bat
without even realizing it.

38
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,628
I swear I didn't mean
for that to happen.

39
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:40,464
A beanie?

40
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:45,093
A man in a beige beanie
was stalking Ah Jin.

41
00:05:45,427 --> 00:05:49,181
When I saw him in that beanie
at Ah Jin's yesterday

42
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:51,475
I thought he was that stalker.

43
00:05:56,938 --> 00:06:00,442
We didn't find a beanie at the scene.
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

44
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:05,614
I'm telling you the truth.

45
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:10,660
He was wearing a beige beanie.

46
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,623
It was the same one
that Ah Jin's stalker wore.

47
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:17,000
A beanie?

48
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:22,589
I never saw anything like that.

49
00:06:24,841 --> 00:06:27,552
I don't know what Mr. Choi saw.

50
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:33,225
You saw him bleeding
after you hit him with your bat

51
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:36,144
and you just ran home.
That's what you did, right?

52
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:38,814
Ah Jin!

53
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:40,565
You son of a bitch!

54
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:45,654
My father lunged at Mr. Choi
with a pair of scissors.

55
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:07,467
And Mr. Choi was holding a bat.

56
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:13,890
Hey.

57
00:07:22,023 --> 00:07:23,024
Are you okay?

58
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:26,027
Shit.

59
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:31,908
Mr. Choi.

60
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:35,495
Don't.

61
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:37,497
What are you saying?

62
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:43,795
Stalker or not,
the man is losing a lot of blood.

63
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,341
Mr. Choi!

64
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:51,386
Please don't.

65
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:54,639
That man isn't my stalker.

66
00:07:55,265 --> 00:07:56,766
He's my father.

67
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:05,066
He's my father.

68
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:10,780
That man is my father.

69
00:08:10,864 --> 00:08:11,865
Your father?

70
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:17,954
There was no way of knowing

71
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,833
what my father would do
when he woke up.

72
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:28,131
Mr. Choi, go home for now.

73
00:08:29,674 --> 00:08:32,969
I'll... I'll handle this mess.

74
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:35,931
You should go. Please leave.

75
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:39,392
Do you want to make things worse?

76
00:08:40,393 --> 00:08:42,354
Leave now!

77
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:44,606
I can call for help after you leave

78
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:47,025
so go.

79
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,360
Go!

80
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:10,924
It's just...

81
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:13,718
It's...

82
00:09:15,136 --> 00:09:16,304
Ah Jin...

83
00:09:52,215 --> 00:09:54,217
I thought making him leave...

84
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:58,888
was the right call.

85
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:03,476
So it's true you fled the scene
of the incident, correct?

86
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:07,606
Yes.

87
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:09,190
I panicked at the time.

88
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:12,569
A reasonable person wouldn't have
fled the scene in that situation.

89
00:10:12,652 --> 00:10:15,113
By then, the victim
must've been incapacitated.

90
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:18,658
I honestly don't know

91
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:21,995
why I did any of that.

92
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:24,456
It felt like

93
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:27,917
I was under
some kind of spell yesterday.

94
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:32,005
As if I were a puppet
in someone's master plan.

95
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:35,759
Let's not make this complicated.
Keep it simple, okay?

96
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:40,889
Baek Ah Jin became an orphan
at the age of 20

97
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:42,724
because of you.

98
00:10:43,224 --> 00:10:45,644
If you witnessed a crime,
you should've reported it.

99
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:46,936
Not played the hero.

100
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,480
I'm sorry.

101
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,775
I'm so sorry.

102
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:02,327
Sir.

103
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,121
Thanks.

104
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,248
BAEK SEON GYU, MALE, AGE 48

105
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:09,042
Baek Seon Gyu's
estimated time of death

106
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,670
is between 9 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.
on the 19th.

107
00:11:11,753 --> 00:11:14,339
Meanwhile, you called for help

108
00:11:15,548 --> 00:11:16,633
at 3 a.m.

109
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:23,181
Why didn't you call for help
right away?

110
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:30,980
Oh, dear. Let me help you.

111
00:11:35,902 --> 00:11:37,112
I...

112
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:40,532
I passed out
when my father beat me up.

113
00:11:41,741 --> 00:11:43,159
I called for help

114
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:48,373
as soon as I regained consciousness.

115
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:52,252
After that, I passed out again.

116
00:11:52,794 --> 00:11:53,795
Goodness.

117
00:11:53,878 --> 00:11:57,966
No matter what you did,
he had no right to lay a hand on you.

118
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:00,677
Seriously...

119
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,679
There's something wrong
with people these days.

120
00:12:02,762 --> 00:12:07,100
You rub them the wrong way,
and they lash out, even kill.

121
00:12:09,644 --> 00:12:13,606
You never thought about running away?

122
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:16,317
Detective.

123
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:17,402
Yes?

124
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:21,114
I'm exhausted right now.

125
00:12:25,034 --> 00:12:27,620
Do you have
any more questions for me?

126
00:12:34,836 --> 00:12:35,837
Hello?

127
00:12:36,337 --> 00:12:37,964
Yes, I'm the lead detective.

128
00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:39,674
Who?

129
00:12:40,717 --> 00:12:43,887
PB Agency, CEO Im Seung Yong?

130
00:12:45,805 --> 00:12:46,890
Hold on.

131
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:50,268
I see.

132
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:59,068
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

133
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:01,237
- I come bearing good news.
- Hello.

134
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:03,823
He's Im Seung Yong, CEO of PB Agency.

135
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:06,326
Mr. Choi might be signing
a new contract.

136
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,375
- Sergeant Ham, a minute?
- Yes, sir.

137
00:13:45,615 --> 00:13:48,910
Choi Jung Ho hit him with the bat.
He confessed.

138
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:52,580
But he's claiming
it was self-defense.

139
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:54,374
- It was her.
- What?

140
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,044
He beat her constantly.
Of course, she wanted him dead.

141
00:13:58,127 --> 00:13:59,754
I'd want him dead if I were her.

142
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:03,341
She's got the clearest motive.

143
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,427
What more reason do you need?

144
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:09,430
What looked like an impulsive killing

145
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:11,349
by a former baseball player
making a comeback

146
00:14:12,141 --> 00:14:13,977
turned out to be something else.

147
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,604
A tragic story about a girl

148
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:18,481
who was driven to kill her father

149
00:14:18,982 --> 00:14:20,984
after enduring years of abuse.

150
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:24,779
Baek Ah Jin will get off
because of extenuating circumstances.

151
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,782
So we'll draw attention
using Choi Jung Ho.

152
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:30,869
That'll give him a way out,
and we can wrap up our case.

153
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:33,246
It's a win-win situation, okay?

154
00:14:33,663 --> 00:14:34,664
Sir, but that's...

155
00:14:34,747 --> 00:14:35,957
Come on.

156
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,544
It'll be fine, so grow a pair.

157
00:14:39,627 --> 00:14:40,670
Hey.

158
00:14:41,754 --> 00:14:45,008
What's a young girl like her
going to do anyway?

159
00:14:45,842 --> 00:14:46,843
Keep an eye on her.

160
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:48,636
Don't let her run.

161
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:50,555
Yes, sir.

162
00:14:55,143 --> 00:14:57,562
Reporter Kim, you picked up fast.

163
00:14:58,688 --> 00:15:00,815
Do you know Choi Jung Ho,
the baseball player?

164
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,318
Yes, the guy who retired
because of Kwak Eun Hyeok.

165
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:05,570
That's the one!

166
00:15:06,112 --> 00:15:08,197
Right. You won't believe this.

167
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:13,286
Thank you for your cooperation.

168
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:19,584
Please come by the station later
to give a brief witness statement.

169
00:15:20,376 --> 00:15:23,713
What will happen to Mr. Choi?

170
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:27,008
Mr. Choi keeps insisting
it was self-defense.

171
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:28,927
But he admitted to the assault.

172
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,845
He'll go to trial

173
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:33,765
and if he's unlucky,
he could end up doing time.

174
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:38,394
I'm sorry about your father.

175
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:41,731
I hope you get well soon. Take care.

176
00:15:52,742 --> 00:15:55,244
No, we're framing it
as an accidental homicide.

177
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:59,332
So just build a story around that.

178
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:03,336
You're the first person
I called with this scoop.

179
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:05,713
Exactly.

180
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:29,904
VITAMIN DRINK

181
00:16:35,576 --> 00:16:36,661
The personal details of Baek

182
00:16:36,744 --> 00:16:40,415
the victim in the Nojeong-dong
Rooftop Murder Case

183
00:16:40,498 --> 00:16:44,711
have spread online,
drawing public attention.

184
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:48,589
After serving five years in prison,
Baek was released in 2016.

185
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:50,383
Unable to find a steady job

186
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:53,469
he visited his daughter's home,
where he was killed.

187
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:56,973
Choi, a former baseball player
now being questioned

188
00:16:57,056 --> 00:16:58,808
for Baek's murder

189
00:16:58,891 --> 00:17:01,602
allegedly attacked him
at his daughter's house.

190
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:03,438
The daughter worked part-time
at Choi's cafe...

191
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,462
ST. JOSEPH'S UNIVERSITY
SEONGSIM HOSPITAL

192
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,888
Ms. Baek, hold on a moment.

193
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:23,101
Please come to the station with us.

194
00:18:24,393 --> 00:18:28,147
You are now a suspect
in the murder of Baek Seon Gyu.

195
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,733
You have the right to remain silent.

196
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:32,902
Anything you say
can and will be used against you.

197
00:18:32,985 --> 00:18:34,654
You have the right to an attorney.

198
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:58,177
What are you suggesting?

199
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:01,222
We'll spin it as you
taking justice into your own hands

200
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:03,766
after being set up
by that part-timer.

201
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,434
We'll flood the media
with that angle.

202
00:19:05,726 --> 00:19:07,645
If the court rules it as self-defense

203
00:19:07,728 --> 00:19:09,063
you might dodge jail time.

204
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:11,023
Then...

205
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,776
What about Ah Jin?

206
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,861
The part-timer?

207
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:16,028
She'll probably do time.

208
00:19:19,782 --> 00:19:23,202
Why are you worried about her?
It's your ass on the line!

209
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:27,498
Don't complicate things.

210
00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:30,126
She has no one to turn to,
so I feel bad for her.

211
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:34,797
But another charge on her record
won't affect her life.

212
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:36,090
Not you, though.

213
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:39,802
You're trying to make a comeback,
and doing time will ruin your life.

214
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:45,725
I've even settled things
with the lead detective.

215
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:48,186
Fortunately, with the new evidence
found at the scene

216
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,479
that girl is now the prime suspect

217
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:52,440
which works to our advantage.

218
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:56,944
The detective said
he'd make her confess

219
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:59,197
before he hands her over
to the prosecution.

220
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:01,532
So don't worry.

221
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:18,466
Le Na?

222
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:20,009
Le Na!

223
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:24,430
Hyang I turned herself in
and said it was her fault.

224
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:28,434
You're just here to give a statement,
so watch what you say.

225
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:33,022
What about the dash cam and the CCTV?

226
00:20:34,523 --> 00:20:35,691
What if I get caught?

227
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:37,235
That's been taken care of.

228
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,739
There wasn't anyone around,
so no one saw the accident.

229
00:20:41,822 --> 00:20:44,617
Be grateful Hyang I got there
before the police did.

230
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:49,288
The reporters haven't caught on,
so we can keep this quiet.

231
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:53,501
- Don't mess this up, okay?
- Okay.

232
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:56,879
- There you go.
- Okay.

233
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,881
Goodness.

234
00:20:59,757 --> 00:21:01,050
Can you smell alcohol on me?

235
00:21:01,968 --> 00:21:04,595
Why do you keep getting into trouble?

236
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:05,805
Come here.

237
00:21:05,888 --> 00:21:07,098
Here. Take this.

238
00:21:07,598 --> 00:21:08,599
Listen.

239
00:21:08,683 --> 00:21:10,184
If people find out about this

240
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:12,144
you'll be dropped
from Director Cheon's movie.

241
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:14,355
And you'll never set foot
in this industry again.

242
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:15,982
- Got it?
- I hear you, okay?

243
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:39,088
Don't worry about Jung Ho.
He'll be fine.

244
00:21:39,463 --> 00:21:42,508
How are the executives taking this?
Is Mr. Kang still in Seoul?

245
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:45,303
Really? Okay.

246
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:52,810
She's stunning.

247
00:21:54,812 --> 00:21:55,813
Let's have a look.

248
00:21:55,896 --> 00:21:57,606
- She's beautiful.
- I know.

249
00:21:58,357 --> 00:21:59,650
Put your phone in the basket.

250
00:22:01,902 --> 00:22:02,903
I need your phone.

251
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:04,822
I can't believe this.

252
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:07,825
Don't stare at her like that.

253
00:22:11,704 --> 00:22:13,414
You're making it so obvious.

254
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:15,583
This is the only time
I'll get to see her.

255
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:18,377
- Look at how small her face is.
- Have a seat.

256
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:21,464
Sit down.

257
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:32,767
So you admit it was your poor driving
that caused the accident, correct?

258
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:33,851
Yes.

259
00:22:33,934 --> 00:22:37,313
Ms. Kang, what were you doing
at the time of the accident?

260
00:22:45,321 --> 00:22:46,989
I was passed out drunk.

261
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:54,038
Ms. Seok, are you sure
you were the one behind the wheel?

262
00:22:54,955 --> 00:22:55,956
Yes.

263
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:01,712
Could you excuse me for a second?

264
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:17,686
Le Na was asleep in the back seat.

265
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,106
I crashed the car on the way back
from picking her up.

266
00:23:22,483 --> 00:23:23,484
Ms. Seok.

267
00:23:24,318 --> 00:23:28,948
If it turns out you're lying,
you could face charges.

268
00:23:29,657 --> 00:23:30,699
I know.

269
00:23:35,371 --> 00:23:37,665
Detective, you should take this call.

270
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:39,792
Hello?

271
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,127
Chief.

272
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,711
Yes.

273
00:23:43,587 --> 00:23:45,005
Noted, sir.

274
00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:53,055
Do you want an autograph?

275
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:00,479
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

276
00:24:01,897 --> 00:24:02,940
Good job.

277
00:24:03,524 --> 00:24:05,651
Ms. Baek, follow me.

278
00:24:19,331 --> 00:24:22,209
This is the text message
you sent Baek Seon Gyu.

279
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:25,337
"I'll give you the money.
Be at my place by 8 p.m."

280
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:30,843
A witness stated that
you sought help from Choi Jung Ho

281
00:24:30,926 --> 00:24:33,304
saying you were a victim of stalking.

282
00:24:35,055 --> 00:24:36,182
Goodness.

283
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:41,520
On the day of the incident,
you called and texted Choi Jung Ho.

284
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:44,648
"Mr. Choi, I need to stop by my place
to grab a few things."

285
00:24:45,357 --> 00:24:47,276
"What? Right now?"

286
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:52,865
So tell me. Why did you lie?

287
00:24:53,532 --> 00:24:56,702
You said you never saw
a beanie, right?

288
00:24:57,036 --> 00:24:59,079
Some fibers,
believed to be from a beanie

289
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:01,165
were found in your toilet.

290
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:04,627
FIBER SAMPLE

291
00:25:14,303 --> 00:25:16,805
All you've got are your hunches.

292
00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:17,973
Not really.

293
00:25:19,016 --> 00:25:20,643
It's called reasonable suspicions.

294
00:25:27,107 --> 00:25:28,776
Your father, Baek Seon Gyu

295
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:31,570
died of a massive hemorrhage
caused by a skull fracture.

296
00:25:31,654 --> 00:25:35,824
And you claimed Choi Jung Ho hit him.

297
00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:43,666
But the victim
was hit more than once.

298
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:47,545
There are signs of multiple blows
to the head.

299
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:52,508
There was a time gap
between the second and third blows.

300
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:57,513
Both times, he was struck
with a blunt object.

301
00:26:03,227 --> 00:26:06,313
You and Choi Jung Ho
were the only two people there.

302
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:11,569
And he said he fled the scene
after hitting your father once.

303
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,988
Ms. Baek.

304
00:26:14,071 --> 00:26:16,991
What you've said so far
doesn't add up.

305
00:26:22,871 --> 00:26:24,456
You still call this a hunch?

306
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:33,007
Detective.

307
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:38,470
Can I get a glass of water?

308
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,681
Sure.

309
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,018
Get her a glass of water
and coffee for me.

310
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:45,603
Sorry?

311
00:26:54,111 --> 00:26:57,156
Seriously? She has no respect for me.

312
00:26:58,324 --> 00:26:59,617
Unbelievable.

313
00:27:12,004 --> 00:27:14,423
NOJEONG POLICE STATION

314
00:27:18,552 --> 00:27:20,054
Just like you thought

315
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:23,641
Baek Ah Jin is being held
on suspicion of murdering her father.

316
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:28,270
They see the abuse from her father
as a clear motive for murder.

317
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:32,691
It might be best to hire a lawyer
and push for a lighter sentence.

318
00:27:32,775 --> 00:27:36,737
It won't mean anything
unless she's cleared of all charges.

319
00:27:37,112 --> 00:27:39,865
Then, what do you plan to do?

320
00:27:39,948 --> 00:27:42,201
There's a strong chance
she killed her father.

321
00:27:43,118 --> 00:27:44,912
Please don't tell Grandpa.

322
00:27:46,246 --> 00:27:47,289
Please.

323
00:27:48,374 --> 00:27:49,833
Sure, my lips are sealed.

324
00:28:08,185 --> 00:28:09,603
All right.

325
00:28:19,905 --> 00:28:21,615
I'm really sorry...

326
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,783
What?

327
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:24,910
Can you get the female officer?

328
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:30,207
I think I just got my period.

329
00:28:32,584 --> 00:28:34,878
Oh, right.

330
00:28:34,962 --> 00:28:36,171
Just a second.

331
00:28:53,105 --> 00:28:54,189
- Hey.
- Yes?

332
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,983
Where is she going?

333
00:28:56,608 --> 00:28:58,861
Her period just started.

334
00:28:59,903 --> 00:29:01,405
- Her period?
- Yes.

335
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,991
Detective, wait.

336
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:07,077
Have you checked my phone?

337
00:29:07,494 --> 00:29:08,912
No. Why?

338
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:14,626
Can't you check the photos
and the voice recording?

339
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:16,670
PROPERTY STORAGE

340
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:20,048
Choi Jung Ho hit him with the bat.
He confessed.

341
00:29:20,132 --> 00:29:23,135
But he's claiming
it was self-defense.

342
00:29:23,677 --> 00:29:24,762
It was her.

343
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:28,098
He beat her constantly.
Of course, she wanted him dead.

344
00:29:28,182 --> 00:29:30,851
Baek Ah Jin will get off
because of extenuating circumstances

345
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:33,103
So we'll draw attention
using Choi Jung Ho.

346
00:29:33,187 --> 00:29:36,023
That'll give him a way out,
and we can wrap up our case.

347
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:38,942
It's a win-win situation, okay?

348
00:29:58,879 --> 00:30:01,423
I've already told you.
It's not someone on our team.

349
00:30:02,174 --> 00:30:03,175
Right.

350
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:06,220
Okay, got it.

351
00:30:09,348 --> 00:30:10,349
What was that about?

352
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,226
That was my friend
from Internal Affairs.

353
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:14,144
He keeps probing for something.

354
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:16,271
Did someone take another kickback?

355
00:30:17,231 --> 00:30:18,816
Gosh, are you okay?

356
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:20,734
Damn it.

357
00:30:21,068 --> 00:30:22,444
Here you go.

358
00:30:22,528 --> 00:30:24,029
Why did you drink that so fast?

359
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:28,617
- What is this?
- Not so fast.

360
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:31,370
What's the rush?

361
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,831
Can we check your car?

362
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,041
Seriously?

363
00:30:47,636 --> 00:30:49,096
VITAMIN DRINK

364
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:54,017
You've been pocketing a lot of things

365
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:55,269
so I can't say I'm surprised.

366
00:31:00,315 --> 00:31:01,859
My mom gave me a box of those.

367
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:03,026
Want one?

368
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,320
In my 15 years on the job

369
00:31:05,404 --> 00:31:08,615
I've never once taken
anything from anyone!

370
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:10,534
Give that back.

371
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:12,828
It was from his mom.

372
00:31:14,788 --> 00:31:17,124
He's a disgrace
to government workers everywhere.

373
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:19,376
No wonder the country's in a rut.

374
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:21,336
A total waste of taxpayers' money.

375
00:31:35,684 --> 00:31:37,227
VITAMIN DRINK

376
00:31:39,062 --> 00:31:40,272
That was close.

377
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,151
Who the hell tipped them off?

378
00:31:52,492 --> 00:31:56,204
You probably thought
this would get me replaced

379
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:59,333
and clear you of the charges
once a new detective took over.

380
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,919
Nicely played, I give you that.

381
00:32:11,553 --> 00:32:13,430
How dare you come after me?

382
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:16,016
I'll do everything I can

383
00:32:17,017 --> 00:32:19,144
to convict you of this murder.

384
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:21,813
You got that?

385
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:26,234
Here.

386
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:35,577
I haven't had a proper meal
in a while.

387
00:32:35,661 --> 00:32:36,662
Why's that?

388
00:32:36,745 --> 00:32:40,248
I had to go somewhere,
and I'll be leaving again.

389
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:43,251
- Where?
- Somewhere.

390
00:32:45,837 --> 00:32:48,048
Did you hear the news?

391
00:32:48,715 --> 00:32:50,926
That jerk Baek Seon Gyu is dead.

392
00:32:55,222 --> 00:32:56,223
Really?

393
00:32:58,850 --> 00:32:59,935
That's awful.

394
00:33:03,063 --> 00:33:04,314
I can't shake the feeling

395
00:33:05,565 --> 00:33:06,566
- that she...
- Mom.

396
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,403
The rolled omelet is delicious.
Can I get some more?

397
00:33:14,741 --> 00:33:15,784
What's with you?

398
00:33:17,536 --> 00:33:20,706
It's not like you to come home
just to have dinner with me.

399
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:23,417
You've always gone out of your way
to help Ah Jin.

400
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,919
I just came to see you.
What's wrong with that?

401
00:33:26,795 --> 00:33:30,215
Besides, she's got nothing
to do with us anymore.

402
00:33:40,892 --> 00:33:42,310
VISITATION ROOM

403
00:33:42,394 --> 00:33:44,855
I heard you were backed
into a corner.

404
00:33:46,189 --> 00:33:48,150
How about I get you a good lawyer?

405
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,860
Maybe you don't need one.

406
00:33:49,943 --> 00:33:54,156
The charges may be dismissed
before you even need one.

407
00:33:56,575 --> 00:33:59,369
I know every favor has a price.

408
00:34:00,328 --> 00:34:03,957
Are you pretending to help me

409
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:07,627
so you can profit off me later?

410
00:34:08,336 --> 00:34:11,631
I heard they're trying to coerce
a confession out of you.

411
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:16,928
They're only doing that
because they can't prove I did it.

412
00:34:19,806 --> 00:34:21,683
I heard you wanted
to go to law school.

413
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:23,518
Seems like you know a thing or two.

414
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:26,480
All I'm saying is...

415
00:34:29,691 --> 00:34:31,610
I'm innocent.

416
00:34:33,028 --> 00:34:37,032
If they hand you over
to the prosecution

417
00:34:37,991 --> 00:34:39,785
there's nothing more we can do.

418
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,830
Why take that risk?

419
00:34:45,582 --> 00:34:47,334
You'll probably need time to think.

420
00:34:48,877 --> 00:34:50,921
The boss wakes up before 6 a.m.

421
00:34:52,672 --> 00:34:54,341
so that should be plenty of time.

422
00:35:14,903 --> 00:35:16,113
Mr. Choi's right.

423
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:20,867
Ah Jin had a stalker recently,
so he was worried about her.

424
00:35:21,451 --> 00:35:25,914
I think I saw the guy in the beanie
with Ah Jin at the convenience store.

425
00:35:26,498 --> 00:35:28,125
The guy you saw...

426
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:30,168
Was it him?

427
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:33,255
According to Jo Yoo Sik

428
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,508
Baek Ah Jin had a stalker
just like Choi Jung Ho said.

429
00:35:37,259 --> 00:35:40,971
Turns out it was Yoon Jun Seo,
the one she called the cops on

430
00:35:41,263 --> 00:35:44,808
who tried to hurt Baek Seon Gyu
two days before the murder.

431
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,101
And?

432
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:51,314
She reported him to the police
to protect her father.

433
00:35:51,398 --> 00:35:53,692
So why would she kill her dad
a few days later?

434
00:35:54,734 --> 00:35:56,444
If she really wanted her father dead

435
00:35:56,528 --> 00:35:59,239
she could've just let
Yoon Jun Seo do it.

436
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:04,369
Why would she protect him then,
only to kill him later?

437
00:36:04,661 --> 00:36:06,913
Wait, Jo Yoo Sik did say this.

438
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:11,960
He saw Baek Ah Jin with the stalker,
but she wasn't scared of him.

439
00:36:12,043 --> 00:36:14,212
And it didn't look like
he was trying to hurt her.

440
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,131
Weird, right?

441
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,141
Wait, stop the video.
Can you blow this up?

442
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:28,435
Play it again.

443
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:34,482
Freeze.

444
00:36:35,233 --> 00:36:37,027
That's not enough
to run facial recognition.

445
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:40,614
Really? Could we get another angle?

446
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:48,121
If you see anyone that looks like him

447
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:50,790
- give us a call.
- Sure, I'll call you.

448
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:22,906
NOJEONG POLICE STATION

449
00:37:37,545 --> 00:37:41,883
Two days ago, you were arrested
for assaulting Baek Seon Gyu.

450
00:37:43,843 --> 00:37:45,428
That bastard was evil.

451
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:50,225
What's your relationship
to Baek Ah Jin?

452
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:55,480
We used to be siblings,
but now we're complete strangers.

453
00:37:56,022 --> 00:37:58,108
I've been stalking Ah Jin.

454
00:37:58,191 --> 00:37:59,776
And that Baek Seon Gyu?

455
00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:01,903
I called the police on him
when I was a kid

456
00:38:01,987 --> 00:38:03,280
and had him locked up.

457
00:38:04,072 --> 00:38:06,658
He held a grudge against me
ever since.

458
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:10,495
He also used to beat Ah Jin
all the time

459
00:38:11,413 --> 00:38:12,831
and extorted money from her.

460
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:16,626
So what's your point?

461
00:38:20,463 --> 00:38:23,383
Where did you go
after you got out of lockup that day?

462
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:30,807
I went to see Baek Seon Gyu
at the motel where he was staying.

463
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:32,976
AFFORDABLE ROOMS

464
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:34,769
Why did you go see him?

465
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:36,896
SAVE MOTEL

466
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,356
To get back at him.

467
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:40,942
Here you go.

468
00:38:41,026 --> 00:38:43,236
I fell asleep after drinking this,
and when I woke up

469
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,406
the CCTV had been tampered with
and the receiver was gone.

470
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:47,824
Around what time?

471
00:38:48,116 --> 00:38:49,492
I don't know.

472
00:38:49,576 --> 00:38:51,578
I don't remember what happened
after that man got here.

473
00:38:52,704 --> 00:38:53,747
Is this him?

474
00:38:55,874 --> 00:38:56,958
Yes, it is.

475
00:38:57,334 --> 00:38:59,127
He asked about the guy in Room 305.

476
00:38:59,961 --> 00:39:02,839
After drugging him,
I intended to kill him

477
00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:05,967
once he passed out.

478
00:39:06,926 --> 00:39:11,514
You see, I meant to put
sleeping pills in his drink.

479
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:13,350
HANSOL MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

480
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:17,687
But he wasn't there.

481
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:20,940
That's why I went to Ah Jin's house.

482
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:25,278
What was she doing
when you entered the house?

483
00:39:26,363 --> 00:39:28,531
She was passed out on the floor.

484
00:39:29,616 --> 00:39:33,244
- Help me.
- But that devil was still breathing.

485
00:39:35,163 --> 00:39:37,999
My first thought
was to kill Baek Seon Gyu.

486
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:41,586
I wanted to make sure
he wouldn't get in my way again.

487
00:39:42,212 --> 00:39:45,048
And I wanted to make sure
he never hurt Ah Jin again.

488
00:39:51,096 --> 00:39:54,974
I hit his head with the baseball bat.

489
00:39:56,476 --> 00:39:59,687
Are you saying you hit him
with a baseball bat

490
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:01,189
while he was down?

491
00:40:01,272 --> 00:40:02,357
Yes, I hit him.

492
00:40:09,572 --> 00:40:10,907
So tell me.

493
00:40:15,328 --> 00:40:17,455
Why did you decide
to turn yourself in now?

494
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,501
What?

495
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:23,002
What do you mean?

496
00:40:23,962 --> 00:40:25,130
Is that not allowed?

497
00:40:25,713 --> 00:40:26,965
Well...

498
00:40:30,552 --> 00:40:31,845
You are allowed to come forward.

499
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:48,445
Ms. Baek.

500
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:50,655
- Open it up.
- Sure.

501
00:40:58,121 --> 00:40:59,122
Come with me.

502
00:41:11,885 --> 00:41:13,011
This way, please.

503
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:19,642
You're free to go.

504
00:41:22,103 --> 00:41:23,104
What?

505
00:41:25,398 --> 00:41:28,485
You were lucky
your stalker came forward.

506
00:41:29,652 --> 00:41:30,987
My stalker?

507
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,530
You must not have known.

508
00:41:33,281 --> 00:41:35,867
Yoon Jun Seo was at your house
the day of the murder.

509
00:41:37,327 --> 00:41:40,705
While you were passed out,
he broke into your house.

510
00:41:42,707 --> 00:41:45,793
He attacked your father,
who was still alive then

511
00:41:45,877 --> 00:41:47,795
and delivered the fatal blow.

512
00:41:49,964 --> 00:41:51,299
What are you saying?

513
00:41:51,966 --> 00:41:54,469
Yoon Jun Seo confessed.

514
00:41:57,764 --> 00:41:59,724
So you're free to go.

515
00:42:01,976 --> 00:42:05,063

517
00:42:54,612 --> 00:42:56,781
Ah Jin.

518
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:08,209
Ah Jin.

519
00:43:43,661 --> 00:43:45,913
You're the one who made me this way.

520
00:45:07,995 --> 00:45:09,789
It's over now.

521
00:45:49,996 --> 00:45:50,997
Ah Jin.

522
00:45:54,792 --> 00:45:55,793
Ah Jin?

523
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,071
Mr. Baek.

524
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:26,824
Mr. Baek?

525
00:47:03,152 --> 00:47:04,153
Focus.

526
00:47:10,451 --> 00:47:11,577
Jun Seo.

527
00:47:13,621 --> 00:47:16,207
How far would you go for me?

528
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:19,335
Answer me.

529
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:23,589
How far would you go for me?

530
00:48:59,101 --> 00:49:00,728
SAVE MOTEL
ROOM 305

531
00:49:00,811 --> 00:49:01,938
I'm from Room 305.

532
00:49:03,272 --> 00:49:04,565
Here you go.

533
00:49:10,112 --> 00:49:12,740
HANSOL MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

534
00:49:52,071 --> 00:49:53,823
AUTOPSY REPORT

535
00:50:01,872 --> 00:50:03,290
- Hello?
- Detective.

536
00:50:03,374 --> 00:50:05,710
- Hello, sir.
- I think I know when

537
00:50:05,793 --> 00:50:08,254
the guy with the energy drink
came by the motel.

538
00:50:08,713 --> 00:50:10,464
It was at 1:12 a.m.

539
00:50:10,548 --> 00:50:13,426
I must've dropped my clock
when I passed out.

540
00:50:13,509 --> 00:50:15,720
The battery fell out,
so the time had stopped.

541
00:50:19,807 --> 00:50:20,808
Why did you lie?

542
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:27,857
You said you went
to Baek Ah Jin's house

543
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:30,359
after realizing Baek Seon Gyu
wasn't at the motel.

544
00:50:30,776 --> 00:50:33,654
But the timeline doesn't add up.
It's the other way around.

545
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:37,616
After finding Baek Seon Gyu dead
at Baek Ah Jin's house

546
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,076
you went to his motel room.

547
00:50:39,952 --> 00:50:41,871
You made it look like you killed him.

548
00:50:43,497 --> 00:50:45,791
She's not the girl you stalked.

549
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:49,545
You fabricated the evidence
so you'd take the fall

550
00:50:49,628 --> 00:50:51,422
just so Baek Ah Jin could walk free.

551
00:50:56,302 --> 00:50:57,428
Is Ah Jin okay?

552
00:50:58,804 --> 00:51:01,348
- She was released, right?
- Mr. Yoon!

553
00:51:08,564 --> 00:51:11,776
Ah Jin did nothing wrong.
She's had it rough.

554
00:51:12,902 --> 00:51:14,904
What are you doing?
Are you kidding me?

555
00:51:15,654 --> 00:51:17,448
She's had a rough life, okay?

556
00:51:17,531 --> 00:51:18,532
So please!

557
00:51:18,991 --> 00:51:20,826
Please don't pin this on her.

558
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:22,745
I love her, okay?

559
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,916
Her father found out about it,
so I killed him out of rage.

560
00:51:26,999 --> 00:51:29,710
Why are you taking the fall
for something you didn't do?

561
00:51:30,711 --> 00:51:32,922
There's proof that Baek Ah Jin
called Choi Jung Ho out

562
00:51:33,005 --> 00:51:34,882
to have Baek Seon Gyu killed.

563
00:51:34,965 --> 00:51:37,968
Even if she didn't swing the bat,
it's still a serious crime.

564
00:51:38,052 --> 00:51:40,971
This isn't something you can cover up
with your lousy lies.

565
00:51:42,056 --> 00:51:43,057
No.

566
00:51:43,516 --> 00:51:45,851
Ah Jin wouldn't have done that.
She's just a poor girl.

567
00:51:45,935 --> 00:51:48,854
Let go of me. Let go!

568
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:51,982
I killed him! I killed that bastard!

569
00:51:52,066 --> 00:51:54,360
Don't you feel bad for Ah Jin?

570
00:51:56,654 --> 00:51:57,822
- Hold still!
- I killed him.

571
00:51:57,905 --> 00:51:59,156
I killed him!

572
00:51:59,907 --> 00:52:01,117
I killed him.

573
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,493
He's out of his mind.

574
00:52:02,993 --> 00:52:05,830
We're closing it as a blunt-force
homicide by Choi Jung Ho

575
00:52:05,913 --> 00:52:07,248
and turning it over
to the prosecution.

576
00:52:07,331 --> 00:52:09,667
What? What are you talking about?

577
00:52:10,251 --> 00:52:12,211
We need to question
Baek Ah Jin again.

578
00:52:12,878 --> 00:52:14,880
NOJEONG POLICE STATION

579
00:52:21,178 --> 00:52:22,429
I bet you're hungry.

580
00:52:23,222 --> 00:52:24,223
Hop in.

581
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:29,186
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

582
00:52:34,108 --> 00:52:36,902
The country we live in is a place

583
00:52:36,986 --> 00:52:40,573
where the people without power
can't clear their names

584
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:43,367
or protect what's theirs.

585
00:52:45,202 --> 00:52:46,912
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER KIM SU IL

586
00:52:50,332 --> 00:52:53,085
The lead detective
tried to railroad your case.

587
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,217
It was settled faster
than I expected.

588
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:02,761
Now you know.

589
00:53:03,387 --> 00:53:05,806
This is what it means to have power.

590
00:53:07,141 --> 00:53:08,350
That power?

591
00:53:08,976 --> 00:53:10,769
You can have it too.

592
00:53:11,145 --> 00:53:12,188
I'll help you.

593
00:53:14,023 --> 00:53:16,525
Yoon Jun Seo will be released
in a few days.

594
00:53:17,776 --> 00:53:22,156
Please let me know what I can do
to repay you.

595
00:53:23,824 --> 00:53:24,992
Yoon Jun Seo.

596
00:53:25,826 --> 00:53:27,620
Stay away from him.

597
00:53:34,585 --> 00:53:36,962
Why should I stay away from him?

598
00:53:38,797 --> 00:53:43,510
What's that got to do
with my contract with your agency?

599
00:53:44,053 --> 00:53:46,555
Ah Jin, you're going to be
incredibly famous.

600
00:53:47,681 --> 00:53:49,016
I'll make sure of it.

601
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:52,937
Your actions, your clothes

602
00:53:53,687 --> 00:53:55,981
and even the words
you absentmindedly say

603
00:53:56,774 --> 00:53:59,985
will have tremendous influence

604
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:02,279
enough to move
hundreds of billions in capital.

605
00:54:03,405 --> 00:54:09,828
However, once you become famous,
people will dig up this case again.

606
00:54:10,704 --> 00:54:12,998
And your relationship
with Yoon Jun Seo

607
00:54:13,082 --> 00:54:14,625
will come to light.

608
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:16,460
Not only will it reveal
your relationship

609
00:54:16,543 --> 00:54:21,048
but it'll also bring to light
the past you wanted to bury.

610
00:54:21,632 --> 00:54:22,967
And that's when you'll realize

611
00:54:23,842 --> 00:54:28,806
that the relationship you had
was toxic to both of you.

612
00:54:28,889 --> 00:54:32,309
I'm only trying to make sure
that doesn't happen.

613
00:54:34,478 --> 00:54:37,189
Did that answer your question?

614
00:54:38,816 --> 00:54:40,442
I was going to cut ties with him

615
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:43,821
even if you hadn't told me to.

616
00:55:13,642 --> 00:55:16,687
NOJEONG-DONG
ROOFTOP HOUSE MURDER 1

617
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:27,257
That was too dangerous.

618
00:56:33,347 --> 00:56:34,890
You could've died.

619
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,229
I didn't,
and I broke free from my shackles.

620
00:56:41,647 --> 00:56:42,981
That's all that matters.

621
00:56:45,526 --> 00:56:47,611
Was that really the only way?

622
00:56:47,694 --> 00:56:49,530
That's why I told you
to stay out of it.

623
00:56:49,988 --> 00:56:51,865
This is exactly why
I didn't tell you.

624
00:56:52,616 --> 00:56:56,370
If I'd told you my plan,
you wouldn't have gone along with it.

625
00:56:56,453 --> 00:56:58,455
Is that why you used him...

626
00:57:00,582 --> 00:57:02,000
to kill your father?

627
00:57:04,086 --> 00:57:08,006
I didn't ask him to,
nor did I force him.

628
00:57:10,342 --> 00:57:12,761
He came to your house to help you.

629
00:57:12,845 --> 00:57:15,097
He risked his life to help you.

630
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:17,933
He made his own choice.

631
00:57:18,016 --> 00:57:20,102
You basically forced his hand.

632
00:57:20,185 --> 00:57:22,271
You set it up
so he'd make that choice.

633
00:57:24,898 --> 00:57:26,316
Do you feel bad for him?

634
00:57:28,902 --> 00:57:30,571
Is that why you're yelling at me?

635
00:57:31,738 --> 00:57:34,992
I'm sorry to say this,
but I only pity myself.

636
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:37,369
I only feel sorry for myself.

637
00:57:38,662 --> 00:57:40,831
I never got to have
a normal life like other people.

638
00:57:41,582 --> 00:57:44,042
Ever since I was little,
I spent every day wondering

639
00:57:44,126 --> 00:57:46,462
when I'd get kicked out
or how bad the next beating would be.

640
00:57:47,337 --> 00:57:53,135
So why should I care about
other people's pain?

641
00:57:53,594 --> 00:57:56,722
I'm tired of what this world
keeps throwing at me!

642
00:57:57,431 --> 00:57:58,515
Ah Jin.

643
00:57:59,183 --> 00:58:01,143
Ah Jin, sit down.

644
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:03,770
I promised I'd make up
for my mom's sins

645
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,231
by never leaving your side.

646
00:58:06,315 --> 00:58:08,233
That was your mother's debt to pay.

647
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:11,403
But I want so much more than that.

648
00:58:12,279 --> 00:58:13,614
Please don't be like this.

649
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:16,492
Ah Jin, please.

650
00:58:17,075 --> 00:58:19,703
I'll make you happy,
just like everyone else is.

651
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:22,331
Ah Jin, please don't do this.

652
00:58:23,207 --> 00:58:24,208
Ah Jin.

653
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:25,584
Jun Seo.

654
00:58:27,628 --> 00:58:28,795
Don't kid yourself.

655
00:58:33,467 --> 00:58:36,011
You've never once protected me.

656
00:58:37,513 --> 00:58:39,723
If you had been serious
about protecting me

657
00:58:40,057 --> 00:58:41,808
you would have killed him

658
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:44,311
before I took matters
into my own hands.

659
00:58:45,604 --> 00:58:46,605
Go tell him.

660
00:58:47,606 --> 00:58:49,358
Tell Choi Jung Ho the truth.

661
00:58:51,568 --> 00:58:54,821
I can't wait to see his face
when he finds out he was used.

662
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,366
You...

663
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:01,870
You're going to pay for this.

664
00:59:04,081 --> 00:59:05,999
What you did was unforgivable.

665
00:59:07,459 --> 00:59:11,088
I won't get what I want
if I live the way you do.

666
00:59:13,632 --> 00:59:14,758
Don't get in my way

667
00:59:16,468 --> 00:59:17,928
and don't ruin my life.

668
00:59:21,848 --> 00:59:23,850
For all the pain you've caused

669
00:59:23,934 --> 00:59:25,435
you'll be miserable
for the rest of your life.

670
00:59:26,019 --> 00:59:28,438
Every day of your life
will be empty and exhausting.

671
00:59:28,522 --> 00:59:31,900
You might be miserable
for the rest of your life.

672
00:59:32,526 --> 00:59:33,610
Because I...

673
00:59:35,821 --> 00:59:36,905
Because I know that...

674
00:59:43,495 --> 00:59:44,580
I can't leave you.

675
00:59:47,916 --> 00:59:51,587
I have to share your punishment
when that day comes.

676
00:59:55,549 --> 00:59:57,426
You may be right.

677
00:59:59,803 --> 01:00:01,263
But you don't know how I feel...

678
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:05,559
because you haven't walked
in my shoes.

679
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,896
You're not me...

680
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:14,526
so you'll never understand.

681
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:30,584
Your kindness

682
01:00:32,294 --> 01:00:33,795
will put me in danger.

683
01:00:34,713 --> 01:00:35,839
You're too kind.

684
01:00:36,673 --> 01:00:39,176
And to me, that's a shackle,
just like my father.

685
01:00:39,718 --> 01:00:41,511
You keep dragging me down.

686
01:00:42,304 --> 01:00:43,680
What are you getting at?

687
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,308
I'm saying this is goodbye.

688
01:00:49,728 --> 01:00:50,729
Ah Jin.

689
01:00:50,812 --> 01:00:53,940
I'll climb to the top, where no one
will dare stand in my way.

690
01:00:56,485 --> 01:00:59,363
I want to be reborn at the very top.

691
01:01:01,573 --> 01:01:05,160
Where you're headed
could be the loneliest...

692
01:01:08,205 --> 01:01:09,998
most miserable place there is.

693
01:01:12,209 --> 01:01:13,418
I don't care.

694
01:01:16,004 --> 01:01:19,424
It's not like I even know
what happiness is.

695
01:01:25,097 --> 01:01:27,516
If she ever finds happiness...

696
01:01:30,018 --> 01:01:32,729
it'll come at the cost
of someone else's pain.

697
01:01:36,358 --> 01:01:37,859
That illusion of happiness

698
01:01:39,486 --> 01:01:41,196
will never last.

699
01:01:42,614 --> 01:01:43,907
I'm certain of it.

700
01:01:47,786 --> 01:01:49,746
If there is a god,
I'd like to ask him this.

701
01:01:50,664 --> 01:01:51,707
"Why is it

702
01:01:52,749 --> 01:01:54,167
that I love...

703
01:01:56,211 --> 01:01:57,462
someone so cruel?"

704
01:02:30,287 --> 01:02:32,080
Baek Ah Jin,
the rising star, turns heads

705
01:02:32,164 --> 01:02:33,623
in the film
and entertainment industry.

706
01:02:33,707 --> 01:02:36,001
Baek Ah Jin, the new face
of global fashion brand Hadere...

707
01:02:36,084 --> 01:02:38,378
The up-and-coming icon...

708
01:02:38,462 --> 01:02:40,630
Actress Baek Ah Jin tops
brand image rankings.

709
01:02:40,714 --> 01:02:42,799
Baek Ah Jin's name has become
a cultural phenomenon.

710
01:02:42,883 --> 01:02:45,469
A cultural powerhouse
shaping an entire generation's

711
01:02:45,552 --> 01:02:48,221
- vibe and taste...
- At the Berlin Film Festival...

712
01:02:48,305 --> 01:02:50,348
She is gaining global attention
through her acting.

713
01:02:50,432 --> 01:02:53,560
She's been turning heads
even in the global market.

714
01:02:53,643 --> 01:02:55,771
- Winning Best Actress...
- Tonight

715
01:02:55,854 --> 01:02:58,774
her name outshines
every trophy out there.

716
01:02:58,857 --> 01:03:01,860
How much more of a global sensation
will she become?

717
01:03:01,943 --> 01:03:04,112
I spent every night awake

718
01:03:04,196 --> 01:03:06,698
and every day
drowning in my own tears.

719
01:03:07,783 --> 01:03:09,826
I tried to let it all go

720
01:03:11,328 --> 01:03:12,621
to forgive and move on.

721
01:03:13,538 --> 01:03:15,248
However, you chose to be silent.

722
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:18,335
Yet he lived on.

723
01:03:19,753 --> 01:03:20,754
And I...

724
01:03:21,296 --> 01:03:24,800
I alone escaped your judgment

725
01:03:27,594 --> 01:03:30,639
leaving me to suffer
in this agonizing Hell.

726
01:03:40,232 --> 01:03:44,653
DEAR X

727
01:06:04,751 --> 01:06:06,753
