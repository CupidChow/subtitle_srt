1
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:49,007
Showing a naked back

2
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:57,766
Leaving me to me

3
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:07,150
On the bed that is spinning

4
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:15,325
The light is soft

5
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:23,583
Shaking in the mirror

6
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:38,973
I just hug each other

7
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,935
There is no rotating bed in the motel these days

8
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,771
How do you know?

9
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,316
I don't know

10
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,737
Who did you go with?

11
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,697
I didn't go

12
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,786
So you don't do it with me

13
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,288
It's noisy, noisy

14
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,794
Why are you annoyed from the morning?

15
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,727
Close the door and pack it

16
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,242
Don't work part -time?

17
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:40,743
Not

18
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,913
There is an important live

19
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,750
Did the producer come to see?

20
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,680
I think I'll debut only

21
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,725
why?

22
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,935
Isn't it a three -member band?

23
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,272
Only me needs

24
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,150
Did you tell the kids?

25
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,526
yet

26
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,365
What should I do?

27
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,955
Do you want to debut?

28
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,211
I feel like I'm betraying

29
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,218
It's such a world

30
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:08,998
we

31
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,669
let's do it!

32
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,757
Do it

33
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,102
hungry

34
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,145
Let's go to eat

35
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,356
Let's do it!

36
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:37,235
No, not this

37
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,530
-Dressing particles -no hate

38
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,866
-Interable toothpaste -I hate it

39
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,493
don't do it!

40
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,997
-Strite, grumpy -come down

41
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,541
Can't you bake one more?

42
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,418
no

43
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,338
The landlord checks food waste

44
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,090
If you have two fish bones, you doubt

45
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,927
Pold a little more

46
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,116
I ate well

47
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,453
-I'll be washing the dishes -yeah

48
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,751
I ate well

49
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,298
Because I do

50
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,934
Is it the last work today?

51
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,185
huh

52
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,983
I've struggled so far

53
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,987
Now I will work on behalf of you

54
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,196
huh

55
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,741
When it becomes the day after tomorrow

56
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,495
I want to do it with myself

57
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,705
What is it?

58
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,668
Walking hands with two

59
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,469
It is a courier, a shipping

60
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,554
yes

61
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,015
Please wait a little

62
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,187
Go out

63
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,449
Courier fee is 1,280 yen.

64
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,575
Here

65
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,165
thank you

66
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,341
The book I ordered on the Internet has come

67
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,686
There has been nothing so far

68
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,564
Isn't it okay now?

69
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,275
You can't be alert, two days left

70
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,945
therefore…

71
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,074
Only 38 hours endure

72
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,641
You are

73
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,103
Are you discounted if you marry at your hotel?

74
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,313
Suddenly what is it?

75
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,275
If you debut anyway, you will throw away things like me

76
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:38,406
I can't do that, but I invested 1.4 million yen

77
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:06,350
"Kabukicho Love Hotel"

78
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,079
Stand up

79
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,962
-However -I'll go first

80
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:43,179
Yes, I will practice in the studio and go to the live house early.

81
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,934
Is it after the end?

82
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,105
all right

83
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,784
-Hi -Hello

84
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,578
Hi -Hello

85
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,752
302, the door opened

86
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,258
No. 302, it is a room

87
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,017
It's a prostitute outside

88
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,771
Sometimes it's in front of the hotel, but don't get it when it comes in

89
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,696
Is there anything else?

90
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:29,827
The porn film shooting team borrows all the second floor from 11:00

91
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,583
Then the second floor does not need to be cleaned

92
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,043
Yes, until 5 pm

93
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,342
Right, manager

94
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,512
There is a lack of 100 yen coins

95
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,060
-I can't do it.

96
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,651
Borrow from the second store

97
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,285
Mr. Sato went

98
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,875
I have a cold

99
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,254
I can't even go to the hospital because I don't have an insurance card

100
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,638
Then I'll go

101
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,515
Sorry

102
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,361
5 and 6 words are strong

103
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,421
what?

104
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,134
what?

105
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,103
I'll go and come

106
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,376
-Please go first and prepare -Yes

107
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,754
-Asa, please, please -Thank you

108
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,882
-I don't know the room, go together -sorry

109
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,427
-K way to the hotel staff! - yes

110
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,602
hello

111
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,814
Hi -What are you looking at?

112
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,110
Because there is nothing to do in the flea market

113
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,196
Do you like the flea market?

114
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,324
The clothes are cheap

115
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,834
"Wanted"

116
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,695
"Press Pruts Iria, Reservation Call"

117
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:14,027
-Foreigners go out! -Foreigners go back!

118
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:38,343
-Strite hate speech! -The discrimination is ashamed!

119
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,501
why?

120
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,169
Feet…

121
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,007
Oh, this?

122
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,760
Is it bad?

123
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:06,682
Because it was cleaned with a chlorine detergent, it became like this

124
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,185
sorry

125
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,271
It's not because of the manager

126
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,065
I'm sorry though

127
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:25,158
I shouldn't do that, I have to pull it properly

128
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,537
Didn't you do this?

129
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,210
Candy?

130
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,670
Candy?

131
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,548
Don't you know yet?

132
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,926
Condom is called candy

133
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:48,473
"Please call the front guests who wish to rental goods."

134
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,568
-I've been there.

135
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,380
Thank you for your effort

136
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,844
Hello, this is a prominence

137
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:29,097
Yes, are you nominated?

138
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,477
Irian? What is it possible?

139
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,814
Yes, 60 minutes? All right

140
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,068
it's okay

141
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,616
-I -Yes

142
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,410
-It's place name -Yes

143
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:09,805
yes

144
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,015
sorry

145
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:17,270
I will make time soon and I will go to the gymnasium.

146
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,232
Yes, I'll stop

147
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,949
Iria, today is the last time?

148
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,408
huh

149
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,744
-Ido -Huh?

150
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,329
it hurts!

151
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,332
-Sur -sorry

152
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,544
-You thanked you for a while -Yes

153
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,298
It's still popular, but isn't it a waste?

154
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,843
I can earn more

155
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,014
What is this?

156
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,808
what?

157
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,560
that?

158
00:23:57,185 --> 00:24:00,188
Pizza ordered by the shooting team

159
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,358
Why don't you bring me? It's cool

160
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,695
You can't empty the front desk

161
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,121
What is the waiting room?

162
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,206
No. 211

163
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,758
I brought pizza

164
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,010
Come in

165
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,219
excuse me

166
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,225
Do you like beards?

167
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,895
-What is your beard? - huh

168
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,479
So far

169
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,064
Yes, I know

170
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,944
Where will you be?

171
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,362
Leave it there

172
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,614
yes

173
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,743
The assistant director will calculate, so wait for a while

174
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,036
All right

175
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,251
Miyu?

176
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,301
What are you doing here?

177
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,473
Come here

178
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:20,185
- wait for a sec… -What is it?

179
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,145
-What are you? -This brother

180
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,355
what?

181
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,275
Would you like to go out for a while?

182
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,695
I have me

183
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,364
sorry

184
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,163
Please go out too

185
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,625
-Yeah -I'm sorry

186
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,736
What do you do?

187
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,328
-What is the school? -It is going

188
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,416
Admission decision

189
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,210
I tried to work hard, but there was an earthquake

190
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,587
Our factory is also floating

191
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,632
My father fell down and couldn't even work

192
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,137
You said you have to share your tuition fees

193
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,392
-Didn't you work part -time? -Of of course I got it

194
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:48,273
After the class, I worked at a convenience store and Izakaya

195
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,360
I was so tired that I was sleepy during class

196
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:57,032
I want to be a nursery, but I don't have time to study

197
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,867
I wanted to be doing

198
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:05,665
I was going to go to a bar, but I was scared to see you in the neighborhood

199
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,462
So are you taking porn?

200
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,134
I saw an adult actress recruitment advertisement on the Internet

201
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,553
It seemed difficult

202
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:22,557
I applied for a traffic and accommodation.

203
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,809
I got a contact soon

204
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,229
The director is in Sendai, so let's meet

205
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,483
The director

206
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:35,570
It's famous for shooting a first -time shooting on the street.

207
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:40,450
I got a face mosaic and received 150,000 yen

208
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:45,080
After that, I came to Tokyo twice a month and took it.

209
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,083
I also earned tuition fees in an instant

210
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,964
When I first came, it was absurd

211
00:27:56,841 --> 00:28:00,387
It was less than half a year after the earthquake

212
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,932
Everyone is doing well as if nothing happened

213
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,438
On TV, the whole nation's ties

214
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:14,651
After all, it's all others' jobs

215
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,806
How is your father's depression?

216
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,643
You are taking medicine

217
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,229
Yes

218
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:56,651
Dad removes contamination from the nuclear power plant

219
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:00,655
Mom works at a fish cake factory that is restarted

220
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,494
Why are you going to continue when both of you work?

221
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,581
I don't know the world

222
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,041
The nuclear power day is 10,000 yen a day

223
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,086
I can't go out on a bad day, so I don't have 20 days a month

224
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:19,132
The fish cake factory is 750 yen in hourly wage

225
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,512
I am

226
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:30,101
I used to hesitate to buy cheap clothes

227
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,605
How much I was worried about going back and forth

228
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,524
Yosan 1, 20,000 yen just buy it

229
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,444
I can't think of no money now

230
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,198
The staff and actresses are also fun

231
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,326
They are people who can't see the neighborhood

232
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,955
Receive makeup and wear costumes

233
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,875
I feel like I'm not me

234
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,794
I forgot bad things

235
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,548
This is also strict

236
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,343
So there is no guilt

237
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:11,059
Can you tell your parents to be a porn actor?

238
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,313
no

239
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,070
You mean

240
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,282
Stop what you can't say

241
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,662
What is your brother?

242
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,580
Why are you here?

243
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,833
Wasn't it a Grand Pacific Hotel in Odaiba?

244
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,920
-When you cut it -Why?

245
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,299
What does it matter

246
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,387
This is a love hotel

247
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,015
Can I tell my parents?

248
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,018
Do whatever you want

249
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,319
Excuse me, Azusa

250
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,280
I'm ready to go?

251
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,865
-Yes -Please

252
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,122
Never tell your parents

253
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,000
You will hurt your heart

254
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,471
I also hurt my heart

255
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,850
Sorry, can you take a picture together?

256
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,978
-There of course, thank you

257
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,732
Now, I'll take it, kimchi!

258
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:41,983
- kimchi! - kimchi!

259
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,241
-Please -thank you

260
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,038
no!

261
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:01,961
no!

262
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,924
don't do it! Don't do it!

263
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,635
Please stop

264
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,303
Don't do this!

265
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,264
Don't touch it!

266
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,683
stop!

267
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,394
no!

268
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,356
hey! Bring the vibrator

269
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,025
Yes, I'll bring it

270
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:33,868
Here

271
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,498
Now, prepare

272
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:42,043
Ready, action!

273
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:46,422
Please stop

274
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,258
Don't do this…

275
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,903
The prostitution is turned off

276
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,740
Young

277
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:22,875
great job

278
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,548
I will come

279
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,300
Are you okay?

280
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,928
Business massage is okay

281
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,515
It's not as dirty as you

282
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,601
I was a call girl until recently

283
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,604
Call girl? It's been a long time since I heard

284
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,523
I'm old

285
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:50,903
Die!

286
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,954
Mr. Iria, so good

287
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:08,337
I'll let you go more

288
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:40,536
Can't I insert it today?

289
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:47,460
I want to do it, but I cut it in the store

290
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:58,846
Then you can't meet Amiya.

291
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,059
It's difficult, but…

292
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,441
'Ah Undi'?

293
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,402
'I'm Ready'

294
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,580
'Ready'

295
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,583
'Ready'

296
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,587
'go'

297
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,303
Do you feel good?

298
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,430
yes

299
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,390
how is it?

300
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,953
great?

301
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:09,644
I think it will be rice

302
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,188
Cheap! I think it's cheap too

303
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,814
It's cheap!

304
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,995
-I -yes?

305
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:36,629
I bought a perfume, but I don't know if you like it

306
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:49,016
I've met several women so far

307
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,186
No one was good like Iria

308
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,065
I know everything when I see the service

309
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:05,950
Would you like to go out with me if only Iria is okay?

310
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,120
sorry

311
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,959
Right? What did you say like a stupid!

312
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,921
I go back to Korea

313
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,549
yes?

314
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:23,968
I can't get it

315
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,970
It's okay, accept it

316
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:34,770
I'm the first to present to a woman

317
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:39,150
I consult with the clerk what I like to like

318
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,985
It was fun alone

319
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,904
I was excited

320
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,074
Okay? therefore…

321
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,201
Accept

322
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:54,206
It's my last request

323
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,502
Mr. Amyya

324
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,590
thank you

325
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,592
Thank you

326
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,854
why?

327
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,400
Why?

328
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:26,697
Instead, I want to have

329
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,120
Please give me panties

330
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,227
I found it!

331
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,271
- No -Yes

332
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,356
Please give me panties

333
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,070
great

334
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,613
Oh!

335
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,743
What are you doing?

336
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:16,163
Don't do that! Stop it

337
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,188
Kim, close the door

338
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,901
Kim -gun

339
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,368
Close properly

340
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,537
It opens because it doesn't close tight

341
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:24,607
Why am I eating cup ramen in this dirty way?

342
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,613
Kim -gun

343
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,365
I mean

344
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,910
Not the person here

345
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,579
What do you mean?

346
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:42,500
Do you know the Grand Pacific?

347
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,585
Best hotel

348
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,672
I don't know?

349
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,800
I worked there

350
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,304
There is a situation

351
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,308
I'm rotten here now

352
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,353
anyway

353
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,940
I'm going to get a job again at the first -class hotel

354
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,194
This is Tsunagi

355
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:11,695
okay?

356
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,113
Tsunagi?

357
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,573
Time crying place!

358
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:27,336
No. 307

359
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,465
I went out, clean it

360
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,890
Finish in 20 minutes

361
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,310
If you can't rotate, your boss is angry

362
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,272
What is Suzuki?

363
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,817
I went to the emergency staircase

364
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,946
Never!

365
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:57,575
You can overdue, so don't go back!

366
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,368
You can't go out!

367
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,327
"Atlas Hotel"

368
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,204
I can't

369
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,749
I'll return it

370
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,167
Okay?

371
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:09,670
No!

372
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,422
huh?

373
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,882
- okay? -What are you doing here?

374
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,434
Suzuki, clean it

375
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,436
huh

376
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,794
This is Mycho Newspaper

377
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:51,563
Do you know what Suzuki did before?

378
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:58,612
People who work in this way are full of people who have a story

379
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,949
Too skewer

380
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,368
I don't dig the past

381
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,454
To know as a manager

382
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,503
What are you doing with a rubber band?

383
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,964
At the Tokyo Detention Center

384
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,926
11 rubber bands

385
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:25,097
There is a prisoner who commits suicide by wrapped around the neck

386
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,852
I thought it would be possible

387
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,271
This is quiet

388
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,942
I can die

389
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,031
- are you okay? - huh

390
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,253
To kill it?

391
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:59,298
The shooting is over, thank you

392
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:01,008
Thank you for your effort

393
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:08,849
Kim?

394
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:13,103
It's over the second floor, so take a break and clean it

395
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,235
Beauty oil

396
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:24,698
why?

397
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,625
You, no way

398
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,253
Is it the first time in the movie?

399
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,714
It's the first time?

400
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,842
First experience

401
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,763
no way! no

402
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:50,724
With a dating person?

403
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,559
huh

404
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,646
thank god

405
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,982
I died with tsunami

406
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,656
Come quickly, Azusa

407
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:06,573
yes

408
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,869
Good, brother, I'll come again

409
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:12,788
Don't come!

410
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,802
-Please stay? -Yeah, choose anywhere

411
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,554
really?

412
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:34,434
-I'll do it the cheapest.

413
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,857
To stay now

414
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,485
Is it okay to add a lot of money?

415
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,195
What are you talking about?

416
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:50,534
If you stay before 11 pm, you have to pay the rain.

417
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:52,995
Gourmet

418
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:09,720
What are you doing?

419
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,639
Lying in bed after a long time

420
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,850
Sweet and good

421
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,687
It smells!

422
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:23,275
I haven't washed it for a week

423
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,234
what?

424
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,403
How did you buy it?

425
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:29,239
When I had money, I slept at the Internet cafe

426
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:30,490
When there is no?

427
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,329
Is it prepaid?

428
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,416
It's okay, you just need to solve the accommodation

429
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,293
If you don't have sex,

430
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,546
Oppa, you are a good person

431
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,174
Everyone is trying to have sex

432
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,718
You buy beef rice bowl and want to have sex

433
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,638
-Isn't it too much? -Grubine

434
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,182
yes? Garbage

435
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,435
By the way, wash it a little

436
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,188
-You -yeah

437
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,197
oh my god! There is also a jacuzzi

438
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,883
-However -How about?

439
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,511
I came to the hotel because I caught a high school girl

440
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:34,721
Because minors sell expensive

441
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,515
Squeeze well

442
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:39,893
Please leave it, I will bake it well

443
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:44,231
-Please -Yes, I'll do it hard

444
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,223
"Price declaration!"

445
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,466
Can I go in?

446
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,640
Hello, this is Iria

447
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:04,019
Hey, guest

448
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,228
wait for a sec

449
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,189
Wait a minute

450
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,607
No

451
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,401
Please wait

452
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,820
I'll only call you first

453
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:19,242
Otherwise, people will be worried about the store.

454
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,660
Do it quickly

455
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,412
yes

456
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:28,835
hello

457
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:33,256
This is Iria, please prepare for the change

458
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,841
- what? - yes

459
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,427
small change?

460
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:38,804
It's 20,000 yen

461
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,472
Why do you need change?

462
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:45,352
Oh, right, yes

463
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,021
It's weird

464
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,942
Guest, can you take a shower?

465
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,903
Don't need it, let's do this first

466
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,905
Guest, calm down

467
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,367
It's a dangerous guest. Bring Master Key!

468
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,919
Mr. Iria! Iria

469
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,215
Opened

470
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,133
Iria

471
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,344
What are you?

472
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,054
are you okay?

473
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,472
What are you!

474
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,392
Stop it

475
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,645
I mean, let it go

476
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:29,896
It hurts

477
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,779
hey!

478
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,406
what are you doing?

479
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,868
Are you a gangster? What is your job?

480
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,162
-Turn the flyer -it's unemployed

481
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:51,501
I'm the head of the real estate sales department, but I don't retire.

482
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:55,922
A young boss wants to sprinkle 2,000 sheets a day

483
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,757
I don't know

484
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:01,928
If you do that, it's 3,000 from tomorrow.

485
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,933
I know I can't

486
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:12,898
I'm trying to cut it at the company. I want to quit

487
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:14,566
however…

488
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,652
I am a high school student

489
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,949
I have to send a university too…

490
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,869
It's not the time to do medicine

491
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:28,163
Some people commit suicide

492
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:36,463
Without medicine

493
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,008
I'll do it

494
00:53:58,026 --> 00:53:59,611
cheer up

495
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:06,993
thank you

496
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,330
Can you meet again?

497
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,203
Was it okay?

498
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,666
You are kind

499
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,335
I'm sorry

500
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:00,672
It's dangerous

501
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,299
That

502
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,972
I don't want to do it

503
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:14,019
In fact, I want to be a first -class hotelier

504
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,400
me too

505
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,236
I want to open a clothing store

506
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:26,322
thank you

507
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,782
huh

508
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,118
Go carefully

509
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:39,085
- no! Don't eat! -Give only one

510
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:44,049
It's a dream to eat all the nurse alone

511
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,341
-The nurse? - huh

512
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:48,636
I only ate what my brother left

513
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:50,930
What are you talking about?

514
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:54,267
My mom remarried

515
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:56,936
I'm a brush brother

516
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,024
My mom is a new father, but I cared about

517
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:06,654
The child became more severe because the child was born

518
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:11,076
I sneak up in the middle of the night because I didn't give me rice

519
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,204
I ate the rice left in the rice cooker with a spatula

520
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,790
Not even transparent humans

521
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:19,793
Really?

522
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,294
huh

523
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,963
When I traveled my family, I saw a house alone

524
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,633
You don't have to believe it

525
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,638
So you ran away

526
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,390
I abandoned the house

527
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,061
okay?

528
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,025
I don't go home

529
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,113
I went with my friends

530
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:55,495
Even if I'm a friend, I'm the only friends at that time

531
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,208
however

532
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,794
I went in at night

533
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,297
Mom said

534
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:12,011
'Please die'

535
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,517
It was hard

536
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,228
It was so hard

537
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:25,733
I couldn't stand it because it exceeded the limit

538
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:29,237
I packed it up on that way

539
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,830
I am!

540
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:46,337
I will die because I tell you to die

541
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,216
I have aid or anything

542
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:53,052
He will survive

543
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:32,717
Do you not?

544
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,104
Not

545
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,736
But something touches

546
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,909
The heart and body are separate

547
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,254
me…

548
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:15,134
I have never done it with someone I like

549
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:22,183
The first experience was bald

550
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:26,938
I see

551
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:55,717
I want to do it

552
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,098
"Business"

553
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,901
-Thank you -Eat delicious

554
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,835
There are accommodation and a room

555
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,420
Accommodation

556
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:29,675
The accommodation is 14,000 yen.

557
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:30,968
is it so?

558
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:32,720
It is fixed

559
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:35,640
Expensive

560
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:44,357
200 yen here

561
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:32,488
I can't use the child today

562
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:36,158
There is no sexual attraction and it is not good there

563
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:37,451
what?

564
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:43,666
It's real, and I listened to my dad is a police officer.

565
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:48,337
You don't sympathize with a runaway girl?

566
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:50,256
Where are you now?

567
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:51,590
The bathroom

568
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:55,553
Are you stupid? I have already stealed the girl

569
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:57,096
yes?

570
01:06:58,222 --> 01:06:59,432
no way

571
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:22,747
-It was the first time? - yes

572
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:25,916
- no way… -It's the first time

573
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:27,668
really?

574
01:07:44,935 --> 01:07:46,228
Nobody

575
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:47,605
huh

576
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:53,778
what? I'm an employee

577
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:17,259
"Why are you there?"

578
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:25,226
Don't throw it?

579
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:29,355
yes

580
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:32,316
It's been a while since I changed

581
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:35,027
okay?

582
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:03,556
great job

583
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:05,391
I had a lot of trouble

584
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,811
thank you

585
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:10,729
Stop now

586
01:09:12,773 --> 01:09:15,276
It's okay, I'll do it until the end

587
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,153
I work hard

588
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:19,864
Today is the last time

589
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:25,744
What are you going to do if you go to Korea?

590
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:31,000
I'm going to set up a clothes store with my mother

591
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:32,960
-It with mother? - yes

592
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:37,214
My mother has been struggling in the meantime

593
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:43,762
When I was two years old, my father died of a car accident

594
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:49,685
Since then, my mother has raised me alone.

595
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:53,439
You sold your clothes until the morning in Dongdaemun Market

596
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,567
It must have been hard

597
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:01,363
I want to go back and take effect

598
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:08,037
-How are you Yonsei? -I'm 57 years old

599
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:13,459
If my mother was alive, he was the same man

600
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,336
Did you die?

601
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,465
2 years ago to breast cancer

602
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:27,806
It only caused a problem, and I rotted my mother a lot.

603
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:31,477
I went to the police station several times

604
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:34,563
Every time my mother bowed his head

605
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,776
If you come and think about it, there is no cotton

606
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:42,529
I'm talking about what I say

607
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:45,074
Good to my mother

608
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:48,369
-Yes -yeah

609
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:50,746
Mr. Kubota

610
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:55,542
Is Purz a name made by Mr. Kubota?

611
01:10:57,336 --> 01:11:00,339
In middle school, there was a band called Purz.

612
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:03,008
I liked the vocal of Iria

613
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:07,972
Is it my name?

614
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:17,690
Thank you, this is Purz

615
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:19,692
great job

616
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:27,741
thank you so much

617
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:31,370
Marine, Claire, Lisa

618
01:11:32,162 --> 01:11:34,957
Come to Korea

619
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,709
- huh! -I'll go!

620
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,712
-Instation -Promise

621
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,423
Myeongdong is okay?

622
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:43,507
of course!

623
01:11:43,757 --> 01:11:44,717
are you okay?

624
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:56,603
Are you a brother?

625
01:11:57,187 --> 01:11:58,272
My brother is For…

626
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:06,155
I'm a girlfriend

627
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:21,587
Call

628
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:32,639
This is the front

629
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:35,225
yes

630
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:38,479
There is no hot water in the bathroom?

631
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:41,565
I'm sorry, I'll go up soon

632
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:43,734
yes?

633
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:47,446
Yes, I'll take it

634
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:48,614
sorry

635
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:55,287
No. 311, there is no hot water

636
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,248
-311? - huh

637
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:00,626
Go fast

638
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:02,836
Suzuki is going

639
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:04,671
what?

640
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:08,133
Claim processing is a manager

641
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:09,802
Give me

642
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:14,640
Like a man

643
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:28,529
wait for a sec

644
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:31,573
There is no condom

645
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:10,737
Hot water comes out?

646
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:15,325
fool

647
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:17,536
It hurts, what are you doing?

648
01:14:19,329 --> 01:14:20,581
Why don't you get angry?

649
01:14:20,664 --> 01:14:23,542
I do it! Is it okay though?

650
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:25,919
You've come to go anyway

651
01:14:27,254 --> 01:14:28,297
Who is that guy?

652
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:34,553
Takenaka of the producer

653
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:41,768
Did you come to entertain?

654
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:49,067
Why are you working here?

655
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,737
Wasn't it Odaiba?

656
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:00,329
I've been deceived me

657
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:01,955
I'm not deceived

658
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:06,084
Because I can't pay for the earthquake and I can't pay the tuition

659
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:10,297
I told my parents and graduated with that money

660
01:15:11,089 --> 01:15:13,967
How do you say you didn't go to the Grand Pacific?

661
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,768
Money, return it

662
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:26,730
You're going to get married, so you don't have to pay it back!

663
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:29,775
-I'll think again.

664
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,360
On the topic of business with the body

665
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:54,610
"I'm sorry, I was trying to hand over to the prostitute."

666
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:57,988
"Now I'll wash my hands now, wait!"

667
01:17:24,848 --> 01:17:25,724
why?

668
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:32,773
I'm sorry, but please calculate the fee first

669
01:17:32,856 --> 01:17:34,232
Why?

670
01:17:34,858 --> 01:17:37,569
-I think the party is going out.

671
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:41,198
- still… -I will definitely come

672
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,951
Would you please contact the party?

673
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:47,245
- yes? -Do mobile phone

674
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:53,794
I don't know the number?

675
01:17:56,588 --> 01:17:59,424
I know the mail, I will send you an e -mail

676
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:04,763
Now come

677
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:06,807
Come down to the front

678
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:38,630
What are you going to do?

679
01:18:41,758 --> 01:18:43,009
Come here

680
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:50,934
Okay, if you don't like it

681
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:04,823
Will you go?

682
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:08,994
The woman is not so sad

683
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:32,350
'Nice Shot'!

684
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:40,233
You didn't fit, shit

685
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:41,818
Look here

686
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:11,640
"Honey, I got to work overtime"

687
01:20:11,723 --> 01:20:17,229
"Try Mickey's Daycare Center instead of tomorrow"

688
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:24,069
babe

689
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:28,532
It's already bigger

690
01:20:42,754 --> 01:20:44,256
You waited for a long time

691
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:47,384
Get

692
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:49,177
yes

693
01:21:08,905 --> 01:21:10,031
hey

694
01:21:12,909 --> 01:21:16,288
-This -Thank you

695
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:17,831
Oh, this is

696
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:43,398
what's the matter?

697
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:47,527
I think I saw that aunt

698
01:21:48,778 --> 01:21:50,989
Isn't it a neighborhood? are you okay?

699
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:54,075
It's dangerous if you are a neighborhood…

700
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:57,621
Who is it? I'm worried

701
01:21:58,747 --> 01:21:59,998
What if you get caught?

702
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:06,755
wait for a sec

703
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:18,433
It is good to be caught

704
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:22,187
It is difficult without money

705
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:25,440
Should I call the police?

706
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:29,444
What if you don't have an ID card?

707
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,364
I have missing

708
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:38,203
It's all that is cut from my salary!

709
01:22:39,412 --> 01:22:41,665
What should I call the police?

710
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:44,167
This parent should make me

711
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,837
The police are severe, then…

712
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,340
I'm sorry

713
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:53,635
Then, what…

714
01:22:54,844 --> 01:22:56,638
Will Suzuki be up?

715
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:58,807
no

716
01:23:00,183 --> 01:23:02,394
You can't tell this address

717
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:04,729
It's a runaway child

718
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:07,899
hey! Wherever you go

719
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:11,486
Let this, let me let go

720
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:12,737
Let go!

721
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:14,739
You can't come back

722
01:23:16,282 --> 01:23:18,076
Didn't you reply?

723
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:21,454
-You, you're deceived -no

724
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:24,374
I came to pick it up to pick it up

725
01:23:24,457 --> 01:23:26,710
Say and deceive

726
01:23:27,919 --> 01:23:30,588
Let go! don't do it!

727
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:07,751
What are you doing? In this way

728
01:24:08,084 --> 01:24:09,294
it hurts!

729
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,466
Let's go

730
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:19,095
-It's okay -it was a sacrifice for that child

731
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:23,641
Are you okay?

732
01:24:26,644 --> 01:24:28,396
Will you be playing the second game by now?

733
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:48,291
Don't overdo it

734
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:55,840
I'll go first

735
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:56,526
Do you do this with your husband?

736
01:25:57,068 --> 01:26:00,488
No, no hands

737
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:05,076
By now, Lieutenant Fujita is sleeping with the kid?

738
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:06,744
Don't so

739
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:15,503
I leave it to my husband and I'm a bad wife

740
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:17,547
Don't so

741
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:26,598
Shall we live together?

742
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:31,895
liar

743
01:26:33,646 --> 01:26:35,148
What if you are serious?

744
01:26:42,113 --> 01:26:45,909
I'm not like myself

745
01:26:47,785 --> 01:26:50,538
It was a long dream to be a detective

746
01:26:51,164 --> 01:26:52,332
so?

747
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:56,002
so

748
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:03,927
I only became a detective and came here

749
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:09,974
I can't afford to think about it now

750
01:27:11,434 --> 01:27:12,769
really?

751
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:25,448
I don't know

752
01:28:07,323 --> 01:28:09,117
It was really good

753
01:28:11,327 --> 01:28:12,578
I remembered

754
01:28:13,329 --> 01:28:14,330
what?

755
01:28:18,084 --> 01:28:20,753
Aunt who was cleaning earlier

756
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:28,386
Where did you see it?

757
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:39,731
This is this

758
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:44,485
'1998 Italian restaurant chef Kashiwagiga'

759
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:46,154
'To Ikazawa, a 33 -year -old clerk'

760
01:28:46,237 --> 01:28:50,700
'I was beaten as a frying pan and was hurt and lost.'

761
01:28:50,783 --> 01:28:54,829
'The suspect Ikezawa escapes and does not know the whereabouts'

762
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:57,123
'The wife of Kashiwagi, who is 30 years old at the time'

763
01:28:57,206 --> 01:29:00,043
'The suspect Kiriko also disappeared at the same time'

764
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:03,671
'The police are chasing two suspects in robbery'

765
01:29:03,921 --> 01:29:05,506
Are you dead?

766
01:29:06,424 --> 01:29:07,425
no

767
01:29:08,092 --> 01:29:12,513
After being beaten

768
01:29:13,556 --> 01:29:17,143
Is it a robbery sin and a hidden sin?

769
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:21,314
If she is Kiriko, he will be with Ikaja.

770
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:23,733
I caught a big thing!

771
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:28,738
I'm glad I remember

772
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:31,199
I saw a case where the aging was almost done before

773
01:29:31,282 --> 01:29:32,450
prescription?

774
01:29:33,951 --> 01:29:35,536
This, aging…

775
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,122
tomorrow?

776
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:41,459
No, until today!

777
01:29:44,128 --> 01:29:45,713
It's a big deal, I have to contact you as soon as possible

778
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:47,215
wait for a sec! Stop

779
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:50,968
How to explain this situation to the police station?

780
01:29:52,303 --> 01:29:55,473
If we have a relationship, you are the end of a criminal life

781
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:58,142
The police are closed

782
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,576
Only me?

783
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:18,621
What is your career?

784
01:30:19,455 --> 01:30:21,666
That's hard too

785
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:26,462
Is your wife a high school daughter?

786
01:30:26,712 --> 01:30:30,675
Would you have a divorce?

787
01:30:34,011 --> 01:30:35,096
okay

788
01:30:39,058 --> 01:30:40,309
Then go first

789
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:44,480
I'll contact you when you go out

790
01:30:54,031 --> 01:30:55,032
Look at this!

791
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,201
People are dead

792
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:01,747
What are you talking about! It's done during menstruation

793
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:48,836
what's the matter?

794
01:31:58,763 --> 01:32:00,765
It's a murder case

795
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:04,560
- where? -In the next hotel

796
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:08,356
Police tea and ambulance are not uproar.

797
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:13,277
It is difficult for our customers to enter the ban on the ban.

798
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:20,117
-Susuki -yeah

799
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:22,536
Please look at the front desk

800
01:32:23,454 --> 01:32:24,330
huh

801
01:32:41,097 --> 01:32:44,642
You can't go in.

802
01:33:01,784 --> 01:33:03,327
It's terrible

803
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:32,356
Who died?

804
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:00,634
A prostitute who was standing outside

805
01:34:04,263 --> 01:34:06,682
I was awakened with a guest for a fare problem

806
01:34:11,562 --> 01:34:13,397
I was killed

807
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:19,070
okay?

808
01:34:22,948 --> 01:34:24,158
I see

809
01:34:57,566 --> 01:34:59,360
It was so hard today

810
01:35:00,236 --> 01:35:02,613
There is a strange guest

811
01:35:05,282 --> 01:35:06,283
Sitting

812
01:35:08,828 --> 01:35:10,246
Sorry

813
01:35:10,621 --> 01:35:12,581
Don't you want to hear something like you?

814
01:35:13,457 --> 01:35:16,252
Self, are you finished?

815
01:35:16,669 --> 01:35:18,170
Would you like to go to my house?

816
01:35:21,465 --> 01:35:22,591
today

817
01:35:23,634 --> 01:35:24,760
No

818
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,763
Oh, why?

819
01:35:29,306 --> 01:35:32,351
That's right, I'm sorry

820
01:35:32,435 --> 01:35:34,353
You didn't give you a fort pocket money

821
01:35:34,437 --> 01:35:35,563
Here

822
01:35:37,231 --> 01:35:39,733
what's the matter? Come on

823
01:35:43,154 --> 01:35:44,155
today

824
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:47,700
Please understand

825
01:35:55,124 --> 01:35:57,209
Did I hate it?

826
01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:12,600
Why not?

827
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:18,397
Hungry

828
01:36:19,231 --> 01:36:21,400
Would you like sushi?

829
01:36:43,797 --> 01:36:46,759
-310 -Go in

830
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:50,554
Today is the last time

831
01:36:51,388 --> 01:36:52,389
last?

832
01:36:53,557 --> 01:36:55,059
Go back to Korea

833
01:36:58,354 --> 01:36:59,355
this

834
01:37:00,898 --> 01:37:02,900
I don't know if I like it

835
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:06,612
wait for a sec

836
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:15,788
Can I open it?

837
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:21,877
You want to be a first -class hotel rear?

838
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:24,755
huh

839
01:37:24,838 --> 01:37:27,591
Then Navi Neck Taiji

840
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:32,137
This is used at the banquet.

841
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:34,598
It's missed

842
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:38,686
Do hard work

843
01:37:41,605 --> 01:37:42,648
Hye Na

844
01:37:50,489 --> 01:37:51,448
thank you

845
01:37:54,577 --> 01:37:57,788
What I was here too

846
01:37:58,372 --> 01:38:00,374
I'll forget everything

847
01:38:03,752 --> 01:38:05,296
hi

848
01:38:08,382 --> 01:38:09,216
hi

849
01:38:23,689 --> 01:38:25,149
Can I go in?

850
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:28,068
Open

851
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:30,946
excuse me

852
01:38:33,824 --> 01:38:35,868
I'll see you for the first time, I am Iria

853
01:38:35,951 --> 01:38:38,162
-Please, please don't turn on

854
01:38:38,996 --> 01:38:41,582
- but… -I can't turn it on

855
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:46,920
yes

856
01:38:49,214 --> 01:38:50,215
then

857
01:38:50,924 --> 01:38:52,926
I'll only call you first

858
01:38:57,306 --> 01:39:02,353
Guests, the course is 60 and 120 minutes

859
01:39:03,687 --> 01:39:04,647
Do whatever you want

860
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:09,151
Are you okay with 120 minutes?

861
01:39:09,985 --> 01:39:10,986
huh

862
01:39:12,571 --> 01:39:13,530
yes

863
01:39:25,417 --> 01:39:26,710
I came in now

864
01:39:27,127 --> 01:39:29,046
You set it for 120 minutes

865
01:39:29,546 --> 01:39:32,216
all right

866
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:37,346
I cover my eyes with it

867
01:39:39,223 --> 01:39:41,058
I cover a lot of strangers

868
01:39:43,727 --> 01:39:44,728
With this?

869
01:39:57,574 --> 01:39:58,409
yes

870
01:41:49,019 --> 01:41:51,104
Please give me a body cleanser

871
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:54,900
I can't see it

872
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:58,195
Can you wash it well?

873
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:05,327
I'll wash it

874
01:50:04,472 --> 01:50:07,100
I brought the sushi you ordered

875
01:50:07,475 --> 01:50:11,146
- how much is this? -Please calculate when you leave

876
01:50:13,690 --> 01:50:15,692
Kissiwagi Kiriko is right

877
01:50:16,651 --> 01:50:18,862
-Stop -Kiriko Kashiwagi!

878
01:50:26,703 --> 01:50:28,413
Arrested for hidden crime

879
01:50:28,496 --> 01:50:30,206
What are you doing?

880
01:50:33,626 --> 01:50:35,337
Are you really a police officer?

881
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:37,714
The handcuffs are fake

882
01:50:38,173 --> 01:50:41,092
Would you like to talk for a while?

883
01:50:55,607 --> 01:50:57,233
Where are Ikegawa?

884
01:50:58,151 --> 01:51:00,445
-I don't know -Don't lie

885
01:51:00,528 --> 01:51:02,072
Not a lie

886
01:51:03,406 --> 01:51:05,325
I broke up 10 years ago

887
01:51:05,533 --> 01:51:08,078
You may be together yet

888
01:51:08,161 --> 01:51:10,163
How do you believe in words?

889
01:51:11,122 --> 01:51:13,750
It's been 15 years after the incident

890
01:51:14,209 --> 01:51:16,628
Wouldn't it be boring with the same person?

891
01:51:18,088 --> 01:51:21,591
You don't know better

892
01:51:22,258 --> 01:51:23,468
what do you mean?

893
01:51:25,595 --> 01:51:27,472
A man in a photo of a cell phone

894
01:51:28,807 --> 01:51:30,892
Isn't that a detective?

895
01:51:34,896 --> 01:51:37,107
The police are also cheating

896
01:51:37,524 --> 01:51:40,026
You were also cheating with Ikezawa

897
01:51:40,527 --> 01:51:41,611
no

898
01:51:41,694 --> 01:51:43,238
Then why did you run away?

899
01:51:51,246 --> 01:51:53,998
I knew I was attracted to each other

900
01:51:57,043 --> 01:51:59,212
To him who worked under her husband

901
01:52:00,296 --> 01:52:02,132
I was just the owner's wife

902
01:52:03,466 --> 01:52:06,302
There was no physical relationship, really

903
01:52:12,267 --> 01:52:14,602
My husband became violent when he was drunk

904
01:52:16,354 --> 01:52:17,981
I hit me when I tapped

905
01:52:20,817 --> 01:52:22,444
That restaurant

906
01:52:23,695 --> 01:52:25,822
My father was running

907
01:52:27,157 --> 01:52:29,200
I opened the hamburger house and opened it.

908
01:52:30,702 --> 01:52:31,995
I was the owner

909
01:52:33,788 --> 01:52:36,040
My father also gave me funds.

910
01:52:40,170 --> 01:52:42,505
It may be because of the complex

911
01:52:43,965 --> 01:52:46,176
I hit me if I just drank alcohol

912
01:52:49,471 --> 01:52:51,598
I sympathized with me like that

913
01:52:54,392 --> 01:52:57,520
I always comforted me with warm words

914
01:53:00,231 --> 01:53:02,775
Why did you steal money?

915
01:53:03,485 --> 01:53:06,154
I asked you to take it

916
01:53:06,237 --> 01:53:09,032
Then you are an accomplice

917
01:53:11,367 --> 01:53:12,368
that's right

918
01:53:13,870 --> 01:53:15,580
I'm an accomplice too

919
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:31,471
stop

920
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:34,641
If you shut your mouth for 20 hours, it ends

921
01:53:34,724 --> 01:53:36,100
Wouldn't you say?

922
01:53:46,319 --> 01:53:48,196
I have to be at the police station

923
01:53:50,907 --> 01:53:51,908
wake up

924
01:53:55,912 --> 01:53:58,164
I will be forced to drag

925
01:54:03,962 --> 01:54:05,755
all right

926
01:54:09,968 --> 01:54:11,386
Before that

927
01:54:12,011 --> 01:54:13,930
I'll go to the bathroom

928
01:54:14,931 --> 01:54:15,932
I'm in a hurry

929
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:51,259
Quickly

930
01:55:01,019 --> 01:55:04,147
Hey, run away quickly!

931
01:55:04,856 --> 01:55:08,568
I was caught by a detective who came as a guest

932
01:55:10,194 --> 01:55:13,281
I'm sorry, but I don't have it here

933
01:55:13,823 --> 01:55:15,116
Do you run away?

934
01:55:15,325 --> 01:55:17,035
The family is also ruined

935
01:55:17,118 --> 01:55:20,163
You can't even be a detective you like

936
01:55:21,497 --> 01:55:23,583
I have lived for 15 years

937
01:55:23,666 --> 01:55:25,460
It's the same as going to jail

938
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:29,088
You're already atonement, close your eyes

939
01:55:29,172 --> 01:55:30,965
Crime is a crime

940
01:55:31,049 --> 01:55:34,594
Even if we did, the family is a crime

941
01:55:34,677 --> 01:55:38,306
Private life, the police don't intervene in civilians.

942
01:55:38,598 --> 01:55:41,267
I can't see it anymore

943
01:55:57,367 --> 01:55:59,077
I'm a detective

944
01:55:59,994 --> 01:56:02,288
I don't worry

945
01:56:02,705 --> 01:56:05,249
You can live for two years for hidden sin

946
01:56:05,917 --> 01:56:07,543
So wait

947
01:56:07,961 --> 01:56:11,214
Two years later, I came to the back gate

948
01:56:11,422 --> 01:56:12,632
Open

949
01:56:13,633 --> 01:56:14,717
-Not open! - are you okay

950
01:56:20,765 --> 01:56:22,225
what are you doing?

951
01:56:23,518 --> 01:56:24,894
Open quickly

952
01:56:49,419 --> 01:56:52,088
-What is Suzuki? - huh?

953
01:56:54,841 --> 01:56:57,260
I can't go to sushi

954
01:56:58,636 --> 01:57:00,221
It's been a while

955
01:57:02,724 --> 01:57:03,725
Yes

956
01:57:05,309 --> 01:57:06,686
405?

957
01:57:08,771 --> 01:57:09,772
that's right

958
01:57:28,458 --> 01:57:29,751
I'll see you

959
01:57:41,054 --> 01:57:42,263
This is the front

960
01:57:42,638 --> 01:57:44,098
Wait a minute

961
01:57:45,183 --> 01:57:47,810
-What is there? - huh

962
01:57:47,894 --> 01:57:49,479
Come quickly

963
01:58:00,364 --> 01:58:02,075
Now, Betty

964
01:58:02,283 --> 01:58:04,077
It's a walk time

965
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:07,997
'Slow Slow Quick Quick'!

966
01:58:08,081 --> 01:58:11,125
'Slow Slow Quick Quick'!

967
01:58:11,209 --> 01:58:13,419
With the feeling of being sucked on Earth

968
01:58:13,503 --> 01:58:14,545
customer

969
01:58:14,879 --> 01:58:16,839
Earth, it becomes Earth

970
01:58:16,923 --> 01:58:18,800
-It's hard to do this -what?

971
01:58:19,926 --> 01:58:22,011
You like this too

972
01:58:22,678 --> 01:58:25,056
Turn back!

973
01:58:25,264 --> 01:58:26,390
Dog!

974
01:58:27,433 --> 01:58:29,811
-Opes! Look good -look closely

975
01:58:29,894 --> 01:58:31,729
Betty

976
01:58:31,813 --> 01:58:36,567
It's a really big Frankfurt sausage!

977
01:58:36,651 --> 01:58:40,363
-He -Look more

978
01:58:40,446 --> 01:58:42,198
Look at Betty

979
01:58:43,032 --> 01:58:43,991
Look at it

980
01:58:59,257 --> 01:59:00,675
Stupid

981
01:59:00,758 --> 01:59:01,592
what?

982
01:59:04,554 --> 01:59:07,348
- what are you doing? -Do you mean

983
01:59:12,145 --> 01:59:14,772
Don't open your legs

984
01:59:34,417 --> 01:59:37,461
Didn't you learn not to get sick?

985
01:59:38,254 --> 01:59:39,672
Say what!

986
01:59:39,755 --> 01:59:41,048
Why is it to Betty?

987
01:59:41,132 --> 01:59:42,633
-It's noisy -Aya!

988
01:59:42,717 --> 01:59:45,595
-It's noisy! -Don't use violence

989
01:59:45,678 --> 01:59:46,596
It's play!

990
01:59:46,679 --> 01:59:49,182
Don't play like this!

991
01:59:49,265 --> 01:59:51,517
Manager, what are you doing?

992
01:59:52,602 --> 01:59:53,769
Get out!

993
01:59:53,853 --> 01:59:56,230
I can't stand it anymore, I'll hit you!

994
02:00:01,611 --> 02:00:02,695
I must…

995
02:00:05,114 --> 02:00:07,867
I'll get a job at the right hotel

996
02:00:10,119 --> 02:00:11,829
So I'll pay you back

997
02:00:15,374 --> 02:00:17,835
I'll meet a better girl

998
02:00:19,337 --> 02:00:20,338
Manager!

999
02:00:47,156 --> 02:00:48,366
What is it?

1000
02:00:49,742 --> 02:00:50,743
Suzuki!

1001
02:00:52,411 --> 02:00:53,704
Run away!

1002
02:00:54,705 --> 02:00:55,873
Should I bicycle?

1003
02:00:56,082 --> 02:00:57,667
Give me!

1004
02:01:02,171 --> 02:01:03,381
thank you!

1005
02:01:40,459 --> 02:01:43,129
get on! Come on!

1006
02:01:43,212 --> 02:01:46,048
How? -Chale quickly

1007
02:01:51,137 --> 02:01:52,179
Where are you?

1008
02:01:53,139 --> 02:01:54,098
excuse me!

1009
02:01:55,182 --> 02:01:56,309
Where are you going?

1010
02:01:56,892 --> 02:01:59,395
First, there!

1011
02:03:28,025 --> 02:03:30,194
I didn't want to do it

1012
02:03:32,571 --> 02:03:34,156
It's business

1013
02:03:35,157 --> 02:03:37,201
Debut

1014
02:03:46,252 --> 02:03:47,795
I care about that?

1015
02:03:50,673 --> 02:03:51,966
Stiffly

1016
02:04:27,084 --> 02:04:27,918
let's go

1017
02:04:40,764 --> 02:04:43,100
Where are you going?

1018
02:04:44,518 --> 02:04:45,895
I'm going to my hometown

1019
02:04:53,569 --> 02:04:55,696
I can wait?

1020
02:05:01,994 --> 02:05:02,995
babe

1021
02:05:17,718 --> 02:05:19,053
i'll wait

1022
02:06:22,783 --> 02:06:27,454
Don't turn on the fire

1023
02:06:29,748 --> 02:06:31,333
Moon

1024
02:06:33,544 --> 02:06:37,131
Light

1025
02:06:39,466 --> 02:06:44,054
Subtly you

1026
02:06:46,473 --> 02:06:52,771
Because it is shining

1027
02:06:54,523 --> 02:07:00,696
Don't look back like this

1028
02:07:02,573 --> 02:07:08,454
Because tears are in full swing

1029
02:07:10,831 --> 02:07:14,293
Long journey

1030
02:07:14,877 --> 02:07:18,922
I think it will be

1031
02:07:20,924 --> 02:07:26,889
Not a breakup

1032
02:07:28,891 --> 02:07:32,811
This city

1033
02:07:36,148 --> 02:07:41,236
It's just leaving

1034
02:07:49,620 --> 02:07:54,083
Your gesture

1035
02:07:56,502 --> 02:08:03,050
Each one

1036
02:08:06,095 --> 02:08:10,265
How much me

1037
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:18,941
I don't know if I saved

1038
02:08:21,110 --> 02:08:27,032
I can't say it well…

1039
02:09:04,027 --> 02:09:05,904
Peak

1040
02:09:05,988 --> 02:09:07,072
Eat well

1041
02:09:07,656 --> 02:09:09,408
-Can you eat? -An one

1042
02:09:09,491 --> 02:09:11,702
-An only one? - huh

1043
02:09:12,286 --> 02:09:13,662
I'm going to eat it all

1044
02:09:13,746 --> 02:09:16,123
-It's a joke -it's okay

1045
02:09:16,415 --> 02:09:18,751
Stack it like a peak

1046
02:09:19,001 --> 02:09:20,294
I like to do it

1047
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:25,382
- are you okay? - huh

1048
02:09:32,556 --> 02:09:34,266
What is a lunch box today?

1049
02:09:34,516 --> 02:09:35,517
hamburger

1050
02:09:35,601 --> 02:09:37,311
also?

1051
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:44,693
what's the matter? mom

1052
02:09:45,527 --> 02:09:47,362
Where did you see it

1053
02:09:47,988 --> 02:09:49,448
I'll be late

1054
02:09:57,956 --> 02:10:01,960
This city

1055
02:10:05,088 --> 02:10:10,302
It's just leaving

1056
02:10:14,181 --> 02:10:17,976
This city

1057
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:27,027
It's just leaving

1058
02:13:59,990 --> 02:14:02,325
Just stand up!

1059
02:14:04,453 --> 02:14:05,620
Look there!
