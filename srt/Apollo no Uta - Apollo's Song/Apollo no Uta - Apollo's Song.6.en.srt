(Enoki) Shogo.

(Yamabe)

213
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,700
You can tell by the smell that it's hidden. ➡

214
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,624
The human body odor

215
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,624
It's worse than oxidized metals.

216
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,492
If you're going to do it, let me know. ➡

217
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:26,997
No matter how many times I remake it ➡

218
00:18:26,997 --> 00:18:30,525
The king is just

219
00:18:26,997 --> 00:18:30,525
Just call your name ➡

220
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:32,832
There's no way I can do it anymore.

221
00:18:38,195 --> 00:18:41,030
(Yamabe)

222
00:18:38,195 --> 00:18:41,030
Collect all these junk ➡

223
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,261
What did you want to do?

224
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,733
Did you do the exile order?

225
00:18:54,657 --> 00:18:58,426
(Yamabe) To the current king

226
00:18:54,657 --> 00:18:58,426
They have no ability to move the country. ➡

227
00:18:58,426 --> 00:19:01,591
Never again

228
00:18:58,426 --> 00:19:01,591
To avoid confusion in national politics ➡

229
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:03,624
It was a necessary decision.

230
00:19:09,459 --> 00:19:11,492
Gachan (loading sound)

231
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:22,865
Stop it now.

232
00:19:24,591 --> 00:19:27,063
Sigma doesn't want this.

233
00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:31,591
If you want to shoot, just shoot.

234
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:34,393
A new body will soon be synthesized.

235
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:46,228
(Yamabe) You

236
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:46,228
It made me make this decision.

237
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:51,195
if

238
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:51,195
If there's something to be grudged ➡

239
00:19:51,195 --> 00:19:53,228
It's yourself.

240
00:19:57,492 --> 00:19:59,525
Bang!

241
00:19:57,492 --> 00:19:59,525

243
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,525
It's also important to revive it

244
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,525
Because it's not free.

245
00:20:16,624 --> 00:20:18,700
Gachan

246
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,865
