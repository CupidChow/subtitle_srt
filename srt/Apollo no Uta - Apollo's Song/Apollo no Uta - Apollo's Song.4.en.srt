00:15:39,964 --> 00:15:44,624
It was made with streamlined.

194
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:53,327
There is no excretion device

195
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:53,327
They don't have children so they don't have genitals.

196
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:58,997
But it's something that humans made

197
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:58,997
Only the appearance was similar.

198
00:15:58,997 --> 00:16:02,228
In other words

199
00:15:58,997 --> 00:16:02,228
First of all, the feeling of love ➡

200
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:05,393
I can't have it.

201
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:07,700
But somehow ➡

202
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,558
Love has sprouted

203
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,558
I heard there are synthetic people ➡

204
00:16:10,558 --> 00:16:14,063
What is that?

205
00:16:10,558 --> 00:16:14,063
I started to want to know.

206
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,591
If I try it

207
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,591
Can you let me out from here?

208
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,799
Yes, it's fine.

209
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,832
If they'll do it.

210
00:16:40,327 --> 00:16:42,360
Ah...

211
00:17:22,931 --> 00:17:24,964
Come.

You, are you the spy from the human-tight organisation?

248
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,327
What is that ugly face? ➡

249
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,624
If you feel like that

250
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,624
He should have given the king a final blow. ➡

I'm the commander here.

The king must not execute you

255
00:21:29,931 --> 00:21:33,360
You're saying that. ➡

256
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,591
However, there are conditions.

257
00:21:36,591 --> 00:21:39,360
To serve the king until his death.
