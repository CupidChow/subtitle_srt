If you're someone else, that might be true.

53
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,433

Romance film data ➡

In particular, this work that plays a paper show➡

111
00:10:11,963 --> 00:10:14,831
There are many different forms of love

112
00:10:11,963 --> 00:10:14,831
It was very educational.

113
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,194
When people in the past fall in love ➡

114
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:22,128
Body and mind

115
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:22,128
I was immediately bolder.

00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:26,260

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,359
In reality, this is not what you do.

00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:37,194

120
00:10:37,194 --> 00:10:39,557
There are many things to love too

121
00:10:37,194 --> 00:10:39,557
Children can do it ➡

122
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:43,128
When it comes to combinations

123
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:43,128
It's limited to the moment.

124
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:46,227
Also written by a German philosopher

125
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:46,227
In an old book ➡

126
00:10:46,227 --> 00:10:48,732
It said, "Love is technology."

127
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,491
If that's the case

128
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,491
If you study love, even a synthetic person ➡

129
00:10:55,491 --> 00:10:58,128
It's something I'll get one someday

130
00:10:55,491 --> 00:10:58,128
Don't you think so?

131
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,260
I don't think so.

Why?

133
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:11,600
It's a book written by a human.

134
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,128
What if that's the case? Why

135
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,128
Do you assume it's impossible?

00:11:26,326 --> 00:11:28,359

138
00:11:30,227 --> 00:11:32,732
How many times do you try to kill?

139
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:34,930
I'll show up again.

140
00:11:37,425 --> 00:11:39,864

00:11:43,227 --> 00:11:47,633
That's it.

143
00:11:43,227 --> 00:11:47,633
Huh?

144
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:52,864
The synthetic man does not know that he will die.

145
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:52,864
So it's not possible.

146
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:55,326
That's not the case.

147
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:55,326
Because the purpose of love is ➡

148
00:11:55,326 --> 00:11:57,359
Overcome death

149
00:11:55,326 --> 00:11:57,359
It's going to be eternal!

150
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:59,392
Did you write that in the book too?

151
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:04,732
Everything is convenient for you

152
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:04,732

155
00:12:13,557 --> 00:12:15,600
Maybe it's an illusion.

That's not the case.

Even if that's the case

158
00:12:19,963 --> 00:12:23,798
I don't respond to that feeling.

It's good, I don't know.

178
00:14:10,996 --> 00:14:13,600

I was thinking of showing it off.

193
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:12,732
But... when I try it ➡

194
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:15,392
The thing to show at the moment

195
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:15,392
I'm feeling embarrassed.

196
00:15:21,996 --> 00:15:25,359
Haha... Hahaha...

197
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:30,491
Hehe... ah

198
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:30,491
I guess this is something that's so elaborate.

199
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:34,128
Hahahaha... Hahahahaha...

200
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:38,600
for now

201
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:38,600
Would you like to eat together?

202
00:16:00,988 --> 00:16:03,623
It's hard to eat though.

203
00:16:03,623 --> 00:16:07,590
I'd like to watch it forever, where I'm eating.

204
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,920
Just the soup?

205
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,382
I don't eat anything.

206
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,382
I hope I get nutrients.

207
00:16:16,052 --> 00:16:18,524
So the same body as a human?

208
00:16:22,151 --> 00:16:25,118
I'm Shogo

209
00:16:22,151 --> 00:16:25,118
Because I just want you to turn around.

210
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:32,524
If you get closer to Hiromi

211
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:32,524
I wonder if he'll fall in love with me.

212
00:16:35,283 --> 00:16:37,316
I wonder what that is.

213
00:16:39,788 --> 00:16:41,821
Hey….

214
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:48,557
At the bottom of my heart

215
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:48,557
You love Hiromi, right?

216
00:16:53,953 --> 00:16:59,052
Just you

217
00:16:53,953 --> 00:16:59,052
It's just not recognized.

218
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:09,250
I know I lied.

219
00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:13,118
Don't get along well if you know it.

220
00:17:13,118 --> 00:17:15,151
You love Hiromi.

221
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,887
That too was an extraordinary feeling.

222
00:17:22,283 --> 00:17:24,316
Stunning!

223
00:17:25,986 --> 00:17:28,755
I look exactly like Hiromi...

224
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:33,184
I love you...

225
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,283
It becomes a human body too...

226
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:46,382
But...➡

227
00:17:46,382 --> 00:17:49,184

From the hidden corridor ahead

234
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:17,953
You can go to the back gate.

235

Huh?

236
00:18:21,788 --> 00:18:24,052
It's a secret passage that only I use. ➡

I know.

249
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:22,854
(Yamabe) So

250
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:22,854

He has no guilt.

254
00:19:37,316 --> 00:19:39,349
I won't forgive you if you hurt me.

255
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:42,755
Haha. Don't you allow it?

256
00:19:42,755 --> 00:19:48,019
Hahaha

257
00:19:42,755 --> 00:19:48,019
That's what I say. ➡

258
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:51,382
A man who could also be the king of the synthetics ➡

259
00:19:51,382 --> 00:19:55,151
You could transform into an ugly person. ➡

260
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:57,524
There's nothing shameless about it.

If you were His Majesty, you know? ➡

The surgery is illegal.

265
00:20:13,656 --> 00:20:17,821
That much of a human

266
00:20:13,656 --> 00:20:17,821
If you want to become a person ➡

267
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:24,689
You now

268
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:24,689
I will be enrolled in human marriage.

269

00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:28,920
You can go anywhere. ➡

To the doctor in preparation for this situation➡

280
00:20:55,052 --> 00:20:58,316
Implants were implanted. ➡

281
00:20:58,316 --> 00:21:02,316
Of course, if you could become a human

282
00:21:02,316 --> 00:21:06,524
The fate of being human

283
00:21:02,316 --> 00:21:06,524
