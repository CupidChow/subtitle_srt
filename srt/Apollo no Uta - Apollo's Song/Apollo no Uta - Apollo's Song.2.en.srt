What kind of work was it? ➡

How far can you do with your own strength

58
00:03:27,094 --> 00:03:31,830
I was thinking of giving it a try.

59
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,863
Well, it was a challenge though.

60
00:03:37,863 --> 00:03:40,863
(Shimoda) I see. ➡

Changing the subject a bit

62
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:44,457
The origin of Sigma's name is

63
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,500
It's been debated among fans. ➡

64
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,665
From the theory that it is summation of mathematics➡

65
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:51,731
Take the initials of "signal"

66
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:51,731
Even the theory is that it was written in Greek...

67
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,226
Which do you think it is?

68
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:56,424
Huh?

69
00:03:56,424 --> 00:03:59,566
