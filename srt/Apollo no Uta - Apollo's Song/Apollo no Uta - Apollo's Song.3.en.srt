194
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:31,491
To wait for the sunset

195
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:31,491
Isn't it just a little early?

196
00:12:40,996 --> 00:12:44,963
And here's it, see ➡

197
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:46,996
It'll cut off quickly.

198
00:12:52,227 --> 00:12:55,326
To the strange old man ➡

199
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:58,161
Never get involved again

200
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:58,161
I was threatened though.

201
00:13:01,425 --> 00:13:03,524
So it came from me.

202
00:13:10,227 --> 00:13:12,260
Hehe.

203
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:17,359
It's still in time.

204
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:19,392
Would you like to go to a better place?

205
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,194
Ah... wow! Ahaha.

206
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:28,897
Wow, huh...

207
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:32,458
Haha, wow...

208
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:32,458
Hahaha.

209
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:37,831
Wow, ha ha. Wow!

210
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:39,864
Ahaha.

211
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:48,897
copper?

212
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:05,798
Sagittarius.

213
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:12,359
which one?

214
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:12,359
over there.

215
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:15,699
That bright one is Nanto Rokusei.

216
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:21,062
What? Which?

217
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:21,062
Hehehe.

218
00:14:21,062 --> 00:14:23,963
So what's next to it?

219
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,765
What seat is it?

220
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,864
I don't know.

221
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,864
It was Scorpio.

222
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:34,798
Hahahahahaha...

223
00:14:37,062 --> 00:14:40,831
Why do you know that?

224
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:43,798
I thought I'd write the lyrics ➡

225
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:45,831
I've studied recently.

226
00:14:49,392 --> 00:14:52,260
Is that a star song?

227
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,524
Hmm...

228
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,029
It might be a little different.

229
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,963
Hey….

230
00:15:36,524 --> 00:15:38,557
Was it right?

231
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:43,996
Huh?

232
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:48,732
With people you know.

233
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:00,062
About me...

234
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,425
Is that person?

235
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,425
You've been thinking about it for a while, haven't you?

236
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:14,666
Probably on that bench...

237
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,425
Someone who watched the sunset with me many times.

238
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,798
Sniff... (sound of slurping flowers)

239
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:44,062
Ugh...

240
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:46,095

Sniff...

246
00:17:09,425 --> 00:17:12,326
Ugh...

247
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:14,600
Hey, why are you crying?

248
00:17:18,326 --> 00:17:20,359
sorry….

249
00:17:23,524 --> 00:17:30,062
I... did something terrible.

250
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:34,458
Uhhh...

251
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:43,930

252
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:43,930

Wow... what are you talking about, Mom!

279

I'll call the police.

280
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,194
Hey, just a moment... hey wait!

281
00:21:10,194 --> 00:21:12,227
Shoe!

282

Squish (falling sound)

(Shimoda) Shogo!

284
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,623
(Shimoda) Finally found it.

285
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,161
(Shimoda) Are you okay? Who did it?

286
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,699
I just found my mother

287
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,699
If I chase after him...

288
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:45,524
(Shimoda) Mom? Your mother ➡

289
00:21:45,524 --> 00:21:48,524
He must have passed away a long time ago.

290
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:51,524
Huh?

291
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:51,524
Was there a similar synthetic person?

292
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:57,062
Synthetic man?

293
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:57,062
These guys lately

294
00:21:57,062 --> 00:22:00,458
If it's data about a dead person, it's fine

295
00:21:57,062 --> 00:22:00,458
Because I'm starting to use it.

296
