1
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,600
He's awake.

2
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,480
What's going on?

3
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,560
Why am I back here?

4
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,210
Have some water.

5
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,520
I'll tell you slowly.

6
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,880
Huo Ran.

7
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,240
You promised me

8
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,160
you won't lie to me again.

9
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,600
Right?

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,680
Yes.

11
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:45,840
Okay.

12
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,680
Mr. Tang values her so much.

13
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,079
If she climbs up the ladder one day,

14
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,940
how can she not forget her origin?

15
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,480
You gave her a life,

16
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,000
but you didn't raise her.

17
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,360
In her heart,

18
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,440
in her heart.

19
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,840
Father,

20
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,560
Don't make wedding clothes for others.

21
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
In the Huo family,

22
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,520
even a dog,

23
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,080
the rope

24
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,079
should be tied to your hands.

25
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,120
Well said.

26
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,560
In that case,

27
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,600
I'll leave this to you.

28
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,600
I was too foolish.

29
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,160
I should have known what kind of person you are.

30
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,960
Huo Ran.

31
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,480
You've been lying to me.

32
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,320
What?

33
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,200
Do you believe what I said?

34
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Blame yourself for being too naive.

35
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,560
In this world,

36
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,210
How dare you believe in sincerity?

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,930
What about this?

38
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,360
This is nothing.

39
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,640
Nothing.

40
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,360
Yes.

41
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,000
Your mother did me a favor.

42
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,440
I'm repaying her kindness by saving your life.

43
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,320
I've been working hard in the Huo family for more than ten years.

44
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,200
and finally got to where I am now.

45
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,000
Do you really think

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,520
I can give up everything

47
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,450
you can give up everything, right?

48
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,640
Huo Ran.

49
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,159
Song Jiayu.

50
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,680
You overestimated yourself.

51
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,240
Don't forget

52
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,560
only one of us

53
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,600
only one of us can live.

54
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,360
I told you.

55
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,160
With your appearance,

56
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,130
You still have a long way

57
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,820
There's still a long way to go.

58
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
Keep an eye on her.

59
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,520
Miss Leng.

60
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,720
You were forced to

61
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,920
to protect Lady Ruan.

62
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,680
Why didn't you tell her?

63
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,380
With her personality,

64
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,760
if she knows the truth,

65
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,960
even if I lose my life tonight,

66
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,960
I'll fight to the end with Mount Huo.

67
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,840
If we die together,

68
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,720
what's the point of winning?

69
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,280
Right now,

70
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,000
it's not a bad thing

71
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,159
to stay in Huo family.

72
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,680
At least,

73
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,080
she can be safe.

74
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,800
Leave the rest

75
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,160
to me.

76
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,200
My lady,

77
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,400
Don't take any risks.

78
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,240
Don't worry.

79
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,930
I know what to do.

80
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,600
Bad news.

81
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,200
Young Lady Yu Zhu is missing.

82
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,680
My lady.

83
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,840
Lady Ruoxi ran away.

84
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,760
What are you waiting for? Find her!

85
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,320
Yes.

86
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,880
Hurry.

87
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,440
Hurry up.

88
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,800
Where is Lady Ruan?

89
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,340
Hurry! Over there!

90
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,040
It's not here.

91
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,420
Over there.

92
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,840
We haven't searched the alley ahead.

93
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,370
Let's go.

94
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,400
Hang in there.

95
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,650
Duan Ming is at the next intersection.

96
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,080
Go.

97
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,160
Let's go.

98
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,480
Sorry.

99
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,920
Thank you

100
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,000
Thank you.

101
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,520
By the way,

102
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,920
why were you there?

103
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,480
I was just passing by.

104
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,480
and helped.

105
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,880
It's late.

106
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,360
Rest early.

107
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,200
Ms Huo.

108
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,760
Our master ordered

109
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,920
not to see guests today.

110
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,560
What?

111
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,580
I'm a fiancee. I can't enter the Wen's house.

112
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,880
Well...

113
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,600
Or is your master hiding something

114
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,940
hiding something he shouldn't hide?

115
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,880
I'm going to take it as my own.

116
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,440
Ms Huo.

117
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,680
Go away.

118
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,970
There's nothing you want here.

119
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,160
Ms Huo.

120
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,120
Please.

121
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
Cut the crap.

122
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,040
Where is she?

123
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,080
Who?

124
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,280
Wen Liyan.

125
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,930
You've been with Tang Jing for so long.

126
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,650
who has been with Tang Jing for so long?

127
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,280
I told you.

128
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,740
The person you're looking for

129
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,680
is not here.

130
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,530
It's not up to you

131
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,080
is not up to you.

132
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,410
Take a guess.

133
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Half an hour.

134
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,760
Is it enough to burn down the casino of Longhu Gang?
