1
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,840
No.

2
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,560
Mr. Tang.

3
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,440
Oh no.

4
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,720
Ex-director.

5
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,880
No.

6
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,240
Impossible.

7
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,320
It's you.

8
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,620
You collected so many evidence of Tang Jing.

9
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,490
The Huo family is Tang Jing's right-hand man.

10
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,280
No wonder

11
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,200
you want to marry Huo Ran.

12
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,240
For so many years,

13
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,280
I've been waiting for today.

14
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,280
Don't worry.

15
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,880
I will send them to the provincial city safely.

16
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,360
One more book.

17
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,320
This is

18
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,640
from Huo Ran.

19
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,760
Bastard!

20
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,890
It's all your fault!

21
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,040
Young Master, get out of the way!

22
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,400
It's Guang's fault.

23
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,600
because he was blind.

24
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,480
Young Master.

25
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,560
May I ask you

26
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,420
let me join the Dragon Tiger Gang.

27
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,360
Get up.

28
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,880
Thank you, Young Master.

29
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,040
Great.

30
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,640
Tang is down.

31
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,240
Pooh, corrupt official.

32
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,840
You deserve it.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,160
Pooh, so unlucky.

34
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,800
God is watching.

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,840
That's right.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,040
What?

37
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,880
The surprise you said was to take me home.

38
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,320
Home?

39
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,880
Don't forget

40
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,040
I've been blind for two days.

41
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,480
I can even remember

42
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,960
when you open the door.

43
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,360
Be careful.

44
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,240
Don't open your eyes.

45
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,360
All right.

46
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,360
This is to celebrate our escape.

47
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,600
I knew you forgot.

48
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,040
Happy birthday.

49
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,080
Yes.

50
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,840
Try it.

51
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,760
How is it?

52
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,680
It's weird.

53
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,480
Then stop eating.

54
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,640
Huo Ran.

55
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,080
Did you make this?

56
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,760
No.

57
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,400
That's it.

58
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,640
Make a wish.

59
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,600
My wish is

60
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,560
to make a wish.

61
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,800
Today is your birthday too.

62
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,050
Have you forgotten?

63
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,010
Before I came to the Huo family,

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,680
I didn't know my birthday.

65
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,600
That year,

66
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,560
my mother told me.

67
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,520
Well,

68
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,920
I'll give you my wish.

69
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,120
Then you have two wishes.

70
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,159
Let's go to a place.

71
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,600
This is my first wish.

72
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,040
Yes.

73
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,080
The birthday girl has the final say.

74
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,040
Look.

75
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,500
That is the Big Dipper.

76
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,520
I loved watching stars.

77
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,920
Why?

78
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The elders said

79
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,040
as long as the lost people follow the direction of Big Dipper,

80
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,770
in the direction of Big Dipper.

81
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,920
I used to look at them

82
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,650
and prayed again and again.

83
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,120
to bring you back.

84
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,850
You were born with everything.

85
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,640
and I have nothing.

86
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,640
That's weird.

87
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,840
I was so jealous of you,

88
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,140
but I still hope you can come back.

89
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,540
Speaking of jealousy,

90
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,000
I should be jealous of you.

91
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,000
You're so smart.

92
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,000
You can learn everything.

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,330
I'm good at everything.

94
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,480
When I was young,

95
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,760
I always thought

96
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,480
you are more like my daughter.

97
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,040
Now that I think about it,

98
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,460
It's really silly.

99
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,280
Yes.

100
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,840
So silly.

101
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,400
But gradually,

102
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,160
I don't want you to come back.

103
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,640
The Huo family is hell.

104
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,040
I've been mediating with Mount Huo for a long time.

105
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,040
There were many times I thought I had the chance to win.

106
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,300
But I didn't expect

107
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,680
he is more

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
than I thought.

109
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,480
No wonder

110
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,240
you kept chasing me away.

111
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,940
In order to live in the Huo family,

112
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,210
I did too many dirty things for him.

113
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,130
and his hands were stained with countless blood.

114
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,040
However,

115
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,240
he was still on guard.

116
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,440
It shows that he is so shrewd.

117
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,680
As long as he is targeted,

118
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,160
if I can't be used by him,

119
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,000
he will die.

120
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,280
But now is the best time.

121
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,120
When Tang Jing falls,

122
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,280
Before the new minister takes office,

123
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,680
Yun City must be in chaos.

124
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,120
It can stop Mount Huo.

125
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,320
I know you're capable.

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,520
Even if you stay in the Huo family,

127
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,980
you can protect yourself.

128
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,400
But your ability

129
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,520
shouldn't be wasted here.

130
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,880
The Huo family is like a mud.

131
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,039
As long as you're trapped, you'll be devoured.

132
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,400
You're scheming and scheming.

133
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,560
These tricks are tricks,

134
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,960
not Tao.

135
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,520
No matter how beautiful the oriole is,

136
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,400
it's still a caged bird.

137
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,840
To become an eagle in the sky,

138
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,280
you have to fight to the sky

139
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,200
and fly further.

140
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,480
My second wish

141
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,600
is to leave here.

142
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,200
Okay.

143
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,560
I promise you.

144
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,640
But

145
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,610
you have to come with me.

146
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,320
I can't go anymore.

147
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,760
Sister.

148
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,280
Sister

149
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,080
Your bag.

150
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,300
Huo Ting Shan controlled you with drugs.

151
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,080
He knew

152
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,320
when my mother was alive,

153
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,920
she was my weakness.

154
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,080
After my mother passed away,

155
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,880
I was fearless.

156
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,080
He threatened me with his mother

157
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,480
to poison me.

158
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
Only in this way

159
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,800
he can control me for a long time.

160
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,840
Huo Ran.

161
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,400
I will leave.

162
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,320
But not now.

163
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,440
Even if you're in hell,

164
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,120
I'll pull you up.

165
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,720
Okay.

166
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,720
Song Jiayu.

167
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,440
Come and save me.

168
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,520
It seems

169
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,480
this is your best ending.

170
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,160
You can't survive.

171
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,840
I can't die.

172
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,760
I won't kill you.

173
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,970
Because I killed you, you bastard.

174
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,480
because I killed you.

175
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,520
Tang Jing.

176
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,260
I want to apologize

177
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,020
for what happened before.

178
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,040
Actually, I trust you.

179
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,680
All these years,

180
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,280
I'm used to being alone

181
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,960
Having friends

182
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,980
means showing your weakness.

183
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,800
Once betrayed,

184
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,280
you will be doomed.

185
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,760
Sometimes I wonder

186
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,880
if this is the punishment from God.

187
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,440
Why?

188
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,840
Why do you think that?

189
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,680
When my mother was alive,

190
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,200
I lived under her protection.

191
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,600
She has been doing her best

192
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,640
to support my wings.

193
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,570
That's why I'm so tired that I can't get up.

194
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,200
I often think

195
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,240
if I manage more

196
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,480
and do better,

197
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,700
Will the ending be different?

198
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,920
This time,

199
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,100
the ending will be different.

200
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,400
Trust me.
