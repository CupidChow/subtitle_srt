1
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,280
I only know half an hour

2
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
in half an hour.

3
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,360
Ms Huo,

4
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,920
Am I right?

5
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,100
Do you think I care about that?

6
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,840
You want it.

7
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,320
Take it.

8
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,280
Wen Liyan.

9
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,650
Who are you to take her away?

10
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,680
Then why did you take her away?

11
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,400
Because I'm her sister.

12
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,600
You are her sister.

13
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,400
Put the poison on her.

14
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,240
I'll ask you one last time.

15
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,880
Where is she?

16
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,080
If you dare,

17
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
shoot me.

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,320
Ms Huo.

19
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,320
A guest

20
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,050
asked me to give you something.

21
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,919
She said if you insist on staying here,

22
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,800
I can only...

23
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,960
I'd rather die than do anything.

24
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,520
She threatened me with her life.

25
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,560
Wen Liyan.

26
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,800
Let's talk.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,600
Okay.

28
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,980
Why are you helping me?

29
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,620
I'm just doing you a favor.

30
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,920
A favor?

31
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,400
You're too polite.

32
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,200
There's no kindness between us.

33
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,960
It's business.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,920
I know.

35
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,170
you wandered around the Huo family

36
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,640
and circled around me and Huo Ran.

37
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,520
must have an ulterior motive.

38
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,010
The person you really want to deal with

39
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,000
is Tang Jing, right?

40
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,960
I guess I was right.

41
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,760
What do you want to know?

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,660
I don't want to know anything.

43
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,440
Everyone has their own secrets.

44
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,320
You don't have to explain to anyone.

45
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,440
The purpose is not the most important.

46
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,380
What matters is the destination.

47
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,200
Looks like

48
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,560
I should reconsider your proposal that night.

49
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,839
and make you

50
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,160
the sharpest knife in my hand.

51
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,440
So,

52
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,600
what does this mean

53
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,640
to you?

54
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,320
A

55
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,960
We get what we need and we won't lose anything.

56
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,680
new cooperation.

57
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,280
That's right.

58
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,159
That's it.

59
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,360
What favor?

60
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,600
You were the one who heard the news that the Huo family was blocked.

61
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,920
because you heard the news of the Huo family's lockdown.

62
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,800
Okay.

63
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,640
Boss.

64
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,600
Why didn't you tell Lady Ruan

65
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,130
you had a chance to meet her?

66
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,600
Why should I tell her?

67
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,480
Although we don't talk about the past

68
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,520
but now.

69
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,760
You should let Lady Ruan know how good you are to her.

70
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,640
No need.

71
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,320
She's right.

72
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,520
I have a grudge against Tang Jing.

73
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,720
And I came to the Huo family for another purpose.

74
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,200
I'm not pure.

75
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,400
Don't tell me

76
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,240
ever again.

77
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,040
Yes.

78
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,400
This person is...

79
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,560
Tang Jing.

80
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,400
Sorry.

81
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,480
It's okay.

82
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,080
Since I brought you here,

83
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,680
I have nothing to hide.

84
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,320
Outsiders know

85
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,520
Tang Jing is your father.

86
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,680
But it seems

87
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,570
rarely anyone mentioned your mother.

88
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,400
Back then,

89
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,500
he had a bright future.

90
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,480
My mother

91
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,360
was a boatman.

92
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,040
I thought it was just one night.

93
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,200
but

94
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,760
she gave birth to me.

95
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,419
After that, my mother was seriously ill.

96
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,280
she kneeled on the ground

97
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,919
and begged Tang Jing to feed me.

98
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,640
But Tang Jing

99
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,920
disliked my mother's status

100
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,520
and kicked us out of the house.

101
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,920
Later,

102
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,400
my mother

103
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,520
died,

104
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,960
I lived on the street.

105
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,560
until I was dying.

106
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,560
a man appeared in front of me.

107
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,200
He was the last leader of Dragon and Tiger Gang.

108
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,120
Jiang Huai.

109
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,880
He took me in.

110
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,720
He is your master.

111
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,960
My master saved me.

112
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,800
He saved me.

113
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,170
[But what about me?] [He saved me.]

114
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,240
I killed him.

115
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,760
It's quite ironic.

116
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,280
Tang Jing.

117
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,880
He had many sons.

118
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,760
But all of them died.

119
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,010
When the Tang family had no offspring,

120
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,880
he thought of me.

121
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,080
He forced me to go back.

122
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,720
But I refused.

123
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,680
he killed my master.

124
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,240
The last word

125
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,000
said before he fell.

126
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,920
is running.

127
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,640
He asked me to run.

128
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,800
All the way south

129
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,460
without looking back.

130
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,520
Keep running.

131
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,840
Keep running

132
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
I run until my feet are blurry

133
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,050
I ran until I was exhausted and knelt down.

134
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,000
I have a fever again.

135
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,800
I had no choice

136
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,080
I hid in a shabby house.

137
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,960
In this shabby house,

138
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,160
there was a girl

139
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,920
She told me

140
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,080
Hey.

141
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,120
A coward who doesn't go home.

142
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,480
Three years ago,

143
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,080
was you.

144
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,100
Someone is searching the street.

145
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,440
If you wake up,

146
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,280
run away.

147
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
A coward who doesn't dare to go home.

148
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
What do you know?

149
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,930
Of course I know.

150
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,160
Because

151
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,890
I have a home too.

152
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,240
I must go back.

153
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,280
Indeed.

154
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,600
Your words hurt me.

155
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,760
But I couldn't refute it.

156
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,480
She also told me

157
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,520
she had to go home.

158
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,400
Maybe what she said

159
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,920
gave me some courage.

160
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,240
I will never forget

161
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,200
that time

162
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,330
was the most embarrassing time in my life.

163
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,960
I'm like a stray dog.

164
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,800
I'm in a mess.

165
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,600
and lost her way.

166
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,680
But what about that girl?

167
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,000
She didn't even look at me.

168
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,240
She might be right.

169
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,680
I'm a coward.

170
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,960
So from that moment on,

171
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,640
my heart

172
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,840
in my heart.

173
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,000
So,

174
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,360
I'm back now.

175
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,080
She told me

176
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,480
we were just partners.

177
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,760
There's no such thing as a favor.

178
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,920
But I want to tell you

179
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,760
what I owe

180
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,720
for Song Jiayu three years ago.

181
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,330
Later, I returned to Yuncheng.

182
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
That bastard Tang Jing...

183
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
He threatened me

184
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,340
to threaten me to work for him.

185
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,200
I had to obey him.

186
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,120
Under his control,

187
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,520
under his control.

188
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,620
far away from Master's original intention.

189
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,520
Tang Jing and I

190
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,680
will never die.

191
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,760
One day,

192
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,340
I will take back the Dragon and Tiger Clan

193
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,920
and make you pay.

194
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,930
I've made up my mind.

195
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,090
Let's work together again.

196
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,720
I think

197
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,960
he can protect the world in Yuncheng.

198
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,080
then we...

199
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,560
flip the sky.

200
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,280
Okay.

201
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,960
Okay.

202
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,200
Now that we're partners,

203
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,880
let me tell you a secret.

204
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,800
I said that on purpose three years ago.

205
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,290
What did you say?

206
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,720
At that time,

207
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,200
you had a high fever.

208
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,640
lying on the ground and talking nonsense,

209
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,600
I knew

210
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,940
we are the same kind of people.

211
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,680
No matter how badly you get hurt,

212
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,240
I won't give up easily

213
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,730
As long as it's stimulated,

214
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,200
will stand up again.

215
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,800
It proves that

216
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,090
I guessed right.

217
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,800
Wen Liyan.

218
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,440
Three years ago,

219
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,960
three years ago.
