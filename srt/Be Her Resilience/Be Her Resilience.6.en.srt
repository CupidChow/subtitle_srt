1
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,800
Jiang Wanrou.

2
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,200
I didn't expect you to be so bold.

3
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,640
I missed the best time.

4
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,920
Even if I give her away now,

5
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,160
no one wants her.

6
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,800
Master.

7
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,120
Our child might have died.

8
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,120
At this time,

9
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,440
at this time?

10
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,400
Yes.

11
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,640
She's dead.

12
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,800
My wealth died too.

13
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,000
You buried them all.

14
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,280
What an eyesore.

15
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,240
Guards!

16
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,440
Sell her to Paramount.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,460
Don't even think about it.

18
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,560
I'll send her away as soon as possible.

19
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,120
You...

20
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,800
Don't hit Aunt Jiang!

21
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,920
How dare you!

22
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,000
What are you doing?

23
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,600
Let go!

24
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,640
Let go!

25
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,000
Aunt Jiang.

26
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,200
Aunt Jiang.

27
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,320
Take her away.

28
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,360
Leave me here.

29
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,200
I can do anything for you.

30
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,450
What did you say?

31
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,760
As you can see,

32
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,570
I'm not afraid of anything.

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,600
As long as you stop bullying Aunt Jiang,

34
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,200
I can fulfill what you want.

35
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,240
I'll think about it.

36
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,040
But...

37
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,440
You're hurt.

38
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,850
Don't get infected.

39
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,660
Treat your illness first.

40
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,440
Don't lie to me.

41
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,840
This isn't for treatment, is it?

42
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,840
Okay.

43
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,800
From now on,

44
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,120
you're the eldest daughter of Huo family, Huo Ran.

45
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,920
Mother.

46
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,240
Mother.

47
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,840
When you find the time, run away.

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,920
No, Mother.

49
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,490
I want to stay here with you.

50
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,400
and find your sister.

51
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,040
If I can find her...

52
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,520
No.

53
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,960
Don't let her come back.

54
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,770
Don't let her go back to the Huo family.

55
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,920
Do you hear me?

56
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,520
Okay, Mother.

57
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,760
I promise you.

58
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,720
Mother.

59
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,320
I found my sister.

60
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,440
Don't worry.

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,520
I will protect her

62
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,240
and let her leave the hell of the Huo family.

63
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,960
Don't come over!

64
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,159
Run!

65
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,120
Don't come over.

66
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,170
Don't be afraid.

67
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,560
I need your help.

68
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,840
No.

69
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,720
Zhi Jie.

70
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,040
The son of the president of Anhua Bank

71
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
is your friend.

72
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,620
What's wrong, Dad?

73
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll go visit him.

74
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,400
I'll go.

75
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,640
The crime scene is near my house.

76
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,440
Did my family do it?

77
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Shut up.

78
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,520
Bad luck.

79
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,360
I'll go visit him now.

80
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,600
Master.

81
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,960
Master.

82
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,760
The witness of last night's murder accused the murderer.

83
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,600
Murderer?

84
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,440
What's taking you so long?

85
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,240
What's wrong with the murderer?

86
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,600
She said the murderer was Lady Ruan.

87
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,600
The police still want Lady Ruoxi to answer.

88
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,480
Bring her down.

89
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,360
Yes.

90
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Song Jiayu, you killed someone.

91
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,400
Jiayu.

92
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,720
Did you do this?

93
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,400
No.

94
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,580
I don't know who this person is

95
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,040
or where this is.

96
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,360
Stop quibbling.

97
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,900
The murderer accused you.

98
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,760
Are you going to convict an innocent person

99
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,240
by a stranger?

100
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,559
I think she did it.

101
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,440
Huo Zhi Jie.

102
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,600
Are you out of your mind after waking up early in the morning?

103
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,120
Can't you see such an obvious false accusation?

104
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,960
Huo Ran, you...

105
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,640
Father.

106
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,760
The wound killed him with one stab.

107
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,290
Obviously, the murderer is a martial artist.

108
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,440
I suspect

109
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
this person came for the Huo family.

110
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,920
and used Jiayu.

111
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,800
Dad.

112
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,040
In that case,

113
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,980
we have to send Song Jiayu out.

114
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,840
If we don't,

115
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,640
all of us will be implicated.

116
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,000
The Huo family has always been responsible for the public.

117
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,160
If we give up our own daughter,

118
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,330
if this gets out,

119
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,960
no one will cooperate with us in the future.

120
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,440
Huo Ran.

121
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,680
You mean

122
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,560
there must be someone else behind this.

123
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,560
These days,

124
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,840
my sister is not suitable to stay here.

125
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,600
I suggest we send her out for a while.

126
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,120
When the truth is out,

127
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,880
when the truth is revealed.

128
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,440
Okay.

129
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,520
Let's do it.

130
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,760
Jiayu.

131
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,000
I have to make you suffer.

132
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,320
Yes.

133
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,980
Listen to your father.

134
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,120
Sister.

135
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,720
You've won a great round.

136
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,160
I don't understand what you're talking about.

137
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,680
Don't worry.

138
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,320
I'll be back.

139
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,360
Okay.

140
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,200
Huo Ran.

141
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,240
You gave it to me this time.

142
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,440
When Song Jiayu dies,

143
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,720
I'd like to see how you can turn over.

144
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,120
Sister.

145
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,250
You set this up, didn't you?

146
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,640
But I won't leave so easily.

147
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,480
Aunt Liu.

148
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,120
Yes?

149
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,760
Give me the ticket.

150
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,800
You can stop here.

151
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,360
Lady Ruoxi.

152
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,400
Miss Leng said

153
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,660
I can't go back until I take you to the car.

154
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,600
Kill!

155
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,120
Lady Ruoxi, run!

156
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,440
Boss.

157
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,840
You asked me to keep an eye on the Huo family.

158
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,970
Something happened to Young Lady Huo.

159
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,320
Boss.

160
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,440
He's dead.

161
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,100
Looks like we're late.

162
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,100
Lady Ruan has been taken away.

163
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,840
Take care of it.

164
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,170
Don't leave anyone behind.

165
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,040
Yes.

166
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,240
Doctor, how is it?

167
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,440
The victim's head was severely hit.

168
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,860
It may lead to short-sighted blindness.

169
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,960
How long will it take to recover?

170
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,240
Maybe two or three days.

171
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
Maybe a month.

172
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,400
it may depend on the injured.

173
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,160
Miss Leng.

174
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,340
Master is asking about Lady Ruan.

175
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,640
Tell him

176
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,330
Jiayu is still missing.

177
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,840
I'm trying to find it.

178
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,840
Yes.

179
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,800
Thanks to your worry,

180
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,440
I went to see Lady Ruan off.

181
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,160
Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable.

182
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,640
So don't blame yourself.

183
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,600
I'm fine.

184
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,160
For the next few days,

185
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,840
I'll stay here and take care of her.

186
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,900
When she recovers,

187
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,800
when she recovers.
