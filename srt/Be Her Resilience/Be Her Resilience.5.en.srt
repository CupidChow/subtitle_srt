1
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,520
Ms Huo, will you forgive Wen Liyan?

2
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,600
Does Master Huo know about this?

3
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,880
Will the marriage between the Huo family and the Wen family be cancelled?

4
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,400
Ms Huo.

5
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,080
Ms Huo! Ms Huo!

6
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,520
Open the door, Ms Huo!

7
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,960
Ms Huo, please respond.

8
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,160
Ms Huo! Ms Huo!

9
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,360
Please respond.

10
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,280
Ms Huo, will you forgive Wen Liyan?

11
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,080
That's right.

12
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,039
Will the marriage between the Huo family and the Wen family be cancelled?

13
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:35,759
Ms Huo, open the door!

14
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,479
Ms Huo.

15
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,640
Sorry.

16
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,250
for disappointing you.

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,560
Our engagement ceremony

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,460
will be held as scheduled.

19
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,400
As scheduled.

20
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,160
Ms Huo is really flexible.

21
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,280
In my opinion,

22
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
From now on,

23
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,640
I'll wear green.

24
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,160
What do you think?

25
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,600
Okay.

26
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,479
Ms Huo, I've heard a lot about you.

27
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,960
Your generosity is indeed extraordinary.

28
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,440
I admire you.

29
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,079
Mr. Deng.

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,120
I can't accept this gift.

31
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,880
In this world,

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,840
no one is willing to share their love.

33
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,370
I, Huo Ran, am no exception.

34
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,960
You're lying.

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,560
You're lying.

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,840
How can you be a reporter with such a good eye?

37
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,560
Ms Huo,

38
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,200
Could it be you in the photo?

39
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,640
Everyone.

40
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,880
The answer you want is here.

41
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,680
It's really her.

42
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,720
It's Ms Huo.

43
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,180
It's a misunderstanding.

44
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,800
Come on.

45
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,480
It's fun.

46
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,680
It was a personal matter.

47
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,280
Everyone has it.

48
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,680
Sorry to disturb you.

49
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,040
It's just a small apology.

50
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,440
You all have it.

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,400
Thank you.

52
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,600
It's all...

53
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,160
It's all a misunderstanding.

54
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,079
What a disgraceful thing.

55
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,000
What are you doing?

56
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,240
Mr. Deng.

57
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,500
Wait for the lawyer's letter.

58
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,560
Since ancient times,

59
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,760
men are romance.

60
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,560
It's worth reciting poems and writing poems.

61
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,890
A name remains forever.

62
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,360
But if it were a woman,

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,480
it would be an unforgivable crime.

64
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,810
for ten thousand years.

65
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,680
But to me,

66
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,840
there is no such rule.

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
Okay.

68
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,280
Are you satisfied with this play?

69
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,880
Sister.

70
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,600
I have no idea what you're talking about.

71
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,840
Sister.

72
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,240
It's not a good habit to lie.

73
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,800
Crazy.

74
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,080
Of course I like it.

75
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,640
You have a good wrist

76
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:25,880
I'm V

77
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,000
I...

78
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,880
I'm inferior to you.

79
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,000
This is not right.

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,280
It doesn't look like that either.

81
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
What should we do?

82
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,480
Does Master Huo know about this?

83
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,560
Will the marriage between the Huo family and the Wen family be cancelled?

84
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,360
It's too late.

85
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,760
Miss Leng.

86
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,280
Businessmen never do losses.

87
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,570
They are willing to put the bait

88
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,840
to catch a big fish.

89
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,520
Who's crazy?

90
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,200
Sister.

91
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,480
We are sisters.

92
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,640
we should have the same blood.

93
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,700
I will investigate this thoroughly.

94
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,280
No matter who it is,

95
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,440
I will make her pay.

96
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,640
Let's wait and see.

97
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,360
You're such a good actress.

98
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,200
If you know how to stay clean,

99
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,440
it will save you a lot of trouble.

100
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,000
30% interest.

101
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,800
It's not a loss

102
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,960
at this price.

103
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,080
Of course I have to settle the score.

104
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,080
But I'm not the one who should give in.

105
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,640
It's you.

106
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,400
Ms Huo.

107
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,040
Why don't you ask your good sister

108
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,840
what she did to me?

109
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,680
Please.

110
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
Song Jiayu.

111
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,680
I'll make you remember me this time.

112
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,240
50% interest. Deal.

113
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,880
I didn't expect

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,760
Ms Huo is such a good sister.

115
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,880
But you should know the means of Dragon and Tiger Gang.

116
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,360
I thought you would thank me

117
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,409
for getting rid of this troublemaker for you.

118
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,060
It's none of your business

119
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,640
is none of your business.

120
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,160
Don't forget

121
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,240
we are just partners.

122
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,970
We each get what we need.

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,930
I'll think about

124
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,610
I'll think about it.

125
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,600
Master.

126
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,880
I beg you.

127
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,520
Wanrou.

128
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,840
This is your daughter.

129
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,480
Wanrou.

130
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,200
She's our daughter.

131
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,680
I don't want to.

132
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,360
But she has a good fate.

133
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,440
Trust me.

134
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,640
Just this once.

135
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,280
He said

136
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,440
as long as I help him

137
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,040
the business will be successful.

138
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,000
From now on,

139
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,160
our Huo family will have a backer.

140
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,440
Give me another daughter then.

141
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,120
Ah no

142
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,320
and have another son.

143
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,320
and carry on the family line.

144
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,170
Even the vicious tiger won't eat its cubs.

145
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,440
Mount Huo Ting.

146
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,240
You're shameless.

147
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,520
You value men over women.

148
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,760
Are you selling your daughter for glory?

149
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,760
In women's opinion,

150
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,400
It's not your turn to decide the Huo family.

151
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,280
Come here.

152
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,240
Come here.

153
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,680
Try one.

154
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,480
It's okay.

155
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,320
Madam.

156
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,960
This child was born on the same day as Miss.

157
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,280
It’s also a rare fate of Phoenix.

158
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,600
I asked around.

159
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,440
She has no parents.

160
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,370
She's an orphan.

161
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,360
If you want a raccoon to replace the Crown Prince,

162
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,640
she's the perfect one.

163
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,040
No matter what,

164
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,640
I can't do it.

165
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,760
to push her out as a scapegoat.

166
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,240
I just don't know

167
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,080
if it's the right decision

168
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,410
Isn't that the right decision?

169
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,800
I'll send you away soon.

170
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,680
Just wait.

171
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,560
Go away!

172
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,820
None of your business.

173
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,360
Mom!

174
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,560
Mom, help me!

175
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,520
Mom!

176
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,120
Jiayu.

177
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,560
Mom, help me.

178
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,280
Jiayu.

179
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,680
Mom!

180
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,800
Mom, help me!

181
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,720
Jiayu.

182
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,680
Huo Ran.

183
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,440
Mom, help me!

184
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,400
Jiayu.

185
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,440
Miss Leng.

186
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,680
Master wants you to go to the study.

187
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,760
Coming.

188
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,840
Father.

189
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,840
Do you know your mistake?

190
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,400
Play dumb.

191
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,440
Father, just say it.

192
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,960
This time,

193
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,840
you broke your arm

194
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,040
and kept your relationship with the Dragon and Tiger Gang. You should be rewarded.

195
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,880
But this shouldn't have happened in the first place.

196
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,540
As the daughter of the Huo family,

197
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,020
you can't even control your husband.

198
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,680
How embarrassing.

199
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,840
This is your punishment.

200
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,200
Remember.

201
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,080
Because of me,

202
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,080
because of me.

203
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,360
and always listen to me.
