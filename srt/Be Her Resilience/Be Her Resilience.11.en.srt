1
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,160
Sister

2
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,800
What are you doing?

3
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,800
You kept asking me

4
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,530
why I didn't do anything to you?

5
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,520
Your wish is fulfilled now.

6
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,600
It's so lively.

7
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:33,840
Mr. Tang.

8
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,280
Huo Ran.

9
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,680
Long time no see.

10
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,820
Why is your temper getting worse?

11
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,160
Sorry, Mr. Tang.

12
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,600
This guy doesn't know anything.

13
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,840
How dare he play tricks in front of you?

14
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,400
and disgrace the Huo family.

15
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,460
I'm just following the family rules.

16
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,090
to give you an explanation.

17
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,759
Who said that?

18
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,880
I think you're a good girl.

19
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,640
She's brave and resourceful. She's in danger.

20
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,120
As for you, Huo Ran,

21
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,210
It's time to learn your temper.

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,080
Yes.

23
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,240
Lady Ruan.

24
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
See you.

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,200
Father.

26
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,680
Okay.

27
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,240
Good job, Jiayu.

28
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,920
You did a great job.

29
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,770
Father, you flatter me.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,530
You're indeed my daughter.

31
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:37,680
I'm counting on you from now on.

32
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,280
Father.

33
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,840
This is the account book from last month.

34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,960
Give it to Jiayu.

35
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,560
By the way,

36
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,690
Jiayu's yard is a little small.

37
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,200
Give me yours.

38
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,880
Sister.

39
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,240
It doesn't belong to me.

40
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,960
No matter how tight it is,

41
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,079
no matter how tight it is.

42
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,160
I told you

43
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,520
I will take back

44
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,680
one by one.

45
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,280
Aunt Wang, any news?

46
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,640
Jiayu, are you sure it's that villa?

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,720
Yes.

48
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,480
After he saved me,

49
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,400
he put me in that villa.

50
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,160
Later, I had to go back to the Huo family.

51
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,620
I couldn't find her again.

52
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,640
I just want to thank her in person.

53
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,960
She is meticulous and cautious.

54
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,140
I've inquired a lot to get some clues.

55
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,880
But...

56
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,200
Tell me.

57
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,480
This villa

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,280
under Huo Ran's name.

59
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,600
Aunt Wang,

60
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,560
Please investigate one more thing for me.

61
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,320
Okay.

62
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,370
Mr. Tang is going to hold a birthday party.

63
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,280
This banquet is very important.

64
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,280
We can't lose face.

65
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,880
Jiayu, do you understand?

66
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,760
Yes, Father.

67
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,680
But...

68
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,280
If you have any concerns,

69
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,200
just tell me.

70
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,800
I've never been to a party.

71
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,440
I don't know what to choose.

72
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,400
But

73
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,640
if you're willing to help me,

74
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,760
I won't make a fool of myself.

75
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,280
Father.

76
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,360
It's not hard.

77
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,280
Huo Ran, I'll leave it to you.

78
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,640
Any questions?

79
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,480
Thank you.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,680
No, next.

81
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,680
Huo Ran, are you done?

82
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,480
Didn't you ask me to come?

83
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,040
What?

84
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,960
Do you regret it?

85
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,240
Look at you.

86
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,770
You still have a long way

87
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,690
I still have a long way to go.

88
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,660
Where's your pendant?

89
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,400
It's worthless.

90
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
I've long lost it.

91
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,080
Miss, your cheongsam is here.

92
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
Please have a try.

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Sister.

94
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,490
Since you're wearing a cheongsam,

95
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,800
why don't you wear a fan?

96
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,880
But this pattern is not good.

97
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,560
Let's change it to Nightingale Flying Butterfly.

98
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,680
What do you think?

99
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,880
Is it really you?

100
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,080
This medicine smells quite special.

101
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,460
Where's your pendant?

102
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,040
I've already lost it.

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,280
Orange red cake.

104
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,500
It tastes good.

105
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,960
Young Lady asked me to buy it.

106
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,540
Change it to Nightingale Flying Butterfly.

107
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,640
Jiayu.

108
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,480
The thing you entrusted last time has been settled.

109
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,280
There is indeed a kid in the Huo family who is good at Go.

110
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,740
who once showed himself in the competition.

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,480
But the photos were missing.

112
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,560
or hidden in the Huo family.

113
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,610
Young Lady Zhen Zhu, what's wrong?

114
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,240
Nothing.

115
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,160
It's just a stray cat.

116
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
Let's go meet your father.

117
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,440
Okay.

118
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,840
Father.

119
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,880
Tell me. What is it?

120
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,480
Father is right.

121
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,480
Mr. Tang's banquet is a top priority.

122
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,880
It's inevitable to dance western dance to cheer you up.

123
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,120
How about

124
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,240
I'll teach Jiayu to practice in advance

125
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,090
in case she makes mistakes.

126
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,880
That's very thoughtful of you.

127
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,760
Let's do it.

128
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,280
Yes.

129
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,720
Young Lady.

130
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,960
When she was investigating the villa,

131
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,560
when she was investigating the villa.

132
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,200
Why did you deliberately

133
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,930
to lure Lady Ruan into the trap?

134
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,680
Instead of hiding,

135
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,240
than hide it.

136
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,280
After all, it's better to see it

137
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,200
than seeing it with your own eyes.

138
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,680
People only believe in their own judgment.

139
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,560
The smarter you are, the more you are.

140
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,480
Now,

141
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,280
She should have given up.

142
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,280
No way.

143
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,880
The Huo family is good at Go.

144
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,800
is Huo Zhi Jie.

145
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,040
Young Lady Zhen Zhu.

146
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,700
Why would you rather be beaten

147
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,760
even if you're beaten?

148
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,960
No, Tsukki.

149
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,800
I can't fight with Huo Zhi Jie for anything now.

150
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,560
My mother just passed away.

151
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,160
The Huo family is in turmoil.

152
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,920
Only hiding can we be safe.

153
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,800
It doesn't matter whether I can play Go or not.

154
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,400
What Huo Ting Shan wants to test is my attitude.

155
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,840
He wants me to be a dog willingly

156
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,140
to pave the way for the Huo family.

157
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,740
If Her Ladyship finds out,

158
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,960
she will be sad.

159
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,570
Mother taught me how to play Go.

160
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,160
because

161
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,660
the person she really wants to play chess

162
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,680
is no longer around.
