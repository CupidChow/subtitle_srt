1
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,200
Boss.

2
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,600
I've arranged everything

3
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,440
has been arranged. Don't worry.

4
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,039
Boss.

5
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,840
Since you remember,

6
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,080
why don't you take this opportunity to express your feelings to her?

7
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,560
Duan Ming.

8
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,400
Do you really

9
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,360
in your mind.

10
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,240
But if a man and a woman want to protect each other,

11
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,920
what else

12
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,039
what else can I be?

13
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,840
Partner.

14
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,720
Friends.

15
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,600
Being friends

16
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,920
could last longer.

17
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,880
Yes.

18
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,800
Most importantly,

19
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,440
she

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,880
saw me long ago.

21
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,200
I'm afraid someone might tamper with your medicine.

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,260
I'll get it myself.

23
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,240
The brothers of the Dragon Tiger Gang are all here.

24
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,320
I'll be back soon.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,800
Miss.

26
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,079
I finally found you.

27
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,000
The doctor said your test results are out.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,960
Come with me.

29
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,880
Here.

30
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,090
Where's the doctor?

31
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,680
Where is he?

32
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,120
Where is he?

33
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,560
What are you waiting for?

34
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,800
Find him.

35
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,320
Yes.

36
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,960
Boss.

37
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,880
Here.

38
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,280
The person Mr. Tang wants

39
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,400
has been found.

40
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,800
Master.

41
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,320
How is it?

42
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,720
I found Young Lady Yu Zhu.

43
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,839
However,

44
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,959
was sent by Mr. Tang himself.

45
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,560
What?

46
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,720
Mr. Tang said

47
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,280
Say it.

48
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
Say it.

49
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,120
Mr. Tang said you failed.

50
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,480
The passports to the Huo family

51
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,320
to the Huo family.

52
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,680
You've gone too far!

53
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,159
Master.

54
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,120
Turn off the engine.

55
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,240
Mr. Tang is the favourite person of the provincial general.

56
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,040
In a few days,

57
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,360
the provincial general will come to Yuncheng for ribbon cutting.

58
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,360
If we offend him now,

59
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,620
the consequences will be unimaginable.

60
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,440
After the ceremony,

61
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,240
Lady Ruan will get married soon.

62
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,680
By then, you and Mr. Tang will be a family.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,200
There might be a chance.

64
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,080
Tang Jing, that bastard.

65
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,640
Miss Rong Hua, have you had fun?

66
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,920
Young people are more interesting.

67
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,800
Don't say it.

68
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,440
you chased after me.

69
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,840
is really interesting.

70
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,680
If you like it,

71
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,920
if you like it.

72
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,000
I wonder how many lives others can keep me company.

73
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,480
Let me count.

74
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,280
There are dozens of people in the Huo family.

75
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,840
and the Dragon Tiger Gang.

76
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,760
Mr. Tang.

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,840
Jiayu was willful before.

78
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,120
Please forgive me.

79
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
Lady Ruan,

80
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,560
don't force yourself.

81
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,680
Earlier,

82
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,120
my father read my fortune.

83
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,440
Tell me.

84
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,720
I have the same fate as Mr. Tang.

85
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm lucky

86
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,720
to have such a husband.

87
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,680
I'm willing to marry him.

88
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,760
However,

89
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,200
I have a favor to ask.

90
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,400
Oh.

91
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,760
I think

92
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,320
for a few days.

93
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,080
When I recover,

94
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,360
or I'll be doomed

95
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,960
you'll be executed.

96
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,280
Of course.

97
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,280
I'll find the best doctor for you.

98
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,280
But you look

99
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,140
you don't look like a normal cold.

100
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,640
What?

101
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,960
Did someone hurt you in the Huo family?

102
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
Jiayu.

103
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,480
Don't be afraid. Tell me.

104
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,320
I will avenge you.

105
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,880
Let me guess.

106
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,480
Could it be...

107
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,880
Huo Ran?

108
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,280
Not her.

109
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,400
You worry too much.

110
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,640
Really?

111
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,320
That's good.

112
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,000
Take a good rest.

113
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,180
On the wedding day,

114
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,080
I will make you the most beautiful bride in Yun City.

115
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,960
Young Lady Zhen Zhu, I've found out that...

116
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,680
Tang Jing has been in seclusion these days.

117
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,810
as if he was on guard.

118
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,159
But the provincial general will attend the opening ceremony of Yuncheng Railway.

119
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,400
Tang Jing will be in charge of this.

120
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,930
He will definitely show up.

121
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,200
How many days?

122
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,440
Three days.

123
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,320
Okay.

124
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,240
Three days later,

125
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,320
in three days.

126
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,240
Do you need us to prepare?

127
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,120
No need.

128
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,760
I'll go alone.

129
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,600
Miss Leng.

130
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,960
You can't risk your life

131
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,320
and risk your life.

132
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,880
This is my personal grudge.

133
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,480
I shouldn't involve others.

134
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,280
If anything happens,

135
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,760
you can distribute them.

136
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,400
These things

137
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,440
is enough for you to stay in the Huo family.

138
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
Young Lady Zhen Zhu.

139
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Say no more.

140
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,570
I've made up my mind.

141
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,440
Miss Leng.

142
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,720
If you don't take me there,

143
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,240
kill me now.

144
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,480
Tsukki!

145
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,240
Miss Leng.

146
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,500
We're willing to follow you to the death.

147
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,680
Later,

148
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,440
the provincial general will attend

149
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,760
to attend the opening ceremony of the railway in Yuncheng.

150
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,520
Everyone,

151
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,160
Do your best.

152
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,000
Sure.

153
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,600
Wen Liyan,

154
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,300
You are really a good dog of Tang Jing.

155
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,440
I want him dead

156
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,140
than anyone in this world.

157
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,320
Why should I trust you?

158
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,280
Because I promised Song Jiayu.

159
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,400
I won't break my promise.

160
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,600
Huo Ran.

161
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,080
We're on the same side.

162
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
Then you shouldn't have stopped me.

163
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,560
If Tang Jing

164
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,360
die like this,

165
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,440
he'll be lucky.

166
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,120
Tell me.

167
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,320
Is it your Huo family?

168
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,880
I don't know.

169
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,720
That old fox, Huo Ting Shan.

170
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,440
ruined the ribbon cutting ceremony.

171
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,040
and made a fool of me in front of the provincial governor.

172
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,800
Father.

173
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,960
How could Father...

174
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,120
If he's unkind, don't blame me for being unjust.

175
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,960
Just marry me in the netherworld.

176
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,960
The Yin marriage is also a marriage.

177
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,240
If you resent,

178
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,160
blame your ungrateful father.

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,800
This is bad. The police are here.

180
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,760
What?

181
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,920
Tang Jing.

182
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,240
You are suspected of murder of the provincial mayor.

183
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,080
Come with me.

184
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,200
Nonsense!

185
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,180
What evidence do you have?

186
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,520
The model of this gun

187
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,840
is exactly the same as the one who killed the provincial governor.

188
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,520
No.

189
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,560
Impossible.

190
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,570
If you have anything to say,

191
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,280
let's talk at the police station.

192
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,120
Let's go.

193
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,160
Let's go.

194
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,650
That's impossible.

195
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,480
Doctor.

196
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,040
Please tell me honestly.

197
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,400
if my poison is serious.

198
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,960
How should I detoxify it?

199
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,160
It's strange, Miss.

200
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,840
Your pulse is strong.

201
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,480
You're not poisoned.

202
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,120
What?

203
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,880
Impossible.

204
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,120
I vomited blood before.

205
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
and my body aches.

206
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,400
No way.

207
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
No way.

208
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,320
But...

209
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,280
Miss.

210
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,200
Have you had eye disease before?

211
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,560
It should be sudden.

212
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,160
caused by the impact.

213
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,860
The symptoms are serious.

214
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,080
Even darkness in front of my eyes.

215
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,760
That's it.

216
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,400
Your eye disease

217
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,600
seems to be cured,

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,260
but it actually leaves a root of illness.

219
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,120
The coldness in his body hasn't dissipated and his blood is blocked.

220
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,760
If this goes on, the root will be hurt.

221
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,640
Miss.

222
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,840
This medicine seems to be poison,

223
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,400
but it's actually medicine.

224
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,160
There are three seventy and red flowers in it.

225
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,240
It can remove the bruises in your body

226
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,720
It can remove the coldness in your body.

227
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,600
These symptoms will be removed within three to five days.

228
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,000
Don't worry.

229
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,840
People who use medicine

230
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,080
is not to harm you.

231
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,600
but to save you.

232
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,860
Congratulations.

233
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,400
The plan worked.

234
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,560
What happened to your face?

235
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,360
Let's go up.

236
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,530
So you discussed this with Song Jiayu?

237
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,960
She was caught by Tang Jing on purpose

238
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,760
to sneak into the Tang Residence

239
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,160
and set him up.

240
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,640
Yes.

241
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,160
Wen Liyan.

242
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,260
How dare you let her take the risk?

243
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,240
You clearly know the Tang Residence is like.

244
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,840
How dare you let her...

245
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,640
Why don't you trust her?

246
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,680
These are two different things.

247
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,720
No, it's one thing.

248
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,480
Huo Ran.

249
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,480
You know it better than anyone.

250
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,640
She is an eagle in the sky,

251
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,640
not a bird in the palm.

252
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,440
Besides,

253
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,940
the moment you entered the Huo family and exchanged identities with her,

254
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,720
you're destined

255
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,400
to live in the storm forever.

256
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,580
That's what happened.

257
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,540
She decided to give up everything

258
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,040
to assassinate Tang Jing.

259
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,840
Thank you.

260
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,560
Why are you telling me this?

261
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,050
Mind your own business.

262
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,280
It's not like you.

263
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,360
I just don't want you to have regrets.
