1
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,320
Aunt Wang.

2
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,880
Please help me.

3
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,640
Don't let anyone know.

4
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:54,840
Okay.

5
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,120
What's wrong with the Huo kid?

6
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,200
Nothing.

7
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,800
Maybe it's because he's young.

8
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,400
You overestimate yourself.

9
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,240
I heard that the merchant from Nanyang met at your place.

10
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:23,000
Did you hear anything?

11
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,120
No.

12
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,840
In that case,

13
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,520
I can only ask the Huo family to give me an explanation.

14
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,880
I'd like to see what other tricks Mount Huo has.

15
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,160
Boss.

16
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,079
Tang Jing has suspected you.

17
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,920
He won't give up easily.

18
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,200
What should we do?

19
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,680
The nails planted

20
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,840
should be pulled out.

21
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
That makes sense.

22
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,560
You planted spies around him

23
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,820
to check the accounts?

24
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,440
Now we have the evidence.

25
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,480
It's a good chance to escape.

26
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,800
We just need the right time.

27
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,170
By the way, boss,

28
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,220
someone just sent something.

29
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,240
A chance?

30
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,240
Maybe he's here.

31
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,120
Yes.

32
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,490
Why did you catch me?

33
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,320
I'm sorry.

34
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,200
Someone asked me to give this to you.

35
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,440
We meet again.

36
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,880
How dare you!

37
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,480
It gave me courage.

38
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,760
After all,

39
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,600
this is your biggest secret.

40
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,300
This western medicine can make people weak.

41
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,960
As long as it's fixed,

42
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,480
we can create an illusion of paralysis.

43
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,400
That's the leader of the Dragon and Tiger Gang.

44
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,280
You are cruel to others.

45
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,880
and yourself.

46
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,800
Nonsense.

47
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,840
I took a bag of fake medicine

48
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,970
and made up a bunch of ridiculous lies.

49
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,730
You're threatening me.

50
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,400
If I tell you,

51
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,890
people will believe me.

52
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,000
True or false

53
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,000
is the least important.

54
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,800
Am I right?

55
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,760
Song Jiayu.

56
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,040
You're ungrateful.

57
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,600
What kindness?

58
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,680
It was a deal before.

59
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
You got a batch of goods for nothing.

60
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Don't be a good boy if you get a good deal.

61
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,960
You too.

62
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,800
You caused a big trouble.

63
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,580
and caused such a big trouble.

64
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,320
and destroyed Huo Zhi Jie.

65
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,520
[and had a chance to show off in front of Mount Huo.]

66
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,960
It looks like killing two birds with one stone.

67
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,600
But your real target is Huo Ran.

68
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,720
In order to calm Tang Jing down,

69
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,159
to calm Tang Jing down.

70
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,480
But do you know

71
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,480
you can't fight alone.

72
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,040
So you want to drag me into the water?

73
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,280
Lady Ruan,

74
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
You really have a good plan.

75
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,960
Unfortunately,

76
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,680
I may not be that capable.

77
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,400
No.

78
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,880
You do.

79
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,400
If I'm not mistaken,

80
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,600
you arranged an undercover for Tang Jing, right?

81
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,560
I'll inform Boss about this.

82
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,560
What do you want?

83
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,200
Cooperate from inside and perform a good show.

84
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,680
You're lucky.

85
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,090
If it weren't for my intention,

86
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,520
do you really think I would be threatened by you?

87
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,080
Right?

88
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,680
The process doesn't matter.

89
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,210
What matters is the result.

90
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,290
Happy cooperation.

91
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,120
Orange red cake.

92
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,680
Lady Ruan, bad news.

93
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,480
This is Mr. Tang's invitation.

94
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,920
He asked the Huo family

95
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,960
to give him an explanation tonight.

96
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,760
Otherwise...

97
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,160
Otherwise...

98
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,720
Don't panic.

99
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,640
Just go.

100
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,920
It tastes good.

101
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,480
Oh.

102
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,200
Miss asked me to buy it

103
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,840
Sister, wait and see.

104
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,240
Mr. Tang.

105
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,220
Sorry to keep you waiting.

106
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,400
Mount Huo Ting is so foolish.

107
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,600
Who do you think you are?

108
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,850
You have the right to talk to me.

109
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,800
Mr. Tang.

110
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,080
I'm standing here today with only one identity.

111
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,360
The Huo family.

112
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,120
The Huo family will live and die together.

113
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,400
No matter who you send,

114
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,760
it's the same.

115
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,800
You have a sharp tongue.

116
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,360
Then tell me

117
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,800
what do the Huo family plan to give me?

118
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,920
I can't.

119
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,360
The goods are lost.

120
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,240
the Huo family won't be able to compensate.

121
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,520
However,

122
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,010
we have prepared another gift for you.

123
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,440
As the saying goes,

124
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,480
it's a blessing to fail.

125
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,210
Exchange a batch of goods for a mole to be exposed.

126
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,000
Do you think this deal is worth it?

127
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,360
This gift is the sincerity of the Huo family.

128
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,480
Wait.

129
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,400
Ruyan.

130
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,040
You do it.

131
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,880
Okay.

132
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,400
That's Ning Zheng, the brother of Longhu Gang.

133
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,800
He has been hiding beside Tang Jing these years.

134
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,920
There was no flaw.

135
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,600
But after Huo Zhi Jie lost his goods,

136
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,280
Tang Jing was wary of him.

137
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,840
He's a thief.

138
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,360
Sacrificing a brother for Tang Jing's trust.

139
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,680
It's a good deal.

140
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,840
But,

141
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,060
are you willing to do that?

142
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,640
You...

143
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,840
Lady Ruan, don't worry.

144
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,240
The Dragon and Tiger Gang

145
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,200
we need some tricks to escape.

146
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,600
As long as I shoot that day,

147
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,400
nothing will go wrong.

148
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,760
How did you know Tang Jing would send you here?

149
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,220
Because he's suspicious.

150
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,800
He won't let go

151
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,720
to test me.

152
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,600
What are you waiting for?

153
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,560
Throw it into the river.

154
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,620
Don't get in my way.

155
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,920
Tae Yang, it's okay.

156
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,920
How is she?

157
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,810
Everything is fine.

158
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Don't worry.

159
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,880
The people we arranged in the casino

160
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,920
in the casino.

161
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,940
No one noticed.

162
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,800
I really underestimated her.

163
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,520
Maybe

164
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,880
she's stronger than I thought.

165
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,760
Young Lady Zhen Zhu.

166
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,400
What are we going to do next?

167
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,160
Song Jiayu's opera is over.

168
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,400
It's my turn.

169
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,440
What are you doing?
