1
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,759
Who are you?

2
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,640
Stay back!

3
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,039
I won't hurt you.

4
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,720
Don't worry.

5
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,970
I won't take it away.

6
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,360
Just put it somewhere safe.

7
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,200
Where am I now?

8
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,639
This is the suburb.

9
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,900
You're in my house.

10
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,640
I saved you.

11
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,860
I want to go.

12
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,400
I want to go back.

13
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,660
You're badly injured.

14
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,340
Don't move.

15
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,079
Luckily, I'll change my voice

16
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,060
I won't let her hear me.

17
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,640
Lean on it.

18
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,079
Here.

19
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,040
Back.

20
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,520
Be careful.

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,840
Don't worry.

22
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,600
It's safe here.

23
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,700
You can stay here and recuperate.

24
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,320
The doctor said your eyes are fine.

25
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,400
You just need to rest.

26
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,240
This is the medicine the doctor prescribed for you.

27
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,570
Drink it while it's hot.

28
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,770
Open your mouth.

29
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,800
This way, the medicine won't be bitter.

30
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,720
Try it.

31
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,600
Be careful.

32
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,240
Slowly.

33
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,720
Have a good rest.

34
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,160
I'm leaving.

35
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,080
Wait.

36
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,360
What should I call you?

37
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,770
You're younger than me.

38
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,560
Just call me sister.

39
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,200
Sister.

40
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,960
Thank you.

41
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,800
Good night.

42
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,159
Good night.

43
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,120
Let's play.

44
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,760
I found something new.

45
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,400
Black is rough.

46
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,400
White is smooth.

47
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,450
There's a mark on the board.

48
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,380
Even if you can't see it, you can feel it clearly.

49
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,540
Let me help you.

50
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,760
Okay.

51
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,240
Wait.

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,800
I can do it.

53
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,060
I'll walk towards you.

54
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,760
I got it.

55
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,800
Because

56
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,050
you are in the light.

57
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,200
You are the one in the light.

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,120
I lost.

59
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,000
You're amazing.

60
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,290
If you don't like it,

61
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
I won't play then.

62
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,640
No.

63
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,920
I like it.

64
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,520
In that case,

65
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,290
why are you pretending?

66
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,159
You're good at chess,

67
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,840
but you're still acting like you know nothing.

68
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,480
Why?

69
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,040
I just want to make you happy.

70
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,960
I can't afford to lose in your heart.

71
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,600
No.

72
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,840
Sister, I was wrong.

73
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,000
Again.

74
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,960
The game is over.

75
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,420
There's no need to waste time.

76
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,080
What?

77
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,159
Nightingale Flying Butterfly, right?

78
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,880
Oh no.

79
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,120
My mother taught Jiayu and I Go.

80
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,640
Did she see something?

81
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,000
Nightingale pounces butterflies.

82
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,400
It looks harmless.

83
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,560
Flower cakes.

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,800
is actually a killing move.

85
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,840
Sister, this round...

86
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,400
It's a draw.

87
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,840
Speaking of which,

88
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,720
my mother taught me this.

89
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,800
Sister.

90
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,440
Your mother must be very talented.

91
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,560
She's good at everything.

92
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,960
My mother is good at everything.

93
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,960
You too.

94
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,840
I'm not as good as her.

95
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,240
If I can choose,

96
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,600
maybe

97
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,850
she would prefer someone else to be her daughter.

98
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Who?

99
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,720
A thief.

100
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,800
When I was young,

101
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,050
I was jealous of her.

102
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,160
I think

103
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,360
she has nothing,

104
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,120
but she's so smart.

105
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,690
It took me three months to practice the piano.

106
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,480
She surpassed me in three days.

107
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,600
Compared to me,

108
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,880
than me.

109
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,920
Before,

110
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,600
I always thought

111
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,360
no matter what,

112
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,160
she's no match for me.

113
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,660
After all, I'm her biological daughter.

114
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Until that day,

115
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,360
I realized

116
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,440
I was wrong.

117
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,800
It turns out

118
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,120
a person can easily

119
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,560
just like that.

120
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,680
Do you hate her?

121
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,840
Who would forgive

122
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,760
someone who's trying to kill himself?

123
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,920
we won't let each other go.

124
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,320
Either I die or she dies.

125
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Don't worry.

126
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,930
Everything is done.

127
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,160
From Master's perspective,

128
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,440
Lady Ruan was framed.

129
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,440
She was innocent.

130
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
Now the money is ready.

131
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,700
and found a scapegoat.

132
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,040
to make the police report.

133
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Soon,

134
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,440
this matter will be settled.

135
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,640
Keep investigating.

136
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,200
We must find the killer.

137
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,760
Yes.

138
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,960
Whoever it is,

139
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,440
I must make him pay.

140
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,720
Okay.

141
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,640
Not yet.

142
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,600
We must find him.

143
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
Take care of it.

144
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,060
Baby pancakes.

145
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,600
Hey.

146
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,360
Let me see.

147
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,120
Don't move.

148
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,840
I wish you were really my sister.

149
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,640
Don't touch water in three days.

150
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,120
Thank you.
