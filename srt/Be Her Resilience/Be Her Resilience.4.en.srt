1
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,320
By the way,

2
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,039
you asked me to investigate her.

3
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,039
she was adopted by a fisherman.

4
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
But...

5
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,200
Just what?

6
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,280
That family didn't treat her well.

7
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,039
She'll get beaten up whenever she's hurt.

8
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,440
Life is tough.

9
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,100
Did I ask you to find out if she had a hard life?

10
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,160
I want to know

11
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
why she came back

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,479
to come back this time?

13
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,440
Since you suspect Lady Ruan,

14
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,840
why did you ask her to interfere in the engagement banquet?

15
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,360
Aren't you afraid she'll ruin it?

16
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,440
You need to keep dangerous things with you.

17
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,040
That's it. You can leave now.

18
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,560
Lady Ruoxi, this is the pipa.

19
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,360
Young Lady Yu Zhu asked you to send it to her for maintenance.

20
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,360
On the day of the banquet, she wants to play it herself.

21
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,440
Be careful.

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,040
This pipa

23
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,840
was left to her.

24
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,079
Her skills

25
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,360
You really live up to your cultivation.

26
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't break it.

27
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,600
This is my favorite pipa.

28
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,320
It's okay.

29
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,440
Here.

30
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,840
Do you like it?

31
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,680
Yes.

32
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,560
Try it.

33
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,329
Our lady doesn't like pipa.

34
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,090
It's a waste of your qin skills.

35
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,400
I didn't expect a new lady

36
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,880
to meet you.

37
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,720
Unfortunately, this new lady

38
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,440
Actually...

39
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:37,880
Hey.

40
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,840
Oh.

41
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,000
Miss, are you okay?

42
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,560
Why did you

43
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Why did you...

44
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,440
This is Miss Leng's favorite pipa.

45
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,360
What's going on?

46
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,840
Oh.

47
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,640
Miss Leng, don't worry.

48
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,840
I'll ask someone to change the strings.

49
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,840
You did it on purpose.

50
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,640
Yes, I don't like it.

51
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,800
I'm not happy.

52
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,840
Do you know

53
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,240
Mother made every string herself?

54
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,040
She mended every crack herself.

55
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,000
Go to the ancestral hall and kneel.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,400
and apologize to Mother.

57
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,040
A fake daughter

58
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,080
really regards other's mother as her own mother.

59
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,240
What did you say?

60
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,040
I said...

61
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,159
Darn it.

62
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,320
Mother.

63
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,240
When you abandoned me,

64
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,200
Have you ever thought

65
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,920
I would return to this mansion one day?

66
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,640
Huo Ran is so nice.

67
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,760
that you can abandon your own daughter

68
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,640
for her.

69
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,640
Do you want to hear

70
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,040
how I've been through these years?

71
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,680
When the train broke down,

72
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,440
I walked

73
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,520
walking in the wilderness.

74
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,240
He fainted in shock.

75
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,240
Fortunately,

76
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,810
There's a fishing village nearby.

77
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,480
A passing fisherman saved me.

78
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,000
Unexpectedly,

79
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,880
he sold me to a human trafficker.

80
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,210
and only got a bag of rough rice.

81
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,400
Can you add some?

82
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,280
This kind of little fool

83
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,600
It's worth it.

84
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,080
Get up.

85
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,280
Go.

86
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,880
Later,

87
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,360
I escaped.

88
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,880
Hello.

89
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,680
Okay.

90
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,000
Cross the bridge.

91
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,760
I fought with a wild dog for rotten rice.

92
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,800
When I was 12,

93
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,210
I learned to blackmail and steal wallets.

94
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,760
Stop!

95
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,840
Stop running.

96
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,440
I didn't shed a single tear

97
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,960
I didn't shed a single tear.

98
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,640
But every time

99
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,480
But every time I close my eyes,

100
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,000
I think of how you let go of my hand.

101
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,600
Mom, help me.

102
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Jiayu.

103
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,720
Huo Ran.

104
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,240
Mom.

105
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,840
But it's okay.

106
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,160
Now that I'm back,

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,800
I won't give up easily.

108
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,680
Sister.

109
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:44,020
Since that engagement is the most important to you,

110
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,200
I'll destroy it.

111
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,880
Boss.

112
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,600
Mr. Tang invited you to dinner when you're free.

113
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,040
Don't pretend to be a good son.

114
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,840
Exactly.

115
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,920
He saw us swallowing the Hong Gang.

116
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
to share the soup.

117
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,840
Fortunately, you arranged it in advance.

118
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,800
They will only see old scores

119
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,280
and trash.

120
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,880
Oh, right.

121
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,280
Huo family sent a letter

122
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
saying that the dress size

123
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
was lost by a servant.

124
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,920
Please go to the tailor shop

125
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,960
to try it on.

126
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,760
Try on the clothes.

127
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,490
Do I need to go in person?

128
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,880
Okay.

129
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,560
I'll tell Lady Ruan

130
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,600
to find a way.

131
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,840
Give it to me.

132
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,640
Mr. Wen, you are here.

133
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,840
Please.

134
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,610
When you broke into my warehouse that day,

135
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,540
when you broke into my warehouse.

136
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,440
Mr. Wen knows I'm a member of the Huo family.

137
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,560
He didn’t say he’s the son-in-law of the Huo family.

138
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,690
You just want to see my surprised face.

139
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,340
Since you're my brother-in-law,

140
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,640
you should be polite.

141
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,440
Your time is precious.

142
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,680
Let's start.

143
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,360
Are you scared?

144
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
I'll do it myself.

145
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,360
If you're thirsty,

146
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,810
I'll get you some water.

147
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,840
No need.

148
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,880
Who knows if you'll poison me in the water?

149
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,120
What did you do to me?

150
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Brother-in-law.

151
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,640
Don't you dare?

152
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,600
Thank you.

153
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
Brother-in-law.

154
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,880
Boss, what's wrong?

155
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,080
Bad news!

156
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,280
Bad news!

157
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,200
Something happened.

158
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,480
Song Jiayu.

159
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,040
Bastard!

160
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,960
If I put up with it,

161
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,280
people will look down upon us.

162
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,440
How can we face the Huo family in the future?

163
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,600
If you can't bear it,

164
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,840
Longhu Gang and Tang Jing will harm the Huo family.

165
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,000
Don't you understand

166
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,500
Don't you understand?

167
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,080
Don't think I'll treat you like my own daughter.

168
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,040
If you lose your value,

169
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,280
you know the consequences.

170
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,440
Humph.
