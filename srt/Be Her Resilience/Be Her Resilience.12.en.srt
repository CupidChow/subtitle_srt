1
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,920
You're late.

2
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,800
Father told you to practice with me.

3
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,280
That's your attitude.

4
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,160
Lady Ruan, I've asked around.

5
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,880
Everyone in the Huo family knows that

6
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,200
Young Lady Zhen Zhu never plays Go.

7
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,330
She hates it so much.

8
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,020
She was punished for that.

9
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,479
But even if she was flogged,

10
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,440
I still won't.

11
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,080
Maybe I'm really not gifted.

12
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,090
Why are you looking at me like that?

13
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,960
What?

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,000
Do you want me to comfort you?

15
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,360
Song Jiayu.

16
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,240
Do you think I'm your sister

17
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,479
I'm your sister?

18
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,320
I give up.

19
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,600
Never.

20
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,720
Mr. Huo is a good teacher.

21
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,079
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

22
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,760
Especially Jiayu.

23
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,560
has been separated for years,

24
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,400
but she's still a noble lady.

25
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,920
You're so delicate.

26
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,160
No matter how beautiful the flowers are,

27
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,680
it would be a pity

28
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,960
it would be a pity.

29
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,840
What do you think, Mr. Tang?

30
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,250
No matter the steps,

31
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,260
as long as we take the lead,

32
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,890
you can dance to the end.

33
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,490
Have you forgotten?

34
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,320
Waltz is a double dance.

35
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,840
At least in this dance,

36
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,680
We're not enemies. We're friends.

37
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,000
I'll get going.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,320
Practice on your own.

39
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,010
What about outside this dance?

40
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,920
Kneel.

41
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,360
Boss.

42
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,640
This man is mixed up

43
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,000
who prepared the birthday banquet for Mr. Tang.

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,880
is up to no good.

45
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,780
Let go of me!

46
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,120
Back then,

47
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,080
Longhu Gang was loyal.

48
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,340
I didn't expect

49
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,480
Now that you have a father,

50
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,040
and became Tang Jing's lackey.

51
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,200
So it was you

52
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,920
trying to assassinate Mr. Tang during the birthday banquet?

53
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,360
Tang Jing is a beast.

54
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,160
My daughter was so young.

55
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,400
he abducted her

56
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,800
and locked her in her room.

57
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,720
and tortured him to death.

58
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,160
Wen Liyan,

59
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,600
Even if you kill me,

60
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,080
even if you kill me.

61
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,600
Even if I become a ghost,

62
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,960
I won't let you go.

63
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,080
Who said I wanted to kill you?

64
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,600
I just...

65
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,280
give you a better chance

66
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,120
to kill him.

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,800
Everyone.

68
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,800
Today's banquet

69
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,740
Mr. Tang specially prepared a surprise for you.

70
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,440
Let's learn western

71
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,720
Let's have a masquerade.

72
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,360
Please find your partner.

73
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,960
Three minutes.

74
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,520
Yes, it's quite interesting.

75
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,050
I've never participated in

76
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,320
Jiayu.

77
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,680
Okay, time's up.

78
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,540
What a coincidence, Mr. Tang.

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,200
You asked me to dance.

80
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,600
What's your purpose?

81
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,760
Dance with the boss of the Dragon and Tiger Gang

82
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,760
Isn't that what all women want?

83
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,920
Then tell me

84
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,120
why have you been staring at your sister

85
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,480
from the beginning?

86
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,800
I see.

87
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,440
You want my fiancee

88
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,120
in public,

89
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,200
right?

90
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,480
Will you

91
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,680
help me?

92
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,080
Is the Jiayu

93
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,840
Jiayu?

94
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,800
Your wedding with Liyan

95
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,360
will be held soon.

96
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,280
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

97
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,120
Father.

98
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,880
My sister is still young.

99
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,600
It's nothing

100
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,200
is nothing.

101
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,520
But

102
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,040
you seem to care about

103
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,440
Do you

104
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,600
do you have other plans for her?

105
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,040
You'll find out later.

106
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,920
Hey.

107
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,960
Isn't this Ms Huo?

108
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,400
Why is she dancing with her sister's fiance?

109
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,200
Hush.

110
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Do you want to die?

111
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,400
Can't you see her face?

112
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,000
Wen Liyan.

113
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,720
Stay away from Song Jiayu.

114
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,760
She can't

115
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,880
to steal Huo Zhi Jie's goods.

116
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,520
after taking down Tang Jing.

117
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,570
You've been helping her

118
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,160
you've been helping her, right?

119
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,360
Ms Huo,

120
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,760
Who are you questioning me?

121
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,600
Young Lady Huo.

122
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,720
My fiancee.

123
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,360
or

124
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,120
who worries about her sister?

125
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,040
You know better than I do.

126
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,840
She's not like us.

127
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,360
Let's stop here.

128
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,160
Jiayu.

129
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,400
I haven't

130
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,120
for what happened last time.

131
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,520
Mr. Tang, you're welcome.

132
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,600
Mr. Tang,

133
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,320
in the future.

134
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:01,960
Yes.

135
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
We still have a lot of business to rely on you.

136
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,720
Okay.

137
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,980
There will be many chances in the future.

138
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,960
Jiayu.

139
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,760
Guards, catch him!

140
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,490
Are you okay?

141
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,800
Murder! Murder!

142
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,040
Help!

143
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,440
Get him!

144
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,680
Let's go.

145
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,130
I'll take care of it.

146
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,010
What's going on?

147
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,920
How could he hurt Lady Ruan by mistake?

148
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,520
Song Jiayu did it on purpose.

149
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,000
Why?

150
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,480
Sister.

151
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,600
You fell for it.

152
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,880
I knew it was you.

153
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,920
I don't understand what you're talking about.

154
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,960
Stop pretending.

155
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,360
I almost believed you.

156
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,720
Song Jiayu.

157
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,320
You're really capable.

158
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,010
You even dare to risk your life.

159
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,880
You're so smart.

160
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,800
Sister.

161
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,680
Why did you hide it from me?

162
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,160
Something happened.

163
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,440
Mr. Tang.

164
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,560
Mr. Tang said

165
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,400
to marry Lady Ruan.

166
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,040
What?
