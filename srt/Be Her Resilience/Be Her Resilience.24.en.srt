1
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,920
Father.

2
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,960
Did you sleep well?

3
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,080
Huo Ran.

4
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,920
You're still alive.

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,520
Maybe you're dead.

6
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,039
Stop playing tricks.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,400
The mortal world is not worth lingering on.

8
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,120
The Huo family is gone anyway.

9
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,720
What did you say?

10
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,480
Thanks to you,

11
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,330
I found out that there's still a batch of goods in the Huo family.

12
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,440
Falling down and scattered.

13
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,680
Without the backbone,

14
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,040
without the backbone.

15
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,079
How can he withstand the torture?

16
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,000
Guess

17
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,680
where the goods are now?

18
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,320
Evil!

19
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,120
Evil!

20
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,760
Evil!

21
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,720
At worst, we can start all over again.

22
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,120
I, Mount Huo Ting,

23
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,360
have nothing

24
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,960
to the peak of Yun City,

25
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,400
I will rise again someday.

26
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,560
You think you can defeat me?

27
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,730
Unfortunately,

28
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,480
There's no time.

29
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,720
The old friend is here.

30
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,280
She...

31
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,079
has been waiting for you.

32
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,400
Don't come near me.

33
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,220
Mount Huo Ting.

34
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,200
I want you to pay back

35
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,080
what you owe me.

36
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,960
Don't worry.

37
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,680
I won't kill you.

38
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,280
Death is relief.

39
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
And you

40
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,000
are destined to live in hell.

41
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,460
What are you afraid of?

42
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,800
That's how you treated me back then.

43
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,720
No.

44
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,640
It's not up to you.

45
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,400
It's over.

46
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Mom.

47
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,280
It's dawn.

48
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,520
Lady Ruan.

49
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,480
The prohibited drugs sold by Mount Huo Ting

50
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,760
has been destroyed.

51
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,290
Okay.

52
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,640
Don't move those trading lines for now.

53
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,080
I've contacted the provincial capital.

54
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,680
Once we get the evidence, we'll catch them all.

55
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,560
Remember.

56
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,200
Don't alert them.

57
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,240
Aunt Wang, how are things going over there?

58
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,360
Don't worry.

59
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,160
The Jiang family's foundation is still there.

60
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,080
Look.

61
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,200
This is an order from the hospital.

62
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,800
The price of the medicine

63
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,120
according to your order,

64
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,920
I just want to return the money, not for profit.

65
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,400
On the 15th day of every festival,

66
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,659
The old, weak, and disabled can receive medicine for free.

67
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,000
Good.

68
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,880
Businessmen

69
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,680
business is the most important.

70
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,280
Making money is not urgent.

71
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,280
There's a long way to go.

72
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,080
Lady Ruoxi.

73
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,120
My boss wants to see you.

74
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,840
Kill me.

75
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,040
You must be joking.

76
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,760
As a child,

77
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,880
How could you be so treacherous?

78
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,330
Mother has been here for half her life.

79
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,560
You can't stand it after just a few days.

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,920
Huo Ran.

81
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,560
Do you think Song Jiayu

82
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,240
really tolerate you?

83
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,520
One day,

84
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,600
she will take everything away from you.

85
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,560
Power.

86
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,400
Wealth.

87
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
status,

88
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,080
how to share

89
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,400
with others?

90
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,540
You don't have to wait until that day.

91
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,280
If she wants it,

92
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,120
I will give it to her.

93
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,440
Time's up.

94
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,240
Take care of Master.

95
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,680
Thank you.

96
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,600
For what?

97
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,159
All.

98
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,400
You're not used to

99
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,480
to threaten me.

100
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,159
There's no need to thank me.

101
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,640
We meet each other

102
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,520
Meeting you

103
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,360
to meet you.

104
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,460
You're leaving Yuncheng?

105
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,200
The Dragon and Tiger Gang was born for justice.

106
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,280
Master's wish is to save the world.

107
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,080
Although Longhu Gang is in charge of Yun City now,

108
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,480
it's hard for them to stand on their feet.

109
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,060
I can't fulfill my master's wish.

110
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,400
So I plan to study abroad.

111
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,360
When I return,

112
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,280
I plan to run industries in Yuncheng.

113
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,440
and do more things.

114
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,520
I believe

115
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,920
you can do it.

116
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,400
Song Jiayu,

117
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,120
How about I give you the casino of Longhu Gang?

118
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,200
I heard you're running a Women's Academy.

119
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,919
How is it?

120
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,480
I dare not accept such a big gift.

121
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,679
Or I'll owe you too much.

122
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,580
What about Huo Ran?

123
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,740
Aren't you afraid?

124
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,159
I owe her too much?

125
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,200
She owes me too.

126
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,960
I'm afraid I'll have to settle this for the rest of my life.

127
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,640
The 19-year-old Song Jiayu

128
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,800
I've returned

129
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,320
when I was 25.

130
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,960
Life is vast.

131
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,360
You and I

132
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,240
take care.

133
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,520
See you.

134
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,680
See you.

135
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,900
You're so naughty.

136
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,400
You're amazing.

137
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,690
You've always liked these flowers and plants since you were young.

138
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,340
If I didn't come to the Huo family,

139
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,880
I might have become a gardener.

140
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,880
Sister.

141
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,680
Are you really not going to

142
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,320
about business anymore?

143
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,080
What?

144
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,760
You said you wanted to be me.

145
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,680
I have the power.

146
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,760
Young Lady Yu Zhu is unhappy now?

147
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,920
Sister.

148
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,400
Jiayu.

149
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:27,880
Yes.

150
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,720
I'm really tired these years.

151
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,080
I'm counting on you.

152
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,120
Even so,

153
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,880
I have a new job.

154
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,720
You can't refuse it.

155
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,800
This is...

156
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,320
Get ready to be the principal.

157
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,520
Young Lady Yu Zhu, hurry.

158
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,920
It's the auspicious time.

159
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,440
Okay.

160
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,880
Miss, the new batch of medicine is here.

161
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,520
Okay, wait over there.

162
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,440
Okay.

163
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,880
This batch of goods must be dealt with within this week.

164
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,960
Ouch!

165
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,560
Women are like men.

166
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,360
Only strong physical strength can achieve great things.

167
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,120
Go on.

168
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Sister.

169
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Class is over.

170
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,440
Class is over.

171
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,010
Wen Liyan is leaving today.

172
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,040
might be on that ship.

173
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,130
I wish the children of Yuncheng

174
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,760
can set foot on a long journey someday.

175
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,320
With us,

176
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,160
that day will come.

177
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
Teacher.

178
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,120
Play with us.

179
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,160
Let's play together.

180
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,140
It's the sound of the ship.

181
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,240
Where are they going?

182
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,760
Yeah, where will they go?

183
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,280
To a bigger world.

184
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,640
Will that world be better?

185
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,800
Yes.

186
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,880
As long as you're here,
