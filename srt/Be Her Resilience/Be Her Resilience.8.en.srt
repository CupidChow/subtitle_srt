1
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,320
Sister

2
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,880
I'm not feeling well.

3
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,759
Yes.

4
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,080
Here.

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,800
Slowly.

6
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,960
Okay.

7
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,890
Open your mouth.

8
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,360
Is it sweet?

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,800
Sister.

10
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,400
Your medicine is quite effective.

11
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,240
It doesn't hurt anymore.

12
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,820
As long as it works.

13
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,880
But

14
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,920
the smell of this medicine is quite special.

15
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,079
I heard

16
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,720
a rich family used to find famous doctors to make medicine.

17
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,400
The medicine is unique.

18
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,720
It's hard to copy.

19
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,120
For example,

20
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,780
the Huo family.

21
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,079
Have you heard of it?

22
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,810
They must have been cheated by the clinic.

23
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,720
There are thousands of herbs.

24
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,400
There's always something similar.

25
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,560
For example, Astragalus and pea root

26
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,250
have the smell of beans.

27
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,760
The unique smell is just a gimmick.

28
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,680
Really?

29
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,800
If you're interested,

30
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,600
I'll take you to the clinic later.

31
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,880
Okay.

32
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,200
I heard

33
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,840
there's a snack shop next to the clinic.

34
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,410
The orange red cake inside is very delicious.

35
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,079
If there's a chance

36
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,600
let's try it together.

37
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,680
I'll get ready.

38
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,040
Let's eat later.

39
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,680
Okay.

40
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,560
Sister

41
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,400
Sister

42
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,200
Sister.

43
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,340
I didn't have time to take this medicine.

44
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
Sister.

45
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,600
Sister

46
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,080
Sister.

47
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,640
I'll get you some medicine.

48
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,800
There's water.

49
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,640
And doctor.

50
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,120
Jiayu.

51
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,130
Don't be afraid.

52
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,159
Go back to your room and rest.

53
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,600
I'm fine.

54
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,640
Just a moment.

55
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,320
I'll accompany you.

56
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,720
Don't be afraid of the small boat.

57
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,760
Don't be afraid of the wave

58
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,720
Harder

59
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,600
Shake

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,160
Shake over the previous village

61
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,000
and crossed the bridge.

62
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,280
Miss.

63
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
The opium you destroyed on purpose

64
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,960
Some ungrateful traitor informed Master.

65
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Fortunately, our men have caught him.

66
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,880
We just need you to deal with him yourself.

67
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,680
Okay.

68
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,960
Sister.

69
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,520
Jiayu.

70
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,040
Jiayu.

71
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,560
Jiayu.

72
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,720
Jiayu.

73
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,160
Aunt Wang, thank you for your help last time.

74
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,720
Jiayu, don't worry.

75
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,200
I've infiltrated the Huo family to work.

76
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,280
From now on,

77
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,680
in the future.

78
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,800
Thank you.

79
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,850
I found the person who hurt you.

80
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,880
Huo Ran.

81
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,840
It's not her.

82
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,560
Yes.

83
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,560
Oh, right.

84
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,680
He might be able to help you.

85
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,200
Yes.

86
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,820
Since you're Aunt Wang's friend,

87
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,960
I will definitely help you.

88
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,120
As far as I know,

89
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,120
Young Master Huo is short of money recently.

90
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Short of money?

91
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,080
Yes.

92
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,760
His older sister

93
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,160
Huo Ran is a great character.

94
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,440
I don't know how to persuade Master Huo.

95
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,880
to cut half of Young Master Huo's daily expenses.

96
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,400
Now he has a lot of money.

97
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,360
No wonder he wandered around the casino.

98
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,840
So he lost money.

99
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,880
Boss.

100
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,880
Someone saw Young Lady Yu Zhu at our casino.

101
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,880
Yes.

102
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,680
I heard

103
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,140
Young Master Huo stocked up a batch of goods.

104
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,200
waiting to turn the tide.

105
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,760
But

106
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,640
this is not what I can find out.

107
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,800
Maybe...

108
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,680
in the VIP room,

109
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,440
in the VIP room?

110
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,400
Yes, you.

111
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,560
Mr. Huo, you're here.

112
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
This way, please.

113
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,880
No.

114
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,080
He was alone just now.

115
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,640
Mr. Huo, you're mistaken.

116
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,200
I'm the only one here.

117
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,400
Move.

118
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,920
I want to see

119
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,200
who the blind servant

120
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,960
dare to show off in front of me?

121
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,520
Come out!

122
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,480
Zhijie!

123
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Brother-in-law.

124
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,880
Don't be so angry.

125
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,680
Who do you want

126
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,200
Who do you want to get out of here?

127
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,120
No, no, brother-in-law.

128
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,570
I have something to do. I have to go.

129
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,880
Stop!

130
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,920
Lady Ruan.

131
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,040
Why are you leaving

132
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,440
without saying goodbye?

133
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,400
Aren't you going to

134
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,000
say thank you to me?

135
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,650
Did you find him?

136
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,800
I got in touch with an informant.

137
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,130
He said he knows where Young Lady Yu Zhu is.

138
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,920
Miss Leng.

139
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,120
If it's a trap,

140
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,450
even if it's only one in a thousand,

141
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,120
I'll go.

142
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,000
These days,

143
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,180
I've been looking for you.

144
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,800
Why?

145
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,720
I don't remember we were so close.

146
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,240
Why?

147
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
What do you think?

148
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,480
I haven't settled

149
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,360
you owe me.

150
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,320
What is it?

151
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,560
That day,

152
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,400
you put the medicine on my neck.

153
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,080
Am I right?

154
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,960
Do you have evidence?

155
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
Brother-in-law.

156
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,120
It's not my turn to pay for your love debt.

157
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,760
If there's nothing else,

158
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,980
I'll get going.

159
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,960
Song Jiayu.

160
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,920
You can't leave.

161
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,000
From now on,

162
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,320
you just need to step out of here.

163
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
Huo Ran.

164
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,400
will be informed immediately.

165
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,120
So,

166
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,480
Whether to leave or stay,

167
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,040
you choose.

168
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,600
You...

169
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,040
Okay.

170
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,360
I'll stay.

171
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,080
From now on,

172
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,200
I want you to obey me.

173
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,200
Yes, sir.
