1
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,400
Take me with you this time.

2
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,520
to pick up my master's ashes

3
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,920
and return to the Dragon and Tiger Clan.

4
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,039
is the top priority.

5
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,560
Tang Jing's words are a bit strange.

6
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,360
You stay in Yuncheng.

7
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,120
By the way,

8
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,640
have you found anything?

9
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,600
Not yet.

10
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,880
Tell me as soon as you hear anything.

11
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:35,080
Aren't you going to tell Lady Ruan yourself?

12
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,400
No need. I'll be back.

13
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,200
Are you sure it's this place?

14
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,240
Of course.

15
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,200
This place is expensive.

16
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,800
It must be the best in Yuncheng.

17
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,880
Don't worry. I have money.

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,560
Hush.

19
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,360
Lady Ruoxi.

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,560
These are new arrivals.

21
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,540
Take your time.

22
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,480
I'll leave you alone.

23
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,280
Thank you.

24
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,560
These are for me.

25
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,600
Yes.

26
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,720
You're still young

27
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,560
How old are you

28
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,800
You always wear such a dull color.

29
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,800
I'm ten years older.

30
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,340
How can I convince the people if I don't look mature?

31
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,160
That's Young Lady Huo.

32
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,680
Today,

33
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,020
You're just my sister.

34
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,640
Try it.

35
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,560
Please.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,800
A surprise.

37
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,600
Jiayu.

38
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,400
Jiayu.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,600
Jiayu, you...

40
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,200
Song Jiayu.

41
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,520
You won't succeed with me around.

42
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,320
Money and money are so boring.

43
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,520
Power is the best honor for women.

44
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,560
Aren't you the same?

45
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,320
Huo Ran.

46
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,320
I want to be you.

47
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,280
You look

48
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,520
in this dress.

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,200
What about me?

50
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,580
You're pretty too.

51
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,000
Looking at you like this,

52
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,720
we're like real sisters.

53
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,640
Since a long time ago,

54
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,160
we were already.

55
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,320
Whatever you like,

56
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,920
will be given 50% off.

57
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,640
The difference is on my account.

58
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,720
Remember, don't let it slip.

59
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,760
Yes.

60
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,120
If that's the case,

61
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,159
why don't you just give her a free meal?

62
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:48,840
You...

63
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,100
You don't understand.

64
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,480
It's a gift my sister saved up to buy.

65
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,440
How can I disappoint you?

66
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,970
Where are we going next?

67
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,800
You'll know soon.

68
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,560
Boss, we're here.

69
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,000
Hello

70
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,130
Let's sort out our clothes.

71
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,320
You two are so close.

72
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,640
Of course.

73
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,400
I'm ready.

74
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,400
Let's start.

75
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,320
Come on.

76
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,360
A little to the left.

77
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,960
Yes, a little to the left.

78
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,440
A little to the left.

79
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,360
To the left.

80
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
Sister

81
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,159
A fisherwoman?

82
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,960
You really are a liar.

83
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,760
You lied to me too.

84
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,720
Yes.

85
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
The owner of the clothing store.

86
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,000
knows you, right?

87
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,280
Or

88
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,000
you're the boss.

89
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,520
Cough.

90
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,040
I knew it.

91
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,120
How could it be so cheap?

92
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,440
You grew up here.

93
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,160
Yes.

94
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,200
also...

95
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,600
No.

96
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,720
After we separated that year,

97
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,120
I went around

98
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,480
and wandered around.

99
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,720
I learned some skills

100
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
to make a living.

101
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,320
But later,

102
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,400
I made some friends.

103
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,440
From then on,

104
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,340
I feel much better.

105
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,520
I'll stay here

106
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,800
for a long time.

107
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,560
But to me,

108
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,280
this is just a rest place.

109
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,490
So is the Huo family.

110
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,130
I don't have a home anymore.

111
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,970
Have you forgotten?

112
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,880
You did.

113
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,490
From the beginning.

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,760
I prepared this for you.

115
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,760
Sister.

116
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,680
Sister

117
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,120
Yesterday...

118
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,860
One needle.

119
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,800
Just give me one more shot.

120
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,080
Sister.

121
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,720
You're addicted.

122
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,760
You can't rely on it anymore.

123
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Don't be controlled by him anymore.

124
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,680
Don't cry.

125
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,960
I promise you.

126
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,520
I'm here.

127
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,320
no one can hurt you.

128
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,160
Even yourself.

129
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,280
I will find the antidote for you.

130
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,650
Boss, we have a clue.

131
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,120
The operation in the provincial capital was so fast

132
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,920
because

133
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,160
the evidence you and Miss Leng have is solid.

134
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
On the other hand,

135
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,760
Say it.

136
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,960
Tang Jing has been stalked.

137
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,200
Over the years,

138
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,240
a mysterious man named Lei Yu Sheng

139
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,300
is collecting evidence of Tang Jing.

140
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,400
And the evidence he provided is confidential.

141
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,200
That's why

142
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,320
to stab Tang Jing's vital point.

143
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,240
It seems that this person has a good relationship with Tang Jing.

144
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,040
And he is cautious.

145
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,440
and can't find any evidence.

146
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,440
Lei Yu Sheng.

147
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,760
Ting.

148
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,920
Mount Huo.

149
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,280
That makes sense.

150
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,100
The evidence Ms Huo brought last time

151
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,580
was provided by Huo Ting Shan on purpose.

152
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,200
Send this message to them.

153
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,200
Yes.

154
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,640
You did well.

155
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,000
Thank you, Master.

156
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,000
Lady Ruoxi, where are you going?

157
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,860
The Huo family.

158
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,680
The gap between Huo Ran is getting shorter.

159
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,320
I must go to the Huo family

160
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,450
to get the antidote.

161
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,120
Lady Ruoxi, you can't go.

162
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,880
Why?

163
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,220
Why did you come in?

164
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,560
Something bad happened.

165
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,000
Before Boss left,

166
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,400
he asked me to investigate the person behind Tang Jing.

167
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,330
I'm afraid Huo Ting Shan had a plan.

168
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
All these years, he has been disguised as Lei Yu Sheng

169
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,340
and secretly reported Tang Jing.

170
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,320
I didn't expect

171
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,920
he got this position so soon.

172
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,000
What a coincidence.

173
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,080
Miss Leng and Lady Ruoxi are both here.

174
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,440
I'm here to pick you up by Master's order.

175
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,800
to go home.

176
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,760
It's late.

177
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,500
Maybe another day.

178
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,680
You're right, Young Lady. You're right, Young Lady. You're right, Young Lady. You're right.

179
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,560
However,

180
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,080
if I can't take you home safely,

181
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,160
I'm afraid I can't

182
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,920
can't explain to Master.

183
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,160
It's getting late.

184
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,360
Let's go.

185
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,570
It's good that you're back.

186
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,560
There's been a riot in Yuncheng lately.

187
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,020
It's not safe everywhere.

188
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,370
You're not home.

189
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,000
I felt a string in my heart.

190
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,400
I can't sleep well no matter how I sleep.

191
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,840
Really?

192
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,560
I thought we weren't home.

193
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,720
when we weren't home.

194
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,840
Kayu.

195
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,560
I

196
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,600
I'm sorry.

197
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,240
Tang Jing threatened you

198
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,600
threatened you with the lives of the Huo family

199
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,240
and insisted on marrying you.

200
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,200
I had no choice.

201
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,120
I can only marry you

202
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,640
and delay it.

203
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,240
and find a way

204
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,760
to bring you back to the Huo family.

205
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,920
I'm sorry

206
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,440
I'm sorry.

207
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,200
I'm incompetent.

208
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,160
I made you suffer.

209
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,000
You're too modest.

210
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,960
How can you be incompetent?

211
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,280
If you're not capable,

212
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,600
how can you become the new minister of Yuncheng so soon?
