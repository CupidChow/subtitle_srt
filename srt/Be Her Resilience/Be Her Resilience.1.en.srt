1
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,840
He's here.

2
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,480
Who is it?

3
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,039
You again?

4
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,080
I left my stuff at your house.

5
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,480
I'll leave when I find it.

6
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,960
I said I didn't see it.

7
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,220
Don't you understand?

8
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,400
Please!

9
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,880
I lost my jade pendant.

10
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,479
Let me go in and look for it.

11
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,880
I'll leave when I find it.

12
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,479
It's just a blood transfusion.

13
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,160
Are you relying on the Huo family?

14
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,690
Get lost!

15
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,320
Please.

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,600
I just need to find my own things.

17
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,160
Go away.

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,160
Let go!

19
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,520
Please.

20
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,960
Let go!

21
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,400
I just want to find my jade pendant.

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,160
I beg you.

23
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,400
Let go!

24
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,360
Shut up!

25
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,000
My lady.

26
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,280
This woman is crazy.

27
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,080
She just came to donate her blood to Master.

28
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,560
He said he lost the jade pendant.

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,920
and insisted on looking for it.

30
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,560
Look.

31
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,680
My mother gave me that jade pendant before she died.

32
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,760
Open the door.

33
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,640
Don't you understand?

34
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,400
Yes.

35
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,440
Thank you.

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,520
Is it enough?

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,560
Oh.

38
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,140
It seems not enough

39
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,880
Is that enough?

40
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,440
I'm not lying.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,860
I've seen a lot of people like you.

42
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,730
I'm warning you.

43
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,040
Don't imagine things that don't belong to you.

44
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,570
I only want my jade pendant.

45
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
If I can't find it,

46
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,640
I'll leave immediately.

47
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,280
Do you think I'll believe you?

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Looks like

49
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,280
you're being hard on me.

50
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,440
Let go of me!

51
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,280
My lady.

52
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,560
Please let her go.

53
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,240
Why?

54
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,400
Because

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,920
Master is awake.

56
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,440
He wants to see his own daughter.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Lady Ruan.

58
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,360
Long time no see.

59
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,160
Welcome home.

60
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,920
We meet again.

61
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,900
Have you forgotten me?

62
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,080
And I

63
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,640
still thinking about you.

64
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
Sister.

65
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,440
Hurry up.

66
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,440
This is what the future master's wife wants.

67
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,240
Hurry up.

68
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,960
Hurry up. Over there.

69
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,640
Gently. Gently.

70
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,560
Hurry up.

71
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,640
Hurry up!

72
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,040
Ms Huo.

73
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,840
You are...

74
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,370
Send a message to Wen Liyan.

75
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,040
He doesn’t even know

76
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,480
his Dragon Tiger Gang.

77
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,760
Yes.

78
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:37,800
Follow me.

79
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,480
How dare you touch Huo's stuff?

80
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,200
Huo Ran, you'll die a horrible death.

81
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,440
Really?

82
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,880
Too bad you can't see it.

83
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,480
What are you doing?

84
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,760
The rope fell off.

85
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,040
Get rid of it.

86
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,520
Yes.

87
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,200
Let's go.

88
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,880
Thank you.

89
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,360
If it weren't for you,

90
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,840
I would have been crushed by the train.

91
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,680
I am a businessman.

92
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,640
I did some small business to make a living.

93
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,280
If Huo Ran hadn't gone too far,

94
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,740
and lowering the price in the name of the Huo family,

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,720
I...

96
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,240
I wouldn't have...

97
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,560
Thank you for saving my life.

98
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,800
I will never forget.

99
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,760
One day,

100
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,040
I'll pay you back.

101
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,400
One day,

102
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,200
will be today.

103
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,640
Huo Zhi Jie,

104
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,520
Go ahead.

105
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,280
I hate you.

106
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,600
I hate you.

107
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,240
Huo Ran.

108
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,120
I like it

109
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,440
I like, love, love

110
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,919
You're always noisy.

111
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,000
Look at you.

112
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,400
Master, you don't understand.

113
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,440
They are close.

114
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,120
Ran.

115
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,040
Ran.

116
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,480
How was your trip to the dock today?

117
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,220
Everything went well.

118
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,760
Sorry to disappoint you.

119
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,680
Huo Zhi Jie.

120
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,280
You gave him the money, didn't you?

121
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,760
I...

122
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,840
Brother, I have a suggestion.

123
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,740
If you want to inquire about shipping next time,

124
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,280
don't go there yourself.

125
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,560
Father, don't worry.

126
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,040
Although the information was leaked,

127
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,240
I've taken care of it.

128
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,520
Aunt Mei.

129
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,240
Yes.

130
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,840
Take the money to buy a dress.

131
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,160
Zhi Jie.

132
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Give the goods to your sister.

133
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,280
Ran.

134
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,560
Thank you.

135
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,700
But no matter how busy you are,

136
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,160
take care of yourself.

137
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,880
Yes.

138
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,640
Father.

139
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,730
Did you take care of him?

140
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,680
He didn't die.

141
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,440
He was saved.

142
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,480
What?

143
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,540
Please come in.

144
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,940
Take care, Mr. Huo.

145
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,160
Huo Ting Shan, die!

146
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,680
Catch him!

147
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,840
Master.

148
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,360
How could you leave Ying'er behind?

149
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,480
Everyone.

150
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
My master needs blood urgently.

151
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,800
Please help him.

152
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,840
I promise

153
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,060
as long as the blood can match,

154
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,360
five silver dollars.

155
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,600
I won't lie to you.

156
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,840
Mr. Huo seems to be badly injured.

157
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,360
It costs so much blood.

158
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,040
I can't afford it.

159
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,530
Ten silver dollars.

160
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
She's coming.

161
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,200
No.

162
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,280
I don't want to.

163
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,000
Are you crazy?

164
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,360
Little girl.

165
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,000
I feed you and feed you.

166
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,560
and make some money.

167
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,840
Stop dawdling.

168
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,280
Behave yourself.

169
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,360
Just smoke.

170
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,100
She's thick-skinned. She's not afraid of pain.

171
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,240
Let's go.

172
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Go!

173
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,840
What's wrong with that fisherwoman?

174
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,600
Why are there two ladies?

175
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,480
You're late.

176
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,280
It's normal that you don't know.

177
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,480
Actually, Ms Huo

178
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,560
was adopted by Her Ladyship.

179
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,040
Ah.

180
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,280
Back then, Madam thought

181
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,040
she was the only child at home.

182
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,640
I was afraid you would be bored.

183
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,800
So I found a girl who is about the same age

184
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
to play with you.

185
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,480
Why is there only one left?

186
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,240
I don't know the details.

187
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,480
I think it's a disaster.

188
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,400
Her wife escaped from death.

189
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,000
and carried only one girl back.

190
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,800
and passed away soon.

191
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,880
This has always been the pain in Master's heart.

192
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,200
Don't mention it again.

193
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,920
Okay.

194
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,200
I didn't expect

195
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,240
Ms Huo is usually fierce

196
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,800
is a fake daughter.

197
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,280
Do you think this fisher girl is real?

198
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,680
I really don't know.

199
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,400
I only know that

200
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,330
the Huo Mansion is going to change.

201
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,560
Miss.

202
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,320
Young Lady.

203
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,040
What is this?

204
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,400
Miss,

205
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,720
Madam asked me to...

206
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,560
Miss.

207
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,280
I'll give you a decent dress.

208
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,040
Meizing.

209
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,040
Give it to me.

210
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,210
But Madam told me...

211
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,000
Yes.
