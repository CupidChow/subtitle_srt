1
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,720
Besides,

2
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,080
aren't we partners?

3
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,440
Shouldn't partners

4
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,800
say everything you know?

5
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,080
Yes.

6
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,560
Can you do me another favor?

7
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,960
Okay.

8
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,000
I haven't said what it is yet.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,960
Whatever it is.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,039
That's my answer.

11
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,960
Yes.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,860
I want you to ask Huo Ran out for me.

13
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,080
If I ask her out,

14
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,050
she wouldn't want to see me.

15
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,120
Yes.

16
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,960
Wen Liyan, what's the matter?

17
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,500
I should have known it was you.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,360
I'll give you some time.

19
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,520
Do you hate me?

20
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,760
If I say no,

21
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,680
Do you believe me?

22
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:23,880
Huo Ran.

23
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,800
I really hate you.

24
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,079
It's good.

25
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,840
Continue to hate me.

26
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:37,340
Don't you have anything else to say to me?

27
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,400
Shoot me.

28
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,640
As you wish.

29
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,440
What?

30
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,100
I'm surprised.

31
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,960
That day at the casino,

32
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,440
there was no bullet in your gun.

33
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,120
Huo Ran.

34
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,880
Are you not willing to explain to me?

35
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,560
Am I so untrustworthy?

36
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,040
Your plan is flawless.

37
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,800
I just need to be a fool and everything will be fine.

38
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,640
But you never asked me

39
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,170
whether I'm willing or not.

40
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,100
What about you?

41
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,800
Have you ever cared about me?

42
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,840
You were reckless and reckless.

43
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,000
You knew it was dangerous,

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,120
yet you still dare to risk your life.

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,120
How many lives do you think you have?

46
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,040
It's none of my business

47
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,300
is none of my business.

48
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,120
I just want you to live.

49
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,480
If you live,

50
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,720
is me.

51
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,360
If you die,

52
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,240
what's the point of doing all this?

53
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,159
Even if I die,

54
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,880
even if I die.

55
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,000
and fight for the family property with you.

56
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,480
Don't worry.

57
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,400
We can meet again.

58
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,680
If you die,

59
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,520
I won't look at you one more time.

60
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,680
I'll throw you into the river

61
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,570
into the river to feed the fish.

62
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,280
I'm a man of my word.

63
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,240
So,

64
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,240
you can't die.

65
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,640
I knew you wouldn't kill me.

66
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,760
Are you laughing at me?

67
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,480
I don't know.

68
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,159
Maybe I just want you to forgive me.

69
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,040
In this world,

70
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,480
in this world.

71
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,360
One is my mom.

72
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,600
It's you.

73
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,920
Huo Ran.

74
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,640
Do you hate me?

75
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,760
I hated many people,

76
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,960
but I never hated you.

77
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,960
Let's try again.

78
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,760
It's raining today.

79
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
It won't be dawn.

80
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,280
Then tomorrow.

81
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,570
The day after tomorrow.

82
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,130
The day after tomorrow.

83
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,880
The sun will come out one day.

84
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,040
Try again.

85
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,440
Live until dawn with me.

86
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,720
Okay.

87
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,520
Master.

88
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,900
When Tang Jing went in,

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,600
they all changed their faces.

90
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,560
Our orders are all gone.

91
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,960
I gave him so much money in vain.

92
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,640
to be a servant and careful.

93
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,080
Now they are all dead.

94
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,000
You bastard!

95
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,340
Father, calm down.

96
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,300
We can talk about business again.

97
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,080
But if you get hacked,

98
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,940
it'll be hard to turn over.

99
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,440
What do you mean?

100
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,000
The most important thing now

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,800
is to cut ties with Tang Jing

102
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,250
so that people can see the Huo family's attitude.

103
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
Yes.

104
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,800
You're right.

105
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,920
Guards!

106
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,560
Find everything related.

107
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,520
Burn the fire.

108
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,840
Father, don't worry.

109
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,080
Leave this to me.

110
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,320
Huo Ran.

111
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,920
The Huo family can't live without you.

112
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,480
It's you.

113
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,240
What?

114
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,840
Did I disappoint you?

115
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,080
It's time to eat something good.

116
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,200
You old man.

117
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,760
It's not long.

118
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,000
The dog that bites doesn't bark.

119
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,440
It seems

120
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,920
It's not bad.

121
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,720
Tang Jing,

122
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,920
I advise you to take a closer look.

123
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,440
Is it a wolf or a dog?

124
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,600
You ungrateful jerk.

125
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,440
I shouldn't have given you food.

126
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,360
I'm ungrateful.

127
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,960
What kindness?

128
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,820
What kindness?

129
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,840
I'm afraid...

130
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,320
you are the only one

131
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,880
is you.

132
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,400
Lieutenant Li.

133
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,280
to go through thick and thin with you.

134
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,410
and never leave you.

135
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,240
to help you get along.

136
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,840
and take care of everything.

137
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,810
treat you like a living Buddha.

138
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,080
Why?

139
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,680
Because you treat other's daughter's leg disease.

140
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,400
the medicine never stops.

141
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,280
But he didn't know

142
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,840
you asked someone to cripple his daughter's leg.

143
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,000
So what?

144
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,320
We need to use the stick to train the dog.

145
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,800
Aren't you afraid that this will be exposed?

146
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,720
Go ahead.

147
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,000
Let's see

148
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,520
whether he trusts you

149
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,240
or me?

150
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,320
Besides,

151
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,920
So what if I know?

152
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,610
It's been so many years.

153
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,080
can she leave my medicine?

154
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,800
Ruyan.

155
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,120
Remember,

156
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,500
no matter how capable you are,

157
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,480
even if you're capable.

158
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,840
Okay.

159
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,440
Let's wait and see.

160
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,240
Let's see

161
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,560
who will win.

162
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,360
Mr. Wen,

163
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,840
I was blind

164
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,960
I was deceived by him for so long.

165
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,280
Please save my daughter.

166
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,360
Take this ticket.

167
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,810
I've contacted the best doctor

168
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,570
the best doctor abroad.

169
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,000
Take your daughter abroad tomorrow morning.

170
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,840
Thank you, Young Master.

171
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,240
Thank you, Young Master.

172
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,440
About what you said before,

173
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,160
what you said before.

174
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,360
Boss.

175
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,400
Ms Huo sent something.

176
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,970
There's no need to wait.

177
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,680
Mr. Tang won't come back.

178
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,480
But don't worry.

179
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,140
As long as you are willing,

180
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,800
Longhu Gang will always have a place for you.

181
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,040
Think about it.

182
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,800
Let's see who dares

183
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,170
make such a big fuss.

184
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,060
Aren't you afraid of attracting the police?

185
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,770
Are you talking about them?

186
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,080
Mr. Tang.

187
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,920
This is a misunderstanding.

188
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,050
Misunderstanding?

189
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,860
Since this is your family matter,

190
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,000
we'll leave now.

191
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,460
We won't get involved.

192
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,840
Let's go.

193
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,480
Hurry.

194
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,960
Do you really think

195
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,560
I would put all my chips

196
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,360
on a lieutenant.

197
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,280
Ruyan.

198
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,120
I told you

199
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,140
no matter how capable you are,

200
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,560
you'll still have my blood.

201
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,200
This is your last chance.

202
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
I'll forgive you if I admit my mistake.

203
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,800
Otherwise, you'll bear the consequences.

204
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,840
Wen Liyan,

205
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,000
As long as this position is still here,

206
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,720
Yuncheng is my world.

207
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,320
Oh, really?

208
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Really?

209
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,640
What if you're fired?

210
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
Mr. Tang.

211
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,250
Ridiculous.

212
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,460
If I'm not the minister, who is the minister?

213
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,240
New telegram from the provincial government.

214
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,200
Tang Jing has a bad conduct.

215
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,680
He took bribes and disregarded the law.

216
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,440
Therefore, he was removed from the position of General Manager of Business Department of Yun City.

217
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,320
Immediately effective.
