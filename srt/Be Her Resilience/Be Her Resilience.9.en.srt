1
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,400
Okay, I'll stay.

2
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
Song Jiayu.

3
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,720
Is this how you obey everything?

4
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,760
You're quick.

5
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,280
Here.

6
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,920
What do you want?

7
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,280
I'm going to ruin this deal.

8
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,000
Let Huo Zhi Jie pay the price! Make way!

9
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,600
Let Huo Zhi Jie pay the price.

10
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,120
Let's make a bet.

11
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,040
I won once.

12
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,800
Please help me.

13
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,120
What if you lose?

14
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,880
you can punish me.

15
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,720
Why should I bet with you?

16
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,360
You dare not?

17
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,280
It's settled then.

18
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,320
Tell me, where is she?

19
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,160
Young Lady Zhen Zhu.

20
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,320
There is no such thing as a free message.

21
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,079
Yes.

22
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,880
Oh, these...

23
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,600
Either say or die.

24
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,920
My lady, I was wrong.

25
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,360
Young Lady Zhen Zhu, the money...

26
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,520
I don't want the money.

27
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,240
I'll give it back to you.

28
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,240
No need. Save it for the coffin.

29
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,080
Brother-in-law, thank you.

30
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,280
Lady Ruan won this round.

31
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,200
I lost.

32
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,880
Mr. Wen wins this round.

33
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,120
The last one.

34
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,800
You first.

35
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,680
Boss, Ms Huo is looking for someone.

36
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,240
It seems that you only care about hatred.

37
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,800
Or this sister...

38
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,680
You only care about profit.

39
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You're right.

40
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,000
I only care about interests.

41
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,850
Do you want to continue?

42
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,920
It's not the end yet.

43
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,640
We don't know who will win.

44
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,080
I won.

45
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,240
Lady Ruan won this round.

46
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,640
You cheated.

47
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,730
The rules are not set. There are no taboos.

48
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,360
You...

49
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,600
You lost.

50
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,120
I agree to your terms.

51
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,720
Thank you, brother-in-law.

52
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,120
Boss.

53
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,520
You obviously treat Lady Ruan differently.

54
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,580
How could you tolerate her cheating?

55
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,760
I don't think you're interested in

56
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,800
I want the goods.

57
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
She wants people.

58
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,580
and get what she needs.

59
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,080
Why not?

60
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,720
Come on.

61
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,360
Place your bets.

62
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,240
Big, big, big.

63
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,720
Room 112.

64
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,840
We won.

65
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,840
No way.

66
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,040
Impossible.

67
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,320
Again.

68
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,480
Mr. Huo,

69
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,200
Why don't you pay your debt first?

70
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,120
Who are you?

71
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,480
Hey.

72
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,370
You are the young master of the Huo family.

73
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,920
I'm a businessman from Nanyang.

74
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,520
I'm new here.

75
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,240
Mr. Huo, only you can help me.

76
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,440
Miss, the goods are ready.

77
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,720
Everything is ready.

78
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,480
I'll inform boss about this.

79
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,500
The uniform of the business department.

80
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,680
What's wrong with losing money?

81
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,120
I just paid

82
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,980
I can earn it right after that.

83
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,780
Mom, you know what?

84
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,280
Yes.

85
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,080
The Nanyang who knows nothing

86
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,320
paid double the price.

87
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Double

88
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,840
That's my son.

89
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,280
I didn't know his son was so capable.

90
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,600
Young Master, bad news.

91
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,480
We haven't got the money yet.

92
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,640
Why are you panicking?

93
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
Hand in the money, hand in the goods.

94
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
If he doesn't pay,

95
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,500
you can't take the goods away.

96
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,840
Young Master.

97
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,680
That guy...

98
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,040
What happened to the goods?

99
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,240
The goods are gone.

100
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,320
Bastard!

101
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,800
Stop fighting!

102
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Master.

103
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,560
I didn't get the goods.

104
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,020
Master.

105
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,200
I lost my money.

106
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,360
Are you trying to destroy the Huo family?

107
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,960
Master.

108
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,160
Guards!

109
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,840
Tie this bastard to Nanyang.

110
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,000
Without my order,

111
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,400
without my order.

112
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,320
Father, I was wrong.

113
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,850
Please forgive me, Father.

114
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,880
Please spare me.

115
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,920
No! No!

116
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,200
Zhijie! Zhijie!

117
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:48,960
Huo Ran.

118
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,930
Where is Huo Ran?

119
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,520
Master, Miss Leng is not home.

120
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,720
But Young Lady Yu Zhu is back.

121
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,360
Let's go.

122
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,360
Zhijie.

123
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,240
Father.

124
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,360
I can handle this.

125
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,480
But

126
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,800
you have to promise me one thing.

127
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,120
What is it?

128
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,200
I'll take full responsibility.

129
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,920
You can't get involved.

130
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,720
No way.

131
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,200
You're the one who shouldn't interfere.

132
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,760
Father.

133
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,480
I...

134
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:24,940
Enough.

135
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,000
I gave you a chance.

136
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,200
Father, listen to me.

137
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,080
Jiayu will handle this.

138
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,290
You can also experience it.

139
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,880
Take a good rest when you're back.

140
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,040
Take care.

141
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,520
Yes, Father.

142
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,520
Song Jiayu.

143
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,780
Do you think you can beat me like this?

144
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,240
You overestimated yourself

145
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,860
You overestimated yourself.

146
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,600
How would I know

147
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,840
how would I know?

148
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,200
Huo Ran.

149
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,440
What is on your neck?

150
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,440
When you hit the south wall,

151
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,480
when you hit the south wall,

152
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,720
It'll be too late to regret.

153
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,200
Isn't that what you want?

154
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,920
That's right.

155
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,320
I'm waiting for you to mess up

156
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,840
and send you out of the Huo family.

157
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,240
There are things

158
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,480
you shouldn't have touched.

159
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,640
Really?

160
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,440
You...

161
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,560
Sister.

162
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,280
Why didn't you kill me?

163
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,720
I regret I didn't do it earlier.

164
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,920
Take care.
