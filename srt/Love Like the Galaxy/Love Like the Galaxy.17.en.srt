00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,600
= Love Like the Galaxy=

2
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,860
=Episode 17=

3
00:02:05,607 --> 00:02:08,448
I knew your Young Master would come
and rescue me.

4
00:02:09,528 --> 00:02:11,368
We shouldn't stay here.

5
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:13,903
This place is still too near
from the capital.

6
00:02:13,928 --> 00:02:15,687
Ling Buyi is cunning.

7
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:17,848
We must not let him picked up our trail.

8
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:19,408
Did you mention my Young Master's name

9
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:20,568
to Ling Buyi?

10
00:02:20,727 --> 00:02:22,368
I didn't say a word.

11
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:25,207
Your Young Master had promised me.

12
00:02:25,327 --> 00:02:26,287
If I revolted,

13
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:28,687
his father, Lord Yong will come to my aid.

14
00:02:28,807 --> 00:02:30,207
When that happens,
Feng Yi County will work

15
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:32,568
with Shu to fight for a great cause.

16
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:36,848
But when is he making his move?

17
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:42,008
Are you insane?

18
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:44,448
I'm the Prince's ally.

19
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,127
His Highness said,

20
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:48,448
only dead people can keep a secret.

21
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,767
You animals!

22
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:04,647
No.

23
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:15,928
General Ling, save me!

24
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:17,247
I'll tell you everything.

25
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:20,408
Retreat!

26
00:03:54,448 --> 00:03:55,287
Please help me.

27
00:03:56,127 --> 00:03:57,848
Shut up if you want to live.

28
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:17,488
Young Master sure beat him hard today.

29
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:19,167
He didn't even let us do it.

30
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:22,408
Is he in a bad mood?

31
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:25,568
If Fan Chang didn't break out
of the dungeon,

32
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,008
Young Master could've sent

33
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:29,008
the Cheng family back
to their residence today.

34
00:04:30,408 --> 00:04:32,528
Why must Young Master escort
the Cheng family back?

35
00:04:35,848 --> 00:04:36,848
This bunch of people

36
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:38,327
always stall Young Master
from doing his work.

37
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:55,687
Stop talking about the Cheng
or the Li family already.

38
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:57,287
Can you take care of me first?

39
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,368
Send for a physician here.

40
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:17,327
The physician said I'm all right.

41
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:18,687
General,

42
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:20,928
stop pacing about.

43
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,127
You're making me head hurt.

44
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:24,767
Stop being stubborn.

45
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:27,888
We've been married
for more than 20 years.

46
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,207
I've never seen you this sick.

47
00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:32,568
When the Xiao clan fell back then,

48
00:05:32,568 --> 00:05:34,287
you didn't even show your weakness.

49
00:05:34,928 --> 00:05:37,687
Now, it's only our daughter's marriage.

50
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:39,807
How can you fall ill and remain in bed?

51
00:05:40,287 --> 00:05:41,488
I'm upset.

52
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:43,408
I have no one to blame.

53
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:46,888
Cheng Yang,

54
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:48,327
let me do it.

55
00:05:48,408 --> 00:05:49,607
You can rest for while.

56
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:53,008
When you were with Lou Yao
in Hua County,

57
00:05:53,408 --> 00:05:55,008
it was Yangyang who took care of me.

58
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:56,528
You don't have to meddle.

59
00:05:58,408 --> 00:05:59,327
In Hua County,

60
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:02,247
Niaoniao learned
from the physician earnestly.

61
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:03,448
When Madam was seriously ill,

62
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:05,448
it was thanks to Niaoniao
for taking care of you.

63
00:06:05,888 --> 00:06:07,488
With both daughters taking turns
to take care of you,

64
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:09,968
you'll recover soon.

65
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:12,928
Yangyang is more obedient and sensible.

66
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:15,607
If she meets a fine man in the future,

67
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:18,368
it'll be his family's blessing
to marry her.

68
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:19,687
Aunt.

69
00:06:20,408 --> 00:06:21,848
It's was my negligence

70
00:06:22,368 --> 00:06:23,327
that Niaoniao discussed

71
00:06:23,888 --> 00:06:25,327
her marriage beforehand.

72
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:28,088
It's too late to regret now.

73
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:30,327
You're older than Niaoniao.

74
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:32,888
It's time for you to think
about your marriage now.

75
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:35,928
If you have set your eyes on someone,

76
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:37,928
you can just tell me.

77
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:40,607
I'll speak for you.

78
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:43,207
Marriage is dictated

79
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:44,888
by parents.

80
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:48,647
I shall follow your arrangement.

81
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:51,807
I knew you're

82
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:53,368
a sensible child.

83
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:54,607
Rest assured.

84
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:56,647
I will think

85
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:58,368
about this thoroughly.

86
00:07:07,888 --> 00:07:09,368
The water is cold.

87
00:07:09,368 --> 00:07:10,848
I'll get some hot water.

88
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:19,088
You didn't have to say that.

89
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:53,528
Niaoniao sure was competent.

90
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:55,088
When Sister-in-law was ill,

91
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:56,767
she ran the household

92
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,408
in such an orderly manner.

93
00:07:58,848 --> 00:07:59,888
Mr. Wan.

94
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:00,848
Qiqi.

95
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:01,928
What brings you here?

96
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:04,127
I heard your mother is sick
so we came to visit.

97
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:05,088
Qiqi,

98
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:06,647
see how filial and obedient

99
00:08:06,647 --> 00:08:08,127
Niaoniao is.

100
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:10,807
When I was sick,
what did you do?

101
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:12,727
She actually went out fighting.

102
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:15,207
Father, what are you saying?

103
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,527
Are trying to make Shaoshang and me

104
00:08:17,527 --> 00:08:20,207
grow estrange by comparing us?

105
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:21,848
But seeing

106
00:08:21,928 --> 00:08:23,768
you're praising my younger sister,

107
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:25,127
I'll let you go this time.

108
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,088
I'm so angry that the right side
of my head hurts again.

109
00:08:29,768 --> 00:08:30,888
Come and massage it for me.

110
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:32,728
Father,

111
00:08:32,848 --> 00:08:34,088
the physician said

112
00:08:34,088 --> 00:08:36,127
the pain on the right side
of the skull is an ominous sign.

113
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:38,768
It's probably impossible

114
00:08:39,287 --> 00:08:40,447
for you to have a son anymore.

115
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:41,608
Rest assured.

116
00:08:41,848 --> 00:08:43,768
I assure you that I'll give you
a younger brother.

117
00:08:47,848 --> 00:08:49,327
Are you really in talks of marriage?

118
00:08:50,287 --> 00:08:51,127
Can you believe it?

119
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,888
I can't believe you actually came back
with a future husband

120
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:55,287
while you were on your journey.

121
00:08:56,088 --> 00:08:57,527
You're obviously younger than me.

122
00:08:57,527 --> 00:08:59,207
Yet, you're getting married before me.

123
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:03,367
But this Lou Yao was engaged

124
00:09:03,608 --> 00:09:05,608
to He Zhaojun before.

125
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,367
He was always shamed
and being picked on.

126
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:09,688
I think he's too honest.

127
00:09:09,928 --> 00:09:11,447
That's what I like about him.

128
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,207
My parents

129
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:15,447
don't like Yao either.

130
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,407
But where can they find such

131
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,888
an obedient son-in-law?

132
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:20,127
When I repaired the houses,

133
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,207
he handed me the tools.

134
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:22,527
When I forged farm tools,

135
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:23,848
he pulled the box for me.

136
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:25,527
When I was punished by my mother,

137
00:09:25,728 --> 00:09:27,367
he even secretly sent wine for me.

138
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:29,367
It was

139
00:09:29,688 --> 00:09:30,447
very nice.

140
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:33,407
Wait.

141
00:09:34,247 --> 00:09:35,327
Even Lianfang can do

142
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:36,728
all the things

143
00:09:37,768 --> 00:09:39,008
you said he did.

144
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:42,487
Besides,

145
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:44,247
when two people are together,

146
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:46,008
love is more important.

147
00:09:46,088 --> 00:09:47,768
What's it like to be in love?

148
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:50,088
It's better to find a playmate

149
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:51,768
as husband.

150
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:58,447
You have a point.

151
00:09:58,768 --> 00:09:59,527
Then

152
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:00,928
I'll find an obedient husband
in the future.

153
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:03,207
When I'm fighting, he'll carry my stick.

154
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:05,287
When I'm hurt, he'll bandage me.

155
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:07,407
He must not be like your Second Brother

156
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:08,728
who always contradicts me all day.

157
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:10,327
My Second Brother didn't do it
to contradict you...

158
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:11,247
Wan Qiqi,

159
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:13,088
what nonsense are you talking about?

160
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:16,167
You can't find a husband
who will only put up with you.

161
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,768
You must find one who'll supervise you

162
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:19,088
and encourage you.

163
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:24,808
I'm looking for a husband

164
00:10:25,088 --> 00:10:26,247
not a teacher.

165
00:10:26,247 --> 00:10:27,848
Why would I want to ruin myself
by finding someone

166
00:10:27,848 --> 00:10:28,768
who'd make me depressed?

167
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:30,888
Shaogong,

168
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:32,447
you know how to read fortune.

169
00:10:32,728 --> 00:10:33,447
Help me read mine

170
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:35,088
and see what my future husband
is going to be like.

171
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:45,447
Qiqi,

172
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:47,527
your future husband is

173
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:50,608
as far as the edge of heaven
and right under your nose.

174
00:10:58,327 --> 00:10:59,247
Under my nose?

175
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:02,928
Where?

176
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:04,608
Are you even accurate?

177
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:15,648
Out of my way.

178
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:17,808
You're in my way
from finding the right man.

179
00:11:18,088 --> 00:11:18,688
Shaoshang.

180
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:20,088
Shaoshang, come here.

181
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:22,688
Where is he?

182
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:24,848
Is there something wrong
with Qiqi's eyesight?

183
00:11:26,888 --> 00:11:28,088
I think

184
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:29,487
she's pretty fine.

185
00:11:35,768 --> 00:11:36,688
Sister-in-law,

186
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:38,648
you're still sick.
So no need to see me off.

187
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:40,968
If you ask me,

188
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:42,608
a woman shouldn't be too strong.

189
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:44,447
Shi is skinny like a pole

190
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:45,808
from taking care of you.

191
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:48,648
Wan, have you ever seen such
a sturdy pole like me?

192
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:06,167
I was wondering

193
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:07,888
why Qiqi refused to give me
the deer tendons for me.

194
00:12:08,008 --> 00:12:09,848
It turns out she's giving it
to your son.

195
00:12:10,287 --> 00:12:11,848
Qiqi sure have a good judgment

196
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:14,728
for knowing only the Cheng's sons
deserve the deer tendons.

197
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:18,648
Qiqi, it's time to go home!

198
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:21,487
Madam,

199
00:12:21,728 --> 00:12:24,008
I'm afraid we'll have two happy events
in this family.

200
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:29,327
It has been more than half a year

201
00:12:29,808 --> 00:12:31,407
since these monkeys returned
to the capital.

202
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:32,567
They'll turn the house upside down

203
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:33,567
if I let them waste time.

204
00:12:34,728 --> 00:12:35,608
I think

205
00:12:36,008 --> 00:12:37,447
I must hire a teacher

206
00:12:37,768 --> 00:12:39,527
and start schooling them

207
00:12:39,888 --> 00:12:42,327
about the doctrines of sages at home.

208
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,327
That's a good idea.

209
00:12:44,688 --> 00:12:46,247
I, too think they need
to be put in their place

210
00:12:47,287 --> 00:12:49,567
and start studying to enhance
their knowledge.

211
00:12:58,768 --> 00:13:00,608
The Cheng family is going
to start a home school?

212
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,848
They're seeking Mount Bailu's

213
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:04,567
students as teacher?

214
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:10,648
The Cheng family didn't have
to look further to find one.

215
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:12,088
All over the world,

216
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:13,247
who's more suitable than me

217
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:15,327
except for Master.

218
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:16,808
Are you saying

219
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:17,968
you want to go to the Cheng's Residence

220
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:19,167
and be their teacher?

221
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:22,127
Master Huangfu misses Master Sang.

222
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:24,207
So he asked me to keep an eye on her.

223
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,247
How could I disobey Master's order?

224
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:29,527
Isn't Master Sang is in Hua County?

225
00:13:34,768 --> 00:13:36,167
Master Sang likes

226
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:38,327
her nonsensical niece,
Cheng Shaoshang the most.

227
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,008
Mount Bailu has sent a letter wanting me

228
00:13:40,008 --> 00:13:41,527
to recommend disciples to go.

229
00:13:42,608 --> 00:13:43,648
Why don't I recommend myself

230
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:45,367
to share Master Sang's worries

231
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:47,447
and educate Cheng Shaoshang properly?

232
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:48,968
Lest she behaves recklessly

233
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:50,968
and irritates others before she marries.

234
00:13:51,127 --> 00:13:53,848
But the Cheng family
isn't hiring female teacher

235
00:13:54,848 --> 00:13:56,608
for the female family members.

236
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:06,008
A wise man said

237
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:07,688
provide education for all people
without discrimination.

238
00:14:08,287 --> 00:14:11,608
Do you think I'm those vulgar person
who thinks lightly of women?

239
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,848
I'd naturally teach

240
00:14:16,207 --> 00:14:17,527
the young ladies properly too.

241
00:14:25,808 --> 00:14:27,808
How is that taking women lightly?

242
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:31,768
They clearly never thought
of asking you.

243
00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:40,287
Stop the carriage!

244
00:14:45,487 --> 00:14:46,487
We're not there yet.

245
00:14:46,808 --> 00:14:47,728
Why are we stopping?

246
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:50,287
Are you going
to shamelessly recommend yourself

247
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:52,367
to be the teacher
at the Cheng's Residence?

248
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:53,848
No one would reject being an official

249
00:14:53,848 --> 00:14:54,968
to be a teacher

250
00:14:54,968 --> 00:14:56,367
at Marquis Quling's Residence.

251
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:57,287
Who says so?

252
00:14:57,327 --> 00:14:58,367
Isn't Master Huangfu also returning

253
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,008
to Mount Bailu to pay attention

254
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:01,287
in educating others now?

255
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:03,167
Teachers are respected by all.

256
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,888
Teachers aren't inferior
to the pillars of the nation.

257
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:07,688
Don't you look down on this profession.

258
00:15:07,928 --> 00:15:09,608
I guess many people want

259
00:15:09,768 --> 00:15:11,008
to be a teacher
at the Cheng's Residence.

260
00:15:25,688 --> 00:15:27,447
Mr. Lou looks spirited

261
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:28,848
in his clothes today.

262
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:32,008
Why is the Lou family's
Second Madam with him?

263
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:34,768
I don't think they're here
for the teacher's position.

264
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,808
I'm afraid they're here
to visit their in-laws.

265
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:37,888
Young Master,

266
00:15:37,888 --> 00:15:39,728
why don't we come another day

267
00:15:39,728 --> 00:15:41,207
since the Cheng has
important guests today?

268
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:44,247
Return home.

269
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:46,567
Young Master,
you've finally come around.

270
00:15:47,688 --> 00:15:48,608
Who says so?

271
00:15:49,088 --> 00:15:49,888
I want to change into something

272
00:15:49,888 --> 00:15:51,608
that makes me look
more spirited than Lou Yao.

273
00:15:52,648 --> 00:15:54,888
I must not lose my imposing manner

274
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,327
in front of the students.

275
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:17,367
Yao.

276
00:16:17,447 --> 00:16:18,247
Shaoshang.

277
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:19,968
It must be a long journey.

278
00:16:19,968 --> 00:16:21,688
Follow me and grab
a bowl of heat dispel soup.

279
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:24,327
Does Yao only get to drink it?

280
00:16:25,808 --> 00:16:28,008
Shaoshang, this is my mother.

281
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:29,567
Come.

282
00:16:32,768 --> 00:16:34,928
I heard First Madam is not well.

283
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:35,808
So I especially come to visit.

284
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:39,648
Second Madam.

285
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:41,527
Greetings, Second Madam.

286
00:16:42,407 --> 00:16:45,207
My son can't stop bragging
about you.

287
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:47,287
But he didn't brag

288
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:49,688
about how beautiful and lovable you are.

289
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,608
What did Yao brag about me?

290
00:16:53,407 --> 00:16:54,648
Second Madam, please tell

291
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:55,928
so I could be happy.

292
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:59,407
Second Madam, you're here.

293
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:03,567
Mr. Lou,

294
00:17:04,008 --> 00:17:05,567
why didn't you inform me earlier
that you're coming?

295
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:07,207
Shaoshang,

296
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:09,167
give a first proper greeting.

297
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:16,928
Please have a seat.

298
00:17:19,447 --> 00:17:20,127
Come here.

299
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:21,287
Sit here.

300
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:24,608
Sit.

301
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:39,088
I heard you're not well.

302
00:17:39,447 --> 00:17:41,127
So I come to visit
because I was worried.

303
00:17:41,487 --> 00:17:43,088
But if I'm bothering you,

304
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:44,888
I wouldn't have come.

305
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:46,167
According to etiquette,

306
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:48,127
I should've paid you a visit

307
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:50,367
to discuss their marriage.

308
00:17:50,768 --> 00:17:53,608
But I had to fall sick of all times.

309
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:55,407
You can take your time to recuperate.

310
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:56,848
No rush.

311
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,327
I'm not in a rush too.

312
00:18:00,768 --> 00:18:03,447
But I'm not sure if my son can wait.

313
00:18:03,928 --> 00:18:04,688
Mother.

314
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:20,407
General Cheng had done well

315
00:18:20,407 --> 00:18:21,728
in offering amnesty
and recruiting the rebels.

316
00:18:21,728 --> 00:18:22,728
I heard His Majesty is going

317
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:24,127
pass down his edict

318
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,928
to promote General Cheng
as the Left Aide of the Palace Garrison.

319
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:29,088
I came for two reasons.
First, I'm here to visit you.

320
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
Second, to congratulate you.

321
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:33,968
I'm almost

322
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:35,768
recovered now.

323
00:18:36,808 --> 00:18:38,327
Yesterday,
Second Young Master Lou delivered

324
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:40,327
some medicinal ingredients.

325
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:41,768
But I didn't accept them.

326
00:18:43,768 --> 00:18:44,848
As of the congratulatory wish,

327
00:18:45,247 --> 00:18:47,327
I can't accept it

328
00:18:47,688 --> 00:18:49,848
because His Majesty has yet decreed it.

329
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:05,127
Madam,

330
00:19:05,407 --> 00:19:08,688
you lose nothing
if you accept this gift.

331
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,928
You only have to say

332
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:15,008
if you want to accept this gift

333
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:18,008
or not.

334
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:29,167
I'm afraid today is a day of good news.

335
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:30,888
Distinguished guests have been flocking
to our doors.

336
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:32,527
Madam, guess

337
00:19:32,527 --> 00:19:34,327
who's the other distinguished guest?

338
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:43,407
Mr. Yuan,

339
00:19:43,688 --> 00:19:45,367
are you really here

340
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:48,167
to teach my ignorant sons?

341
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:50,367
I've always admired you

342
00:19:50,728 --> 00:19:53,487
for delaying your children's success

343
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:54,728
because of your devotion

344
00:19:55,088 --> 00:19:56,327
to the country.

345
00:19:56,888 --> 00:19:59,808
So I came uninvited after receiving
Master Sang's letter seeking referrals.

346
00:20:00,008 --> 00:20:02,768
I hope you don't find it disagreeable.

347
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,367
Of course, not. Not at all.

348
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:08,088
I'm afraid I dare not feel that way
my whole life.

349
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:11,768
It's just that you have such
an extensive knowledge

350
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:14,088
that even the officials
at court speak highly of it.

351
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:15,648
I'm afraid

352
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:18,367
none of my children are talented enough

353
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:19,367
to be taught by you.

354
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:20,247
Father,

355
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:25,247
Yao's uncle is
the Crown Prince's teacher.

356
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:27,808
Yao's knowledge is also taught
and passed down by his uncle.

357
00:20:28,768 --> 00:20:31,367
Why don't you let Yao teach my brothers?

358
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,207
Then you don't any outsiders
to come and teach.

359
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:35,207
You mustn't say that.

360
00:20:36,008 --> 00:20:37,808
Compared to Senior Shanjian,

361
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,207
my knowledge is way behind his.

362
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:42,487
Yao,

363
00:20:42,968 --> 00:20:44,207
you must have self-confidence.

364
00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:45,287
You're going to marry soon.

365
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:46,648
How can you still be this disrespectful?

366
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:49,688
Let Yao teach you some manners.

367
00:20:56,768 --> 00:20:58,648
Mr. Yuan, please don't see yourself
as an outsider.

368
00:20:59,928 --> 00:21:00,968
Have some hot tea.

369
00:21:27,968 --> 00:21:29,447
Young Lady! Young Lady.

370
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:32,567
It's Mr. Shanjian.

371
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,728
Don't be ridiculous. It's not Mr. Yuan.

372
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,008
Mr. Shanjian requested to see Master.

373
00:21:37,008 --> 00:21:38,247
He said he's here

374
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:39,447
to teach Young Masters.

375
00:21:42,808 --> 00:21:43,728
What?

376
00:21:48,127 --> 00:21:49,327
In such a hot weather,

377
00:21:49,728 --> 00:21:50,608
drinking hot tea

378
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:52,567
must be unbearable.

379
00:21:53,728 --> 00:21:54,527
Yao,

380
00:21:54,808 --> 00:21:56,367
I wanted to bring you to have
some heat dispel soup.

381
00:21:56,487 --> 00:21:57,648
Do you still want to drink it now?

382
00:21:57,648 --> 00:21:59,088
Sure, of course.

383
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:00,207
In this hot weather,

384
00:22:00,207 --> 00:22:01,287
we must drink something cold

385
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:02,407
to feel refreshed.

386
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:04,648
I'll go and get it for you.

387
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:07,808
This tea has a sweet aftertaste

388
00:22:08,088 --> 00:22:09,247
that warms the heart and stomach.

389
00:22:09,888 --> 00:22:12,327
Drinking hot tea in the summer is

390
00:22:12,487 --> 00:22:15,247
the way wise men meditate
and keep good health.

391
00:22:15,487 --> 00:22:17,608
Only vulgar people prefer

392
00:22:18,928 --> 00:22:20,167
cold food and drinks

393
00:22:20,888 --> 00:22:22,127
that are harmful
to the spleen and stomach.

394
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:32,167
I remember Father likes cold drinks too.

395
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:38,287
Now I like hot soup.

396
00:22:58,287 --> 00:23:00,008
You were the one who set the trap

397
00:23:00,127 --> 00:23:01,567
into letting Fan Chang escape
from the dungeon?

398
00:23:01,968 --> 00:23:02,768
Yes.

399
00:23:03,127 --> 00:23:04,407
I let Fan Chang escape on purpose

400
00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:06,088
and sent someone to trail him.

401
00:23:06,088 --> 00:23:08,088
We found out he indeed met up
with Prince Xiao's men..

402
00:23:08,088 --> 00:23:09,527
The other party even intended
to silence him.

403
00:23:09,768 --> 00:23:11,608
Fan Chang hates Prince Xiao
for burning bridges.

404
00:23:11,888 --> 00:23:12,928
So he confessed to me

405
00:23:13,088 --> 00:23:15,088
that the reason why he dared
to have delusions over the years was

406
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:16,808
that Prince Xiao told him

407
00:23:16,968 --> 00:23:18,808
that Feng Yi County
will join forces with Shu

408
00:23:19,088 --> 00:23:20,207
to rebel.

409
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,487
Lord Yong was among my earliest friend

410
00:23:24,327 --> 00:23:27,648
who fought to seize
the state power with me.

411
00:23:28,688 --> 00:23:30,648
He suffered three severe wounds.

412
00:23:31,688 --> 00:23:33,327
He took them on my behalf to protect me.

413
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:36,327
I don't believe

414
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:37,648
he was the one instigated this.

415
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:38,768
We mustn't believe

416
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:40,407
Fan Chang's one-sided statement.

417
00:23:40,407 --> 00:23:42,207
It isn't entirely based
on Fan Chang's statement.

418
00:23:42,407 --> 00:23:44,207
I also thoroughly investigated
the identities of those dead men

419
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:45,407
and found out they're

420
00:23:45,768 --> 00:23:47,167
from Feng Yi County.

421
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:49,968
So this matter should be true.

422
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,808
When we found this country,

423
00:24:01,247 --> 00:24:02,207
I wanted to invite

424
00:24:02,968 --> 00:24:04,367
Lord Yong to the capital

425
00:24:04,768 --> 00:24:05,848
to help run the country.

426
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:07,127
But he passed the responsibility
to others

427
00:24:07,608 --> 00:24:09,367
by saying he was old and tired.

428
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,127
That he was missing his home

429
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:12,367
and only wanted to return home

430
00:24:12,527 --> 00:24:15,008
to offer sacrifices
for his ancestral graves.

431
00:24:15,608 --> 00:24:17,608
I didn't insist

432
00:24:17,808 --> 00:24:19,008
because he was doing his duty as a son.

433
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:20,968
So I ordered his eldest son

434
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,447
to enter capital and granted him
a title as a prince.

435
00:24:23,648 --> 00:24:24,968
He was to choose
any amount of official salary.

436
00:24:26,127 --> 00:24:27,008
Am I not

437
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:28,928
generous enough to them?

438
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:30,167
When a person is greedy,

439
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:32,327
being generous is not something
that can satisfy them.

440
00:24:33,127 --> 00:24:33,888
Is it possible

441
00:24:33,888 --> 00:24:35,728
that it was this useless son

442
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:37,527
who acted on his own?

443
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:39,367
He wanted to steal and sell armaments.

444
00:24:39,808 --> 00:24:42,127
So he lied to Fan Chang on purpose

445
00:24:42,567 --> 00:24:44,167
and Lord Yong knows nothing

446
00:24:44,728 --> 00:24:45,848
of this matter.

447
00:24:46,008 --> 00:24:47,567
He may be someone

448
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:49,648
who can't restrain his son, that's all.

449
00:24:49,648 --> 00:24:50,608
Your Majesty is indeed benevolent.

450
00:24:50,968 --> 00:24:52,768
But it's hard to predict a person.
We must be on guard.

451
00:24:53,287 --> 00:24:54,928
To find out if he knows,

452
00:24:55,247 --> 00:24:56,127
Your Majesty only needs to summon

453
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,928
Lord Yong to the capital.

454
00:25:02,808 --> 00:25:04,447
So where is his son

455
00:25:04,928 --> 00:25:05,848
who had caused so much trouble?

456
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:06,928
I've looked into it.

457
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:08,447
After their defeat in Hua County,

458
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:10,487
he took his new bride back to his manor
to complete the wedding ceremony.

459
00:25:10,848 --> 00:25:11,928
He has yet returned until this day.

460
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:14,247
He returned to his manor
to complete his wedding?

461
00:25:15,888 --> 00:25:16,888
What a coincidence.

462
00:25:18,928 --> 00:25:20,567
Who is this new bride?

463
00:25:24,127 --> 00:25:24,848
What's wrong?

464
00:25:25,527 --> 00:25:26,487
Is this new bride not

465
00:25:27,088 --> 00:25:28,327
of someone ordinary?

466
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:29,768
She's the Cavalry General,

467
00:25:30,088 --> 00:25:31,127
He Yong's daughter,

468
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:32,287
He Zhaojun.

469
00:25:36,928 --> 00:25:38,127
Could it be that He Yong is also

470
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:40,447
on Lord Yong's side?

471
00:25:40,928 --> 00:25:41,848
I think

472
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:44,167
General He is a good and loyal general.

473
00:25:44,608 --> 00:25:45,768
He won't be persuaded by Lord Yong.

474
00:25:46,487 --> 00:25:47,648
He may not know

475
00:25:47,768 --> 00:25:49,888
that Lord Yong and his son
are plotting a rebellion.

476
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:51,167
How about this?

477
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:54,008
I want you to take care
of Lord Yong's followers in the capital.

478
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:56,167
I'll send an imperial edict to him

479
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:57,728
to report to the capital.

480
00:25:57,808 --> 00:25:59,088
If he has no second thoughts,

481
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:02,527
we'll see if he complies to my order.

482
00:26:03,608 --> 00:26:04,407
Yes, Your Majesty.

483
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,928
He Zhaojun?

484
00:26:15,088 --> 00:26:17,367
Why does this name sound familiar?

485
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:18,608
Your Majesty,

486
00:26:18,888 --> 00:26:21,768
it's the name of General He Yong's
youngest daughter

487
00:26:21,768 --> 00:26:23,527
who was charmed by Prince Xiao,

488
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,808
which ended her engagement
with the Lou's Second Young Master.

489
00:26:26,608 --> 00:26:28,567
Now, the Lou's Second Young Master is

490
00:26:28,808 --> 00:26:31,327
in talks of marriage
with Fourth Lady Cheng.

491
00:26:31,487 --> 00:26:33,447
The happy event is approaching.

492
00:26:33,447 --> 00:26:34,648
Is this Fourth Lady Cheng

493
00:26:35,608 --> 00:26:36,608
the one Zisheng escorted

494
00:26:36,608 --> 00:26:38,447
into the city?

495
00:26:38,968 --> 00:26:40,207
Yes, Your Majesty.

496
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:48,688
This hateful Prince Xiao.

497
00:26:48,688 --> 00:26:49,407
Tell me.

498
00:26:49,768 --> 00:26:51,327
If he didn't entice her,

499
00:26:51,447 --> 00:26:52,088
that Lou Yao

500
00:26:52,088 --> 00:26:54,407
wouldn't have snatched
Zisheng's sweetheart,

501
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:55,367
that made

502
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:57,848
Zisheng remains alone
and single until now.

503
00:26:57,848 --> 00:26:59,088
Poor boy.

504
00:27:00,648 --> 00:27:02,327
That hateful kid.
He deserves to be punished.

505
00:27:05,527 --> 00:27:06,768
Did Yuan Shanjian say

506
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:08,888
anything else other than

507
00:27:10,888 --> 00:27:12,527
to be a teacher here?

508
00:27:14,848 --> 00:27:16,888
He didn't say anything important.

509
00:27:17,728 --> 00:27:19,968
He just talk
about drinking hot soup in summer

510
00:27:20,447 --> 00:27:22,527
and vulgar people greed
for cold foods and drinks.

511
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,567
He's very well-educated.

512
00:27:25,447 --> 00:27:28,127
Why did he come to be a teacher
at our home?

513
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:33,768
I don't know

514
00:27:34,728 --> 00:27:36,167
even if you asked me.

515
00:27:39,608 --> 00:27:40,487
General,

516
00:27:41,008 --> 00:27:42,008
think about it.

517
00:27:42,487 --> 00:27:43,888
Are you implying

518
00:27:44,888 --> 00:27:46,088
that this Yuan Shanjian

519
00:27:46,808 --> 00:27:48,688
also have feelings for Niaoniao?

520
00:27:57,447 --> 00:27:58,968
You better explain everything in detail.

521
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:01,287
What have you been doing
for the past several months?

522
00:28:01,768 --> 00:28:02,768
And who did you meet?

523
00:28:03,768 --> 00:28:05,247
You must not miss out any details.

524
00:28:07,608 --> 00:28:08,808
Must I tell you everything?

525
00:28:09,808 --> 00:28:11,287
It'll take months to tell.

526
00:28:15,287 --> 00:28:16,088
All right.

527
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:19,127
That day,

528
00:28:19,287 --> 00:28:23,008
I was in the carriage
with Third Uncle and Third Aunt...

529
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:24,928
I wasn't asking about this.

530
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:30,327
Father, how about you just be frank?

531
00:28:31,247 --> 00:28:32,688
Are you curious about Yuan Shanjian?

532
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:35,247
Yes, Yuan Shanjian.

533
00:28:37,088 --> 00:28:38,608
When did you know him?

534
00:28:39,088 --> 00:28:40,167
How many times have you met him?

535
00:28:40,447 --> 00:28:41,447
What did you talk about?

536
00:28:42,407 --> 00:28:44,688
We only met

537
00:28:45,487 --> 00:28:46,648
about five to eight times.

538
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:49,608
But I can assure you

539
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:51,008
that I have nothing to do with him.

540
00:28:51,287 --> 00:28:52,728
I can swear to heaven.

541
00:28:53,207 --> 00:28:54,407
Then why did Yuan Shanjian

542
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:57,247
especially come here to be your teacher?

543
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:00,728
He's not cunning but fickle-minded.

544
00:29:01,327 --> 00:29:02,808
He shouldn't be called Yuan Shanjian.

545
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:05,247
He should be called Yuan Shanbian,
the fickle-minded man.

546
00:29:05,768 --> 00:29:06,728
Father. Mother.

547
00:29:06,968 --> 00:29:08,367
This person recommended himself
to be the teacher.

548
00:29:08,648 --> 00:29:09,848
He must have some bad intentions.

549
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:11,688
Mother is also knowledgeable.

550
00:29:11,688 --> 00:29:13,407
It is enough to teach my brothers.

551
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:15,127
Why do we need
to hire a teacher from outside?

552
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:16,648
If it doesn't work,
Yao can also teach them.

553
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,928
Stop talking about Yao.

554
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:20,608
I can see Lou Yao is only

555
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:23,287
a bit more knowledgeable than you.

556
00:29:23,808 --> 00:29:25,527
You're just being prejudice towards Yao.

557
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:27,888
Mother, you saw how

558
00:29:28,088 --> 00:29:29,447
my future mother-in-law

559
00:29:29,447 --> 00:29:30,888
treated me today.

560
00:29:30,888 --> 00:29:32,287
She rather likes me.

561
00:29:32,728 --> 00:29:34,487
I'm sure things will be peaceful

562
00:29:34,768 --> 00:29:35,928
if I marry into the Lou family.

563
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:38,688
She never likes He Zhaojun anyway.

564
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:40,287
When the He family broke off
the engagement,

565
00:29:40,287 --> 00:29:41,928
it brought her a great embarrassment.

566
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,608
Of course, she's full of expectations
for you this time.

567
00:29:45,768 --> 00:29:47,808
You don't have
to be so pleased with yourself.

568
00:29:50,447 --> 00:29:51,367
Tomorrow,

569
00:29:51,688 --> 00:29:53,327
you'll come with me and reciprocate
the Lou family with the gifts.

570
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:55,848
You shall see what everyone is like

571
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:57,808
at Lou's Residence with your eyes.

572
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:10,768
The Lou's Residence
sure is magnificent.

573
00:30:11,088 --> 00:30:11,928
Usually,

574
00:30:12,247 --> 00:30:13,247
the Second Chamber's West Court

575
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:15,247
should be a little smaller
than the First Chamber's Eastern Court.

576
00:30:15,407 --> 00:30:16,287
But look,

577
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:17,728
there's not much difference in sizes.

578
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,447
Quiet.

579
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,287
Move.

580
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:49,688
This must be Cheng's First Madam

581
00:30:50,928 --> 00:30:52,008
and Shaoshang.

582
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:55,527
Shaoshang,

583
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:57,487
this is your First Aunt.

584
00:30:57,848 --> 00:30:58,688
This is

585
00:30:58,968 --> 00:31:00,167
Ben's wife.

586
00:31:03,808 --> 00:31:05,088
Greetings, First Madam.

587
00:31:06,008 --> 00:31:06,848
Shaoshang,

588
00:31:07,447 --> 00:31:08,407
greet them.

589
00:31:11,688 --> 00:31:12,848
Greetings, First Aunt.

590
00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:34,088
You can just call me Yanji.

591
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:35,928
After you and Yao are married,

592
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:37,088
you can address me properly then.

593
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:39,808
I wish you health, Yanji.

594
00:31:45,648 --> 00:31:47,768
How about taking a seat?

595
00:31:51,487 --> 00:31:53,207
Let's sit down and talk.

596
00:32:15,848 --> 00:32:17,527
Sister-in-law, you're so blessed.

597
00:32:18,008 --> 00:32:19,447
This new bride looks prettier

598
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:21,247
than the previous one.

599
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:23,367
That's right.

600
00:32:23,848 --> 00:32:24,648
Shaoshang

601
00:32:24,648 --> 00:32:26,407
truly outdo

602
00:32:26,407 --> 00:32:27,608
all the young ladies here.

603
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:30,088
She's both filial and friendly.

604
00:32:30,327 --> 00:32:32,127
She takes good care of Yao too.

605
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,487
Such a daughter-in-law

606
00:32:33,608 --> 00:32:35,367
can't be any better.

607
00:32:35,968 --> 00:32:37,768
Since you and Yao like this,

608
00:32:37,968 --> 00:32:39,127
I can set my mind to rest.

609
00:32:40,327 --> 00:32:43,207
Does that mean Sister-in-law agreed
to this marriage?

610
00:32:44,728 --> 00:32:46,287
If I don't agree,

611
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:48,287
Yao would ignore me.

612
00:32:48,768 --> 00:32:51,608
I'll invite someone for divine readings
and pick an auspicious day tomorrow.

613
00:32:52,447 --> 00:32:53,527
That's great.

614
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:56,487
Come here.

615
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:02,648
I couldn't prepare anything
because everything was in a hurry.

616
00:33:03,008 --> 00:33:04,888
Shaoshang, take this.

617
00:33:05,648 --> 00:33:07,127
Take it as a memento.

618
00:33:15,968 --> 00:33:16,968
First Madam,

619
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:18,888
there's no need to rush

620
00:33:18,888 --> 00:33:20,447
to pick the wedding date.

621
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:23,487
The country may be peaceful now.

622
00:33:23,487 --> 00:33:25,247
But it's changeable.

623
00:33:25,608 --> 00:33:28,968
It's still too soon
to discuss marriage now.

624
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:30,848
How about we wait

625
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:33,367
until everything is stable?

626
00:33:33,768 --> 00:33:35,487
How is it unsafe?

627
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:37,688
Did you think Sister-in-law

628
00:33:37,688 --> 00:33:39,008
would simply give away her keepsake?

629
00:33:39,287 --> 00:33:40,167
This jade was

630
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:42,088
the dowry

631
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:43,287
she carried with her for many years.

632
00:33:43,808 --> 00:33:45,088
At first, we thought

633
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:47,207
she'll give it to Ben's bride.

634
00:33:47,447 --> 00:33:48,928
Yet, she gave it to Shaoshang.

635
00:33:49,287 --> 00:33:50,088
It looks like

636
00:33:50,768 --> 00:33:53,207
you prefer this younger daughter-in-law.

637
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:02,608
I was out of line.

638
00:34:03,447 --> 00:34:04,848
Yanji, don't take it to heart.

639
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:06,848
I'm sure your mother-in-law dotes
on you too.

640
00:34:07,008 --> 00:34:08,968
She won't favor one over the other.

641
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:29,327
Yanji,

642
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,527
Yao told me

643
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,447
you already have the best keepsake

644
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:33,688
of the Lou family.

645
00:34:36,768 --> 00:34:39,247
Yanji met Eldest Brother
when he was traveling.

646
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:41,728
When Eldest Brother went traveling,
he doesn't carry valuable things.

647
00:34:41,888 --> 00:34:43,527
So he made a bronze mirror

648
00:34:43,527 --> 00:34:44,648
for Yanji himself.

649
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:46,287
It means

650
00:34:46,287 --> 00:34:49,008
his heart is clear as the mirror
and no doubts about each other.

651
00:34:49,527 --> 00:34:50,247
I don't think

652
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:52,327
all the jades in the world
can be compared

653
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:53,968
to the bronze mirror.

654
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:55,167
Yanji, am I right?

655
00:34:57,127 --> 00:34:58,527
Shaoshang, you're right.

656
00:34:58,728 --> 00:35:00,407
Ben has already given me

657
00:35:00,407 --> 00:35:01,848
Lou family's best keepsake.

658
00:35:03,088 --> 00:35:05,287
Shaoshang is right. That's right.

659
00:35:05,287 --> 00:35:07,127
Look how muddle-headed I am.

660
00:35:07,808 --> 00:35:09,447
How could I forget this?

661
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,968
My eldest son is good at calligraphy.

662
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:13,527
He even carved

663
00:35:13,688 --> 00:35:14,968
the poem "Jianjia" with different fonts

664
00:35:14,968 --> 00:35:16,848
behind the mirror.

665
00:35:30,447 --> 00:35:31,888
Shaoshang, you're here.

666
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:32,808
Yao.

667
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:35,928
All the elders are here.

668
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:38,567
Do you only see your future bride?

669
00:35:46,247 --> 00:35:48,247
You uncle taught you
how to deal with dilemmas.

670
00:35:48,367 --> 00:35:50,088
But you didn't seem to bear it in mind.

671
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:51,287
I...

672
00:35:55,728 --> 00:35:57,167
Yao knows etiquette best.

673
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:58,768
Yao behaved this way

674
00:35:58,768 --> 00:35:59,808
because he doesn't see First Aunt

675
00:35:59,808 --> 00:36:01,407
as an outsider in his heart.

676
00:36:05,848 --> 00:36:06,728
Yao,

677
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:09,527
you've found yourself one capable wife.

678
00:36:10,247 --> 00:36:12,247
She's good at talking.

679
00:36:12,688 --> 00:36:13,327
Yes.

680
00:36:13,527 --> 00:36:15,008
Shaoshang is not only smart
but also capable.

681
00:36:15,327 --> 00:36:16,968
She knows everything in this world.

682
00:36:19,848 --> 00:36:21,127
Don't just stand there.

683
00:36:21,688 --> 00:36:23,327
Go and find your uncle to come back.

684
00:36:23,487 --> 00:36:24,848
A betrothal is not a small matter.

685
00:36:25,207 --> 00:36:27,207
There are many things
that need him to decide.

686
00:36:27,808 --> 00:36:28,648
I'll go right now.

687
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:46,207
Yanji,

688
00:36:46,928 --> 00:36:48,088
why don't you show Shaoshang

689
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,688
around our place?

690
00:36:52,808 --> 00:36:53,447
All right.

691
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,768
I happen want to see
that bronze mirror too.

692
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:57,608
Yanji, can you show it to me?

693
00:36:58,207 --> 00:36:59,127
Come with me.

694
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,088
This way.

695
00:37:35,608 --> 00:37:37,327
Thank you for helping out just now.

696
00:37:37,608 --> 00:37:39,888
You helped the Second Chamber win
some dignity.

697
00:37:42,688 --> 00:37:43,928
Have that First Madam

698
00:37:44,648 --> 00:37:46,648
always been speaking to Yao
this rudely?

699
00:37:47,008 --> 00:37:48,367
Father-in-law passed away early.

700
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,527
The Lou's Residence's
present glory and honor is

701
00:37:50,648 --> 00:37:52,008
all thanks to First Uncle

702
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:53,487
for being the Crown Prince's teacher.

703
00:37:53,728 --> 00:37:54,928
The Second Chamber
naturally has less say

704
00:37:54,928 --> 00:37:56,407
in the presence of the First Chamber.

705
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:57,808
Usually,

706
00:37:57,968 --> 00:37:59,608
First Aunt would reprimand Lou Yao

707
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:01,848
in front of others

708
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:03,608
and not leave him any dignity.

709
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:08,768
No wonder when I first met Yao,

710
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:10,928
he always looked so timid.

711
00:38:11,768 --> 00:38:12,808
When he was bullied,

712
00:38:12,808 --> 00:38:14,728
he would just keep quiet
and not defend himself.

713
00:38:15,407 --> 00:38:17,928
After you married into the Lou family,

714
00:38:18,888 --> 00:38:20,327
I'm afraid you'll have

715
00:38:20,327 --> 00:38:21,648
to suffer these grievances with us.

716
00:38:25,247 --> 00:38:26,407
Yanji, rest assured.

717
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:27,487
I'm not

718
00:38:27,487 --> 00:38:29,207
someone who'd allow myself to suffer
from grievances.

719
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:32,207
If they dare to bully Yao in the future,

720
00:38:33,327 --> 00:38:34,567
I'll confront

721
00:38:34,567 --> 00:38:35,688
and reason with them.

722
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:39,247
So you've shown your true colors.

723
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:40,888
Before this,

724
00:38:41,247 --> 00:38:43,968
Second Aunt praised Fourth Lady Cheng
to be gentle and virtuous.

725
00:38:44,608 --> 00:38:46,287
I thought you've changed

726
00:38:46,287 --> 00:38:47,247
because you were possessed by demons.

727
00:38:47,928 --> 00:38:48,808
Unfortunately,

728
00:38:48,968 --> 00:38:50,768
you were already exposed so much sooner.

729
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:52,608
In the face
of a bossy and domineering person,

730
00:38:53,407 --> 00:38:55,088
of course I'd be rude and unreasonable.

731
00:38:56,407 --> 00:38:57,928
But in the face of

732
00:38:58,247 --> 00:38:59,567
someone gentle and virtuous like Yanji,

733
00:39:00,167 --> 00:39:01,688
I'd naturally treat them courteously.

734
00:39:03,928 --> 00:39:04,728
Lou Li,

735
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:06,688
you should think

736
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,008
about why am I
always acting unreasonably

737
00:39:08,327 --> 00:39:10,088
when you see me?

738
00:39:10,088 --> 00:39:11,008
Don't get ahead of yourself.

739
00:39:11,648 --> 00:39:13,608
It's the biggest blessing for you
to be married into our Lou family.

740
00:39:14,207 --> 00:39:15,608
If Zhaojun didn't marry someone else,

741
00:39:15,768 --> 00:39:16,808
do you think you have a chance?

742
00:39:16,808 --> 00:39:17,808
Lou Li, keep quiet.

743
00:39:20,088 --> 00:39:21,567
Yanji, are you going to scold me

744
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,127
because of an outsider?

745
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:24,688
Mother was right.

746
00:39:25,487 --> 00:39:26,848
Second Uncle died too early.

747
00:39:26,848 --> 00:39:28,608
That's why the Second Chamber
lacks parental upbringing.

748
00:39:28,608 --> 00:39:29,407
You...

749
00:39:30,487 --> 00:39:31,287
Lou Li,

750
00:39:31,848 --> 00:39:33,008
since you mention upbringing,

751
00:39:33,608 --> 00:39:35,367
allow me to reason with you.

752
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:37,167
When I marry

753
00:39:37,407 --> 00:39:38,407
into the Lou family in the future,

754
00:39:39,207 --> 00:39:40,407
I'd be your Second Sister-in-law.

755
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:42,367
You yelled and make threatening gestures

756
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:44,327
toward your Second Sister-in-law,

757
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:45,608
do you call this good upbringing?

758
00:39:46,207 --> 00:39:48,207
You speak of this
when you're not part of the Lou.

759
00:39:48,207 --> 00:39:48,928
How shameless of you.

760
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:49,567
All right.

761
00:39:50,407 --> 00:39:51,928
I may not be
your Second Sister-in-law now.

762
00:39:52,527 --> 00:39:53,808
But I'm
the Lou's family distinguished guest.

763
00:39:54,688 --> 00:39:55,688
As the host,

764
00:39:56,247 --> 00:39:57,167
you reproach and make things difficult

765
00:39:57,247 --> 00:39:58,728
for your distinguished guest.

766
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:02,008
Is this how the Lou family
treats their guests?

767
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:04,608
Is this the so-called upbringing
of the First Chamber?

768
00:40:04,888 --> 00:40:06,167
You're not a distinguished guest.

769
00:40:06,768 --> 00:40:07,688
Listen.

770
00:40:07,888 --> 00:40:09,648
My mother likes Zhaojun.

771
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:12,167
When she heard about being in-laws
with the Cheng family,

772
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:13,487
she had never been happy.

773
00:40:13,728 --> 00:40:15,888
You mother likes Young Lady He.

774
00:40:18,327 --> 00:40:20,728
Why didn't you ask the male members
of the First Chamber to marry her?

775
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,968
That's because

776
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:28,608
the Second Chamber likes Zhaojun more.

777
00:40:32,008 --> 00:40:33,127
I see.

778
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:35,567
Yes.

779
00:40:37,327 --> 00:40:38,008
Unfortunately,

780
00:40:38,327 --> 00:40:39,247
your future mother-in-law

781
00:40:39,247 --> 00:40:40,728
doesn't like you at all.

782
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:42,928
You lack parental upbringing
since young.

783
00:40:43,127 --> 00:40:44,968
You have no learning, no skills,
and no patience.

784
00:40:45,127 --> 00:40:46,247
You're unworthy

785
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:47,127
to the prominent Lou family.

786
00:40:47,127 --> 00:40:48,207
What did you say?

787
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:51,287
Mother.

788
00:40:58,928 --> 00:41:00,008
Forgive me for not knowing.

789
00:41:00,728 --> 00:41:01,928
This young lady

790
00:41:02,207 --> 00:41:04,407
must be First Madam's daughter.

791
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:05,247
Yes, she is.

792
00:41:05,848 --> 00:41:08,207
She's the only daughter in the family,

793
00:41:08,648 --> 00:41:09,648
Lou Li.

794
00:41:11,127 --> 00:41:14,567
Grand Tutor Lou was granted
to teach the Crown Prince.

795
00:41:15,407 --> 00:41:18,728
First Madam is from a noble family
that's cultured.

796
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:20,808
Young Lady Lou

797
00:41:20,968 --> 00:41:23,367
has parental upbringing since young.

798
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,768
You shouldn't behave like Shaoshang

799
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:28,167
who has no manners.

800
00:41:29,207 --> 00:41:31,088
Lou Li is the daughter
of the First Chamber.

801
00:41:31,487 --> 00:41:34,447
But I was unable to constrain her.

802
00:41:34,928 --> 00:41:36,407
I hope you can forgive her.

803
00:41:36,808 --> 00:41:38,367
You and Young Lady Lou

804
00:41:38,928 --> 00:41:40,167
are peers

805
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:41,808
and you're from the Second Chamber.

806
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:43,848
Why should you constrain her?

807
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:46,768
Speaking of this,

808
00:41:47,207 --> 00:41:49,327
it should be the parents duty to do it.

809
00:41:50,247 --> 00:41:51,888
How can it be someone else to do it?

810
00:41:53,648 --> 00:41:55,167
The Lou family doesn't need you to...

811
00:41:57,688 --> 00:41:58,327
Mother.

812
00:41:59,447 --> 00:42:01,768
Shaoshang is in talks of marriage
with your cousin.

813
00:42:02,327 --> 00:42:03,648
She'll be part of the family
in the future.

814
00:42:04,207 --> 00:42:05,728
It's her first time here.

815
00:42:05,728 --> 00:42:07,008
How could you humiliate her
in such manner?

816
00:42:07,728 --> 00:42:09,327
How are you going
to face your cousin in the future?

817
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,888
He treats you well for nothing.

818
00:42:15,608 --> 00:42:17,008
I hope you don't be bothered

819
00:42:17,527 --> 00:42:18,888
by this young girl.

820
00:42:25,327 --> 00:42:26,808
Just now, Lou Li said

821
00:42:27,088 --> 00:42:29,127
First Madam likes Zhaojun the most.

822
00:42:29,608 --> 00:42:30,648
If we know this earlier,

823
00:42:30,768 --> 00:42:32,527
Yao shouldn't have be engaged to her.

824
00:42:32,768 --> 00:42:33,768
The male member of the First Chamber

825
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:35,968
should have married Zhaojun earlier.

826
00:42:36,207 --> 00:42:38,207
Then, there won't be
so much trouble today.

827
00:42:45,247 --> 00:42:47,127
It looks like you haven't learned
enough manners.

828
00:42:47,327 --> 00:42:49,407
How dare you spout nonsense
in front of the guests?

829
00:42:50,207 --> 00:42:51,447
Go back and reflect on your mistakes!

830
00:42:56,928 --> 00:42:57,848
Don't be too pleased of yourself.

831
00:43:06,648 --> 00:43:08,648
Why aren't you thanking First Madam?

832
00:43:11,688 --> 00:43:14,407
Thank you First Aunt
for speaking up for me.
