(Ling's Residence)

4
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:18,000
(Ling's Residence)

5
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:31,303
Please wait here.

6
00:02:39,662 --> 00:02:41,142
Why did they make us wait here?

7
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:43,022
All of them look so vicious.

8
00:02:43,662 --> 00:02:45,183
They didn't even offer
a bowl of hot soup.

9
00:02:46,743 --> 00:02:47,582
Father,

10
00:02:48,423 --> 00:02:50,423
this is how cold Ling Buyi is.

11
00:02:50,863 --> 00:02:51,942
But I didn't expect

12
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:54,743
that his residence is this cold
and gloomy.

13
00:02:55,622 --> 00:02:56,982
It doesn't look like a residence at all.

14
00:02:57,863 --> 00:02:58,863
It looks more like a barrack.

15
00:03:01,622 --> 00:03:03,863
But why is there not
a single female servant here?

16
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:05,703
You're a lady, aren't you?

17
00:03:12,062 --> 00:03:13,102
He scared me to death.

18
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:15,582
It's already enough to have you alone.

19
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:20,102
General Ling, you're wounded.

20
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:22,823
You didn't have to come out
and welcome us.

21
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:24,423
You should sit and rest.

22
00:03:25,303 --> 00:03:27,183
I felt cooped up
for lying in bed all the time.

23
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:29,383
So I came out to take a breath.

24
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:32,662
May I know

25
00:03:33,982 --> 00:03:35,142
what brings you here, General Cheng?

26
00:03:36,703 --> 00:03:39,263
You saved my daughter's life.

27
00:03:39,263 --> 00:03:40,863
So I should come and say thank you.

28
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:52,662
Fourth Lady Cheng.

29
00:03:54,022 --> 00:03:54,903
Please take a seat.

30
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:57,223
I don't want to.

31
00:03:57,462 --> 00:03:59,303
Let's not sit, Father. Hurry.

32
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:03,343
I have to thank you for saving her.

33
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:06,863
Otherwise, my daughter would
have fallen off the cliff.

34
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:09,223
Shaoshang,
you should thank General Ling.

35
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:10,622
Thank you, General Ling.

36
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:12,942
I hope you'll take care of yourself.

37
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:14,383
If I want to take care of myself,

38
00:04:15,383 --> 00:04:16,542
I wouldn't have saved you.

39
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,383
(Why is General Ling so tactless?)

40
00:04:21,982 --> 00:04:23,423
(You insisted to come.)

41
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,903
(Let's go, Father. We should leave now.)

42
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:28,223
(All right.)

43
00:04:30,823 --> 00:04:31,823
General Ling.

44
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:32,982
Since you're injured,

45
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:34,502
you should get more rest.

46
00:04:34,823 --> 00:04:36,502
Both of us, mother and daughter
won't be in your way now.

47
00:04:36,502 --> 00:04:37,343
It's father and daughter.

48
00:04:38,622 --> 00:04:39,783
Did I say it wrongly?

49
00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:43,703
My wife and I also prepared a gift
as a token of gratitude

50
00:04:43,823 --> 00:04:45,502
and delivered it here now.

51
00:04:46,343 --> 00:04:47,142
We shall take our leave now.

52
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:08,662
I don't know if it was my illusion.

53
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,183
I feel that Ling Buyi is particularly

54
00:05:11,303 --> 00:05:12,542
not happy with me today.

55
00:05:12,662 --> 00:05:14,263
Every single thing he said irritates me

56
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:16,462
as if he can't wait to swallow me alive.

57
00:05:16,462 --> 00:05:17,582
It wasn't your illusion.

58
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:19,102
From the moment he saw you,

59
00:05:19,383 --> 00:05:20,743
he looked extremely moody.

60
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,223
He was mean in his words too.

61
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:23,303
Father,

62
00:05:23,502 --> 00:05:25,263
when did you offend him?

63
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:27,582
They say scholars despise each other.

64
00:05:28,303 --> 00:05:29,863
Who would have known
it's the same for soldiers?

65
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:31,183
It's my fault

66
00:05:31,423 --> 00:05:32,502
for being outstanding.

67
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:33,622
Even he's jealous of me.

68
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:35,942
I get it.

69
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,743
Father, we should go back now.

70
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:39,062
My legs turned jelly just now.

71
00:05:39,303 --> 00:05:41,622
Lady Cheng, General Cheng, please stop.

72
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:51,783
Young Master found
half a jade pendant just now.

73
00:05:52,062 --> 00:05:54,062
He thinks you must
have accidentally dropped it.

74
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:56,823
But he couldn't find
the other half no matter what.

75
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:57,823
So

76
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:00,263
he needs you to return
and search for it.

77
00:06:01,343 --> 00:06:02,383
I'll go and find it now.

78
00:06:08,062 --> 00:06:10,423
We heard you have great strength

79
00:06:10,423 --> 00:06:12,263
and that you can fight ten people
at one time.

80
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:13,223
All of us want

81
00:06:13,223 --> 00:06:15,343
to ask for your advice on this matter.

82
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:17,823
General Liang,

83
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:19,903
I have some matters
to take care of at home.

84
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:20,903
Let's pick another day.

85
00:06:21,062 --> 00:06:21,903
We'll do it another day.

86
00:06:23,423 --> 00:06:24,263
Niaoniao,

87
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,823
take good care of yourself.

88
00:06:27,863 --> 00:06:28,783
You can do it!

89
00:06:42,863 --> 00:06:44,502
You threaten me with the jade pendant.

90
00:06:45,102 --> 00:06:46,183
General Ling, this isn't

91
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:47,823
the way of a gentleman.

92
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:54,183
Are you really that scared of me?

93
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:56,223
Do you have to bring your father

94
00:06:56,823 --> 00:06:58,423
to boost your courage to visit me?

95
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,022
My old wound relapsed because of you.

96
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:06,982
Yet, you're reluctant
to come and visit me.

97
00:07:08,982 --> 00:07:10,823
General Ling,
does your wound still hurt?

98
00:07:11,383 --> 00:07:12,662
You only asked if it hurts.

99
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:16,062
Are you not going to ask
if it affects archery and horse riding?

100
00:07:17,343 --> 00:07:18,343
It's better if it doesn't hurt.

101
00:07:18,942 --> 00:07:20,383
Is it that important

102
00:07:20,703 --> 00:07:21,942
if you can ride a horse or draw a bow?

103
00:07:22,783 --> 00:07:23,903
When we were in Hua County,

104
00:07:25,102 --> 00:07:26,383
only you would ask

105
00:07:27,183 --> 00:07:28,263
if it hurts.

106
00:07:31,062 --> 00:07:32,582
You're indeed special.

107
00:07:35,783 --> 00:07:36,542
Young Master.

108
00:07:41,383 --> 00:07:42,183
Young Master.

109
00:07:42,183 --> 00:07:43,542
The Crown Prince
is leading Princess Yuchang here

110
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:44,743
to visit you.

111
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:47,102
Princess Yuchang?

112
00:07:51,783 --> 00:07:53,223
Why is she coming here?

113
00:07:54,582 --> 00:07:55,622
I'm not close to her.

114
00:07:57,383 --> 00:07:59,542
Doesn't she come often?

115
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:01,383
Everyone in the capital knows

116
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:02,502
that she adores you.

117
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,142
She doesn't come

118
00:08:12,343 --> 00:08:13,863
that often.

119
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:28,703
General Ling.

120
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,102
Since you have guests,

121
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,383
I should leave now.

122
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:32,502
About my jade pendant...

123
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:33,863
His Highness,
the Crown Prince has arrived.

124
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:34,823
Zisheng!

125
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:46,062
Greetings, Your Highness.

126
00:08:46,622 --> 00:08:47,662
Zisheng, you can drop the formalities.

127
00:08:48,022 --> 00:08:49,542
Shanjian said you're seriously injured.

128
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:50,662
So I came to check on you.

129
00:08:53,383 --> 00:08:55,343
I saw how anxious Shaoshang was.

130
00:08:55,343 --> 00:08:56,903
So I thought you were seriously injured.

131
00:08:57,982 --> 00:08:58,903
General Ling,

132
00:08:59,263 --> 00:09:00,703
I hope you don't find me a disturbance.

133
00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:02,662
If I say you are,

134
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:04,622
would you not come?

135
00:09:05,102 --> 00:09:06,823
Shanjian was only worried about you.

136
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:09,183
Actually, all of us are worried
about you.

137
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,502
Yuchang, in particular.

138
00:09:10,502 --> 00:09:12,022
She was worried that she couldn't sleep.

139
00:09:18,462 --> 00:09:19,783
Who's this young lady?

140
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,703
I'm the daughter of Marquis Quling,
Cheng Shaoshang.

141
00:09:23,942 --> 00:09:24,942
Greetings, Your Highness.

142
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:27,383
She's Fourth Lady Cheng

143
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:29,903
who had to break off her betrothal
with the Lou Family.

144
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:34,582
Shaoshang,

145
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,863
I worry about you every day

146
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:37,263
after your betrothal was broken off.

147
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:38,743
Are you here to visit Zisheng

148
00:09:39,022 --> 00:09:41,022
because you have an ulterior motive?

149
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:42,383
I visit General Ling today

150
00:09:42,863 --> 00:09:44,462
to thank him for saving my life.

151
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:45,703
If you don't believe me,

152
00:09:46,223 --> 00:09:47,383
you can ask him.

153
00:09:48,383 --> 00:09:49,223
That's right.

154
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:52,582
I got injured because of her.

155
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:58,343
I'm afraid someone is using
gratitude as a pretext

156
00:09:58,343 --> 00:09:59,622
to shamelessly approach

157
00:09:59,902 --> 00:10:01,822
and cling to someone.

158
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:04,103
Who caused the bridge to collapse
so they can look at General Ling

159
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,143
but ended up falling into the lake.

160
00:10:05,943 --> 00:10:06,983
Who's the one clinging?

161
00:10:07,263 --> 00:10:08,103
Who's the shameless one here?

162
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:14,822
I invited Lady Cheng
to my residence today.

163
00:10:15,622 --> 00:10:16,782
Is there anything wrong?

164
00:10:23,143 --> 00:10:24,023
But she also

165
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,183
had private meetings with other men.

166
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:28,263
My maidservant saw them

167
00:10:28,423 --> 00:10:31,383
in a secluded place
beside Cheng's Shop.

168
00:10:31,742 --> 00:10:33,902
She said that person's figure
didn't look like Lou Yao

169
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:35,183
or your father.

170
00:10:35,183 --> 00:10:36,183
You're talking nonsense.

171
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:49,742
Lady Wang,

172
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,782
that man should be me.

173
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:56,742
Third Lady Cheng was there too.

174
00:10:57,183 --> 00:10:58,502
But she didn't come along
because she was occupied.

175
00:10:59,303 --> 00:11:01,103
I was delivering a message
for my Master.

176
00:11:01,263 --> 00:11:03,303
So I asked Shaoshang
to do me a favor.

177
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:04,983
Is there anything wrong?

178
00:11:06,662 --> 00:11:07,702
Some people think

179
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:10,023
all men and women behave immorally.

180
00:11:10,702 --> 00:11:11,862
Everyone seems to be indecent
no matter what they do.

181
00:11:12,462 --> 00:11:13,582
If there is anything shameful

182
00:11:13,782 --> 00:11:15,622
between me and Mr. Yuan,

183
00:11:15,622 --> 00:11:17,063
I'd get hit by a carriage and die
the moment I go out.

184
00:11:21,383 --> 00:11:22,263
General Ling,

185
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:24,303
take care. I'll get going now.

186
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:32,023
This matter concerns
the reputation of the Yuan Clan.

187
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:33,063
I'll pick a day

188
00:11:33,063 --> 00:11:35,223
to meet the Cavalry General asking
for an explanation.

189
00:11:35,582 --> 00:11:36,383
Excuse me.

190
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,502
Lady Wang, you insulted

191
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:43,742
my distinguished guest in my residence.

192
00:11:44,143 --> 00:11:45,502
Are you planning

193
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:47,103
to get on my bad side from now on?

194
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:48,303
I...

195
00:11:48,502 --> 00:11:50,542
Zisheng, it's only a misunderstanding.

196
00:11:50,902 --> 00:11:51,702
Zisheng,

197
00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:53,582
did you ask Physician Sun
to examine your injuries?

198
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:54,383
No need.

199
00:11:55,622 --> 00:11:57,183
It doesn't matter if I get hurt.

200
00:11:57,622 --> 00:11:58,742
I think Your Highness

201
00:11:58,742 --> 00:11:59,943
should ask Physician Sun

202
00:11:59,943 --> 00:12:01,423
to check on Lady Wang.

203
00:12:02,063 --> 00:12:03,542
Ask him to examine her eyes

204
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:05,183
for blindness.

205
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:06,742
She'll go blind
if she doesn't get them treated.

206
00:12:08,023 --> 00:12:08,862
Guards!

207
00:12:09,702 --> 00:12:10,542
Send the guests out.

208
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:11,423
You...

209
00:12:20,943 --> 00:12:22,742
You don't have to do this.

210
00:12:22,902 --> 00:12:25,103
They're all relatives.
No need to be upset.

211
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:26,183
You...

212
00:12:27,183 --> 00:12:28,143
Zisheng, I...

213
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,360
(Ling's Residence)

214
00:12:46,822 --> 00:12:48,383
Where are you going, Elder Brother?

215
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:49,782
What happened?

216
00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:52,702
You look flustered
and lose your manners.

217
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:54,662
Yuchang is heartbroken
because of Zisheng.

218
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:55,902
I'm afraid she might do
something foolish.

219
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:57,343
You go inside first.

220
00:12:57,383 --> 00:12:58,303
I'll go after her.

221
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,080
(Ling's Residence)

222
00:13:14,103 --> 00:13:15,902
So what if he's the eldest son?

223
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:19,622
He doesn't look like a Crown Prince
even if he's in his imperial robe.

224
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,622
Your Highness,
Young Master has just retired.

225
00:13:38,742 --> 00:13:40,263
Please allow me to inform him
of your arrival.

226
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:42,702
Since he's already resting,

227
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:44,183
we won't be visiting him then.

228
00:13:44,622 --> 00:13:46,702
Uncle has obtained
some high-quality medicinal herbs.

229
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,462
Please brew them
and have Zisheng drink the concoction.

230
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:49,622
Yes, Your Highness.

231
00:14:28,983 --> 00:14:30,662
You've finally returned.

232
00:14:33,423 --> 00:14:35,023
You're 15 years late.

233
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:42,782
Herald

234
00:14:43,343 --> 00:14:45,862
of the Huo Family army, I, Han Wu,

235
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:49,343
call to pay Young Master's respect.

236
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,263
Since you're alive,

237
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:55,023
why didn't you show up?

238
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:57,303
You even waited for us to look for you.

239
00:14:57,742 --> 00:14:59,303
Do you know the crime

240
00:14:59,662 --> 00:15:00,862
of the Huo Army's deserter?

241
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,383
I do.

242
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:06,542
General Ling, I'll comply

243
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:08,023
however you want to punish me.

244
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:11,423
I never meant to have you look for me.

245
00:15:11,742 --> 00:15:13,862
When Gu City was breached that year,

246
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:16,462
I managed to survive.

247
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:19,023
I intended to reach out
to our fellow soldiers

248
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:21,902
and go to the capital
to report everything to His Majesty.

249
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:24,383
But every time I revealed my identity,

250
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:26,983
all the fellow soldiers
I reached out to were killed.

251
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:30,502
I could only hide my identity
and mingle in the marketplace

252
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:33,702
until I was found by General Liang.

253
00:15:36,023 --> 00:15:37,782
General Ling,

254
00:15:39,902 --> 00:15:42,303
you're safe and sound.

255
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:54,023
Tell me.

256
00:15:55,103 --> 00:15:56,702
On the day Gu City was breached

257
00:15:57,143 --> 00:15:59,103
and the Huo Army were wiped out,

258
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,662
where were you?

259
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:04,263
I wasn't in the city at the time.

260
00:16:04,742 --> 00:16:06,822
The General sent me away
to seek reinforcement.

261
00:16:07,943 --> 00:16:09,582
General Ling, you had no idea.

262
00:16:09,862 --> 00:16:11,063
Someone swapped

263
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:12,343
the armaments of the Gu City's garrison

264
00:16:12,782 --> 00:16:14,383
with low-quality armaments that year.

265
00:16:14,383 --> 00:16:15,542
It was hard to resist the enemy attack.

266
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,542
General Huo had no choice but to send me

267
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:18,662
and another fellow soldier

268
00:16:18,662 --> 00:16:21,183
to seek the Yue Clan's troops
that were stationed nearby

269
00:16:21,183 --> 00:16:23,542
and seek Lord Qian'an's army
for reinforcement.

270
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:26,343
But who would have thought

271
00:16:26,782 --> 00:16:28,423
that Gu City had been breached

272
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:32,622
before the reinforcements arrived.

273
00:16:38,702 --> 00:16:40,862
There was miasma hanging in the air
outside of Gu City that day.

274
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:44,622
The Yue and Lord Qian'an's army failed
to break through the fog.

275
00:16:46,742 --> 00:16:47,782
So

276
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,502
the reinforcement came three days late.

277
00:16:51,702 --> 00:16:53,143
I heard

278
00:16:53,582 --> 00:16:54,862
Marquis Yue dispatched

279
00:16:54,943 --> 00:16:57,183
a team of soldiers to investigate
the miasma that year.

280
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,822
All of them died.

281
00:16:59,423 --> 00:17:00,742
But then someone saw

282
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:03,423
the horses that were dispatched that day

283
00:17:03,902 --> 00:17:06,383
appeared in the barracks.

284
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:09,423
If the miasma was poisonous,

285
00:17:09,423 --> 00:17:13,183
why did the horses survive
when the men died?

286
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:19,943
Are you saying

287
00:17:22,183 --> 00:17:23,943
that the miasma isn't poisonous?

288
00:17:25,582 --> 00:17:26,542
I can't be certain now.

289
00:17:26,782 --> 00:17:28,423
I only find this suspicious.

290
00:17:30,023 --> 00:17:32,143
There's one thing
that's even more suspicious.

291
00:17:33,063 --> 00:17:34,502
After the miasma had dispersed,

292
00:17:34,702 --> 00:17:35,702
the military physicians went

293
00:17:35,862 --> 00:17:38,023
to the forest to examine
the bodies to report it.

294
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:39,622
However,

295
00:17:40,902 --> 00:17:42,423
these military physicians went missing

296
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:44,822
after that.

297
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:48,902
General Ling,

298
00:17:49,103 --> 00:17:51,423
I want to find out
what happened to these physicians.

299
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:53,822
If they're alive,

300
00:17:54,103 --> 00:17:56,023
we might be able to find some clues.

301
00:17:57,462 --> 00:17:58,303
All right.

302
00:17:59,902 --> 00:18:01,862
Thank you, Young Master.

303
00:18:11,983 --> 00:18:13,902
A romantic story was made

304
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,063
about a man and a woman just standing

305
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,183
at the entrance of Cheng's Shop.

306
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:22,983
But our Zisheng saved a woman

307
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:24,742
that his old injury relapsed.

308
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:26,862
Why didn't these blabbermouths

309
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,902
spread his heroic story
from mouth to mouth?

310
00:18:30,502 --> 00:18:31,782
Otherwise, why...

311
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:33,343
This word of mouth is

312
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:35,983
mostly gossip.

313
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:39,423
But without this gossip,

314
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:42,862
how can I take advantage
of the situation to marry them?

315
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:45,103
We've delayed Zisheng's marriage

316
00:18:45,462 --> 00:18:46,943
for so many years now.

317
00:18:47,103 --> 00:18:47,943
Your Majesty,

318
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:52,822
Zisheng has his own mind.

319
00:18:53,143 --> 00:18:54,782
You don't have to worry.

320
00:18:55,263 --> 00:18:57,063
But Fifth Princess talks all day

321
00:18:57,183 --> 00:19:00,223
about not getting married
and living freely

322
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,983
like Zisheng.

323
00:19:02,502 --> 00:19:03,383
Ridiculous.

324
00:19:05,063 --> 00:19:05,943
A young man focuses

325
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:08,622
on his career before settling down.

326
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,343
A young lady

327
00:19:10,343 --> 00:19:12,023
stalling to get married.

328
00:19:12,223 --> 00:19:13,183
If she gets older,

329
00:19:13,822 --> 00:19:14,943
the rumors would

330
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:16,983
be unpleasant to hear.

331
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:17,862
You're right.

332
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,103
Putting that aside,

333
00:19:19,263 --> 00:19:20,782
let's talk about the daughter
of the Cheng Family.

334
00:19:21,183 --> 00:19:23,263
She broke off the engagement
with the Lou Family

335
00:19:23,702 --> 00:19:25,263
for the sake of loyalty.

336
00:19:25,462 --> 00:19:27,063
But others gossip anyway.

337
00:19:27,423 --> 00:19:29,702
If Fifth Princess doesn't marry,

338
00:19:30,143 --> 00:19:31,902
how would the people talk

339
00:19:31,943 --> 00:19:33,303
about her?

340
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:36,183
I ordered her to get married

341
00:19:36,183 --> 00:19:37,502
for her sake.

342
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,502
It's a pity that most children

343
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:42,702
don't know their parents' hearts.

344
00:19:45,502 --> 00:19:46,502
Gossip is

345
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:48,383
always harsher

346
00:19:48,662 --> 00:19:49,702
on women

347
00:19:50,343 --> 00:19:51,782
in this world.

348
00:19:53,462 --> 00:19:54,782
I'm not asking her to marry far away.

349
00:19:55,223 --> 00:19:56,742
A marriage alliance

350
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:58,423
between the Yue and Xuan Clan

351
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:00,622
connected with the Wen Clan.

352
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:02,502
No matter how bad the conflicts are,

353
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:03,662
we're still family.

354
00:20:03,782 --> 00:20:06,902
What is so bad
about marrying the heir of the Marquis Yue?

355
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:10,303
You're always patient with Zisheng.

356
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,143
Fifth Princess is stubborn.

357
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:13,343
Your Majesty,

358
00:20:13,622 --> 00:20:16,143
you must reason with her nicely.

359
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,063
I take care of Zisheng

360
00:20:18,742 --> 00:20:20,983
because I owe Huo.

361
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:23,263
She's my birth daughter.

362
00:20:23,782 --> 00:20:24,782
How are they the same?

363
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:28,303
It's just hard

364
00:20:28,423 --> 00:20:31,542
to have Zisheng set his eyes on a lady.

365
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:34,542
Of course, I need to make
an effort to bring them together.

366
00:20:35,343 --> 00:20:38,063
How do you plan to bring them together?

367
00:20:50,622 --> 00:20:51,423
I shall have

368
00:20:52,063 --> 00:20:53,423
Lady Cheng present herself

369
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:55,822
in the palace.

370
00:21:39,983 --> 00:21:41,263
You still have the appetite to eat.

371
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,542
We received the edict and rushed
to enter the palace this early.

372
00:21:46,983 --> 00:21:48,782
I didn't even eat my breakfast.

373
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:50,223
Why would I lose my appetite?

374
00:21:54,582 --> 00:21:55,502
Tell me.

375
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,902
Did you make any mistakes

376
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,143
when you visited Ling Buyi that day?

377
00:22:01,223 --> 00:22:02,782
No, I didn't make any mistake.

378
00:22:03,662 --> 00:22:04,822
Father was with me.

379
00:22:05,462 --> 00:22:06,343
I wasn't there

380
00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:09,103
in the second half. So how would I know?

381
00:22:10,582 --> 00:22:11,902
I only noticed

382
00:22:11,902 --> 00:22:14,303
Ling Buyi didn't look
too happy that day.

383
00:22:15,263 --> 00:22:16,143
Could it be...

384
00:22:17,782 --> 00:22:19,223
I wonder if His Majesty's edict

385
00:22:20,303 --> 00:22:22,103
is good or bad.

386
00:22:23,902 --> 00:22:25,383
If it's bad, we can't escape it anyway.

387
00:22:25,502 --> 00:22:26,782
What's the point of worrying?

388
00:22:27,343 --> 00:22:29,383
I need to teach you
some life-saving rules first.

389
00:22:29,943 --> 00:22:32,023
When you meet the royalty
after entering the palace,

390
00:22:32,023 --> 00:22:33,263
you must kneel and greet them.

391
00:22:33,662 --> 00:22:35,462
Wish His Majesty long life

392
00:22:35,902 --> 00:22:37,622
and Her Majesty good health.

393
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:39,983
You must say your father's title first

394
00:22:40,223 --> 00:22:41,943
and then your name.

395
00:22:44,502 --> 00:22:45,902
Do you understand?

396
00:22:53,742 --> 00:22:56,103
(I can't remember if you teach me now.)

397
00:22:56,343 --> 00:22:57,662
(Why didn't you teach me earlier?)

398
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:58,702
(It's too late to regret now.)

399
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:24,702
Stop probing around.

400
00:23:28,223 --> 00:23:30,423
You can behave unruly at home.

401
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:33,462
You must not behave this way
when you're in the palace.

402
00:23:33,902 --> 00:23:35,983
Otherwise, you'll implicate
the Cheng Family

403
00:23:37,702 --> 00:23:39,462
and put everyone's life in danger.

404
00:23:40,143 --> 00:23:41,462
Do you understand?

405
00:24:02,383 --> 00:24:03,263
We can get off now.

406
00:24:19,822 --> 00:24:21,742
The female members of the Cheng Family
don't have to get off the carriage.

407
00:24:21,862 --> 00:24:23,423
His Majesty has said

408
00:24:23,423 --> 00:24:24,622
that the ladies don't walk fast.

409
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:26,502
It'll take too long
for them to reach Xuanming Hall.

410
00:24:27,183 --> 00:24:29,383
So they can ride the carriage
all the way to Xuanming Hall.

411
00:24:30,822 --> 00:24:31,742
It's better this way.

412
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:33,502
Take the carriage?

413
00:24:34,423 --> 00:24:35,383
All the way?

414
00:25:27,742 --> 00:25:28,462
I.

415
00:25:28,542 --> 00:25:29,502
I.

416
00:25:32,502 --> 00:25:33,303
I.

417
00:25:33,902 --> 00:25:36,702
-Greetings, His Majesty and Her Majesty.
-Greetings, His Majesty and Her Majesty.

418
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,303
-May His Majesty have a long life.
-May His Majesty have a long life.

419
00:25:39,303 --> 00:25:41,742
-May Her Majesty have good health.
-May Her Majesty have good health.

420
00:25:50,343 --> 00:25:51,183
Please rise.

421
00:25:51,702 --> 00:25:52,582
You may be seated.

422
00:25:54,782 --> 00:25:56,542
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

423
00:26:03,223 --> 00:26:04,263
What are you looking at?

424
00:26:06,383 --> 00:26:07,902
This lamp is huge.

425
00:26:08,983 --> 00:26:09,702
I've never seen

426
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:11,343
a house built so exquisitely.

427
00:26:11,343 --> 00:26:12,383
It's my first time seeing it

428
00:26:12,582 --> 00:26:13,822
so it's hard not to like it.

429
00:26:20,383 --> 00:26:21,223
Sit down.

430
00:26:29,983 --> 00:26:31,782
It's an honor for me and my family

431
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,063
to be summoned in your presence.

432
00:26:34,983 --> 00:26:36,742
Official Cheng,
you can drop the formalities.

433
00:26:37,782 --> 00:26:38,662
Previously,

434
00:26:38,782 --> 00:26:39,902
you had to compromise
and break off the betrothal

435
00:26:40,462 --> 00:26:42,502
with the Lou Family
for everyone's interest.

436
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:43,662
I

437
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,622
have yet complimented you

438
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:47,303
and your family for doing that.

439
00:26:47,782 --> 00:26:50,943
General He and his family died
as martyrs for the country.

440
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:54,423
My family is extremely impressed
by his virtue

441
00:26:54,662 --> 00:26:57,622
so we decided
to fulfill General He's dying wish.

442
00:26:57,822 --> 00:26:59,343
We didn't have to compromise.

443
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:01,023
You're too humble, Official Cheng.

444
00:27:01,263 --> 00:27:02,183
I still have

445
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,862
to reward you.

446
00:27:06,423 --> 00:27:07,303
That must be

447
00:27:07,782 --> 00:27:09,143
your daughter, right?

448
00:27:12,143 --> 00:27:12,862
Yes.

449
00:27:14,822 --> 00:27:15,822
Come here.

450
00:27:16,423 --> 00:27:19,183
Let me and Her Majesty take
a close look at you.

451
00:27:30,423 --> 00:27:31,702
I'm asking you to sit closer.

452
00:27:31,702 --> 00:27:32,822
How are we supposed to talk

453
00:27:33,223 --> 00:27:34,383
if you're too far away?

454
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:39,782
Don't move.

455
00:27:46,983 --> 00:27:48,423
Put it down. Put it down.

456
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,303
Lady Cheng,

457
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:17,742
your name is...

458
00:28:19,383 --> 00:28:20,143
I...

459
00:28:26,983 --> 00:28:28,943
My name is Cheng Shaoshang.

460
00:28:29,223 --> 00:28:30,502
I was named after Guqin string.

461
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:32,662
Shaoshang string.

462
00:28:33,902 --> 00:28:34,943
Shaoshang.

463
00:28:35,622 --> 00:28:37,103
It's indeed a good name.

464
00:28:38,303 --> 00:28:40,303
How old are you this year?

465
00:28:42,702 --> 00:28:45,542
I've reached the age of 15
for months now.

466
00:28:45,782 --> 00:28:46,822
Tell me.

467
00:28:46,983 --> 00:28:48,502
Do you feel sad

468
00:28:49,143 --> 00:28:50,183
after breaking off your betrothal

469
00:28:50,582 --> 00:28:51,782
with the son of the Lou Clan?

470
00:28:52,343 --> 00:28:53,343
Your Majesty,

471
00:28:54,103 --> 00:28:55,423
I do feel sad.

472
00:28:55,822 --> 00:28:57,742
But my family never wanted
to break off the betrothal.

473
00:28:57,983 --> 00:29:00,383
But we know we had no choice
but to do it.

474
00:29:00,662 --> 00:29:01,742
Why do you say so?

475
00:29:02,822 --> 00:29:03,902
I've read

476
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:06,622
a saying from a book.

477
00:29:08,103 --> 00:29:09,542
Heaven and earth are merciless.

478
00:29:09,943 --> 00:29:11,742
They treat everything
as disposable beings.

479
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:13,303
Several months ago,

480
00:29:13,303 --> 00:29:15,143
I witnessed the suffering of the people

481
00:29:15,343 --> 00:29:17,263
after the chaos happened in Hua county,
where my uncle took office.

482
00:29:17,502 --> 00:29:18,822
So I think

483
00:29:18,983 --> 00:29:20,983
it happened because heaven and earth

484
00:29:21,223 --> 00:29:22,702
were ruthless and indifferent
to the world.

485
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:24,423
So when we were born as humans,

486
00:29:24,423 --> 00:29:25,902
we should be kind and upright

487
00:29:25,902 --> 00:29:27,383
to help each other.

488
00:29:27,702 --> 00:29:29,742
If we live for our pride

489
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:31,343
and disregard people's cries,

490
00:29:31,662 --> 00:29:34,143
that's the behavior of an animal.

491
00:29:40,263 --> 00:29:43,303
Do you know which sage said this?

492
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:49,902
Confucius spoke of giving oneself
to justice.

493
00:29:50,183 --> 00:29:51,423
Mencius spoke of sacrificing
for righteousness.

494
00:29:51,822 --> 00:29:54,063
Xunzi said humans are evil by nature.

495
00:29:54,423 --> 00:29:56,103
So they were not the ones

496
00:29:56,103 --> 00:29:57,462
who said this saying.

497
00:29:58,143 --> 00:29:59,502
Legalists talked about advantages
and disadvantages

498
00:29:59,502 --> 00:30:00,742
while Moism talked about universal love.

499
00:30:00,742 --> 00:30:01,582
The former only cared about

500
00:30:01,742 --> 00:30:03,702
the benefits of the world

501
00:30:03,983 --> 00:30:05,902
and they didn't care
if the world is benevolent.

502
00:30:06,183 --> 00:30:06,902
The latter thought

503
00:30:07,343 --> 00:30:08,983
the world is too benevolent.

504
00:30:09,423 --> 00:30:10,662
Even so,

505
00:30:10,662 --> 00:30:12,263
people should cherish each other more.

506
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:13,582
So it was not them

507
00:30:14,183 --> 00:30:16,183
who said it either.

508
00:30:16,622 --> 00:30:19,423
The last one would be a Tao philosopher.

509
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:22,023
So it must be Laozi

510
00:30:23,023 --> 00:30:24,383
who said this.

511
00:30:24,702 --> 00:30:26,303
Why is it not Zhuangzi?

512
00:30:28,063 --> 00:30:30,143
I never read the scrolls about  Zhuangzi

513
00:30:30,143 --> 00:30:31,183
that Mother gave.

514
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,183
So I don't know what's written in it.

515
00:30:35,862 --> 00:30:37,383
You made a correct guess.

516
00:30:37,782 --> 00:30:39,263
But the interpretation is off.

517
00:30:40,023 --> 00:30:41,223
Heaven and earth are merciless.

518
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,943
They treat everything
as disposable beings.

519
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:45,143
It's not about being indifferent

520
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,542
and treating everything as disposals.

521
00:30:47,343 --> 00:30:48,423
But it means

522
00:30:48,622 --> 00:30:51,582
heaven and earth treat
everything equally.

523
00:30:51,782 --> 00:30:53,943
Let nature take its course.

524
00:30:55,582 --> 00:30:57,822
So this is what it means.

525
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:58,622
I had no idea too.

526
00:30:58,622 --> 00:30:59,462
Official Cheng,

527
00:31:00,862 --> 00:31:01,662
impressive.

528
00:31:01,983 --> 00:31:02,782
You've taught

529
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:04,343
your daughter well.

530
00:31:05,742 --> 00:31:06,902
Not at all, Your Majesty.

531
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:08,943
My wife taught her well.

532
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,423
Your Majesty,

533
00:31:15,023 --> 00:31:16,502
we didn't return home
for more than ten years

534
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:18,063
due to war expeditions.

535
00:31:18,662 --> 00:31:20,943
So General and I fail
to teach her well.

536
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:23,862
I hope Your Majesty can forgive us.

537
00:31:26,063 --> 00:31:26,943
Shaoshang,

538
00:31:27,462 --> 00:31:30,662
your parents held up your studies
because of the country.

539
00:31:30,902 --> 00:31:32,983
I can see how smart you are.

540
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:35,462
General Cheng and Madam Cheng

541
00:31:35,582 --> 00:31:37,343
only need to make a little effort.

542
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,103
I'm sure they'll teach you well.

543
00:31:42,103 --> 00:31:43,702
Thank you for your praise, Your Majesty.

544
00:31:46,223 --> 00:31:48,063
Your Majesty, you're very beautiful.

545
00:31:53,023 --> 00:31:54,462
Niaoniao, don't speak recklessly.

546
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:57,782
It's my turn to ask you now.

547
00:31:58,343 --> 00:32:00,542
Is your mother or the empress

548
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:02,303
more beautiful?

549
00:32:06,063 --> 00:32:07,103
Her Majesty.

550
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:14,343
Your Majesty,

551
00:32:15,622 --> 00:32:17,023
she doesn't know the rules.

552
00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:19,662
She offended Her Majesty
during her first meeting.

553
00:32:20,303 --> 00:32:21,622
Please forgive her, Your Majesty.

554
00:32:22,383 --> 00:32:23,423
Please pardon her, Your Majesty.

555
00:32:23,782 --> 00:32:24,862
No matter.

556
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:26,502
I think this child is

557
00:32:27,622 --> 00:32:29,223
honest.

558
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,103
An interesting child.

559
00:32:35,183 --> 00:32:35,943
Speaking of which,

560
00:32:36,103 --> 00:32:38,303
you received the edict early
in the morning.

561
00:32:38,742 --> 00:32:40,542
I'm sure you haven't taken
your breakfast.

562
00:32:42,983 --> 00:32:44,542
Father and Mother haven't taken
their breakfast.

563
00:32:45,622 --> 00:32:46,662
But I already had mine.

564
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:49,263
I ate a pancake
in the carriage just now.

565
00:32:49,462 --> 00:32:50,782
But I'm hungry now.

566
00:32:50,943 --> 00:32:52,143
Oh, you already ate a pancake?

567
00:32:52,423 --> 00:32:53,742
Good. All right.

568
00:32:54,063 --> 00:32:55,902
Then all of you can stay

569
00:32:55,902 --> 00:32:57,943
and have lunch with me.

570
00:32:58,023 --> 00:32:58,822
What do you say?

571
00:33:00,822 --> 00:33:01,702
I think it's all right.

572
00:33:01,822 --> 00:33:02,822
You think it's all right?

573
00:33:04,423 --> 00:33:05,462
Good!

574
00:33:09,502 --> 00:33:12,622
Your Majesty,
General Wan has entered the palace.

575
00:33:12,702 --> 00:33:14,502
He's currently waiting at Chongde Hall.

576
00:33:14,502 --> 00:33:15,303
It's Mr. Wan.

577
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:16,223
All right.

578
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:17,462
I'll be there.

579
00:33:17,822 --> 00:33:18,782
Official Cheng, Madam Cheng.

580
00:33:19,023 --> 00:33:21,702
Join me and Official Wan
for a conversation.

581
00:33:22,303 --> 00:33:22,983
Yes, Your Majesty.

582
00:33:22,983 --> 00:33:23,862
Madam Zhai,

583
00:33:23,862 --> 00:33:25,462
take Lady Cheng

584
00:33:25,582 --> 00:33:28,103
to Changqiu Palace's side hall
for a rest.

585
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:31,103
Let's have a family feast later.

586
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:01,782
I'll go and help Her Majesty
get changed.

587
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:03,782
Lady Cheng, please have a seat.

588
00:34:38,423 --> 00:34:40,343
(It's actually made of elm.)

589
00:34:40,983 --> 00:34:42,143
(How frugal.)

590
00:34:56,143 --> 00:34:58,223
(This hall is more than 10 meters high.)

591
00:34:58,983 --> 00:35:00,622
(But two people can hug
around this column.)

592
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:04,023
(Clearly, it doesn't rely
on the columns and beams for support.)

593
00:35:05,343 --> 00:35:08,223
(This is different from the houses
of ordinary people.)

594
00:35:08,822 --> 00:35:10,263
(I wonder what method did they use)

595
00:35:10,263 --> 00:35:11,183
(to build this hall.)

596
00:35:16,143 --> 00:35:16,943
Mother!

597
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:18,902
Fifth Princess,
Her Majesty is changing her clothes.

598
00:35:19,143 --> 00:35:20,303
Your Highness. Your Highness!

599
00:35:20,303 --> 00:35:21,103
Mother,

600
00:35:21,983 --> 00:35:24,502
they said you and Father have
something important to discuss

601
00:35:25,622 --> 00:35:27,582
and refused to let me in.

602
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:30,383
Your father indeed has
an important matter to take care of.

603
00:35:30,582 --> 00:35:32,023
Why would I lie to you?

604
00:35:32,862 --> 00:35:35,542
As a princess of the royal family,

605
00:35:35,822 --> 00:35:37,263
you're familiar with the palace rules.

606
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,582
How can you cause a stir as you enter?

607
00:35:39,902 --> 00:35:41,462
If your father hears you,

608
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:43,502
he'll punish you again.

609
00:35:43,502 --> 00:35:45,143
Father is partial.

610
00:35:45,462 --> 00:35:46,782
As a princess,

611
00:35:46,782 --> 00:35:48,822
I have less freedom
than other ordinary girls.

612
00:35:49,902 --> 00:35:51,943
You were born with a silver spoon
in your mouth.

613
00:35:52,263 --> 00:35:54,263
Your father never mistreated you at all.

614
00:35:54,383 --> 00:35:56,742
Isn't swimming in luxury also
a kind of mistreatment?

615
00:35:57,263 --> 00:35:59,063
You don't lack food or clothes too.

616
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,383
But why do you frown every day?

617
00:36:02,023 --> 00:36:03,822
It's because Father only has eyes

618
00:36:03,822 --> 00:36:05,822
for Yue Heng and her children.

619
00:36:06,023 --> 00:36:07,702
Everyone knows

620
00:36:07,702 --> 00:36:09,263
that Yue Heng is the real empress.

621
00:36:09,343 --> 00:36:10,183
How dare you!

622
00:36:36,423 --> 00:36:38,063
Who feeds you

623
00:36:38,223 --> 00:36:40,263
with these incitement words?

624
00:36:42,943 --> 00:36:44,702
The aides at my residence.

625
00:36:45,063 --> 00:36:47,582
They were planning for my future.
They never try to incite anything.

626
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:48,862
You're a woman.

627
00:36:48,943 --> 00:36:50,702
You don't need to manage state affairs.

628
00:36:50,782 --> 00:36:51,983
Why do you need aides?

629
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:54,143
You'll be married off to the Yue Clan.

630
00:36:54,143 --> 00:36:56,063
Yet, you keep these men close to you.

631
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:59,462
What would Marquis Yue think?

632
00:36:59,622 --> 00:37:02,023
This is why I'm here today.

633
00:37:02,183 --> 00:37:03,542
I don't want to marry into that family.

634
00:37:04,063 --> 00:37:06,423
I don't want to marry Marquis Yue's son.

635
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:08,862
Yue Heng's nephew is not talented
in anything.

636
00:37:08,862 --> 00:37:10,742
He's even worse
than Third Princess's husband.

637
00:37:10,943 --> 00:37:12,742
Why did we give Xuan Clan
talented and educated men

638
00:37:12,742 --> 00:37:13,902
for the marriage alliance

639
00:37:13,902 --> 00:37:16,143
while the Yue Clan had to make me
marry that dissolute person?

640
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:17,702
They're clearly trying to ruin me

641
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,223
and insult you.

642
00:37:19,223 --> 00:37:20,063
Ridiculous!

643
00:37:26,103 --> 00:37:28,303
Third Princess used to like Zisheng.

644
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:30,183
But after your father granted
her marriage.

645
00:37:30,183 --> 00:37:32,343
She was willing to marry
into the Xuan Clan.

646
00:37:32,502 --> 00:37:33,822
Why can't you do the same?

647
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,423
That's because Ling Zisheng
is not interested in her.

648
00:37:40,822 --> 00:37:43,662
The Xuan Clan's male members
are not inferior to Ling Buyi.

649
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:44,782
She had no choice but to marry.

650
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,462
If I agree to marry that dissolute man,

651
00:37:47,822 --> 00:37:49,143
she's going to laugh at me.

652
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:53,662
If only you saw

653
00:37:53,862 --> 00:37:54,742
how Fifth Princess cried

654
00:37:54,742 --> 00:37:56,782
while looking flustered
as she entered Changqiu Palace.

655
00:37:57,103 --> 00:37:58,542
It was hilarious.

656
00:37:59,103 --> 00:37:59,742
It looks like

657
00:37:59,742 --> 00:38:00,943
Father is determined

658
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:02,702
to let her marry into Uncle's family.

659
00:38:03,263 --> 00:38:04,143
She's unbelievable.

660
00:38:04,303 --> 00:38:05,263
What's there to complain about?

661
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:08,063
To marry such an insolent bride.

662
00:38:08,183 --> 00:38:09,782
It's a loss for Uncle.

663
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,143
Your cousin lives a dissolute life.

664
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:15,542
It's not surprising

665
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:17,742
that Fifth Princess refused
to marry him.

666
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:19,063
Why should she?

667
00:38:20,103 --> 00:38:21,943
I liked Zisheng in the past.

668
00:38:22,103 --> 00:38:24,263
Father made me marry into the Xuan Clan.

669
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:25,742
Didn't I marry in tears?

670
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:27,383
We're both princesses.

671
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:28,502
So we must have
the same type of marriage.

672
00:38:28,622 --> 00:38:30,183
What gives her the right not to marry?

673
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,822
I suggest you stop daydreaming.

674
00:38:34,223 --> 00:38:37,023
If Zisheng likes someone
with an ugly personality like you,

675
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:40,143
would your father worry
about him all these years?

676
00:38:40,622 --> 00:38:42,263
I'm afraid a number of ladies
who are qualified to marry him

677
00:38:42,343 --> 00:38:44,462
have surrounded the capital.

678
00:38:44,582 --> 00:38:45,622
Mother,

679
00:38:46,183 --> 00:38:48,183
how can you belittle your daughter?

680
00:38:49,103 --> 00:38:50,063
You don't want to admit it?

681
00:38:53,063 --> 00:38:56,143
Your husband of the Xuan Clan
has rendered meritorious service.

682
00:38:56,263 --> 00:38:57,462
Not only his family has
a good reputation,

683
00:38:57,462 --> 00:38:59,343
but he's also upright.

684
00:38:59,822 --> 00:39:01,383
Think about your cousin.

685
00:39:01,702 --> 00:39:04,143
He spends all day at the brothels.

686
00:39:04,582 --> 00:39:06,143
Which lady is willing to marry him?

687
00:39:06,702 --> 00:39:08,902
Would you be willing

688
00:39:09,143 --> 00:39:10,143
to swap your husband with her?

689
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:12,462
Fifth Princess has countless aides
at her residence.

690
00:39:12,862 --> 00:39:14,502
They spend time together every day

691
00:39:14,622 --> 00:39:16,183
and pretend to discuss state affairs.

692
00:39:16,462 --> 00:39:18,822
Who knows what they do behind our backs?

693
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:20,423
Fifth Princess is not willing to marry

694
00:39:21,023 --> 00:39:22,822
because she looks down on the Yue Clan.

695
00:39:22,983 --> 00:39:24,782
Stop sowing discord.

696
00:39:26,103 --> 00:39:28,103
You grew up in your uncle's house.

697
00:39:28,423 --> 00:39:30,383
I'm sure he always tells you

698
00:39:30,383 --> 00:39:32,702
about the grudge between
Changqiu Palace and the Yue Clan.

699
00:39:34,263 --> 00:39:35,862
Let me make myself clear in this matter.

700
00:39:36,303 --> 00:39:37,223
I only want

701
00:39:38,063 --> 00:39:39,983
a quiet life.

702
00:39:40,343 --> 00:39:42,702
Put away your funny business

703
00:39:42,702 --> 00:39:44,542
and don't cause me any trouble.

704
00:39:45,303 --> 00:39:46,143
Or else,

705
00:39:46,462 --> 00:39:47,902
I'll never speak for you.

706
00:39:49,902 --> 00:39:51,103
It's already late.

707
00:39:51,862 --> 00:39:52,983
Go and attend the family feast.

708
00:39:53,742 --> 00:39:54,742
You're not going?

709
00:39:56,183 --> 00:39:58,263
I hate those kinds of boring feasts.

710
00:39:58,622 --> 00:40:00,143
We're not close anyway.

711
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:02,423
Why must we pretend
to be happy together?

712
00:40:02,423 --> 00:40:04,542
Are you going
to let Changqiu Palace steal the show?

713
00:40:05,983 --> 00:40:09,303
Do I look like I care
who gets to steal the show?

714
00:40:09,902 --> 00:40:10,702
You're not happy?

715
00:40:11,502 --> 00:40:12,423
I refuse to give in.

716
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:15,063
If they say men and women
should marry on coming of age,

717
00:40:15,143 --> 00:40:17,103
Ling Zisheng is still not married.

718
00:40:17,343 --> 00:40:19,462
Why did Father
let him live freely?

719
00:40:20,023 --> 00:40:22,263
Father spoils him more
than he spoils us.

720
00:40:22,423 --> 00:40:23,662
Could it be

721
00:40:23,742 --> 00:40:25,782
that Ling Buyi is Father's son
who was stranded out there?

722
00:40:25,782 --> 00:40:26,542
You!

723
00:40:28,943 --> 00:40:30,822
How could you insult
your father this way?

724
00:40:32,383 --> 00:40:34,502
Zisheng is General Huo's nephew.

725
00:40:34,742 --> 00:40:36,423
The only descendant of the Huo Family.

726
00:40:36,622 --> 00:40:37,502
That year,

727
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:40,183
all of the Huo Family died
to save the whole nation.

728
00:40:40,343 --> 00:40:42,702
Your father has been feeling guilty
to this day.

729
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:46,383
How could you utter such cold words?

730
00:40:46,662 --> 00:40:49,383
Huo Chong was only Ling Zisheng's uncle.

731
00:40:49,622 --> 00:40:50,822
No matter how many people die,

732
00:40:50,822 --> 00:40:52,542
they're only from the maternal side.

733
00:40:53,343 --> 00:40:55,822
His parents are obviously still alive.

734
00:40:56,023 --> 00:40:58,462
He was the odd one
who refused to get close to them.

735
00:40:58,462 --> 00:40:59,502
Yet, he shamelessly stayed here

736
00:40:59,502 --> 00:41:01,023
to steal my parents.

737
00:41:01,023 --> 00:41:01,742
How is this reasonable?

738
00:41:01,742 --> 00:41:02,502
Quiet!

739
00:41:03,383 --> 00:41:04,702
If you keep spouting nonsense,

740
00:41:05,183 --> 00:41:06,622
I'm going to punish you!

741
00:41:09,183 --> 00:41:10,702
Just punish me then.

742
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:12,702
I know you're angry
because I'm disobedient.

743
00:41:12,943 --> 00:41:15,223
But I want to do what men do.

744
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,143
Walk into the court,
make contributions to the country,

745
00:41:17,303 --> 00:41:18,902
and be an accomplished lady.

746
00:41:19,303 --> 00:41:21,582
I will never marry into the Yue Clan
no matter what.

747
00:41:21,862 --> 00:41:23,902
If I can't decide on my marriage,

748
00:41:24,143 --> 00:41:25,303
I might as well die!

749
00:41:25,462 --> 00:41:26,063
You!

750
00:41:28,742 --> 00:41:29,983
Mother, where are you going?

751
00:41:29,983 --> 00:41:31,582
I'm not done talking yet.

752
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:38,943
Mother!

753
00:41:50,063 --> 00:41:52,103
How dare this lowly servant eavesdrop?

754
00:41:52,263 --> 00:41:53,423
I wasn't eavesdropping.

755
00:41:53,742 --> 00:41:55,103
You were too loud.

756
00:41:55,103 --> 00:41:56,582
I couldn't avoid it if I wanted to.

757
00:41:56,582 --> 00:41:57,383
Insolence!

758
00:41:57,582 --> 00:41:59,462
How dare you behave insolently
in Changqiu Palace?

759
00:41:59,462 --> 00:42:00,303
Guards!

760
00:42:02,582 --> 00:42:04,103
Drag this disrespectful maidservant

761
00:42:04,103 --> 00:42:05,143
and cane her!

762
00:42:05,143 --> 00:42:06,143
Yes, Your Highness.

763
00:42:06,662 --> 00:42:07,702
Your Highness, please spare her.

764
00:42:13,263 --> 00:42:14,103
Your Highness.

765
00:42:14,742 --> 00:42:17,183
She's Lady Cheng
from Marquis Quling's Residence.

766
00:42:17,343 --> 00:42:18,542
It's her first time entering the palace.

767
00:42:18,542 --> 00:42:19,902
So she doesn't know the palace rules.

768
00:42:20,063 --> 00:42:21,983
General Cheng is a new military general

769
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:24,582
who had made great achievements
in Gu City

770
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:26,542
and was granted the title,
Marquis Quling by His Majesty.

771
00:42:27,303 --> 00:42:29,862
His Majesty often says to be kind
to meritorious heroes' family.

772
00:42:30,063 --> 00:42:31,143
I hope you don't be angry

773
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:32,983
(Luo Jitong)
with Lady Cheng.

774
00:42:35,822 --> 00:42:37,742
So you're a daughter
of a military family.

775
00:42:37,902 --> 00:42:40,263
No wonder you lack proper manners.

776
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:41,542
You actually have the audacity

777
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:43,462
to behave presumptuously
in Changqiu Palace!

778
00:42:43,622 --> 00:42:44,983
I shall report this to Father tomorrow

779
00:42:44,983 --> 00:42:46,143
to punish you, lowly servant!

780
00:42:46,582 --> 00:42:47,223
No,

781
00:42:47,223 --> 00:42:48,822
I'll have your parents punished too!

782
00:42:48,822 --> 00:42:49,943
Strip their military achievements

783
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:51,502
and chase all of you out of the capital.

784
00:42:51,782 --> 00:42:53,023
Your Highness, calm down.

785
00:42:53,383 --> 00:42:55,223
There's no need to bother about her.

786
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,103
His Majesty ordered me

787
00:42:57,103 --> 00:42:58,902
to bring Lady Cheng to the family feast.

788
00:42:59,023 --> 00:43:00,742
If you're still upset,

789
00:43:00,943 --> 00:43:02,223
you can just scold some more.

790
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:03,462
But

791
00:43:03,702 --> 00:43:04,902
I'm afraid His Majesty would blame us

792
00:43:05,822 --> 00:43:07,383
if we were late.

793
00:43:08,862 --> 00:43:10,343
Stop using Father to oppress me.

794
00:43:17,063 --> 00:43:18,223
You're lucky this time.

795
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:19,702
If it weren't for the feast,

796
00:43:19,983 --> 00:43:21,303
I would not let you go this easily.

797
00:43:22,263 --> 00:43:24,303
You better watch yourself at the feast.

798
00:43:25,023 --> 00:43:26,383
Don't let me catch you.

799
00:43:26,983 --> 00:43:27,782
Or else

800
00:43:28,263 --> 00:43:29,462
the Cheng Clan

801
00:43:29,702 --> 00:43:31,063
will be punished along with you.
