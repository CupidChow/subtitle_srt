(Memorial Tablet of Eldest Brother,

4
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,130
If I reveal the truth,

5
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,930
will Brother Wen come forward

6
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,290
and help us both?

7
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,490
I may have found some useful clues

8
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,810
to the truth behind Gu City's incident.

9
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,970
Throughout the ages,

10
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,650
good and evil are always rewarded.

11
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,170
Mother, you can rest assured.

12
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,410
Those who do evil

13
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,050
will eventually be punished.

14
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,250
You're right.

15
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,890
That evil person is still alive.

16
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,490
You must not let him go.

17
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,050
Mother,

18
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,890
I'll be wedded soon.

19
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,930
All suffering

20
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,810
will eventually pass.

21
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,570
Our happiness is approaching.

22
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,290
Zisheng,

23
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,050
you'll be wedded soon.

24
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,290
Yet, I'm the last person to know.

25
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,210
Do you still resent me?

26
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,530
Young Master,

27
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,930
Marquis Chengyang insisted

28
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,130
to see you.

29
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,010
We dare not stop him.

30
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,570
Don't blame them.

31
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,690
It's my fault.

32
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,050
Your mother said

33
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,250
you proposed to Lady Cheng
in front of everyone today.

34
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,850
My mother?

35
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,170
My mother stays
in Xinghua Courtyard all year.

36
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,410
She couldn't have told you about this.

37
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,770
I wonder

38
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,290
who was it that you meant?

39
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,490
Zisheng,

40
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,490
I know you're angry.

41
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,330
But you can't sacrifice
your marriage out of spite.

42
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,530
Cheng Shi is merely a new military general.

43
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,090
He has no foothold in the royal court.

44
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,170
He can't help you at all.

45
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,650
That Lady Cheng's image is even
more infamous.

46
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,610
This marriage brings
no benefit to you at all.

47
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,970
Everyone in the capital city knows

48
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,130
Princess Yuchang likes you.

49
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,570
Regardless of character, appearance,

50
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,410
family's social standing,
or family customs,

51
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,690
Lord Ruyang's descent is much better

52
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,450
than that of the Marquis Quling.

53
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,170
It's not enough for you

54
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,090
to rely on your wife to curry favor

55
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,570
with Lord Ruyang's family.

56
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,970
Now, you want to use my marriage

57
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,810
in exchange for a bright future?

58
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,690
Marquis Chengyang, please rest assured.

59
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,370
I would never put a bet on my marriage

60
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,530
because of my resentment.

61
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,970
I feel relieved

62
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,170
to know you don't resent me.

63
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,810
But that Cheng Family...

64
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,690
If you have slight guilt in your heart,

65
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,890
please leave now.

66
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,290
My mother said

67
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,130
she doesn't want you

68
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,890
to appear in front of her anymore.

69
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,090
I never want to cause
my family any distress.

70
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,170
So you'll have to endure it.

71
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,370
Qi,

72
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,490
send the guest.

73
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,970
Who do you think you are?

74
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,010
How dare a nobody behaves insolently

75
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,770
in front of me?

76
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,650
I'm the only daughter of the Huo Family.

77
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,010
A nobody like you dares to propose to me?

78
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,490
You're not even worthy
to carry my shoes!

79
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,610
I'm going to beat this dissolute man!

80
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,330
I'm going to kill you! Kill you!

81
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,170
I'm going to kill you!

82
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,650
Kill you!

83
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,370
You darn dissolute man! How dare you!

84
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,210
That's enough.

85
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,290
It's all right now.

86
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,930
Don't hurt your hands.

87
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,050
Zisheng,

88
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,810
is there any clinic here?

89
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,770
Xinghua Courtyard is far away
from the clinic.

90
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,410
Marquis Chengyang,

91
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,570
you should hurry and get treatment.

92
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,090
Madam.

93
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,800
(Memorial Tablet of Eldest Brother,
Huo Chong)

94
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,050
General Huo,

95
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,010
I've come late.

96
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,210
I'm 15 years late!

97
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,010
I've let you down.

98
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,250
If we can find out the truth
about Gu City

99
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,610
and let those who died wrongfully
rest in peace,

100
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,930
I'm sure he won't blame you.

101
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,490
Young Master.

102
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,930
I've been looking for
the whereabouts of the physician

103
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,570
who used to work under Marquis Yue

104
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,690
back then.

105
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,970
I've finally found
that military physician.

106
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,490
He has changed his name

107
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,290
and lives in Western Village
on the outskirts of the capital.

108
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,250
I'll send Qi and Fei

109
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,250
with you for the investigation
in Western Village.

110
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,290
You must not.

111
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,090
Your subordinates will easily
attract attention.

112
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,490
To be on the safe side,

113
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,930
you should let me investigate it myself.

114
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,890
I'll contact you anytime.

115
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,210
Within three days,

116
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,650
I'll return.

117
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,410
What if

118
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,450
I want to contact you?

119
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,130
What should I do?

120
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,330
The war situation always changed
by the minute in the past.

121
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,890
Heralds like us always fell into

122
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,890
the enemy's hand very easily.

123
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,010
To avoid leaking military information,

124
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,450
General Huo always ordered us

125
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,490
to hide information in common objects.

126
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,650
The Huo Army doesn't stick
to one type of communication.

127
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:01,810
For instance,

128
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,130
breaking a twig.

129
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,050
If it's broken into three long ones
and one short one,

130
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,010
that means I'm in danger.

131
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,250
If I'm safe,

132
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,610
I'll break them into two long ones
and two short ones.

133
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,250
This trip must not be known to others.

134
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:18,930
Remember.

135
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,010
Safety is a priority.

136
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,970
Please rest assured.

137
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,890
I just can't figure out one thing.

138
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,690
Why are you so anxious

139
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,930
to find the remnants of Gu City?

140
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,890
Is there something else odd

141
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,290
about Gu City being breached?

142
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,210
Yes.

143
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,370
But I'm anxious

144
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,330
because I have someone in my heart.

145
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,090
Young Master,
you're young and promising.

146
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,410
If General Huo was still alive,

147
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,210
he would feel relieved.

148
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,730
It's too bad

149
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,930
General Huo could never see

150
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,810
your accomplishments and wedding.

151
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,970
After you returned
from your investigation,

152
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,450
I suppose you can make it

153
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,490
to the day of delivering
the betrothal gifts.

154
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,250
You...

155
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,290
Young Master, are you getting married?

156
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,730
It's great to hear.

157
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,890
I'm sure General Huo

158
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,810
would also feel relieved.

159
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,010
But I wonder what kind of young lady

160
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,770
you set your eyes on?

161
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,570
She's an extraordinary young lady.

162
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,170
The person like me

163
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,850
who's trapped in the past

164
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,090
should have been alone.

165
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,850
But if she's the one

166
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,010
who'll walk through hardships with me,

167
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,570
perhaps, it's worth a try.

168
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,290
General,

169
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,210
I didn't expect

170
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,890
I'm thousand times

171
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,250
more terrible than Ling Buyi

172
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,130
in her heart.

173
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,970
Dear, don't ever think of it.

174
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,130
Niaoniao is still young.

175
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,170
She doesn't know our worries as parents.

176
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,050
What you said may have caused
her grievances.

177
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,490
But you had no choice.

178
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,210
Don't be angry with her.

179
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,450
I should ask that she doesn't blame me.

180
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,690
We did wrong to Niaoniao in the past.

181
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,250
Now, she's willing to sacrifice
her happiness

182
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,090
just to go against us.

183
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,370
This is the consequence of our actions.

184
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,130
Niaoniao is similar to you.

185
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,130
You're both stubborn but soft-hearted.

186
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,250
You both refuse to yield to compromise,

187
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,250
and always say the meanest things.

188
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,810
I don't blame her.

189
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,010
I only blame myself.

190
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,730
I'm reaping what I sowed.

191
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,890
No matter how hard

192
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,250
and reluctant we felt back then,

193
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,610
we still abandoned her

194
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,290
and made her like this.

195
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,410
It's pointless to talk of this now.

196
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,690
There are so many unhappy couples
in this world.

197
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,690
I only hope she and Ling Buyi

198
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,050
would not be one of them.

199
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,250
I hope they'll love each other

200
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,530
and grow old together.

201
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,490
It's the Lou and He Family's
wedding tomorrow.

202
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,210
Will you attend it with me, Mother?

203
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,690
Other people's marriage
doesn't concern me.

204
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,730
You can attend it yourself.

205
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,610
What about my marriage?

206
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,210
Mother,

207
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,770
Mr. Wu has searched
for marriageable ladies' portraits.

208
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,170
Have you considered them
one by one for me?

209
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,650
You're already an adult.

210
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,810
You can decide on your marriage.

211
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,290
If you find someone you like,

212
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,290
you can ask your father
to propose it to her family.

213
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,410
What about you?

214
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,850
Other parents can't wait
to arrange their children's marriage

215
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,730
because they're worried.

216
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,050
Why do you never worry

217
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,050
about what kind of wife I'll marry?

218
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,770
You're given the freedom
to decide your own matters.

219
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,170
Isn't that good?

220
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,330
In your heart,

221
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,970
do you find my marriage is not

222
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,170
an important matter?

223
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,290
When you get older,

224
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,650
you'll understand

225
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,650
what's important to you

226
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,570
is only something trivial

227
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,610
to some people.

228
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,410
In this world,

229
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,050
don't rely on others

230
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,210
if you can do it yourself.

231
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,970
What did Madam say?

232
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,610
Which young lady did she choose for you?

233
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,250
Mother said

234
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,370
it's up to me.

235
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,530
Young Master, you're knowledgeable,

236
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,370
intelligent, and assertive.

237
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,730
Madam let you decide

238
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,330
regarding your marriage

239
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,090
because she feels assured.

240
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,450
No need to comfort me.

241
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,730
I understand.

242
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,370
In this world,

243
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,490
if there are parents who are involved
in their children's marriage,

244
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,690
there are also those
who don't meddle at all.

245
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,970
While I'm envious of those
who have parents to discipline them.

246
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,090
Others are envious of my unrestrained life.

247
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,290
Who could you mean

248
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,770
by that?

249
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,530
No one.

250
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,530
In this world,

251
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,330
who's not ridiculous and pathetic?

252
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:17,890
Young Lady.

253
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,290
Young Lady, get up.

254
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,890
General Ling is here.

255
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,850
Why is he doing here at this early hour?

256
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,690
Have you forgotten?

257
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,050
Today is the wedding day
of Lou Yao and He Zhaojun.

258
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,770
General Ling specially came
to pick you up.

259
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,570
He's waiting for you

260
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,810
at Jiuzhui Hall now.

261
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,090
General Ling has arrived!

262
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,050
General Ling.

263
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,210
General Ling.

264
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,730
General Ling.

265
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,730
Second Young Master Lou,
congratulations.

266
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,330
Yao,

267
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,610
I wish you and Zhaojun

268
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,210
blissful and long-lasting matrimony.

269
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,490
I heard His Majesty has granted

270
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,050
marriage to you and General Ling.

271
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,330
I offer you my congratulations too.

272
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,970
Miss Shaoshang is sure quick
in finding a future husband.

273
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,730
It's been a few days

274
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,010
and you've already found him.

275
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,290
It doesn't concern you.

276
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,810
I never expect
the ever-fearless Lady Cheng

277
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,530
has also yielded to power.

278
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,570
Second Young Master Lou,

279
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,930
please lead us to our seats.

280
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,290
Yao,

281
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,930
leave matters here to me.

282
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,370
You can lead guests inside.

283
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,410
Shanjian. General Ling.

284
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,770
Please follow me.

285
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,130
As for Shaoshang...

286
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,330
Let me take her.

287
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,050
Yao,

288
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,570
I'll take Shaoshang
to the female seating area.

289
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,850
Shaoshang, let's go.

290
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,770
I've been married twice

291
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,410
in my life.

292
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,010
When I first put on my wedding robe,

293
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,930
my whole family died.

294
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,810
I'm marrying for the second time
while mourning.

295
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,850
We can't play music

296
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,450
or hang a single lantern.

297
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,690
Fortunately,
some guests are still willing to come.

298
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,490
But I just never expect

299
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,810
that you'd come.

300
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,450
I didn't expect I'd come either.

301
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,250
Shaoshang.

302
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,130
I still need to thank you

303
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,370
for returning Yao to me.

304
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,850
If it weren't for me,

305
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,090
you wouldn't have to marry Ling Buyi.

306
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,730
I thought you wanted to say

307
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,490
I've picked up a huge bargain.

308
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,810
Why wouldn't I end
the betrothal with Yao earlier

309
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,450
if I knew I'd be betrothed to Ling Buyi?

310
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,410
Ling Buyi is suspicious, vicious,
and ruthless.

311
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,410
How is marrying him a huge bargain?

312
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,090
When I was in Feng Yi County,

313
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,650
I saw his interrogation.

314
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,930
When I recall it now,

315
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,410
it still shudders me.

316
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,570
His Majesty raised him

317
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,530
and let him do anything he wants.

318
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,610
How could he have such vicious behavior

319
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,450
as if there's a blood feud?

320
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,690
That wasn't his vicious behavior.

321
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,050
That's his killing intent.

322
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:40,930
He's a military general.

323
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,530
His viciousness is displayed
in the right place.

324
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,690
Seeing how you stand up for him shows

325
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,130
both of you are not without feelings.

326
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,850
I was too young and arrogant

327
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,250
to see through people.

328
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,970
I only realized this
after this incident.

329
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,490
A beautiful
and unrestrained man is useless.

330
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,450
It's better for the man
to be soft-hearted

331
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,090
and gentle.

332
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:01,850
As for you,

333
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,690
I can say you're honest and kind too.

334
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,650
I'm glad you know that.

335
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,250
If it weren't for Yao's future,

336
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,290
I wouldn't break off the betrothal

337
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,570
even if your tears have run dry.

338
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,330
Now,

339
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,410
I see Yao as my elder brother.

340
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,010
I'm protective of my family.

341
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:36,970
He Zhaojun, listen up.

342
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,490
I would never let anyone pick on

343
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,570
my family members.

344
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,770
Me too.

345
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,530
Other than my younger brother,

346
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:48,010
Yao is the last family member
I have in this world.

347
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,330
I'll cherish him

348
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,330
no less than you.

349
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,010
Our lives

350
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,450
will become better in the future.

351
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:58,810
I hope

352
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,210
it will be the same
with you and Ling Buyi.

353
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,010
I hope so.

354
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,210
Come on.

355
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,770
We'll go to the banquet area.

356
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,090
I'm still mourning.

357
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,050
According to custom,

358
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,170
I can't meet the guests.

359
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,690
I especially come to see you

360
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,530
and tell you these.

361
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,810
Now, I've already said what I wanted.

362
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,530
You can say

363
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:32,930
I've repaid my gratitude.

364
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,570
This way, please.

365
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,210
This is unexpected.

366
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,650
I was only absent from class
at Cheng's Residence for a few days.

367
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,130
Now, Shaoshang is already betrothed to you.

368
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,890
I'll take care of the Cheng Family's
education from now on.

369
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,930
You no longer have
to trouble yourself anymore.

370
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,250
But if you're truly bored at home,

371
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,890
I can recommend
some official positions for you.

372
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,970
Lest you meddle
in the young ladies' marriage.

373
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,890
No need.

374
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,250
My master, Huangfu Yi
has already recommended me.

375
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,170
In future,

376
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,450
you and I will be fellow officials.

377
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,410
General Ling, rest assured.

378
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:49,850
If I'm bored,

379
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,010
I'll sure give you some trouble.

380
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:54,650
Sorry,

381
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,890
I mean I'll trouble you with favors.

382
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,450
No problem.

383
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,690
On the day of my wedding with Shaoshang,

384
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,010
I'll invite you

385
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,010
to attend our wedding.

386
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,170
Speaking of attending a wedding,

387
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,410
it was only last month

388
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,810
I thought I'll be attending

389
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,050
Shaoshang and Yao's wedding today.

390
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,290
Clearly, you can't be sure

391
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,570
until the wedding ceremony is over.

392
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,930
Mr. Yuan, you first became the teacher
of Cheng siblings.

393
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,490
Now,

394
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,810
you're trying to probe
about my betrothal with Shaoshang.

395
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,050
If I didn't know you have
high expectations,

396
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,730
I'm afraid I would have thought

397
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:37,450
that you have improper thoughts
about my future wife.

398
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,170
Cheng Shaoshang is indifferent
toward men and women's love affairs.

399
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,130
She only cares about scheming.

400
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,330
I detest it the most

401
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,370
when people use marriage
as a tool in their schemes.

402
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,370
I have

403
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,570
no improper thoughts toward her at all.

404
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,850
If you put it that way,

405
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,410
it means you're just picking on me.

406
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,850
I really want to see

407
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:08,050
what will happen to the man

408
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,450
who is aimed at by a vicious woman.

409
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,090
I'll have to disappoint you then.

410
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,890
Shaoshang and I get along very well.

411
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,970
We'll surely grow old together.

412
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,970
But someone who's petty

413
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,610
and speaks indecently like you

414
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,490
may not live to see that day.

415
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,010
General Ling,

416
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,170
as a civil official,

417
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,770
I'll definitely live longer
than a military officer like you.

418
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,010
Get along well and grow old together?

419
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,650
Can you believe

420
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,130
these words yourself?

421
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,130
Please stop arguing.

422
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,530
If you ask me,

423
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,570
Shaoshang is
the best young lady in this world.

424
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,570
-Of course.
-Shut up.

425
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,130
Congratulations, Lady Cheng.

426
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,010
Lady Cheng.

427
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,250
Come and sit next to me.

428
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,770
Sit next to me.

429
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,410
Shaoshang.

430
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,290
Come and sit with me.

431
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,370
It's all right. Thank you for asking.

432
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,850
Niaoniao, you're finally here.

433
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,530
Come and sit here.

434
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,850
After picking his prospect
for many years,

435
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,690
Zisheng's judgment
is nothing more than this.

436
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,370
Cheng Shaoshang,

437
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,930
you sure are capable.

438
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,090
You broke off the betrothal
with my cousin first

439
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,530
and got involved with Zisheng the next.

440
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,210
Don't you feel sorry for my cousin?

441
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,730
His Majesty proposed the marriage
to the Cheng Family himself.

442
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,650
It was a grace from His Majesty.

443
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,450
I dare not reject without any reason.

444
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:05,890
Lou Li,

445
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,090
you talked as if you're almighty.

446
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,730
You should have been the one
in His Majesty's presence.

447
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,570
Let's see if you're brave enough
to reject His Majesty.

448
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:13,810
But...

449
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,010
But you shouldn't have accepted that quickly.

450
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,730
My cousin was so heartbroken.

451
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,730
He has a deep affection for you.

452
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,810
You should be sad

453
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:22,690
and hide in the countryside.

454
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,770
Why can your cousin marry someone else

455
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,170
yet I have to remain unmarried for life?

456
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,610
Why do I have to stay sad

457
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:27,850
and miss out on the time to marry

458
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,170
before I'm allowed to get married?

459
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,490
Even if I'm allowed to marry,

460
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,050
it must be someone unsatisfactory.

461
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:34,210
I must hide in a lonely corner
to tend to my wound

462
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,530
and not appear in front of others.

463
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,810
Those who knew the truth understand
the Cheng Family ended

464
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,890
the betrothal
to fulfill General He's dying wish.

465
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,370
Those who don't know,

466
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,130
they'd actually think the Cheng Family

467
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,850
is deeply indebted to the Lou Family!

468
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:54,570
Lou Li.

469
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,170
If you don't want me
to look down on you,

470
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,250
how about you repeat what you said

471
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,290
in front of your parents.

472
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,530
Let's see if your mother

473
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,090
will slap you.

474
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,330
Madam,

475
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,250
where are you going?

476
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:23,410
It's just a joke
between the young ladies.

477
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,970
I don't think there's a need
for us to get involved.

478
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,570
First Madam Cheng, you're right.

479
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:36,050
It was my daughter who provoked first.

480
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,210
It's a pity for the Lou Family

481
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,450
not to have Shaoshang married
into our family.

482
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,970
It's to fulfill the last wishes
of the martyrs

483
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,450
that we had to do this.

484
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,730
I'm relieved

485
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,450
that you don't take it to heart.

486
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,650
I naturally won't take it to heart.

487
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,370
His Majesty granted our family
a marriage with Zisheng.

488
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,050
He's such a great son-in-law.

489
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,930
I would wake up laughing
in the middle of the night.

490
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,610
Why would I have any resentments?

491
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,330
It's admirable of General Ling

492
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,050
to accompany Shaoshang to attend

493
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,330
the Lou Yao's wedding banquet today.

494
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,050
Even the most generous man

495
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,530
will not accompany his future bride

496
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,530
to the wedding banquet

497
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,810
at her former fiancé's house.

498
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,050
I wonder

499
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,770
if General Ling is being heartless
and indifferent to Shaoshang

500
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:24,970
or if he simply cares not
about his face.

501
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,930
Thank you for coming.

502
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,170
Please.

503
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,730
Thank you.

504
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,690
Mr. Zhang,

505
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:46,930
let's have a drink.

506
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,570
First Young Master Lou.

507
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,570
If it weren't for your knowledge
and good memory

508
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,170
to draw the map of Feng Yi County,

509
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,250
this battle would've been hard to fight.

510
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,050
His Majesty intends
to reward contributors accordingly.

511
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,450
You've made such a great contribution.

512
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:08,730
In the future,

513
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,850
you'll be in high places.

514
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,010
It's a supreme grace

515
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,090
that His Majesty has granted

516
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,170
to the Lou Family
for Yao to marry Zhaojun.

517
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,370
As General He's in-law,

518
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,370
it's only right

519
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,610
for the Lou Family

520
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,410
to help General Ling capture
Feng Yi County.

521
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,010
We dare not ask to be rewarded again.

522
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,370
Ben,

523
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,810
am I right?

524
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,010
Uncle

525
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,450
knows me well.

526
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,330
General Ling,

527
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,170
I'm used to a carefree life.

528
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,090
I only like to travel around.

529
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,490
So I have no desire to be an official.

530
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,530
I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you.

531
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,490
You may have no intention
to be an official.

532
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,770
But if His Majesty wishes
to elevate someone,

533
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,970
I shall see who dares to hinder.

534
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,010
Drink, First Young Master Lou.

535
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,370
The Cheng Family just broke off
the betrothal with the Lou Family.

536
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,690
Then they arranged another betrothal
at the palace soon after.

537
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,530
It really takes people by surprise.

538
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,770
It's hard not to be suspicious.

539
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,050
Could Cheng Shaoshang
already have had an affair

540
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,850
with General Ling long ago?

541
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,170
-Affair?
-An affair?

542
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:53,250
Yan?

543
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,730
Why are you in the men's area?

544
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,130
It's nothing important.

545
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,210
It's just that Fourth Lady Cheng said

546
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,770
she left her cloak
in General Ling's carriage.

547
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,090
She asked me to ask about it.

548
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,370
Shaoshang is someone with determination.

549
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,450
Do you think she's like all of you here?

550
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,090
At the sight of Ling Buyi,

551
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,850
you'd behave like
those hungry puppies drooling

552
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,170
at a piece of meat.

553
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,530
It's too bad

554
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,850
that Ling Buyi isn't interested
in you at all.

555
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:33,490
Ladies,

556
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:36,170
I'm sure you've known Ling Buyi

557
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,730
for a long time now.

558
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,010
But he never asks
for your hand in marriage.

559
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,290
All of us are decent young ladies

560
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:45,650
who are upright.

561
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,090
Unlike certain someone

562
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,330
who entices by making flirty advances.

563
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,650
General Ling is a great man.

564
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,090
What would he know
of these crafty and immoral trickeries?

565
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,370
I'm afraid he was bewitched.

566
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,450
Wang Ling, how dare you frame her!

567
00:35:59,290 --> 00:35:59,930
I did not!

568
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:01,650
Qiqi.

569
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,370
General Ling,

570
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,530
today is the Lou Family's joyous day.

571
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,330
What's the meaning of this?

572
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,330
The black armored guards follow me

573
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,330
wherever I go.

574
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,490
It has always been this way.

575
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:45,850
I have no intention to offend anyone.

576
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,330
General Ling,

577
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,930
this is the women's banquet area.

578
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:55,890
I'm afraid

579
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,530
your action is against proper conduct.

580
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,570
Seating arrangement in
a banquet is a trivial matter.

581
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,490
Having a sense of shame and propriety
is the highest form of proper conduct.

582
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,450
All right.

583
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,410
Since Lady Wang

584
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,090
said I'm going against proper conduct.

585
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,090
Then I shall teach all of you

586
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:23,130
what is a sense of shame

587
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,690
and the proper conduct!

588
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:29,810
General Ling,

589
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,210
what's the meaning of this?

590
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,650
Lady Cheng is sure blessed.

591
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,770
She actually made
General Ling protect her

592
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,450
regardless of the seating arrangements
between genders.

593
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,410
Fourth Lady Cheng just broke off
her betrothal.

594
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,490
Now she could find such
a great future husband.

595
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,090
It's such a great blessing, indeed.

596
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,610
My apologies.

597
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,930
I was too immersed in the chaos
that I couldn't control my hand.

598
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,290
But to have such high-quality venison
to wash your robe,

599
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,690
I'm sure it must be

600
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,570
a great blessing for both of you too.

601
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,370
You...

602
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,330
Just let it go.
Don't even argue with him.

603
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,250
No one can get Yuan Shanjian

604
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,330
to say nice things.

605
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:04,970
Let's go.

606
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,610
Madam Cheng.

607
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,650
Lady Wang said

608
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,250
my behavior is against proper conduct.

609
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,850
With the elders looking on,

610
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,690
it's considered proper now.

611
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:31,570
It's better this way.

612
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,330
General Ling, you're very thoughtful.

613
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,530
General Ling, that's not right.

614
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,530
The sage said, proper conduct...

615
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,410
Proper conduct?

616
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,690
A young lady like you

617
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,490
discusses the private matters

618
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,410
of unmarried couples all the time.

619
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,370
Do you think you know proper conduct

620
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,970
and shame?

621
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,610
You're not married

622
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,730
but you're already behaving like
a married shrew.

623
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,010
First Madam Lou,

624
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,610
do you know of this?

625
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,250
Lady Wang mentioned enticing

626
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,610
and making flirty advances.

627
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,330
Do you know Fifth Prince granted me

628
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,690
two beautiful women last month?

629
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,650
Your eldest brother, Wang Long,
coveted them.

630
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,170
So I gave them to him.

631
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,090
But it was only a few days

632
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,090
when your father took them in.

633
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,010
Those two women should be commended

634
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,210
for their skills in enticing
and making flirty advances.

635
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:32,970
You...

636
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,010
Instead of thinking

637
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,690
about how to slander
my future wife all day,

638
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,410
why don't you go back

639
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:39,810
and think about

640
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,410
how you should address
those two beautiful women in the future?

641
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,850
Should you address them
as your sister-in-law

642
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,330
or

643
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,610
as your mother?

644
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,050
Ling Buyi, you...

645
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:16,610
Ladies and gentlemen,

646
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,010
I'm sure

647
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,370
you've heard

648
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,850
of my betrothal with Lady Cheng.

649
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,530
On the day of my wedding,

650
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,770
I hope all of you

651
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,090
can attend.
