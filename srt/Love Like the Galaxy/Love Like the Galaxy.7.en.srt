4
00:01:54,372 --> 00:01:56,652
Congratulations on moving
into a new home, General Cheng.

5
00:01:57,212 --> 00:01:59,571
-Thank you for coming. This way inside, please.
-Brother Shi.

6
00:02:02,132 --> 00:02:03,972
Best wishes for your new home.

7
00:02:03,972 --> 00:02:04,571
Wan.

8
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:05,451
-Congratulations.
-Wan.

(Virtue Flows Like Water)

10
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:09,011
There are many distinguished guests today.

11
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:10,571
Speaking of which,

12
00:02:10,571 --> 00:02:13,212
(Wan Songbai)
it's my mother's birthday after a few days.

13
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,052
(Wan Songbai)
You and your family must be present.

14
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:17,052
I'd naturally attend

15
00:02:17,052 --> 00:02:18,532
Old Madam's birthday banquet.

16
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:22,052
I don't see Qiqi.

17
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:24,092
She wanted to come.

18
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:26,651
But my mother confined her at home.

19
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:27,931
Well, she deserves it.

20
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:30,132
She caught a cold

21
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:31,611
after she went out riding horses.

22
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:33,691
By the way,

23
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:35,691
where's your precious daughter?

24
00:02:36,052 --> 00:02:37,251
Let me meet her.

25
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:38,492
Niaoniao,

26
00:02:38,651 --> 00:02:39,972
come and greet Uncle Wan.

27
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:41,212
Come here.

28
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:47,492
I wish you great health, Uncle Wan.

29
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:48,412
Good.

30
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:49,772
Good.

31
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:51,651
Shi,

32
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:53,332
I thought you were exaggerating

33
00:02:53,332 --> 00:02:55,531
when you bragged about your daughter.

34
00:02:55,571 --> 00:02:56,412
I had no idea

35
00:02:56,892 --> 00:02:58,332
she was raised well.

36
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:01,531
I almost forget.

37
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:04,692
Take this, Niaoniao.

38
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:07,212
It's a gift for our first meeting.

39
00:03:07,651 --> 00:03:08,332
Take it.

40
00:03:09,091 --> 00:03:10,171
Thank you, Uncle Wan.

41
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:11,212
No need.

42
00:03:11,212 --> 00:03:12,371
She's only a child.

43
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:13,931
General Wan's gift

44
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:15,252
is too valuable.

45
00:03:15,252 --> 00:03:16,212
No, no.

46
00:03:16,332 --> 00:03:18,731
Only good things fit Niaoniao.

47
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:21,371
Niaoniao,

48
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:24,531
your father and I are
very close friends.

49
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:27,212
Should you suffer any injustice,
you can come to me.

50
00:03:27,212 --> 00:03:28,651
I'll definitely speak up for you.

51
00:03:30,852 --> 00:03:33,571
Especially if it's
because of your mother.

52
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:35,811
You can come to me anytime.

53
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,011
Niaoniao,

54
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:41,492
stop idling there.

55
00:03:41,852 --> 00:03:43,612
Go and attend to your grandmother.

56
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:45,691
Keep it.

57
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:47,411
Where are your manners?

58
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,290
(Virtue Flows Like Water)

59
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:53,811
Sister-in-law, you're too rigid.

60
00:03:54,531 --> 00:03:56,572
She plays by the rules with you

61
00:03:56,691 --> 00:03:58,811
and with Niaoniao too.

62
00:03:58,971 --> 00:03:59,651
If

63
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:01,851
a person's life is all about rules,

64
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:03,612
how boring it must be.

65
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:05,572
No, it's not.

66
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,411
When I go out now,

67
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:09,371
no one teases me for being uncultured.

68
00:04:09,612 --> 00:04:11,851
I have to thank Yuanyi
for teaching me well.

69
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:19,172
One thousand liang from Mr. Yuan
of the Jiaodong's Yuan Family.

70
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:20,212
I don't recall being acquainted

71
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:22,052
with the Yuan clan of Jiaodong.

72
00:04:22,572 --> 00:04:24,172
Did you send them an invitation?

73
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:26,531
General, I didn't send them an invitation.

74
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:28,572
It hasn't been long
since you were promoted.

75
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:29,892
I didn't have the time

76
00:04:30,332 --> 00:04:31,971
to be acquainted
with any aristocratic families.

77
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:33,811
I hear Yuan Shen is

78
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:35,651
as sly as a fox.

79
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:37,411
I wonder what ill intention
he comes bearing

80
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:39,411
for coming uninvited.

81
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:42,091
I dare not come with any ill intention

82
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:43,131
in front of two generals.

83
00:04:44,172 --> 00:04:45,091
Mr. Yuan.

84
00:04:47,851 --> 00:04:49,892
My father and the eldest son
of Marquis Quling's Residence studied

85
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:51,332
under the same tutelage.

86
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:52,371
Father said

87
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:55,091
his teacher often praises
the intelligence of this junior.

88
00:04:55,732 --> 00:04:57,452
I've long admired your eldest son.

89
00:04:57,452 --> 00:04:59,772
I heard there's
a housewarming celebration here today.

90
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:01,131
So I came uninvited.

91
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:05,452
But my eldest son isn't home now.

92
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,172
A son is an image of his father.

93
00:05:07,492 --> 00:05:08,531
If I can see

94
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:10,531
your elegance bearing myself,

95
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:13,292
it's equal to seeing your son's charm.

96
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:16,371
Mr. Shanjian, this way inside.

97
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:20,732
I didn't expect my eldest son

98
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:22,492
to have such prestige.

99
00:05:24,772 --> 00:05:25,971
Wan, come inside.

100
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:26,892
This way, please.

101
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:30,371
Your earrings look novel.

102
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:32,452
My husband gave them to me yesterday.

103
00:05:33,572 --> 00:05:35,651
It's enviable to have such
a good husband.

104
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:36,572
This way, please.

105
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:37,131
All right.

106
00:05:37,892 --> 00:05:38,732
Here, Official Liu.

107
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:42,971
You came all the way
on an arduous journey.

108
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:44,612
I'm truly honored to have you here.

109
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:46,971
You're being courteous. You're too kind.

110
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:47,691
This way, please.

111
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:48,251
All right.

112
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:49,851
We can meet Official Li over there.

113
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:50,971
Greetings, Mr. Cheng.

114
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:52,051
Greetings, Official Song.
And you too, Official Li.

115
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:54,772
This way, inside.

116
00:05:55,452 --> 00:05:56,812
What a fine-looking man.

117
00:05:57,372 --> 00:05:58,332
Please come with me.

118
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:03,971
Come here.

119
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,411
Hurry now.

120
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:07,332
Move it.

121
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:12,932
Come here.

122
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,051
Be careful not to drop them.

123
00:06:16,812 --> 00:06:17,372
Keep up.

124
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,971
General Cheng rises in his ranks.

125
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:27,892
Even Old Madam is glowing with radiance.

126
00:06:28,051 --> 00:06:29,651
You look even younger now.

127
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:35,851
That's because you never saw me
when I was young.

128
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:40,651
I was delicate.

129
00:06:42,372 --> 00:06:44,132
My appearance

130
00:06:44,252 --> 00:06:45,692
may have not changed much.

131
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:46,692
But

132
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:49,252
I'm no longer a young maiden.

133
00:06:50,572 --> 00:06:51,372
Am I right?

134
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,291
When did Grandmother send
the hairpin on her head to be made?

135
00:06:57,452 --> 00:06:58,332
They look crude.

136
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:01,772
Grandmother added exactly
two liang of gold.

137
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:03,572
Why didn't you dissuade her?

138
00:07:04,572 --> 00:07:05,651
How embarrassing.

139
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:06,971
I dare not.

140
00:07:16,091 --> 00:07:16,971
Sit properly.

141
00:07:35,332 --> 00:07:37,012
Greetings, Old Madam Cheng.

142
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:37,692
All right.

143
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,171
This is Wang Ling, the daughter
of Cavalry General Wang Chun.

144
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:43,531
(Lou Li)
Her mother Madam Wenxiu is the Empress's younger sister.

145
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:44,851
They're joining us here today

146
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:46,372
to congratulate the Cheng Family.

147
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:49,531
(Wang Ling)
I didn't want to come.

148
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:54,452
However, my father has some ties
to General Cheng.

149
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:56,332
So he ordered me to attend.

150
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,372
That's wonderful.

151
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:03,651
Don't feel restrained

152
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:04,611
among us elderly women.

153
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:05,611
Yangyang,

154
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:09,491
show the guests their seats.

155
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,051
Yes, Grandmother.

156
00:08:22,212 --> 00:08:22,971
This way, please.

157
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:35,651
So that's the rumored Fourth Lady Cheng.

158
00:08:35,812 --> 00:08:37,531
Sure enough,
seeing is better than hearing.

159
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,932
She's indeed haughty and arrogant.

160
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:41,572
Indeed.

161
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,051
I heard

162
00:08:43,212 --> 00:08:45,531
her Second Aunt always confined her

163
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:46,651
in her room

164
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,611
because of her impertinent behavior.

165
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:50,411
Let alone walking around the house.

166
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,332
But today is different from the past.

167
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,332
She has her parents on her side now.

168
00:08:55,892 --> 00:08:58,411
We'll have to meet her often
in the future.

169
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,531
Cheng Yang, you can be my witness

170
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:02,452
to how impertinent I am.

171
00:09:03,372 --> 00:09:04,372
But there are some people

172
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:05,812
who humiliate people as they speak.

173
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:07,892
I wonder who's more disrespectful.

174
00:09:09,171 --> 00:09:11,892
My sister was brought up by my mother.

175
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:14,932
It was my mother's lacking
to not raise her well.

176
00:09:16,091 --> 00:09:17,171
Niaoniao is not to be blamed here.

177
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:24,772
I heard Mr. Shanjian will be here today.

178
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:26,611
I don't see him anywhere.

179
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:30,452
Are you here to see Mr. Shanjian too,
Miss Wang?

180
00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:31,411
Of course.

181
00:09:31,932 --> 00:09:33,812
I was idling at home.

182
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:35,692
I only dropped by

183
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:37,372
because there's a celebration
at Cheng's residence.

184
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:40,372
Look!

185
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:41,892
Mr. Shanjian is here.

186
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:51,531
I'm Yuan Shen of Jiaodong.

187
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:53,091
I'm here to greet Old Madam.

188
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:56,611
Very nice.

189
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,051
Miss,

190
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:09,251
pardon me.

191
00:10:10,572 --> 00:10:11,452
Take it back!

192
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:39,932
Young Lady,

193
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:41,851
it's cold out in the garden.
Why did you come out here?

194
00:10:42,212 --> 00:10:44,491
Cover yourself with this cloak
or you'll feel cold.

195
00:10:45,332 --> 00:10:46,532
I'd rather freeze to death

196
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:48,491
than sit with them.

197
00:10:49,251 --> 00:10:51,532
They keep on mocking me.

198
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,491
I'm not patient enough
to argue with them.

199
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:55,011
So I came out to take some fresh air.

200
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:58,731
Young Lady, don't stoop to their level.

201
00:10:59,932 --> 00:11:01,652
When you came out,

202
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:03,412
did you see the good-looking man?

203
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:05,652
I have no interest in
who that person is.

204
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:08,731
I want to get some air.

205
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:10,532
Lianfang, you can stop following me.

206
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:40,771
Miss,

207
00:11:41,891 --> 00:11:43,212
how have you been?

208
00:11:45,212 --> 00:11:46,052
You?

209
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:48,932
What's the matter?

210
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:51,771
Don't you welcome me?

211
00:11:58,932 --> 00:12:00,572
It's an honor to have you here,
Mr. Yuan.

212
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:02,572
I wouldn't dare to displease you.

213
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:05,131
My father and brothers are
at Jiuzhui Hall.

214
00:12:05,251 --> 00:12:06,891
You can meet them there.

215
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:11,052
But I came especially to meet you.

216
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:17,971
I only caught your embroidered ball

217
00:12:18,532 --> 00:12:19,771
and returned it to you.

218
00:12:20,851 --> 00:12:22,371
Why did you have to come after me here?

219
00:12:23,131 --> 00:12:24,131
There's no need to go to such an extent.

220
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,812
You turned me away like this.

221
00:12:30,412 --> 00:12:32,371
Is this how the Cheng Family treats
their guests?

222
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,131
Don't you find it a little rude?

223
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:36,652
We don't know each other.

224
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,371
Our families are not even acquainted.

225
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:41,052
Don't you think it's rude of you

226
00:12:41,572 --> 00:12:42,771
to block my path?

227
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:46,971
Why don't you be straightforward?

228
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:47,731
All right.

229
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:49,332
An outspoken man speaks his mind.

230
00:12:49,491 --> 00:12:51,091
I only want you

231
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:53,731
to deliver a message to Madam Sang.

232
00:12:57,491 --> 00:12:58,812
If you're here to deliver a message,

233
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,692
you can tell it to Third Aunt in person.

234
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:02,932
There's no need to go
through this trouble.

235
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:06,851
There are things that are not
to be mentioned to outsiders.

236
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:10,891
So I can only trouble you
with this task.

237
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:14,452
This isn't

238
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:16,292
a particularly important
or a trivial matter...

239
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:17,172
Make haste.

240
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:22,292
Are you agreeing
to do it just like that?

241
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:25,412
What message is it
that you want to deliver to Third Aunt?

242
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:26,611
Please tell me.

243
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:29,532
You only need to tell Madam Sang these.

244
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:32,812
"Looking at empty words
with sincere expectation,

245
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:35,091
hoping to meet at the palace gate.

246
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:37,812
Climb up the platform to watch out
for you in the distance

247
00:13:38,212 --> 00:13:40,771
with my mind wandering
like a dream and like a soul.

248
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:43,851
An old friend is only asking

249
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:49,652
but the sound of wind and water."

250
00:13:50,812 --> 00:13:52,412
That is all.

251
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,052
Miss,

252
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:03,611
is something troubling you?

253
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:05,851
I don't understand.

254
00:14:07,052 --> 00:14:09,611
I don't understand
a single word you said.

255
00:14:10,452 --> 00:14:11,131
Can you remove

256
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:13,131
the confusing words?

257
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:14,851
It's not confusing.

258
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:15,932
It's a rhapsody.

259
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:18,091
Then remove the confusing rhapsody.

260
00:14:18,532 --> 00:14:19,491
Sum them in a sentence.

261
00:14:19,851 --> 00:14:21,011
I can remember if it's a sentence.

262
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:23,971
Fine.

263
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,452
You can tell her

264
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:28,611
that an old friend misses her.

265
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:30,611
But only need a few words...

266
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:31,292
I understand.

267
00:14:43,212 --> 00:14:44,532
I'm sure she won't remember it.

268
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:06,011
After I left,

269
00:15:06,611 --> 00:15:08,052
did they make up anything
to ridicule me?

270
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:09,091
No.

271
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:10,851
Mr. Yuan was here.

272
00:15:11,371 --> 00:15:13,292
So they were too busy
to bother about us.

273
00:15:17,131 --> 00:15:19,172
Who invited Yuan Shanjian?

274
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:20,971
Are we acquainted

275
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:22,971
with the Yuan Family?

276
00:15:23,251 --> 00:15:24,692
Mr. Yuan said

277
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:27,412
Eldest Brother's teacher and his father studied

278
00:15:27,652 --> 00:15:29,491
under the same teacher.

279
00:15:29,851 --> 00:15:31,452
That was one huge back road.

280
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,412
Besides, Eldest Brother is not home.

281
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,932
He indeed made a lot of effort

282
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:39,652
to establish a connection
with our family.

283
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:41,932
He's our guest.

284
00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:43,891
You mustn't criticize him.

285
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:47,371
Could it be

286
00:15:49,212 --> 00:15:50,491
that you think he's a nice person?

287
00:15:53,731 --> 00:15:54,491
I...

288
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,371
I've never spoken to Mr. Yuan before.

289
00:15:57,371 --> 00:15:58,292
How do I know what kind of person he is?

290
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,771
If you engage in a conversation with him,

291
00:15:59,771 --> 00:16:01,251
you'll know his disposition.

292
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:04,332
He's nothing more than
a rude pleasure seeker.

293
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:07,412
This isn't a particularly important
or a trivial matter...

294
00:16:07,412 --> 00:16:08,371
Make haste.

295
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:11,611
Cheng Yang,

296
00:16:11,611 --> 00:16:13,212
I want to ask you something.

297
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:17,971
Have you heard of a poem

298
00:16:18,932 --> 00:16:19,692
like this?

299
00:16:20,052 --> 00:16:22,452
Looking at empty words
with sincere expectation,

300
00:16:22,812 --> 00:16:23,891
hoping to meet at the palace gate.

301
00:16:23,891 --> 00:16:25,532
Something about palaces.

302
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:26,572
Climb up the platform to watch out
for you in the distance...

303
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:27,652
Platform.

304
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:29,812
What else...

305
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:31,332
What else...

306
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:34,491
But the sound of wind and water.

307
00:16:34,891 --> 00:16:35,692
That is all.

308
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:36,491
Is it

309
00:16:36,652 --> 00:16:39,412
"Changmen" a famous rhapsody by Sima Xiangru?

310
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:44,731
I think so.

311
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:46,731
Is this poem that popular?

312
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:50,251
It's not exactly well-known.

313
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:51,971
But

314
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:53,891
people love it
for its figurative language

315
00:16:53,891 --> 00:16:55,052
that doesn't involve politics.

316
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:57,851
So often times young women
would read it for pleasure.

317
00:17:02,011 --> 00:17:03,011
Niaoniao, be patient.

318
00:17:03,212 --> 00:17:05,052
After Aunt Yuanyi spends
more time teaching you,

319
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:07,452
you'll know no less than others.

320
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:08,731
No need.

321
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:10,971
I think I'm better this way.

322
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:12,131
I don't need anyone to teach me.

323
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:15,851
You're indeed fine.

324
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
Silks and satins for sale!

325
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,540
Top-quality fabrics!

326
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,700
Come and take a look!

327
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,100
Top-quality wine! Take a look!

328
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:47,251
It's written "Young Lady Cheng"

329
00:17:47,251 --> 00:17:48,731
on the invitation.

330
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:51,011
But it didn't mention
which of us is invited.

331
00:17:51,011 --> 00:17:52,251
Of course, it's you.

332
00:17:52,652 --> 00:17:54,011
I have to thank you, Cheng Yang.

333
00:17:54,731 --> 00:17:55,731
If Wang Ling didn't invite you

334
00:17:55,731 --> 00:17:57,812
to attend Princess Yuchang's
birthday banquet,

335
00:17:57,812 --> 00:17:59,452
my mother wouldn't let me go out

336
00:17:59,452 --> 00:18:02,212
to pick Princess Yuchang's
birthday gift with you.

337
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:24,091
Where did you get the lanterns?

338
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:25,452
General,

339
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:28,332
I purchased them from the market.

340
00:18:28,611 --> 00:18:30,572
Some guests hung them here

341
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,172
to let someone fated guess the riddles.

342
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:37,611
Move!

343
00:18:40,811 --> 00:18:41,731
I've inspected them.

344
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:42,811
These lanterns are different

345
00:18:43,011 --> 00:18:44,531
from Prince Xiao's lantern.

346
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,612
It had caused a huge commotion.

347
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,731
They won't leave
the same lantern behind

348
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:49,892
to us for investigation.

349
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:53,731
They reduce what they have
to destroy every trace of evidence.

350
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:56,852
It proves we're investigating
in the right direction.

351
00:18:58,372 --> 00:19:00,372
Have you found anything

352
00:19:01,132 --> 00:19:02,372
on Prince Xiao's expenditures
in the last six months?

353
00:19:02,452 --> 00:19:03,692
It's as you've expected.

354
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:04,811
It was six months ago

355
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:07,892
when Prince Xiao complained
about struggling in the capital

356
00:19:07,892 --> 00:19:09,212
because he was short of money.

357
00:19:09,212 --> 00:19:11,731
But he has been spending lavishly
for the past six months.

358
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,452
He would travel around,
drink, and play all day.

359
00:19:15,092 --> 00:19:16,531
Does he own any property?

360
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:19,372
He does own several shops in the capital.

361
00:19:19,612 --> 00:19:20,852
But he has a poor business acumen.

362
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:22,291
It was a total loss.

363
00:19:22,892 --> 00:19:25,412
He entrusted someone
to sell his shops in the first half of  the year.

364
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:28,452
But not only didn't he sell them out,

365
00:19:28,571 --> 00:19:31,531
but he also had extra money
to set up more shops after that.

366
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:35,051
Head Armorer Dong and Xu Jinzhong were
involved in the dealings for six months.

367
00:19:35,212 --> 00:19:37,372
Prince Xiao lived lavishly
for six months.

368
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:38,971
No one would believe it

369
00:19:39,092 --> 00:19:39,932
if they're not related to each other.

370
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:42,571
Order the men to cause trouble

371
00:19:43,011 --> 00:19:44,092
at Prince Xiao's shops.

372
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:45,932
We must cut their financial resources.

373
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,692
Someone who's used
to luxury won't be able

374
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:50,011
to bear being penniless.

375
00:19:50,811 --> 00:19:52,491
He will take the risk
out of desperation.

376
00:19:53,212 --> 00:19:54,491
The moment he contacts the buyers,

377
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:56,971
we'll have the chance

378
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,531
to find out the person
who steals the armaments.

379
00:20:02,092 --> 00:20:03,771
Isn't that the Cheng Family's carriage?

380
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:41,531
Young Master, something had happened.

381
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:42,932
Madam Chunyu went to the residence.

382
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:47,452
Let's go back.

383
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:52,011
Young Lady, we've arrived.

384
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,740
Take a look.

385
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:06,051
Young Lady, I've been waiting for you.

386
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:09,291
May I ask if this inn belongs

387
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,011
to General Cheng, the Marquis of Quling?

388
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:11,731
Yes, indeed.

389
00:21:11,731 --> 00:21:14,212
My Young Master was not prepared
for the long journey.

390
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:16,491
So we wonder if we can ask
for some charcoal?

391
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:17,412
Please come with me.

392
00:21:20,731 --> 00:21:21,571
Mr. Yuan?

393
00:21:22,692 --> 00:21:24,811
It's cold outside.
How about getting some rest inside?

394
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:26,051
No need.

395
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:32,852
Mr. Yuan,

396
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,291
my brothers missed you

397
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:36,172
after not seeing you for days.

398
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,452
I wonder if we could exchange
poetry again.

399
00:21:38,692 --> 00:21:40,172
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

400
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,132
"Looking at empty words
with sincere expectation,

401
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:44,811
hoping to meet at the palace gate.

402
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,571
Climb up the platform to watch out
for you in the distance."

403
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,212
I said I would discuss it next time.

404
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:51,291
It's a rhapsody, not a poem.

405
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:54,412
All right.

406
00:21:56,212 --> 00:21:56,932
Rhapsody.

407
00:21:58,771 --> 00:21:59,571
Rhapsody.

408
00:22:00,692 --> 00:22:02,051
The weather is great today.

409
00:22:02,731 --> 00:22:04,011
I have some spare time,

410
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:07,172
and I happen to want to exchange poetry.

411
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:08,452
I wonder

412
00:22:08,852 --> 00:22:10,412
if you're available

413
00:22:10,452 --> 00:22:11,531
to step aside for a moment.

414
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:29,571
May I know what I can do for you?

415
00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:36,212
I've been waiting for you for days.

416
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:37,892
Yet, you never bring back word.

417
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,212
Have you forgotten

418
00:22:41,212 --> 00:22:43,331
to deliver the message
to Madam Sang for me?

419
00:22:44,172 --> 00:22:46,092
I never wanted to help you deliver
the message.

420
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:47,892
So it's not a matter of forgetfulness.

421
00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:51,811
Do you understand people should keep a promise?

422
00:22:51,811 --> 00:22:52,531
No.

423
00:22:53,852 --> 00:22:56,331
That's right. I broke my promise.
What can we do about it?

424
00:22:56,652 --> 00:22:58,531
I don't have a horse,
let alone four of them.

425
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,452
There's nothing more

426
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:05,491
than begging, coercion,
and temptation in this world.

427
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:07,692
Since you're reluctant to speak nicely,

428
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:12,491
I can use other means too.

429
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:16,212
Did I scare you?

430
00:23:17,692 --> 00:23:18,531
Rest assured.

431
00:23:18,892 --> 00:23:20,011
I can't do anything to you.

432
00:23:20,811 --> 00:23:22,132
Many people know my name.

433
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:24,412
If you're willing
to deliver the message for me,

434
00:23:24,652 --> 00:23:26,291
I'll be willing to do you
a favor as repayment

435
00:23:26,811 --> 00:23:27,771
in the future.

436
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:30,971
Any favor?

437
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,811
Apart from being unfilial, rebelling,

438
00:23:34,132 --> 00:23:35,291
treachery, abandonment,

439
00:23:36,771 --> 00:23:38,452
and forbidding from asking
for your hand in marriage,

440
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:39,811
I can agree to the rest.

441
00:23:39,811 --> 00:23:40,571
I...

442
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:43,531
When have I ever asked you to marry me?

443
00:23:43,612 --> 00:23:46,172
When did I ever say I want to marry you?

444
00:23:46,452 --> 00:23:48,811
Have you never thought
of wanting to marry me?

445
00:23:49,452 --> 00:23:51,212
Now, that's appalling to me.

446
00:23:51,612 --> 00:23:53,132
You were tardy in delivering the message.

447
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,771
Isn't this your strategy to cling to me

448
00:23:54,971 --> 00:23:56,372
and lure me into meeting you?

449
00:23:57,531 --> 00:23:58,452
If

450
00:23:58,531 --> 00:24:00,692
you truly want to draw a line
between us,

451
00:24:00,892 --> 00:24:02,251
why didn't you deliver the message
to Madam Sang

452
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:03,692
with haste?

453
00:24:04,132 --> 00:24:07,212
We'll be on our separate ways then.

454
00:24:16,092 --> 00:24:16,971
You have a point.

455
00:24:18,452 --> 00:24:19,372
Mr. Yuan,

456
00:24:19,852 --> 00:24:20,971
I'm to blame.

457
00:24:21,652 --> 00:24:23,692
I suddenly understand something

458
00:24:23,932 --> 00:24:26,331
from your teaching just now.

459
00:24:27,251 --> 00:24:29,692
I should carry my task dutifully
after being entrusted.

460
00:24:30,212 --> 00:24:31,051
How about this?

461
00:24:31,372 --> 00:24:32,452
I shall deliver the message
to Third Aunt

462
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:33,971
when I return home today.

463
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:34,892
No need to thank me,

464
00:24:35,652 --> 00:24:36,932
and please forgive me
for giving you the cold shoulder.

465
00:24:37,372 --> 00:24:38,291
From then on,

466
00:24:38,531 --> 00:24:39,251
we won't be indebted

467
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:40,771
to each other.

468
00:24:41,932 --> 00:24:43,731
What if I need you

469
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:45,372
to deliver messages again?

470
00:24:45,372 --> 00:24:47,011
If Third Aunt doesn't mind me

471
00:24:47,412 --> 00:24:48,692
delivering messages for you,

472
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,932
I shall not decline then.

473
00:24:51,212 --> 00:24:52,571
But if Third Aunt doesn't like it,

474
00:24:53,172 --> 00:24:54,731
I can only respect my elder.

475
00:24:56,811 --> 00:24:57,652
Mr. Yuan,

476
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,811
we shall not meet again.

477
00:25:09,011 --> 00:25:10,452
It's not up to you

478
00:25:11,132 --> 00:25:12,251
if we ever meet again.

479
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:14,251
That will be up to me.

480
00:25:19,092 --> 00:25:21,051
All of the attendants
and bodyguards here

481
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:22,652
should take notice of things
around here.

482
00:25:22,932 --> 00:25:24,852
As I walked
into the General's Residence,

483
00:25:24,932 --> 00:25:25,971
it looks cold and desolated.

484
00:25:26,172 --> 00:25:27,811
Forget about fire to keep warm.

485
00:25:27,932 --> 00:25:30,051
There are no plants here at all.

486
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:32,932
There's not even
a single servant girl here.

487
00:25:34,571 --> 00:25:35,612
Where's your Young Master?

488
00:25:35,692 --> 00:25:36,852
I prefer peace and quietness.

489
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:39,251
I don't like plants.

490
00:25:40,652 --> 00:25:41,452
Zisheng.

491
00:25:42,412 --> 00:25:43,412
It's not surprising

492
00:25:43,571 --> 00:25:45,971
because you're always surrounded
by these men.

493
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:47,932
They wouldn't know any of these.

494
00:25:48,412 --> 00:25:49,331
I think,

495
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:51,251
you have everything you need here.

496
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:53,372
You only lack someone you love.

497
00:25:54,811 --> 00:25:55,971
What brings you here?

498
00:25:56,652 --> 00:25:58,011
I'm your stepmother.

499
00:25:58,452 --> 00:26:00,771
We're family in any case.

500
00:26:00,971 --> 00:26:02,212
Can't I visit you?

501
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:05,571
We're indeed family.

502
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:08,491
You and Marquis Chengyang are cousins.

503
00:26:09,172 --> 00:26:10,372
When I was a child,

504
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:12,892
I even greeted you as my aunt.

505
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:15,612
But it didn't take long for you
to take the advantage

506
00:26:15,692 --> 00:26:17,692
to climb into Marquis Chengyang's bed
to become his wife

507
00:26:17,811 --> 00:26:19,011
while my mother
and I were wandering in destitution.

508
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:20,612
After going in circles,

509
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,731
we indeed become family in the end.

510
00:26:27,132 --> 00:26:28,051
Even if

511
00:26:28,531 --> 00:26:30,212
you hate us as your parents,

512
00:26:30,971 --> 00:26:32,852
you mustn't mistreat yourself.

513
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,531
Princess Yuchang
of Lord Ruyang's Mansion

514
00:26:35,612 --> 00:26:37,291
is truly devoted to you.

515
00:26:37,932 --> 00:26:40,212
You must cherish this betrothal.

516
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:41,372
Well,

517
00:26:41,571 --> 00:26:44,132
Her Highness's birthday is in a few days.

518
00:26:44,612 --> 00:26:45,612
It's best

519
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:47,652
that you go.

520
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,251
See her off.

521
00:27:08,172 --> 00:27:09,731
I haven't finished yet.

522
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:17,652
I've finished talking.

523
00:27:29,652 --> 00:27:30,531
Young Master,

524
00:27:30,852 --> 00:27:32,652
are we attending

525
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:33,571
Prince Yuchang's birthday banquet?

526
00:27:33,771 --> 00:27:36,011
Her Highness especially sent
an invitation.

527
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,680
(Invitation)

528
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:41,051
Receive ten strokes yourself.

529
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:45,011
(Invitation)
Why am I being punished?

530
00:27:45,452 --> 00:27:46,971
(Invitation)
Did I commit anything wrong?

531
00:27:47,172 --> 00:27:48,971
If you cherish your bottom,

532
00:27:49,331 --> 00:27:50,692
you should control your hands.

533
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,011
(Invitation)

534
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,932
Why did I accept this?

535
00:28:11,771 --> 00:28:12,612
Mr. Yang.

536
00:28:17,051 --> 00:28:18,011
Yuan Shanjian.

537
00:28:19,412 --> 00:28:20,932
You're finally back.

538
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:28,372
As long as you agree,

539
00:28:28,612 --> 00:28:32,251
I'll exchange my sister's
written marriage proposal immediately.

540
00:28:32,571 --> 00:28:33,491
Please rest assured.

541
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:35,092
I'm certain no lady

542
00:28:35,092 --> 00:28:36,491
in this capital is more suitable

543
00:28:36,491 --> 00:28:38,892
to marry you than my sister.

544
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:49,051
Isn't this...

545
00:28:49,372 --> 00:28:51,571
Isn't this the scroll I gave you?

546
00:28:52,011 --> 00:28:52,811
Could it be

547
00:28:54,491 --> 00:28:56,092
you're cutting ties with me?

548
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:57,692
I have to return your favor

549
00:28:57,932 --> 00:28:59,731
for giving me this scroll.

550
00:29:01,212 --> 00:29:02,771
So I marked several mistakes

551
00:29:03,212 --> 00:29:04,372
to remind you

552
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:07,051
that if you add more thoughts
in enhancing your knowledge

553
00:29:07,491 --> 00:29:10,251
instead of judging people's marriages,

554
00:29:10,612 --> 00:29:12,172
you wouldn't be making
such mistakes anymore.

555
00:29:12,412 --> 00:29:13,132
Why you...

556
00:29:15,932 --> 00:29:17,212
You don't know what's good for you.

557
00:29:28,092 --> 00:29:29,531
I heard Mr. Yang is

558
00:29:29,531 --> 00:29:31,331
a famous Confucian scholar
in the capital.

559
00:29:31,612 --> 00:29:33,412
He has a younger sister
with a beautiful appearance

560
00:29:33,531 --> 00:29:35,852
who's quiet and docile.

561
00:29:35,852 --> 00:29:37,452
She's both beautiful and gifted.

562
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:39,692
Why did you upset him?

563
00:29:40,652 --> 00:29:41,491
No matter.

564
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:42,771
He wouldn't have

565
00:29:43,011 --> 00:29:44,412
the face to tell anyone
about what happened today.

566
00:29:45,531 --> 00:29:46,372
Young Master,

567
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:48,811
Madam never meddles in your marriage.

568
00:29:48,932 --> 00:29:51,212
As usual, I shouldn't bring it up.

569
00:29:51,811 --> 00:29:54,132
But I watched you grow up.

570
00:29:54,652 --> 00:29:56,971
It's inevitable that I worry.

571
00:29:57,452 --> 00:29:59,331
You're 21 this year.

572
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,852
When do you plan on finding a wife?

573
00:30:02,172 --> 00:30:03,771
Who says people must marry?

574
00:30:05,452 --> 00:30:07,491
Father and mother have been married
for more than 20 years.

575
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:09,692
Yet, they rarely talk to each other.

576
00:30:11,092 --> 00:30:13,692
If life after the marriage is this dull,

577
00:30:14,971 --> 00:30:16,132
I'd rather not marry at all.

578
00:30:17,172 --> 00:30:18,811
Could there be no woman

579
00:30:19,172 --> 00:30:20,291
in this world

580
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:22,251
who you find interesting

581
00:30:22,251 --> 00:30:23,731
and wish to marry?

582
00:30:23,892 --> 00:30:25,291
Must I marry that interesting woman

583
00:30:25,811 --> 00:30:27,251
if I meet one?

584
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:30,412
To a family clan, marriage is
an embellishment.

585
00:30:30,852 --> 00:30:32,932
To the women,
marriage is to climb up the ranks.

586
00:30:33,491 --> 00:30:34,652
But from what I witness since young,

587
00:30:35,011 --> 00:30:37,412
marriage is putting up with each other.

588
00:30:38,372 --> 00:30:40,092
I, Yuan Shanjian, would never do

589
00:30:40,412 --> 00:30:42,291
anything that brings no benefit to me.

590
00:30:57,852 --> 00:30:59,051
Your fingertips are more delicate

591
00:30:59,172 --> 00:31:00,571
than my face.

592
00:31:01,852 --> 00:31:03,331
If you keep spouting nonsense,

593
00:31:03,531 --> 00:31:05,092
I might accidentally cut your face.

594
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:07,571
When that happens,

595
00:31:07,692 --> 00:31:09,412
Old Madam will wail and weep.

596
00:31:13,531 --> 00:31:15,251
Which part of me doesn't belong to you?

597
00:31:15,652 --> 00:31:16,811
Not only would I let you shave my face,

598
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:19,412
but I'll also let you do
whatever pleases you,

599
00:31:19,892 --> 00:31:21,771
even if you want
to embroider flowers on my face.

600
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:24,011
Aunt!

601
00:31:25,331 --> 00:31:26,172
Aunt...

602
00:31:30,531 --> 00:31:32,652
Aunt, I have something to tell you.

603
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,692
Uncle, please step aside for a moment.

604
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:39,892
Can't you see your elders are occupied?

605
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:41,452
Is there something so important?

606
00:31:41,531 --> 00:31:42,811
Can't you tell her a little later?

607
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,491
Don't mind him.

608
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:46,571
Come in.

609
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:49,692
Don't hesitate. Just tell me.

610
00:32:03,092 --> 00:32:04,731
It's all right. Just tell me.

611
00:32:04,932 --> 00:32:07,291
Your uncle knows everything
about my affairs.

612
00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:09,771
Then I'll speak now.

613
00:32:10,172 --> 00:32:11,092
What is it?

614
00:32:14,612 --> 00:32:16,132
A man by the name
of Yuan Shanjian wants me

615
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:18,291
to deliver a message to you.

616
00:32:18,652 --> 00:32:22,011
He said a lot of confusing things called

617
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:23,571
a rhapsody.

618
00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:27,612
In any case, I don't remember any of it.

619
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:29,531
In other words,

620
00:32:30,092 --> 00:32:31,092
an old friend longs

621
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:32,892
for a few words.

622
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:34,811
An old friend?

623
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:38,092
Why did he tell you
to deliver the message

624
00:32:38,372 --> 00:32:39,491
instead of coming himself?

625
00:32:41,331 --> 00:32:42,932
Could this Yuan Shanjian be

626
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:44,452
the disciple he accepted

627
00:32:44,932 --> 00:32:46,172
back then?

628
00:32:48,251 --> 00:32:49,452
Disciple?

629
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:54,571
So it's him.

630
00:32:56,531 --> 00:32:57,652
What does he want?

631
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:03,771
I don't know either.

632
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:05,491
In any case, that's what he said.

633
00:33:05,612 --> 00:33:06,491
Other than these,

634
00:33:06,692 --> 00:33:07,811
he didn't say anything else.

635
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,051
A few words.

636
00:33:11,092 --> 00:33:12,652
What does he mean by that?

637
00:33:13,212 --> 00:33:15,331
I haven't met that person
for more than a decade.

638
00:33:20,092 --> 00:33:21,251
I remember now.

639
00:33:21,731 --> 00:33:23,932
He must have found out I was ill

640
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:25,811
because you were searching for physicians

641
00:33:25,811 --> 00:33:27,011
to find medicinal prescriptions for me.

642
00:33:29,452 --> 00:33:30,731
So that's the reason.

643
00:33:33,092 --> 00:33:35,051
But you've recovered from your cough
for quite a while now.

644
00:33:35,132 --> 00:33:36,331
Why is he still concerned about it?

645
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:39,932
Wait here.

646
00:34:30,132 --> 00:34:30,892
Take this.

647
00:34:32,251 --> 00:34:34,011
Deliver this for me.

648
00:34:34,571 --> 00:34:36,412
(I've recovered. Rest assured.)
Is this all that you write, Aunt?

649
00:34:36,971 --> 00:34:38,331
Don't you want to leave your name?

650
00:34:39,051 --> 00:34:40,212
He recognizes my handwriting.

651
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:41,491
So I don't need to leave any.

652
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:46,590
(I've recovered. Rest assured.)

653
00:34:48,571 --> 00:34:50,011
Aren't you going to tell me

654
00:34:50,011 --> 00:34:51,412
what happened?

655
00:34:53,212 --> 00:34:54,051
For instance,

656
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,692
his name

657
00:34:56,932 --> 00:34:59,692
and the relationship you had with him.

658
00:35:03,531 --> 00:35:06,291
I can't tell you in a few words.

659
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:07,531
It doesn't matter.

660
00:35:08,051 --> 00:35:10,412
If it takes time to tell,
you can tell me slowly.

661
00:35:10,571 --> 00:35:12,491
I can listen patiently.

662
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:13,971
When people say

663
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:16,212
it's something they can't say
in a few words,

664
00:35:16,452 --> 00:35:18,452
it means they don't want to explain it.

665
00:35:20,011 --> 00:35:21,011
Is that what you meant?

666
00:35:24,132 --> 00:35:25,531
I can let it go
if you don't want to tell me.

667
00:35:26,092 --> 00:35:27,491
But can you tell me

668
00:35:27,852 --> 00:35:29,092
why Yuan didn't come

669
00:35:29,092 --> 00:35:30,811
and see you directly

670
00:35:31,011 --> 00:35:33,092
and insisted to go through me?

671
00:35:35,531 --> 00:35:37,291
I once told someone this.

672
00:35:37,892 --> 00:35:38,771
"Be it you,

673
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:41,692
your friends, family, or the disciples,

674
00:35:42,132 --> 00:35:43,692
please don't come and see me

675
00:35:44,771 --> 00:35:46,771
or send any letters to me."

676
00:35:47,891 --> 00:35:50,052
I was young when I said that
out of spite.

677
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,612
I never expected that person
to be so dense

678
00:35:52,771 --> 00:35:54,052
that he actually agreed.

679
00:35:56,092 --> 00:35:57,291
So that's what happened.

680
00:35:58,172 --> 00:35:59,612
But speaking of which,

681
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:02,012
how did you know Yuan Shanjian?

682
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:03,451
This matter isn't

683
00:36:06,572 --> 00:36:08,291
something I can say in a few words.

684
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:11,331
How cheeky.

685
00:36:20,731 --> 00:36:22,132
Have you found out

686
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:24,251
what I ordered you to inquire about?

687
00:36:25,092 --> 00:36:26,771
The Young Ladies of Cheng went
to their family's shop

688
00:36:26,771 --> 00:36:27,851
to pick a birthday gift.

689
00:36:27,972 --> 00:36:30,451
Princess Yuchang also extended
an invitation to the Cheng Family.

690
00:36:32,251 --> 00:36:33,972
I didn't ask you to inquire
about Fourth Lady Cheng.

691
00:36:35,012 --> 00:36:36,331
I wanted to know about Prince Xiao.

692
00:36:38,172 --> 00:36:39,052
As of late,

693
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,092
did he go to Tian's Restaurant?

694
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:43,851
We've been watching Prince Xiao
for several days.

695
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:45,371
He has been spending time

696
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:47,652
with General He's daughter He Zhaojun lately.

697
00:36:48,692 --> 00:36:49,931
Head Armorer Dong was sent into exile.

698
00:36:50,612 --> 00:36:51,972
Xu Jinzhong committed suicide.

699
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:53,251
If Prince Xiao wants

700
00:36:53,572 --> 00:36:55,612
to be in long-term armaments dealings,

701
00:36:55,811 --> 00:36:57,731
he can only get
his armament supplies elsewhere.

702
00:36:58,451 --> 00:37:00,132
If he becomes General He's son-in-law,

703
00:37:00,612 --> 00:37:01,371
it would naturally

704
00:37:01,811 --> 00:37:03,692
be more convenient
to get armament supplies.

705
00:37:04,052 --> 00:37:05,291
General He is loyal and valiant.

706
00:37:05,652 --> 00:37:07,411
He may not associate with him
in such evil deeds.

707
00:37:07,411 --> 00:37:09,572
Lord Yong only elevates his cronies.

708
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:11,771
It is inevitable that his son

709
00:37:12,652 --> 00:37:14,212
may also like to push himself

710
00:37:14,212 --> 00:37:15,572
to read General He.

711
00:37:16,532 --> 00:37:17,331
Do we still have

712
00:37:17,891 --> 00:37:19,851
Princess Yuchang's invitation
from the other day?

713
00:37:20,891 --> 00:37:22,492
We shall go to Lord Ruyang's Mansion.

714
00:37:24,012 --> 00:37:25,411
I already threw it away.

715
00:37:27,132 --> 00:37:27,811
But

716
00:37:28,052 --> 00:37:28,771
I thought

717
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:30,532
you said you're not going to attend.

718
00:37:31,731 --> 00:37:33,331
General He is acquainted
with Lord Ruyang.

719
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:34,771
He Zhaojun

720
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:36,692
will definitely go
to Lord Ruyang's Mansion

721
00:37:37,012 --> 00:37:38,931
to celebrate Princess Yuchang's birthday.

722
00:37:39,572 --> 00:37:41,411
Since Prince Xiao is inseparable from her,

723
00:37:41,771 --> 00:37:43,212
he would be there too.

724
00:37:45,572 --> 00:37:46,371
Fei,

725
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:51,652
have you recovered from your injury?

726
00:37:52,692 --> 00:37:53,972
It was only ten strokes.

727
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,532
It no longer hurts
after I applied medicinal ointment.

728
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:56,652
Good.

729
00:37:58,172 --> 00:37:59,612
Then go and receive another ten strokes.

730
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:01,692
Why?

731
00:38:02,212 --> 00:38:03,652
Don't you think you deserve ten strokes

732
00:38:03,972 --> 00:38:05,371
for throwing out an important invitation?

733
00:38:07,692 --> 00:38:08,731
If you find the invitation,

734
00:38:09,891 --> 00:38:11,052
you shall be pardoned.

735
00:38:13,851 --> 00:38:14,612
Come with me.

736
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,890
(Lord Ruyang's Mansion)

737
00:38:29,811 --> 00:38:31,092
It's such a huge mansion.

738
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,411
Sister-in-law, you picked the right dress.

739
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:45,612
Niaoniao's complexion
and manners are not inferior

740
00:38:45,851 --> 00:38:47,371
to those of aristocratic women.

741
00:38:47,371 --> 00:38:48,451
Yangyang looks beautiful too.

742
00:38:48,731 --> 00:38:49,891
Gentle and imposing.

743
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,411
I have to agree.

744
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:53,172
If anyone complains about being unfair,

745
00:38:53,172 --> 00:38:54,652
no one can blame you.

746
00:38:57,172 --> 00:38:58,052
Niaoniao,

747
00:38:58,771 --> 00:38:59,972
don't wander.

748
00:39:06,931 --> 00:39:07,931
Who's that?

749
00:39:08,172 --> 00:39:10,572
Is she wearing all of her jewelry?

750
00:39:11,251 --> 00:39:12,291
That's Wan Qiqi.

751
00:39:12,612 --> 00:39:13,931
She's the Wan Family's tenth...

752
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,092
Which number of the Wan Family's
children is she again, Song?

753
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:16,811
Tenth?

754
00:39:17,092 --> 00:39:18,012
It's the thirteenth.

755
00:39:18,132 --> 00:39:18,972
Thirteenth?

756
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:21,291
Wan Qiqi is the youngest in the family.

757
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:22,371
Yet she thinks

758
00:39:22,371 --> 00:39:24,132
(Wan Qiqi)
she's the most senior in the capital.

759
00:39:24,532 --> 00:39:26,251
She behaves conspicuously
wherever she goes.

760
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,132
Who are you talking about again?

761
00:39:32,692 --> 00:39:33,532
Cheng Song!

762
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:34,811
Cheng Shaogong!

763
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:42,331
Greetings, Madams.

764
00:39:44,331 --> 00:39:48,012
You must be Shaoshang and Yangyang.

765
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,931
Why are you plainly dressed?

766
00:39:53,172 --> 00:39:53,851
Later

767
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:56,052
I'll have someone send
several beautiful dresses for you.

768
00:39:56,572 --> 00:39:57,572
Plain and neat is good.

769
00:39:57,891 --> 00:39:59,652
One appears more gentle this way.

770
00:40:00,052 --> 00:40:00,811
Yes.

771
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:02,411
When you enter a tiger's den like this,

772
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:03,931
being gentle isn't charming.

773
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:06,411
Let me teach you how to dress up.

774
00:40:28,012 --> 00:40:30,212
There seems to be something lacking.

775
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:31,331
Let me take a look.

776
00:40:36,972 --> 00:40:38,092
Qiqi,

777
00:40:38,212 --> 00:40:39,492
aren't these the gifts

778
00:40:39,492 --> 00:40:40,692
you want to give Princess Yuchang?

779
00:40:40,692 --> 00:40:42,212
No matter. I have a lot.

780
00:40:42,572 --> 00:40:43,411
This one looks pretty.

781
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:49,371
This is better.

782
00:40:51,572 --> 00:40:52,612
Pay more attention.

783
00:40:58,092 --> 00:40:58,891
Beautiful.

784
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:04,212
Madams,

785
00:41:04,371 --> 00:41:06,371
I'll take them to...

786
00:41:06,371 --> 00:41:07,172
Go on.

787
00:41:08,212 --> 00:41:09,052
Let's go.

788
00:41:09,572 --> 00:41:11,931
Let me show you the world.

789
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:13,212
Let me tell you this.

790
00:41:13,212 --> 00:41:14,811
You must not be afraid when I'm around.

791
00:41:23,492 --> 00:41:24,652
Are you certain

792
00:41:24,652 --> 00:41:26,212
the person who ruined my plan was

793
00:41:26,212 --> 00:41:27,612
Fourth Lady Cheng?

794
00:41:27,811 --> 00:41:28,572
Yes, it was her.

795
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,931
If she didn't meddle that night,

796
00:41:30,132 --> 00:41:31,132
you and General Ling

797
00:41:31,132 --> 00:41:32,771
would have been the talk of the capital.

798
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:35,612
By all means, you can just watch today.

799
00:41:35,851 --> 00:41:37,411
I invited her today mainly

800
00:41:37,731 --> 00:41:40,012
to teach her a lesson on your behalf.

801
00:41:41,492 --> 00:41:42,212
Let's go.

802
00:41:47,731 --> 00:41:48,731
Where should we sit?

803
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:50,371
