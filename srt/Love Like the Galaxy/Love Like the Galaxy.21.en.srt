00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,600
= Love Like The Galaxy=

00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,500
=Episode 21=

3
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:51,764
He Zhaojun!

4
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:54,364
He Zhaojun, wait!

5
00:01:55,804 --> 00:01:56,764
I've given it a thought.

6
00:02:01,483 --> 00:02:03,244
I still can't let you have Yao.

7
00:02:04,364 --> 00:02:06,163
You'll bully him again in the future.

8
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:09,884
When I was betrothed to Lou Yao,

9
00:02:10,724 --> 00:02:12,324
I only cared if I love him.

10
00:02:12,563 --> 00:02:13,884
But from now on,

11
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:15,964
it doesn't matter

12
00:02:16,284 --> 00:02:17,483
whether I love Lou Yao anymore.

13
00:02:20,964 --> 00:02:22,163
Before my father died,

14
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:23,764
he slapped me hard twice

15
00:02:24,364 --> 00:02:25,643
and left me two pieces of advice.

16
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:28,924
The first one was,

17
00:02:30,203 --> 00:02:31,364
that there would be no one

18
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:34,444
from the He Family to protect me
from now on.

19
00:02:36,563 --> 00:02:37,444
His second advice was,

20
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:40,364
that the He Family
and my younger brother

21
00:02:40,764 --> 00:02:42,083
will fall on my shoulders.

22
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:46,324
I must live on
until my younger brother grows up.

23
00:02:50,643 --> 00:02:51,603
Cheng Shaoshang,

24
00:02:53,444 --> 00:02:55,284
I'm no longer who I was in the past.

25
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,083
I won't behave recklessly either.

26
00:02:58,603 --> 00:02:59,643
With my current circumstances,

27
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,523
I can no longer offend anyone

28
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:04,003
nor can I afford to do so.

29
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,804
I must take care of my younger brother.

30
00:03:17,724 --> 00:03:20,043
I know you're grieving
over your father and brothers.

31
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:23,683
My heart truly breaks for you.

32
00:03:26,043 --> 00:03:28,404
But Yao has no romantic feelings
for you.

33
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:31,083
He shouldn't sacrifice his happiness.

34
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:39,203
Do you think I like Yao?

35
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:43,163
Am I not sacrificing my happiness too?

36
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:51,003
Do you think I'll be happy?

37
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:53,483
If I could exchange it
with my family's life,

38
00:03:53,683 --> 00:03:55,884
I wouldn't want it
even there are thousands of Lou Yao!

39
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,244
Lady Ancheng, no need
to intimidate Lady Cheng.

40
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:03,804
The Lou and the Cheng Family

41
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:06,003
had already decided
to break off the betrothal.

42
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:14,043
I've never seen you protecting
another woman like this before.

43
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:19,603
Cheng Shaoshang.

44
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:22,924
Since you have General Ling,

45
00:04:24,123 --> 00:04:25,964
why do you still want
to snatch Lou Yao away!

46
00:04:27,364 --> 00:04:28,523
You're breaking into cold sweats.

47
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,083
You must not stay outside.

48
00:04:30,643 --> 00:04:32,404
Get on my carriage
and I'll send you home.

49
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:33,483
Do as I say.

50
00:04:45,563 --> 00:04:46,523
Lady Ancheng,

51
00:04:49,563 --> 00:04:51,444
not everyone in the world owes
the He Family.

52
00:04:51,764 --> 00:04:53,364
Your father and brothers were commended
for their loyalty and courage.

53
00:04:53,683 --> 00:04:55,964
The world now takes pity on you
and your younger brother.

54
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,364
But there are many days ahead of us.

55
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:00,003
It's for you to decide

56
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,364
if you want to make enemies everywhere

57
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,244
or be kind to others.

58
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:10,324
Lady Ancheng,
do whatever you think is best.

59
00:05:35,764 --> 00:05:36,804
Is Feng Yi County

60
00:05:38,764 --> 00:05:40,804
as tragic as she said?

61
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,043
Did the He Family fight

62
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:47,764
to the last person?

63
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,043
What happened in Feng Yi County

64
00:05:53,163 --> 00:05:54,844
is different from that in Hua County.

65
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:57,643
It was because General He put
his five sons

66
00:05:57,764 --> 00:05:59,964
and all his trusted followers' lives
on the line.

67
00:06:00,764 --> 00:06:03,003
He and his trusted subordinates first
defended Feng Yi County tenaciously.

68
00:06:04,123 --> 00:06:05,043
The next day,

69
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,284
he gathered the troops

70
00:06:08,123 --> 00:06:09,563
to block Xiao's rebel forces.

71
00:06:12,724 --> 00:06:14,123
General He refused to surrender

72
00:06:16,123 --> 00:06:17,724
and fought until he was
the last one alive.

73
00:06:19,043 --> 00:06:20,764
He managed to defend
Feng Yi County until the end.

74
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:23,844
There were almost no women and children
of the He Family that survived.

75
00:06:26,003 --> 00:06:28,364
Feng Yi County was safe

76
00:06:30,844 --> 00:06:32,364
because General He risked
his life to fight.

77
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:37,603
There were no rebels scattered
in Feng Yi County.

78
00:06:38,804 --> 00:06:40,523
There were no children
who lost their homes.

79
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:43,324
There were no innocent women
who were violated.

80
00:06:44,724 --> 00:06:46,083
There were no hundreds of graves

81
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:49,444
outside just like the Hua County.

82
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:51,844
And you

83
00:06:53,603 --> 00:06:55,964
no longer have to visit
the graves of the dead.

84
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:02,523
I'm not trying to persuade you

85
00:07:03,643 --> 00:07:05,163
to accept the Lou clan's decision
to break off the betrothal.

86
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:08,804
I truly think

87
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:10,924
you're not wrong

88
00:07:12,603 --> 00:07:14,804
no matter what decisions you made

89
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:18,924
at this moment.

90
00:07:21,244 --> 00:07:22,643
I'm just not satisfied

91
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:26,884
why am I always the unlucky one.

92
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:31,924
Why... Why is it always me?

93
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,380
(Marquis Quling's Residence)

94
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:45,924
Thank you for sending me home.

95
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,323
Get some rest when you settled.

96
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,844
Didn't you leave
with He Zhaojun just now?

97
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,604
Why did you end up with General Ling?

98
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,804
He Zhaojun took me
to the Ministry of Justice

99
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:17,684
to witness Prince Xiao's execution.

100
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:19,764
What?

101
00:09:20,724 --> 00:09:22,644
She took you
to witness Prince Xiao's execution?

102
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:24,524
I'll go and see her now.

103
00:09:24,684 --> 00:09:25,484
Yao.

104
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:33,243
Let's leave certain things

105
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:36,083
to discuss some other days.

106
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:38,243
I'll go back inside first.

107
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:40,243
Shaoshang.

108
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:44,283
All right, then.

109
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:45,564
Today,

110
00:09:45,844 --> 00:09:47,083
you should get some rest early.

111
00:09:47,684 --> 00:09:48,884
I'll come and see you tomorrow.

112
00:09:49,844 --> 00:09:52,083
I think it's better for you not to come
for these few days.

113
00:09:54,524 --> 00:09:55,323
I want

114
00:09:55,524 --> 00:09:56,684
to be alone.

115
00:10:11,924 --> 00:10:12,724
Shaoshang,

116
00:10:15,964 --> 00:10:17,964
there are new snack shops opened
at the Western Market.

117
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:19,564
When you're feeling better,

118
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:21,163
I'll bring you there to try them out.

119
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:22,243
What do you think?

120
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:07,123
Young Lady,

121
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:09,724
it's already midnight.
It's time for you to sleep.

122
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:35,203
(They all kept telling me
about morality)

123
00:11:35,684 --> 00:11:36,844
(and understanding.)

124
00:11:38,804 --> 00:11:40,684
(But who's going
to be considerate of me?)

125
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,043
(Cheng Shaoshang,)

126
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:50,443
(I'm no longer who I was in the past.)

127
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:52,363
(I won't behave recklessly either.)

128
00:11:53,844 --> 00:11:56,123
Do you think I like Yao?

129
00:11:56,443 --> 00:11:57,924
Do you think I'll be happy?

130
00:11:58,123 --> 00:11:59,924
If I could exchange it
with my family's life,

131
00:12:00,564 --> 00:12:01,764
I couldn't care less

132
00:12:02,203 --> 00:12:03,403
if there are thousands of Lou Yao!

133
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,003
(It was because General He risked
his life to fight.)

134
00:12:08,363 --> 00:12:11,003
(There were no rebels scattered
in Feng Yi County.)

135
00:12:12,043 --> 00:12:13,684
(There were no children
who lost their homes.)

136
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:16,684
(There were no innocent women
who were violated.)

137
00:12:17,964 --> 00:12:19,283
(There were no hundreds of graves)

138
00:12:19,684 --> 00:12:21,403
(outside just like the Hua County.)

139
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:23,644
(And you)

140
00:12:25,764 --> 00:12:27,880
(no longer have to visit
the tombs of the dead.)

141
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:28,580
(In Memory of Cheng Xiaomei)

142
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:39,500
(Marquis Quling's Residence)

143
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:46,684
(Shaoshang,)

144
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:48,764
(we promised)

145
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:51,003
(that we won't leave each other.)

146
00:13:18,443 --> 00:13:19,283
Madam,

147
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:20,884
Mr. Lou is still outside.

148
00:13:21,043 --> 00:13:22,083
He refuses to leave.

149
00:13:25,844 --> 00:13:26,724
All right.

150
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:33,443
He's truly a passionate man.

151
00:13:34,484 --> 00:13:35,443
It's pity

152
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:38,163
he's not meant to be with Niaoniao.

153
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:44,684
Mine.

154
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,243
It's mine.

155
00:13:46,644 --> 00:13:47,804
It's all mine.

156
00:13:48,163 --> 00:13:51,443
Let's see who dares
to take away my treasure from me.

157
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:53,924
Mine. It's all mine.

158
00:13:56,524 --> 00:13:57,323
Mother!

159
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:58,163
Mother.

160
00:13:58,163 --> 00:13:59,003
Don't touch it!

161
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:01,724
It's mine!

162
00:14:02,243 --> 00:14:03,003
Old Madam,

163
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,484
there are changes in the betrothal
between the Cheng and the Lou Family.

164
00:14:05,484 --> 00:14:07,443
These are the betrothal gifts
the Lou Family sent us.

165
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,003
I ordered to store
these gifts back then.

166
00:14:10,203 --> 00:14:11,804
Now, we have to count them clearly.

167
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:13,644
If the betrothal is annulled,

168
00:14:13,884 --> 00:14:16,003
we need to return everything
to the Lou Family.

169
00:14:16,443 --> 00:14:19,083
I just wrote letters

170
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,524
to my friends a few days ago.

171
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:21,724
I told them

172
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,604
Niaoniao will marry into the family
of the Crown Prince's tutor.

173
00:14:25,724 --> 00:14:27,283
When they heard the news,

174
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,003
they all want to attend
the wedding banquet.

175
00:14:29,003 --> 00:14:29,964
Now that you break off the betrothal,

176
00:14:29,964 --> 00:14:32,684
how am I going to face them now?

177
00:14:34,564 --> 00:14:35,884
Mother,

178
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,083
we haven't even picked a day
for Niaoniao's wedding.

179
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,323
Why did you act ostentatiously?

180
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:41,604
Whether this betrothal
will be continued,

181
00:14:41,684 --> 00:14:42,844
it's the royal court's say.

182
00:14:42,844 --> 00:14:43,684
It's not up to you or me.

183
00:14:43,684 --> 00:14:44,844
Who are they to meddle in this?

184
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,564
All the officials at the court
are rich and powerful.

185
00:14:47,724 --> 00:14:48,724
The moment they decide,

186
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:51,203
they wouldn't care
what happened to the lady

187
00:14:51,203 --> 00:14:52,524
after her betrothal was broken.

188
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:54,083
After they cancel this betrothal,

189
00:14:54,363 --> 00:14:56,724
they're not going to be concerned
about her matchmaking and betrothal.

190
00:15:00,684 --> 00:15:01,484
Old Madam,

191
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:04,003
calm down.

192
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,924
Niaoniao is going to have
a talk with Lou Yao today.

193
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,243
We were just counting
the Lou Family's betrothal gift

194
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:10,844
for preparation, that's all.

195
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:12,243
We're not breaking it off right away.

196
00:15:12,484 --> 00:15:13,243
Really?

197
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:14,163
Yes.

198
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,083
Are you sure?

199
00:15:15,203 --> 00:15:16,163
Yes.

200
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:24,884
Father.

201
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:26,163
Mother.

202
00:15:26,644 --> 00:15:27,403
Grandmother.

203
00:15:28,564 --> 00:15:29,524
I've decided

204
00:15:30,203 --> 00:15:31,083
to go to Lou's residence

205
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:33,964
and break off the betrothal.

206
00:15:52,443 --> 00:15:54,564
Shaoshang has made up her mind.

207
00:15:55,403 --> 00:15:57,844
We'll just drop this betrothal.

208
00:16:03,283 --> 00:16:06,323
If Grand Tutor Lou still refuses
to make a decision,

209
00:16:06,644 --> 00:16:08,323
after we leave Lou's residence today,

210
00:16:08,604 --> 00:16:10,163
I'll clarify to my fellow officials

211
00:16:10,644 --> 00:16:13,564
that we have come in person
to break off the betrothal.

212
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,524
However, the Lou Family refused to agree

213
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,123
regardless of General He's last words.

214
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:20,003
Marquis Quling,
please speak with discretion.

215
00:16:20,443 --> 00:16:21,443
When has the Lou Family refused

216
00:16:22,323 --> 00:16:24,163
to break off the betrothal?

217
00:16:24,604 --> 00:16:27,484
Since Grand Tutor Lou
and First Madam Lou aren't against it,

218
00:16:28,243 --> 00:16:30,524
we'll return
the betrothal token respectively.

219
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:42,644
Shaoshang,

220
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:44,844
didn't we make a promise that day?

221
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,003
As long as I don't go back on my words,
you won't back out.

222
00:16:47,804 --> 00:16:49,283
Did He Zhaojun force you?

223
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:50,724
I'll go and talk to her.

224
00:16:50,724 --> 00:16:51,684
It wasn't He Zhaojun.

225
00:16:54,243 --> 00:16:55,884
It was me who decided it.

226
00:17:01,243 --> 00:17:02,884
General He and his family had died
for the country.

227
00:17:03,644 --> 00:17:04,724
He Zhaojun and her younger brother are

228
00:17:05,203 --> 00:17:06,924
the only surviving members
of the He Family now...

229
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:08,443
We already know this.

230
00:17:09,443 --> 00:17:10,484
You even told me

231
00:17:10,924 --> 00:17:11,964
that our betrothal has nothing to do

232
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:14,403
with how tragic He Zhaojun is.

233
00:17:16,123 --> 00:17:17,724
When it comes to both of us,

234
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:19,964
it's between us.

235
00:17:21,684 --> 00:17:22,884
But when it comes to the world

236
00:17:23,283 --> 00:17:24,123
and the country,

237
00:17:26,924 --> 00:17:27,884
it's not just between us.

238
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:30,043
I don't care about the world
or the country!

239
00:17:33,604 --> 00:17:35,724
All of you talk
about general principles to fool me!

240
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:37,243
You kept telling me

241
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:39,123
it's benevolent to do this.

242
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:41,003
It's repaying a debt of gratitude
to do that.

243
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:43,644
But why am I the only one
who has to suffer in this family?

244
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:44,924
Only me!

245
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:50,524
None of you

246
00:17:50,524 --> 00:17:51,924
can live my life for me.

247
00:17:54,644 --> 00:17:56,684
Why do you have to sacrifice me?

248
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:03,484
Shaoshang,

249
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:06,403
why have you also changed

250
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,123
and also tried to pressure me?

251
00:18:29,283 --> 00:18:30,123
Yao,

252
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:31,484
come out with me.

253
00:18:31,964 --> 00:18:33,203
I have something to tell you.

254
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:16,844
Shaoshang,

255
00:19:17,804 --> 00:19:18,724
you don't have to persuade me.

256
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:21,083
I'll never agree to break off
this betrothal.

257
00:19:37,283 --> 00:19:38,163
Yao,

258
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:41,003
you told me this before.

259
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:44,083
You may not like He Zhaojun.

260
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,123
But General He

261
00:19:46,283 --> 00:19:47,724
was kind to you.

262
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:49,844
No matter how busy he was,

263
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:51,684
he would spare some time
to give guidance to you.

264
00:19:52,163 --> 00:19:53,964
He was both a teacher and a father.

265
00:19:54,804 --> 00:19:56,764
That's why you revere him.

266
00:19:57,884 --> 00:19:58,924
Was it not?

267
00:20:01,163 --> 00:20:02,163
All these years,

268
00:20:02,323 --> 00:20:03,884
you put up with He Zhaojun.

269
00:20:04,363 --> 00:20:05,884
Half of it was
because of being indebted.

270
00:20:06,884 --> 00:20:07,724
The other half was

271
00:20:08,003 --> 00:20:10,083
for the sake of General He.

272
00:20:11,163 --> 00:20:12,203
Was it not?

273
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:18,484
You've always had a close relationship

274
00:20:19,724 --> 00:20:21,043
with Fifth Young Master He.

275
00:20:21,484 --> 00:20:22,644
You even told me

276
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:24,123
he was the one who taught

277
00:20:24,644 --> 00:20:25,844
you archery.

278
00:20:27,243 --> 00:20:28,363
But do you know

279
00:20:29,363 --> 00:20:30,684
how did he die?

280
00:20:33,964 --> 00:20:36,363
Those people shot dozens
of arrows at him.

281
00:20:37,043 --> 00:20:38,524
When they collected his body,

282
00:20:38,684 --> 00:20:40,203
his body was full of punctured
and incised wounds.

283
00:20:40,484 --> 00:20:42,083
His body was badly mutilated.

284
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,363
Fifth Brother...

285
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:49,203
The rest of He's sons

286
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:51,964
were trodden to death by horses.

287
00:20:52,924 --> 00:20:54,443
They all died without a complete body.

288
00:20:56,804 --> 00:20:57,684
Yao.

289
00:20:59,043 --> 00:21:01,123
In Hua County, you told me

290
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:03,283
a great man

291
00:21:03,443 --> 00:21:04,924
should protect the people.

292
00:21:05,323 --> 00:21:07,684
Only then,
he's worthy of heaven and earth.

293
00:21:08,964 --> 00:21:10,003
But do you know?

294
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:13,203
What happened in Feng Yi County
and Hua County are different.

295
00:21:14,163 --> 00:21:15,604
It was because General He

296
00:21:15,724 --> 00:21:18,243
led five of his sons
to storm to the front

297
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:20,323
and protected the people

298
00:21:20,644 --> 00:21:22,283
to prevent this disaster.

299
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,604
He was a great man

300
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:28,524
who died as a martyr for his country.

301
00:21:29,884 --> 00:21:31,163
So the love affairs

302
00:21:32,163 --> 00:21:34,524
between us are not worth mentioning

303
00:21:36,043 --> 00:21:37,484
in front of him.

304
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,604
Yao,

305
00:21:52,283 --> 00:21:53,924
I know you're heartbroken.

306
00:21:55,283 --> 00:21:56,884
I know I've wronged you.

307
00:21:58,043 --> 00:21:58,924
I know

308
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,363
it's easier to persuade you.

309
00:22:00,804 --> 00:22:02,644
But you're the one marrying He Zhaojun.

310
00:22:03,203 --> 00:22:05,163
If I can marry He Zhaojun in your place,

311
00:22:05,764 --> 00:22:07,243
I'd do it for you.

312
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:09,804
I'm sorry.

313
00:22:11,484 --> 00:22:13,043
I'm really sorry.

314
00:22:19,123 --> 00:22:20,003
Say no more.

315
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:22,564
Shaoshang,

316
00:22:24,924 --> 00:22:26,243
you never wronged me.

317
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:34,844
You're right.

318
00:22:37,764 --> 00:22:39,203
I kept saying

319
00:22:39,403 --> 00:22:41,443
I want to be a great man
to protect the people.

320
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:45,283
Yet, I can't even endure
this bit of grievance.

321
00:22:48,964 --> 00:22:50,123
Isn't that funny?

322
00:22:56,564 --> 00:22:57,443
Yao,

323
00:22:59,363 --> 00:23:00,844
you only have to bear
with this temporarily.

324
00:23:01,644 --> 00:23:03,163
But don't let it become
a lifetime grievance.

325
00:23:05,443 --> 00:23:06,243
Can...

326
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:08,964
Can I really do it?

327
00:23:08,964 --> 00:23:10,123
Yes, you can.

328
00:23:11,243 --> 00:23:12,804
Yao, you can do it.

329
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,524
After you're married to He Zhaojun,

330
00:23:16,924 --> 00:23:18,524
you're not only her husband.

331
00:23:19,123 --> 00:23:21,524
You're also her brother and support.

332
00:23:23,524 --> 00:23:25,844
You must love her and guide her.

333
00:23:27,564 --> 00:23:29,203
But if she does something wrong,

334
00:23:30,203 --> 00:23:31,283
you must not tolerate her.

335
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,283
If she loses her temper
and behaves domineeringly again,

336
00:23:34,844 --> 00:23:36,283
you must not endure it

337
00:23:36,524 --> 00:23:38,924
and let her bully you like last time.

338
00:23:40,684 --> 00:23:41,644
Do you remember what I said?

339
00:23:43,564 --> 00:23:45,363
If she behaves unreasonably,

340
00:23:48,003 --> 00:23:50,443
I'll take her to General He's
memorial tablet to reflect.

341
00:24:56,323 --> 00:24:57,283
To all of the elders here,

342
00:24:58,283 --> 00:24:59,323
I've come around.

343
00:24:59,644 --> 00:25:00,764
I agree to break off the betrothal.

344
00:25:09,804 --> 00:25:11,403
Yao feels for the loyal officials
and generals

345
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:13,924
who died for the country
that brought ruins to their families.

346
00:25:14,524 --> 00:25:15,403
He has decided

347
00:25:16,003 --> 00:25:17,804
to fulfill General He's last wish

348
00:25:18,123 --> 00:25:19,283
and marry He Zhaojun.

349
00:25:20,323 --> 00:25:21,684
Such righteous act

350
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:24,003
will be praised by even His Majesty.

351
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:25,964
We shall see

352
00:25:27,203 --> 00:25:28,884
who dares to meddle
in the Second Chamber's affairs.

353
00:25:31,243 --> 00:25:32,083
That's right.

354
00:25:32,604 --> 00:25:34,724
My future wife has a bad temper.

355
00:25:35,123 --> 00:25:36,403
I hope Uncle and Aunt

356
00:25:36,764 --> 00:25:37,804
can bear with it.

357
00:25:40,203 --> 00:25:41,083
Lou Yao,

358
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:43,283
what do you mean by this?

359
00:25:43,684 --> 00:25:44,884
Over the next ten years,

360
00:25:45,604 --> 00:25:46,604
the He Family's family soldiers
and private soldiers

361
00:25:46,724 --> 00:25:48,363
will be
at the Second Chamber's disposal.

362
00:25:48,884 --> 00:25:50,003
I shall see

363
00:25:50,443 --> 00:25:51,844
who dares to bully us.

364
00:25:56,924 --> 00:25:57,924
Enough said!

365
00:25:58,644 --> 00:25:59,564
Just keep quiet.

366
00:26:01,964 --> 00:26:02,924
We'll do this

367
00:26:03,243 --> 00:26:05,243
according to Marquis Quling's wishes.

368
00:26:05,804 --> 00:26:06,844
Bring the betrothal contract.

369
00:26:07,243 --> 00:26:08,323
We'll annul it.

370
00:26:17,964 --> 00:26:18,844
Mr. Cheng.

371
00:26:19,123 --> 00:26:20,043
Mrs. Cheng.

372
00:26:20,363 --> 00:26:21,203
You can treat me

373
00:26:22,403 --> 00:26:24,283
as your nephew in the future.

374
00:26:35,243 --> 00:26:36,203
Mr. Lou,

375
00:26:36,684 --> 00:26:38,924
you must live well with Lady Ancheng.

376
00:26:39,844 --> 00:26:41,123
She's alone and helpless now.

377
00:26:41,524 --> 00:26:43,083
She may look ferocious.

378
00:26:43,443 --> 00:26:45,564
But she's pitiful too.

379
00:26:46,163 --> 00:26:48,644
You can never be wrong

380
00:26:49,003 --> 00:26:50,524
if you treat her courteously
and sincerely.

381
00:27:08,884 --> 00:27:09,764
Shaoshang,

382
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:12,844
you can address me

383
00:27:14,844 --> 00:27:16,243
as your brother from now on.

384
00:27:20,564 --> 00:27:21,443
All right.

385
00:27:25,283 --> 00:27:26,724
I hope everything goes well

386
00:27:28,123 --> 00:27:29,564
for you in the future.

387
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:33,283
When you're appointed
as an official in the future,

388
00:27:34,684 --> 00:27:36,043
may you move towards a great future.

389
00:27:41,403 --> 00:27:42,804
Then I shall wish you

390
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,524
that you'll meet a good husband
in the future.

391
00:27:46,604 --> 00:27:47,564
From then on,

392
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:49,163
you will grow old with him

393
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:51,564
and love each other unconditionally.

394
00:28:30,924 --> 00:28:32,243
Who would have thought

395
00:28:32,484 --> 00:28:34,764
the Lou Family would treat
this matter thoughtlessly.

396
00:28:35,323 --> 00:28:37,443
They broke off the engagement
with the He Family first.

397
00:28:37,724 --> 00:28:40,323
Then they happily engaged
with the Cheng Family.

398
00:28:40,644 --> 00:28:42,604
After that, they broke off
the engagement with the Cheng Family

399
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:45,443
and took He as the new bride
in a flash.

400
00:28:46,283 --> 00:28:47,764
Don't you find that funny?

401
00:28:48,003 --> 00:28:49,443
The Lou Family can't be blamed
in this matter.

402
00:28:49,564 --> 00:28:51,443
It's just that
the He Family is too pitiful.

403
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,363
Everyone in the capital hopes He Zhaojun

404
00:28:53,363 --> 00:28:54,644
can find a good husband.

405
00:28:54,804 --> 00:28:57,283
That Lady Cheng sure is unlucky

406
00:28:57,283 --> 00:28:58,644
to have her betrothal ended
for no reason.

407
00:28:59,764 --> 00:29:01,884
How is she going to discuss marriage
in the future?

408
00:29:02,924 --> 00:29:05,764
Why are you concerned about her?

409
00:29:06,283 --> 00:29:07,604
That Fourth Lady Cheng

410
00:29:07,604 --> 00:29:09,403
is unreasonable and has poor conduct.

411
00:29:09,884 --> 00:29:11,003
She's not like you

412
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:12,203
who's dependable and dignified.

413
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:14,403
You'll be blessed
with happiness in the future.

414
00:29:14,684 --> 00:29:16,443
The Cheng Family is a small family.

415
00:29:16,443 --> 00:29:18,123
How can their daughter

416
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,964
be compared with Her Highness?

417
00:29:20,203 --> 00:29:21,043
If you ask me,

418
00:29:21,203 --> 00:29:22,403
Zisheng is

419
00:29:22,403 --> 00:29:24,323
the only one compatible

420
00:29:24,323 --> 00:29:26,524
with Her Highness in this world.

421
00:29:28,323 --> 00:29:30,884
I've made His Majesty
to talk to him in person.

422
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:31,644
He has agreed

423
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,524
to return every month for meals
at Marquis Chengyang's Residence.

424
00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:35,363
He'll be here today.

425
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:36,403
Really?

426
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:40,003
You're willing to endure humiliation

427
00:29:40,003 --> 00:29:41,323
to help this father and son
to mend their relationship.

428
00:29:41,724 --> 00:29:43,243
You've suffered the most

429
00:29:43,243 --> 00:29:45,684
among all married women in this capital.

430
00:29:46,924 --> 00:29:48,644
I'll find some secret prescriptions
for you.

431
00:29:48,844 --> 00:29:51,764
You must bear offspring
for Marquis Chengyang.

432
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:53,844
It's more practical
to have someone to depend on.

433
00:29:55,604 --> 00:29:56,644
Thank you, Lady Ruyang.

434
00:29:57,644 --> 00:29:58,964
You don't have to be shy.

435
00:29:59,323 --> 00:30:00,323
Why don't you talk

436
00:30:00,484 --> 00:30:01,724
to Marquis Chengyang

437
00:30:02,363 --> 00:30:04,724
about having Zisheng married
and have children?

438
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,484
He should stop fighting and killing
all day.

439
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,323
See what happened to the He Family?

440
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,363
Most of them are dead.

441
00:30:11,363 --> 00:30:12,844
So what if they have
military accomplishments?

442
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:15,684
They still have to marry
into the Lou Family shamelessly.

443
00:30:16,043 --> 00:30:17,964
If everyone lives without a purpose,

444
00:30:20,764 --> 00:30:23,003
the Xiao rebel
would have wiped out this capital.

445
00:30:23,443 --> 00:30:24,484
You ladies

446
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:26,243
won't be alive criticizing

447
00:30:26,403 --> 00:30:27,964
other people's marriage here.

448
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:28,924
Zisheng,

449
00:30:29,644 --> 00:30:32,043
don't behave rudely
in front of Lady Ruyang.

450
00:30:32,283 --> 00:30:34,163
I didn't know someone
who stole someone else's husband

451
00:30:35,003 --> 00:30:36,564
would know what is proper conduct.

452
00:30:36,764 --> 00:30:37,604
Insolence!

453
00:30:37,844 --> 00:30:39,484
Madam Chunyu is your stepmother.

454
00:30:39,644 --> 00:30:41,123
How dare you humiliate her so?

455
00:30:41,403 --> 00:30:42,764
You're such an unfilial son.

456
00:30:42,764 --> 00:30:43,724
Lady Ruyang,

457
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:46,003
do you know

458
00:30:46,764 --> 00:30:49,123
why His Majesty deducts half a year

459
00:30:50,163 --> 00:30:51,644
of my salary?

460
00:30:52,203 --> 00:30:53,604
Don't even try to threaten me!

461
00:30:53,804 --> 00:30:54,964
I'm not Prince Yong.

462
00:30:54,964 --> 00:30:56,283
I've never committed treason.

463
00:30:56,484 --> 00:30:57,764
Are you still going to kill me?

464
00:30:57,844 --> 00:30:59,163
You must be kidding.

465
00:30:59,844 --> 00:31:01,524
When did I say I want to kill you?

466
00:31:01,764 --> 00:31:02,924
I wanted to say

467
00:31:03,323 --> 00:31:05,003
that His Majesty is fair and strict.

468
00:31:05,484 --> 00:31:07,003
No matter who made a mistake,

469
00:31:07,443 --> 00:31:09,283
they will be punished.

470
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:11,844
His Majesty wishes a marriage alliance
between the He and the Lou Family.

471
00:31:12,123 --> 00:31:13,964
This matter has already been decided.

472
00:31:14,323 --> 00:31:15,724
If anyone criticizes this matter,

473
00:31:15,924 --> 00:31:17,644
that person would be committing a crime.

474
00:31:17,644 --> 00:31:18,844
I'm sure you don't want

475
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:20,804
to be charged with this crime

476
00:31:21,363 --> 00:31:23,363
and sacrifice the lifetime glory
you have now.

477
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:24,764
Zisheng,

478
00:31:24,764 --> 00:31:27,964
Lady Ruyang and Princess Yuchang
especially waited for you

479
00:31:27,964 --> 00:31:30,083
to come back and have dinner together.

480
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:32,804
Why don't we talk as we eat?

481
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:33,644
No need.

482
00:31:34,323 --> 00:31:36,363
I'm not in the mood to dine with you.

483
00:31:36,684 --> 00:31:39,083
Please convey a message
to Marquis Chengyang.

484
00:31:39,684 --> 00:31:42,003
Stop pestering His Majesty
with every issue from now on.

485
00:31:42,644 --> 00:31:43,564
I'll always come back

486
00:31:44,443 --> 00:31:46,524
and visit you always.

487
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:48,083
Also,

488
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:49,684
you don't have to worry

489
00:31:50,043 --> 00:31:51,644
about Lady Cheng's marriage.

490
00:31:53,003 --> 00:31:54,123
I'll be responsible

491
00:31:55,443 --> 00:31:56,604
for her marriage.

492
00:32:21,363 --> 00:32:23,283
It was such a perfect betrothal.

493
00:32:24,764 --> 00:32:26,924
And they broke it off just like that.

494
00:32:27,203 --> 00:32:30,283
It's so unfair to the Cheng Family.

495
00:32:32,123 --> 00:32:33,043
Mother,

496
00:32:33,443 --> 00:32:34,684
it brings more benefit
to the Cheng and Lou Family

497
00:32:34,684 --> 00:32:37,403
after breaking this betrothal.

498
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:40,604
All for your lousy reputation!

499
00:32:41,123 --> 00:32:43,323
You had to end this perfect betrothal.

500
00:32:43,564 --> 00:32:44,564
Is it worth it?

501
00:32:44,724 --> 00:32:47,443
You must have become a fool
after being an official.

502
00:32:47,804 --> 00:32:50,564
It'll only feel real

503
00:32:50,724 --> 00:32:52,043
to have food, money,

504
00:32:52,043 --> 00:32:54,884
and possessions in our hands.

505
00:32:54,884 --> 00:32:56,083
Mother,

506
00:32:56,524 --> 00:32:58,003
stop talking nonsense.

507
00:32:58,003 --> 00:32:59,083
Am I talking nonsense?

508
00:32:59,524 --> 00:33:01,323
How is this nonsense?

509
00:33:02,644 --> 00:33:03,524
It'll be hard

510
00:33:04,323 --> 00:33:07,764
for Niaoniao to find

511
00:33:07,764 --> 00:33:11,043
someone oblivious
to have eyes on her now.

512
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:13,323
Don't you know

513
00:33:13,564 --> 00:33:17,043
it'll be hard for Niaoniao to find
another marriage prospect in the future?

514
00:33:18,243 --> 00:33:19,323
His Majesty is obviously

515
00:33:19,804 --> 00:33:22,003
picking on us
because we're not a large household.

516
00:33:23,804 --> 00:33:25,484
Careful! The walls have ears.

517
00:33:27,363 --> 00:33:28,484
We'll all lose our heads

518
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:30,924
if someone heard
how you vilify His Majesty.

519
00:33:32,163 --> 00:33:33,403
I didn't. I was only...

520
00:33:33,403 --> 00:33:34,203
I was...

521
00:33:34,203 --> 00:33:36,323
I was only feeling sorry
for my granddaughter.

522
00:33:36,323 --> 00:33:37,884
Do I have to lose my head too?

523
00:33:43,003 --> 00:33:44,924
If we don't tell anyone,

524
00:33:45,443 --> 00:33:46,964
how would His Majesty know what I said?

525
00:33:49,764 --> 00:33:51,083
Old Madam. Master.

526
00:33:51,604 --> 00:33:52,684
Someone from the palace is here.

527
00:33:55,323 --> 00:33:56,283
Are they here to catch me?

528
00:33:56,283 --> 00:33:57,804
I was only spouting nonsense. I...

529
00:33:57,884 --> 00:33:59,804
I was only speaking nonsense.

530
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,524
What did they say?

531
00:34:01,764 --> 00:34:03,043
They said His Majesty has decreed

532
00:34:03,163 --> 00:34:04,243
that Master and Madam

533
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:05,644
bring Young Masters and Young Ladies

534
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:07,924
to the sacrificial ceremony
at Mount Tugao with him.

535
00:34:08,564 --> 00:34:09,443
That's great.

536
00:34:09,844 --> 00:34:12,163
Niaoniao has been sad about ending
the engagement over these few days.

537
00:34:12,363 --> 00:34:14,403
I was worried about where
to bring her out to calm her mind.

538
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:16,163
Take me there so I can thank
His Majesty's grace.

539
00:34:16,163 --> 00:34:17,443
Master and Madam?

540
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:19,163
Young Masters and Young Ladies?

541
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,564
Why am I not invited?

542
00:34:20,764 --> 00:34:22,564
His Majesty didn't invite you.

543
00:34:23,203 --> 00:34:24,484
If we defy his decree,

544
00:34:24,964 --> 00:34:26,644
it's a capital...

545
00:34:31,764 --> 00:34:33,524
You unfilial son!

546
00:34:42,844 --> 00:34:43,804
Shaoshang!

547
00:34:46,203 --> 00:34:47,684
I was wondering

548
00:34:47,684 --> 00:34:48,964
where you were
during the sacrificial ceremony.

549
00:34:49,123 --> 00:34:50,363
So this is where you were hiding.

550
00:34:50,524 --> 00:34:52,484
You didn't know
how lively it was just now.

551
00:34:52,484 --> 00:34:54,804
His Majesty, Her Majesty, Consort Yue,

552
00:34:54,804 --> 00:34:56,443
and all the princes and princesses.

553
00:34:56,443 --> 00:34:58,123
All the royalties we don't get to see

554
00:34:58,123 --> 00:34:58,924
were all present.

555
00:34:59,203 --> 00:35:00,123
Why didn't you go?

556
00:35:00,484 --> 00:35:01,804
I'm a little tired.

557
00:35:01,924 --> 00:35:03,403
I want to go back to the tent and rest.

558
00:35:04,163 --> 00:35:05,403
We don't always get the chance
to come out like this.

559
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:07,003
It'll be a waste to coup up in the tent.

560
00:35:08,363 --> 00:35:09,243
Marquis Hou had prepared

561
00:35:09,243 --> 00:35:12,163
the ground for mounted archery
behind the mountains.

562
00:35:12,163 --> 00:35:13,003
There will be food and games.

563
00:35:13,003 --> 00:35:14,323
I don't even know them.

564
00:35:14,484 --> 00:35:15,443
I don't want to go.

565
00:35:16,924 --> 00:35:17,804
Marquis Ban wants

566
00:35:17,804 --> 00:35:19,884
to introduce his great-grandson,
Young Marquis Ban

567
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,123
to everyone.

568
00:35:21,123 --> 00:35:23,764
That's why the young masters
and young ladies were invited this year.

569
00:35:23,924 --> 00:35:25,844
But Marquis Ban is pitiful too.

570
00:35:25,964 --> 00:35:27,003
His whole family died

571
00:35:27,123 --> 00:35:29,844
because of war.
His sons and daughters all died.

572
00:35:29,964 --> 00:35:30,964
Even his five grandsons

573
00:35:31,484 --> 00:35:32,524
had died too.

574
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,203
Ban Jia is the only descendant left.

575
00:35:35,323 --> 00:35:37,283
So he was pampered and spoiled.

576
00:35:37,764 --> 00:35:39,884
He has now reached
a marriageable age.

577
00:35:39,884 --> 00:35:41,724
Yet, it's his first time traveling
this far.

578
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,964
He doesn't even know
his way in the capital.

579
00:35:44,604 --> 00:35:46,203
So his whole family is heroes too.

580
00:35:48,243 --> 00:35:50,724
His life is somewhat similar
to He Zhaojun.

581
00:35:53,163 --> 00:35:54,724
Why did you have to bring her up?

582
00:35:56,163 --> 00:35:57,003
Qiqi,

583
00:35:57,003 --> 00:35:58,323
why don't you go ahead?

584
00:35:58,484 --> 00:36:00,203
I'll accompany Niaoniao here.

585
00:36:00,403 --> 00:36:01,604
I won't let you do that.

586
00:36:01,604 --> 00:36:03,083
You should have some fun
if you're sad.

587
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:03,964
Let's go.

588
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:04,844
Move it.

589
00:36:04,844 --> 00:36:05,243
I don't want to go.

590
00:36:05,243 --> 00:36:05,884
Go.

591
00:36:05,884 --> 00:36:07,323
No, I don't want to go.

592
00:36:07,403 --> 00:36:08,123
I said go.

593
00:36:22,524 --> 00:36:23,564
Hurry up.

594
00:36:31,844 --> 00:36:33,363
Shaoshang, sit here.
Yangyang, sit there.

595
00:36:45,524 --> 00:36:46,203
Good!

596
00:36:46,524 --> 00:36:47,443
Marvelous.

597
00:36:47,443 --> 00:36:48,243
Guards!

598
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,524
Send my purse over there.

599
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,844
It's not fun to just watch.

600
00:36:55,123 --> 00:36:57,724
Why don't we guess who's going to win?

601
00:36:57,724 --> 00:37:00,844
I'll reward the winner generously.

602
00:37:01,203 --> 00:37:01,924
See that?

603
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:04,524
Fifth Princess is the most extravagant.

604
00:37:04,884 --> 00:37:06,380
Among the princes and princesses,

605
00:37:06,443 --> 00:37:06,804
(Fifth Princess)

606
00:37:06,804 --> 00:37:07,724
(Fifth Princess)
she's the only one

607
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:09,684
who was born
after the world is peaceful.

608
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,684
She's also
His Majesty's youngest daughter

609
00:37:11,804 --> 00:37:13,043
and the most favored.

610
00:37:14,123 --> 00:37:14,844
By the way,

611
00:37:14,844 --> 00:37:16,363
she's very close to Wang Ling.

612
00:37:16,363 --> 00:37:17,403
When you see her,

613
00:37:19,443 --> 00:37:20,604
you must keep your distance.

614
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:28,724
(Mr. Zhao hits the target!)

615
00:37:28,724 --> 00:37:31,524
(Fifth Princess rewards
100 silver taels!)

616
00:37:31,524 --> 00:37:33,003
The one sitting next to her is

617
00:37:33,283 --> 00:37:35,123
Third Princess.

618
00:37:35,123 --> 00:37:36,644
She was given birth by Consort Yue.

619
00:37:37,043 --> 00:37:39,443
She's the most greedy for money.

620
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:41,283
I heard she was raised

621
00:37:41,283 --> 00:37:43,680
by her uncle, Marquis Yue
when she was born.

622
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:44,820
(Third Princess)

623
00:37:46,283 --> 00:37:46,884
See

624
00:37:46,884 --> 00:37:49,243
how vulgar she looks?

625
00:37:54,003 --> 00:37:54,804
Good!

626
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:56,484
Fifth Sister.

627
00:37:56,924 --> 00:37:58,524
If Mother knew you placed bets

628
00:37:58,804 --> 00:38:01,243
on a blessing ceremony like today,

629
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:02,724
how unhappy she would be.

630
00:38:02,804 --> 00:38:04,644
I did it for good luck.

631
00:38:05,403 --> 00:38:06,644
You don't have to be nervous.

632
00:38:07,043 --> 00:38:08,043
Besides,

633
00:38:08,524 --> 00:38:10,083
everyone in the palace knows

634
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:11,804
that Consort Chu is not well off.

635
00:38:12,243 --> 00:38:13,644
I didn't ask you to spend money.

636
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,443
Why do you feel bitter

637
00:38:15,564 --> 00:38:17,243
as if you're inexperienced in this?

638
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:22,644
Fifth Sister, which of these gentlemen

639
00:38:22,644 --> 00:38:25,043
do you want to recruit as your aide
in the palace?

640
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:28,323
Father has decided to unite
the Xuan and Yue clan through marriage.

641
00:38:28,443 --> 00:38:31,043
You and my cousin
will be getting married someday.

642
00:38:31,123 --> 00:38:33,043
It's better that you don't offend
my cousin.

643
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:34,403
I'm sure you know

644
00:38:34,524 --> 00:38:36,684
my cousin is indifferent to everything.

645
00:38:36,844 --> 00:38:38,323
Why don't you think

646
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:40,163
about what to do with all the aides

647
00:38:40,163 --> 00:38:41,884
you have at your palace first?

648
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:43,844
Third Sister.

649
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:45,724
If you don't want to watch the archery,

650
00:38:45,964 --> 00:38:47,964
you can play chess
with Third Prince Consort.

651
00:38:47,964 --> 00:38:48,884
What do you say?

652
00:38:54,804 --> 00:38:55,804
If you ask me,

653
00:38:55,804 --> 00:38:57,524
Second Princess is

654
00:38:58,564 --> 00:38:59,484
the most reliable

655
00:38:59,484 --> 00:39:00,524
(Second Princess)

656
00:39:00,524 --> 00:39:01,860
among the princesses in the capital.

657
00:39:03,604 --> 00:39:04,524
Did you know?

658
00:39:04,724 --> 00:39:06,123
If Her Majesty

659
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,644
and Second Princess didn't stop them,

660
00:39:09,443 --> 00:39:10,443
those two

661
00:39:12,323 --> 00:39:14,884
would have fought over who should stand
in front during the ceremony.

662
00:39:17,043 --> 00:39:17,964
Also,

663
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:19,884
the one who doesn't wear much jewelry.

664
00:39:20,043 --> 00:39:21,924
That's the Crown Princess.

665
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,123
(Crown Princess)

666
00:39:22,123 --> 00:39:24,724
She was taken as a wife
for the Crown Prince

667
00:39:24,724 --> 00:39:25,860
before His Majesty ascended
to the throne.

668
00:39:26,443 --> 00:39:28,123
They said she comes from a poor family

669
00:39:28,123 --> 00:39:29,443
and is of rural origin.

670
00:39:33,644 --> 00:39:35,804
You'll get into trouble sooner or later
for gossiping.

671
00:39:36,524 --> 00:39:37,804
Niaoniao doesn't enter the palace.

672
00:39:37,924 --> 00:39:39,524
When will she ever meet
these female royalties?

673
00:39:39,524 --> 00:39:41,083
Stop telling her all
these private matters.

674
00:40:00,804 --> 00:40:02,684
Look! It's Mr. Chen's turn to shoot.

675
00:40:02,924 --> 00:40:04,003
They said his archery skills

676
00:40:04,003 --> 00:40:06,043
can be considered excellent
in the capital.

677
00:40:07,644 --> 00:40:08,884
Do you call that excellent?

678
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,884
I can shoot more accurately
using my legs with my eyes closed.

679
00:40:15,884 --> 00:40:16,964
Please spare me from your nonsense.
