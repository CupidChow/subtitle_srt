00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,360
(Huo)

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,380
(Niaoniao, from Father)
May the family grow and prosper.

5
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,380
(Everything is fine back at home)
May the family grow and prosper.

6
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,060
General!

7
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,350
General!

8
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,740
General!

9
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,710
Please go and do

10
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,590
what I ordered just now.

11
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,230
(Five Years Later)
Yes. Lady Cheng.

12
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,660
Place the lanterns upright.

13
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,620
Yes.

14
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,350
It's the new year again.

15
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,620
Don't you want to go home?

16
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,140
Your Majesty doesn't know this.

17
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,620
My residence is very lively right now.

18
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,990
Qiqi, Miss Qingcong and Cheng Yang

19
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,310
all gave birth.

20
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,020
If I go back,

21
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,070
there might not be enough space for me.

22
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,710
I'll just stay in Changqiu Palace
and accompany Your Majesty.

23
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,990
Isn't that good?

24
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,740
Your Majesty.

25
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,620
It's the New Year today.

26
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,830
Just like last year,

27
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,990
we still have to make a wish.

28
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,620
I wish

29
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,950
for you to meet someone nice

30
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,860
so I can see you get married

31
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,500
and give birth to children

32
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,470
when I'm still alive.

33
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,230
Can't I stay single forever?

34
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,990
It has been five years

35
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,380
since I requested
to stay in Changqiu Palace

36
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,620
and you've accompanied me
for five years.

37
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,540
Haven't you thought it through?

38
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,950
I have.

39
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,230
But I can't forgive.

40
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,110
We are not fated together.

41
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,950
We've bid farewell

42
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,230
so it's no longer possible for us.

43
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,620
What a pity.

44
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,900
I wanted to ask
His Majesty to summon Zisheng back.

45
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,990
Five years have passed after all.

46
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,070
He has been suffering in the Northwest.

47
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,140
It's time for him to return.

48
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,140
It's just getting married
and giving birth.

49
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,990
Can't it be with someone else?

50
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,660
Why does it have to be him?

51
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,310
I want you to marry the person you love

52
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,020
instead of any random person.

53
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,660
There's no difference

54
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,740
for someone who is heartbroken.

55
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Then, I wish for you

56
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,070
to have someone

57
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,430
to accompany you
for the rest of your life

58
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,540
after I die.

59
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,540
Your Majesty,
don't say something so inauspicious.

60
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,070
Go and hang it up.

61
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,990
Yes.

62
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,190
Your Majesty.

63
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,140
I will accompany you

64
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,260
and take care of you forever.

65
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,540
Isn't that good?

66
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,020
Silly child.

67
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,020
No matter how you want
to live the rest of your life,

68
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,470
I will also support you.

69
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,470
Every path you want to take is the best.

70
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,430
However,

71
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,230
perhaps it's my greed,

72
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,540
I always hope for you

73
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,430
to have a more complete life

74
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,430
so I can feel more relief.

75
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,500
Right now,

76
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,430
even Fifth Princess has married.

77
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,350
The one I'm most worried of

78
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,110
is you.

79
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,830
Look.

80
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,310
The snow

81
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,900
is so heavy.

82
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,260
Your Majesty!

83
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,350
Your Majesty!

84
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,190
Your Majesty!

85
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,470
Spare the formalities.

86
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,660
How is

87
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,830
Empress Xuan doing today?

88
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,430
I heard

89
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,140
she's not doing too well.

90
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,830
Physician Sun said

91
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,230
she can only live for few months at the worst.

92
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,590
If she's lucky,

93
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,590
she might live to see spring.

94
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,260
Shen'an's life has been tough.

95
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,190
Heng and I

96
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,230
wanted

97
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,710
to visit her

98
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,260
but she didn't want to see us.

99
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,620
Shaoshang.

100
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,310
You should accompany her more

101
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,990
in my place.

102
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,070
Empress Yue has been
sending food monthly

103
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,020
and also a physician
to treat Her Majesty.

104
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,740
Her Majesty accepted everything.

105
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,380
Her Majesty also requested His Majesty

106
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,470
to move her

107
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,070
and return Changqiu Palace

108
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,900
to Empress Yue.

109
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,780
Her Majesty also said

110
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,110
she should be

111
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,380
called the Empress of Eastern Sea

112
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,710
according to her son's land
at the Eastern Sea.

113
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,380
It has been five years.

114
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,230
Why does Shen'an still remember this?

115
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,860
Go back and tell her

116
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,740
my message.

117
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,230
Say it's troublesome

118
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,710
to move our residence.

119
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,310
I don't like to move
when I've been staying in one place

120
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,860
for a long time.

121
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,830
I'm used to staying in Yongle Palace.

122
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,670
I'm lazy to move.

123
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,630
Also,

124
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,150
there's no need

125
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,430
to change her title.

126
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,470
She will always be Empress Xuan.

127
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,870
Titles

128
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,470
have not always been my thing.

129
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,500
If she

130
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,710
mentions it again,

131
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,340
that means she's trying to offend me.

132
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,190
Understand?

133
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,100
I thank Empress Yue

134
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,950
in Empress Xuan's place.

135
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,820
It has been five years.

136
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,430
You didn't step out of the palace

137
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,950
and we can only meet and talk here.

138
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,740
I thought

139
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,710
you want to live the rest of your life
in Changqiu Palace.

140
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,020
You are the one

141
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,470
who always waits for me here.

142
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,430
I came to speak with you

143
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,020
because I can't stand it.

144
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,020
What's the difference?

145
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,060
Men and women of the world

146
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,230
are always waiting for each other.

147
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,710
There will be people
who they miss out on

148
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,190
and people who
they can finally meet successfully.

149
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,470
I wonder if Shaoshang

150
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,390
is someone I can meet successfully

151
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,020
or someone I will miss out on.

152
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,300
Thank you for accompanying me
for all these years.

153
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,950
The only person I meet is you

154
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,230
since I'm staying here in seclusion.

155
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,300
Aren't those servants
at Changqiu Palace people?

156
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,150
What about Madam Zhai?

157
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:31,780
Shaoshang.

158
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,580
Empress Xuan wants you to get married.

159
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,430
What is your plan?

160
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,580
Empress Xuan's health is declining.

161
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,630
She wants to see you get married
before she dies.

162
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,540
However, among the people you can marry,

163
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,300
there are only a few
who Empress Xuan trusts.

164
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,300
Why don't you pick me?

165
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,020
Our backgrounds are similar.

166
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,390
You are looking for a husband

167
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,630
and I'm looking for a wife.

168
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,820
Why don't we

169
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,820
just make do with it

170
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,500
and make an act

171
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,740
so Empress Xuan can be relieved.

172
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,710
If you are in a rush to get married,

173
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,100
why didn't you agree to the marriages

174
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,060
that Official Ji arranged for you?

175
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,580
Yuan Shanjian.

176
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,740
I know what you are thinking

177
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,910
but I can't give you what you want.

178
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,260
Shaoshang.

179
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,710
Do you know

180
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,470
the reason why all your marriages

181
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,390
have been failures?

182
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,740
Because you are short-sighted.

183
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,820
Look.

184
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,230
My parents raised me
in a free environment.

185
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,580
You want freedom.

186
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,150
No one is freer

187
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,820
than me in the capital.

188
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,820
We are most suitable for each other.

189
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,340
How do you know

190
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,390
you can't give me what I want?

191
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,910
What do you want?

192
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,870
Since we were born,

193
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,780
we have been slightly mean.

194
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,430
We can be ward mates

195
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,990
and we can be allies.

196
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,340
We trust each other

197
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,670
and won't betray each other

198
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,390
because our goals are aligned.

199
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,470
I cherish myself more

200
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,020
compared to a certain person

201
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,100
and won't put myself at risk.

202
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,340
So,

203
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,780
I'm more suitable for you

204
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,260
than him.

205
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,150
I have

206
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,580
summoned Zisheng back to the capital.

207
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,630
He will

208
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,230
arrive soon.

209
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,300
People always

210
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,670
can't let go of
their emotional entanglement.

211
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,990
They are trapped by that

212
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,580
and finally end up

213
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:34,820
in a more painful situation.

214
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,950
The past

215
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,540
will remain as the past.

216
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,060
We need to cherish
our present and future.

217
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,540
If you want your future to be smooth,

218
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,260
you have to break through

219
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,060
your emotional entanglement.

220
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,710
If I still have him

221
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,500
in my heart right now,

222
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,260
are you still willing to marry me?

223
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,020
Yes.

224
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,870
I can wait for you

225
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,340
to forget about him slowly.

226
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,430
I will keep waiting

227
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,500
until the day you turn around

228
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,060
and see me.

229
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,100
Your Majesty.

230
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,740
I request to leave the palace for once.

231
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,430
What for?

232
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,060
To get engaged with Yuan Shanjian.

233
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,340
Your Majesty, sit down.

234
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,430
Even if you stretch your neck,

235
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,470
Zisheng

236
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,540
won't be able to fly back.

237
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,470
Do you think

238
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,390
an accident happened to him on the way?

239
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,060
I shouldn't have asked
Third Prince to welcome him.

240
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,390
Didn't he send someone back

241
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,540
to say they have just entered
the capital gates 15 minutes ago?

242
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,740
It takes some time

243
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,150
to reach the palace
from the capital gates.

244
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,500
Do you think Zisheng
has wings on his back?

245
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,100
Your Majesty!

246
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,060
Your Majesty! He's here!

247
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,190
General Huo has returned!

248
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,020
He's back?

249
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,540
Hurry! Go!

250
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,470
Yes!

251
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,820
He's back.

252
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,390
Zisheng.

253
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,500
How alike.

254
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,630
He's really alike.

255
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,540
Zisheng is growing

256
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,190
to become like Huo Chong.

257
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,230
I, Huo Buyi, the criminal,

258
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,580
am here to see Your Majesty.

259
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,060
Zisheng.

260
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,470
Stand up.

261
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,190
Let me take a good look at you.

262
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,910
It's great to see you back.

263
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,870
It's great to see you back.

264
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,580
It has been five years.

265
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,630
You are so generous.

266
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,540
You left all the capable people

267
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,430
in the capital.

268
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,990
Shaoshang has never left the palace
for five years.

269
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,300
Do you think
she needs you to protect her?

270
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,230
You, on the other hand,

271
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,390
got a useless person

272
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,780
to stay beside you.

273
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,260
You gained new injuries
before your old ones are healed.

274
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,500
Do you want to die?

275
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,540
You.

276
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,260
Tell me.

277
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,870
How did your Young Master

278
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,910
get injured?

279
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,780
Five years ago,

280
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,150
General Wan was assassinated
by the remnants of Emperor Li

281
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,780
so Young Master went to rescue him
with only a few men.

282
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,500
However, all of them
were suicidal soldiers.

283
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,500
Their methods were strange.

284
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,950
We had fewer people

285
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,580
so Young Master got injured.

286
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,580
Why did you go and rescue him?

287
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:31,990
Didn't I ask

288
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,780
Yuan Shanjian's father
to lead an army to rescue him?

289
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,150
I'm not sure.

290
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,020
Young Master wouldn't tell me.

291
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,500
In less than two years,
Young Master risked his life again.

292
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,740
This time,

293
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,150
he went to suppress the bandits at Shu.

294
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,780
General Cheng Song was ambushed.

295
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,630
Young Master...

296
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,470
Fei!

297
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,060
Enough.

298
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,190
I see.

299
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,630
I was wondering

300
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,300
why Cheng Song didn't
come to acknowledge his achievement

301
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,500
when he returned.

302
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:03,740
Turns out

303
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,820
someone was helping him behind his back.

304
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,740
I just don't want
my compatriot to be trapped.

305
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,740
Providing support

306
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,540
is what I'm supposed to do.

307
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,630
Does Shaoshang know

308
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,060
what you did?

309
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,150
Are you hoping

310
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:28,340
for Shaoshang to forgive you
because of this

311
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,150
and reconcile with you?

312
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,630
I did something wrong.

313
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,470
I dare not ask Shaoshang to forgive me.

314
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,670
She doesn't like me
controlling her life.

315
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,060
If she knew I did all that,

316
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,670
she will only hate me more.

317
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,230
I was selfish.

318
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,820
But that's all.

319
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,990
Do you

320
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,990
really not have any other intentions?

321
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,230
I don't.

322
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,580
That's good to hear.

323
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,950
Right now,

324
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:23,580
I asked Third Prince to
oversee the Land Distribution Order.

325
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,430
Since you have returned,

326
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,060
you should help him

327
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,630
implement this order.

328
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,990
This will affect the empire's future.

329
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,740
You must not treat it lightly.

330
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,260
Yes.

331
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,710
Today,

332
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,950
it's Shaoshang's first time
leaving the palace

333
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,500
for the last five years.

334
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,540
She is going with Yuan Shanjian

335
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,390
to meet his parents.

336
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,470
They are getting engaged soon.

337
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,820
From now on,

338
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,260
both of you

339
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,580
will be going your separate ways.

340
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,390
Official Yuan is steady.

341
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,470
He knows what he is doing.

342
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,230
Lady Cheng...

343
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,300
Lady Cheng can have someone to rely on

344
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,990
by marrying him.

345
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,990
What about you?

346
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,500
What about

347
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,710
your future?

348
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,580
Even Cui You

349
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,910
who is faithful to your aunt

350
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,060
said

351
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:45,100
to leave the position of his wife empty
and marry a concubine.

352
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,060
I see you

353
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,020
all alone

354
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,780
and I feel bad.

355
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:57,260
Father, don't worry about Zisheng.

356
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,020
I heard

357
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,340
when Zisheng was injured

358
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,820
at the Northwestern Army Camp,

359
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,430
Lady Luo

360
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,340
was taking care of him
by his side daily.

361
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:06,740
Apparently,

362
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,710
Lady Luo

363
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,230
is different now
in her way of speech and personality.

364
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,740
Whenever she sees other people,

365
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,190
she tells them

366
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:15,710
she will marry Zisheng soon
since he is back in the capital now.

367
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,020
Your Highness.

368
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,780
There's nothing between Lady Luo and me.

369
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,230
There's no way we are getting married.

370
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,780
Fei.

371
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,430
Yes.

372
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,630
When we return,

373
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,710
send a dowry to Lady Luo

374
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,300
and help her find a husband.

375
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,820
You are really quick

376
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,950
in denying everything.

377
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,430
Young Master.

378
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,670
Are you really not going to see
Fourth Young Lady Cheng anymore?

379
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,340
When I finish rebuilding Huo Family's
graveyard and ancestral hall,

380
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,710
I will tell my ancestors

381
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,020
that I will not get married
and have children forever.

382
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,230
I ask for nothing else

383
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,100
in my life.

384
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,060
Young Master.

385
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,300
You are obviously
not thinking it through.

386
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,790
What's wrong with your hands?

387
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,300
It's just frostbite.

388
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:48,790
It's fine.

389
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,870
I've adjusted the stirrup.

390
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,540
Lady Cheng, be careful when you

391
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:05,870
ride a horse in the future.

392
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,180
Thank you, General Huo.

393
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,220
I am no longer
the Cheng Shaoshang from the past.

394
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,180
I can ride a horse now

395
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,390
even without a stirrup.

396
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,660
Thank you for taking care
of my fiancee, General Huo.

397
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,430
However,

398
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,270
it should end here.

399
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,990
Huo Buyi.

400
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,270
I know what you are thinking
even if you don't say anything.

401
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,180
From the day you returned,

402
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,140
I knew you wouldn't let go.

403
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,540
I know I'm not as good as you

404
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,910
in her heart.

405
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,580
But I understand Shaoshang's temper.

406
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,750
Even if she still misses you,

407
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,790
she still might not choose you.

408
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,700
Since Fifth Princess got married

409
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,470
and King of Eastern Sea
went to his fief,

410
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,220
Changqiu Palace

411
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,750
has never been so lively.

412
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:14,790
That's right.

413
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,870
Jitong,

414
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,310
since you have returned,

415
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,580
you should stay a few more days

416
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,500
and have a chat with Her Majesty.

417
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,350
You can try the rice wine I made.

418
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,350
These dishes on the table

419
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,660
can also be paired with wine.

420
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,180
Her Majesty likes them a lot.

421
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,700
Look how busy you are, Lady Cheng.

422
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,540
There's no need to treat me.

423
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,950
I am also someone from Changqiu Palace.

424
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,700
Lady Cheng has been

425
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,700
keeping Changqiu Palace well-managed

426
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,270
in the last few years.

427
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:47,140
The dishes are delicious
and the wine is nice.

428
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,180
I can see that you learned a lot

429
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,580
in Changqiu Palace
in the five years since I left.

430
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,310
I'm afraid you have forgotten

431
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,620
because you left this place
for a long time.

432
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,020
Five years ago,

433
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,830
before you were married
to the Northwest,

434
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,180
I was also the one who
arranged Her Majesty's birthday banquet.

435
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,540
I didn't start to learn

436
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,660
after you left, Jitong.

437
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,430
Yes.

438
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,390
Your life is better.

439
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:10,060
Unlike me, an unlucky person.

440
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,020
When my late husband was seriously ill,

441
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,950
I had been taking care of him
day and night

442
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,580
yet someone still gossips about me

443
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,990
wanting to remarry someone else.

444
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,790
Because of that,

445
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,900
I had to take care of my in-laws

446
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,100
at the Jia Family for a few years
after my husband passed away.

447
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,870
I had a hard time enduring that.

448
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,700
The son of the Jia Family died early.

449
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,830
Your family was under the
Jia Family's protection for many years.

450
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,750
It's your duty
to take care of your in-laws.

451
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,950
How can you complain?

452
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,140
Jitong.

453
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,700
We need to look at the future.

454
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,430
Many good things will definitely

455
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,180
happen for you in the future.

456
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,220
You are right.

457
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,310
We need to look ahead.

458
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,910
Zisheng

459
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,390
used to say the same thing to me.

460
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,870
Although he is strict,

461
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,990
he was tolerant of me.

462
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,020
He only allowed me to enter his tent

463
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,950
to serve him food and wine.

464
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,180
I'm sure you know.

465
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,220
He doesn't eat or drink when he is busy.

466
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,790
I felt bad seeing that.

467
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,310
After that,

468
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,500
he stopped me from entering his tent.

469
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,660
Perhaps he didn't want me
to overwork myself

470
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,750
and see me suffer.

471
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,990
Since you are close to Zisheng,

472
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,180
I'm sure

473
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,180
you already have an engagement with him.

474
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,700
He has yet to mention it to me

475
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,350
but I think it will be soon.

476
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,140
When he received His Majesty's edict

477
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,790
regarding Your Majesty's illness,

478
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,660
he rushed back
to the capital immediately.

479
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,220
He came back in a rush
and didn't even bring me along.

480
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,700
I was wondering

481
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,350
if perhaps

482
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,990
he wanted to propose to me
in the capital.

483
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,310
Seems like it's a bad time
for Her Majesty to be ill

484
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,790
and it interfered with your plans.

485
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,060
No. That's not what I meant.

486
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,350
Of course, I know.

487
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,060
When Her Majesty was still the empress,

488
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,620
she protected the Luo Family
more than once.

489
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,540
With Her Majesty's grace,

490
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,060
it's impossible for you

491
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,620
to blame Her Majesty.

492
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,350
If that's really the case,

493
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,020
you are worse than a beast.

494
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,140
I know Lady Cheng

495
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,540
doesn't like me and Zisheng together.

496
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,390
But we love each other

497
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,910
and can't hold back ourselves.

498
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,620
Besides,

499
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,580
both of you
have cancelled the engagement.

500
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,470
There's nothing wrong
even if he marries me now.

501
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,750
After all,
how can a man take care of himself

502
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,790
without a wife by his side

503
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,180
when he is out on the battlefield?

504
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,540
I'm sure you don't want him

505
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,540
to live the rest of his life poorly.

506
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,430
I am really in a dilemma.

507
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,350
I have you on one hand
and him on the other.

508
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,020
Lady Luo.

509
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,700
It's hard to leave the palace
when the gates are locked.

510
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,990
You just returned to the capital.

511
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,870
You should first return to your home.

512
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,790
You shouldn't stay too long

513
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,430
in Changqiu Palace.

514
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,620
Your Majesty.

515
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,830
I used to
stay in Changqiu Palace as well.

516
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,700
Can't I stay for a while longer

517
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,870
since I haven't returned for so long?

518
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,500
Lady Luo.

519
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,220
You should go home.

520
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:06,310
Someone sent a letter from your house

521
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,620
saying General Huo

522
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,870
has sent two carts of dowries
to the Luo Family

523
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,750
and also a huge bronze mirror.

524
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,310
He also ordered
the elders of the Luo Family

525
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:17,430
to find a good husband for Lady Luo.

526
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,830
How can you

527
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,220
not be home for this, Lady Luo?

528
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:31,830
A bronze mirror?

529
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,020
A mirror.

530
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,390
Seems like General Huo

531
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:40,950
and Jitong

532
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,350
are really close together.

533
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,060
He sent you dowries and a bronze mirror.

534
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,310
No one in the capital

535
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:50,310
will say that both of you

536
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,620
are not close.

537
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,390
Young Master.

538
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,620
I heard Lady Luo

539
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,830
was chased out of her house

540
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,270
by her parents and siblings.

541
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:07,670
Their family has been working
under the Xuan Family for many years.

542
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,950
They wanted to prosper
with the help of the former Crown Prince

543
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,950
but he was stripped of his title

544
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,910
and Empress Xuan
requested for herself to be locked up.

545
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,950
So, they wanted their daughter

546
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,110
to climb the ranks
by marrying Young Master.

547
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:20,700
This time,

548
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,700
Young Master sent her dowries

549
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,100
and ordered her family
to find her a husband.

550
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,470
I'm afraid Lady Luo

551
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,700
is cornered this time.

552
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:36,060
Young Master, this...

553
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,430
General Huo.

554
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:03,620
Father told me

555
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,750
you've sent me a bronze mirror

556
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,270
and a few carts of dowries

557
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:10,020
saying you'll find me a husband
from the Northwest.

558
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,620
I was scared.

559
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,830
I didn't know what I did wrong.

560
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:16,100
General, please retract your order.

561
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,870
I thought you are smart.

562
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,390
A smart person

563
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:23,390
should know when to stop.

564
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:26,870
I used to

565
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,870
accompany you in the Northwest.

566
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:31,580
General,

567
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,580
have you forgotten?

568
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,430
Accompany me?

569
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,470
I used to be accompanied
by another woman.

570
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,060
We ate together

571
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:44,910
and laughed together.

572
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,830
We were close.

573
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,060
That was called accompaniment.

574
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,830
Back in the Northwest,

575
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,660
I chased you out of the camp.

576
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,910
You stayed outside the camp

577
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,700
and sneaked into the camp
to help me wash my clothes.

578
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,350
We didn't even see each other.

579
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,390
When I returned to the capital,

580
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:05,100
you followed the army

581
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,350
and rushed back here.

582
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,350
I didn't speak a word with you.

583
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:10,350
Let me ask you.

584
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:13,060
How is that accompanying me?

585
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:14,830
Yes.

586
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:17,470
General Huo has no feelings for me.

587
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:19,830
But I believe you will

588
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:21,180
one day be touched by my efforts.

589
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:22,830
Look.

590
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:25,100
You didn't even let me enter your tent
three years ago.

591
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:26,180
Right now,

592
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,470
you are treating me better
when you see me.

593
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,540
Why won't you admit it?

594
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,390
Enough.

595
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:33,990
Stop lying to yourself.

596
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,390
Everyone in the capital

597
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:40,870
already knows
I'm going to marry General Huo soon.

598
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:43,750
If they know you won't marry me,

599
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:45,700
how do I live with dignity?

600
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,020
Since I've admired you since young,

601
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,660
please take me in as your concubine.

602
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,100
I don't mind being your concubine.

603
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:07,660
I advise you to give up.

604
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,310
If you return now,

605
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:12,620
I can add another two carts of dowries.

606
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:14,790
If you are still going to annoy me,

607
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,220
I'll order someone

608
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,350
to send you back
to the Northwest immediately.

609
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,180
General Huo!

610
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,910
Why are you forcing me?

611
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,430
I like you.

612
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,870
What did I do wrong?

613
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,790
What did

614
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,500
Jia Qilang do wrong then?

615
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,500
You killed him, right?

616
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,270
You...

617
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:44,830
You...

618
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,100
I didn't do anything!

619
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:49,580
You shouldn't accuse me.

620
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,990
Everyone in the Northwest said

621
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,220
Jia Qilang married

622
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,540
the most virtuous lady,

623
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,580
but I know the truth.

624
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:58,540
Jia Qilang

625
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,020
might be born with an illness

626
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:02,910
but it wouldn't kill him

627
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,500
at the age of 20.

628
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:08,180
You killed him.

629
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,580
As for the method,

630
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,100
do I have to say more?

631
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:29,990
Is it because of Cheng Shaoshang?

632
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:32,700
Did you reject me

633
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,950
because you can't forget about her?

634
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,700
That's none of your business.

635
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,580
How can you treat me like this?

636
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,220
For all these years,

637
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,910
do you not

638
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,470
feel anything towards me?

639
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:53,700
No.

640
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,580
Not even if Cheng Shaoshang
is out of the picture.
