=Episode 16=

3
00:01:58,837 --> 00:01:59,837
Shanjian,

4
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:02,957
was I

5
00:02:04,676 --> 00:02:06,797
truly wrong?

6
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,596
We must let bygones be bygones.

7
00:02:14,277 --> 00:02:15,757
Master, you should let go

8
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:17,556
of the past.

9
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,556
You need

10
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:22,076
to move on.

11
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:28,156
Shanjian,

12
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:33,477
if I could cut off my ties

13
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:36,716
with that woman without any hesitations,

14
00:02:37,797 --> 00:02:38,837
Shunhua

15
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:42,156
would've gotten back together with me.

16
00:02:42,477 --> 00:02:43,317
Master,

17
00:02:44,357 --> 00:02:45,957
I heard that Official Cheng Zhi

18
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:47,596
was handsome and talented.

19
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:50,156
He's famous for his devotion
to his wife.

20
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,917
No one expected Ms. Sang
to be that much happier

21
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:55,877
than you, Master.

22
00:02:56,357 --> 00:02:58,837
Master, you cannot let go of the past

23
00:02:58,837 --> 00:03:00,996
all because you're too stubborn.

24
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:03,437
Master, this is just
a silly opinion of mine.

25
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:06,676
When you fall deeply in love,
you will feel frustrated.

26
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:08,556
When you feel frustrated,
you will become paranoid.

27
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:11,917
If you can let go of the past,
you won't become frustrated or paranoid.

28
00:03:12,397 --> 00:03:14,237
You shouldn't hold on to the past.

29
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:18,076
Master, even if you keep
holding on to the past,

30
00:03:18,556 --> 00:03:20,036
Ms. Sang is already married.

31
00:03:20,516 --> 00:03:21,996
How will you deal with that?

32
00:03:22,357 --> 00:03:23,357
Is

33
00:03:25,477 --> 00:03:26,957
that so?

34
00:03:29,397 --> 00:03:30,237
Yes.

35
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:35,917
You should've rested earlier.

36
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:38,477
Staying up is bad for the body.

37
00:03:48,757 --> 00:03:51,477
Shunhua!

38
00:03:59,596 --> 00:04:00,357
General Ling,

39
00:04:00,477 --> 00:04:02,596
are there wolves nearby the mansion?

40
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:04,837
Wolves?

41
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:07,676
I heard a terrifying
wolf howl last night.

42
00:04:14,277 --> 00:04:15,036
Yao.

43
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:16,837
Shaoshang, look.

44
00:04:17,116 --> 00:04:18,277
This horse is suave and strong.

45
00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:21,757
How did our horses change overnight?

46
00:04:23,716 --> 00:04:25,317
We should be particular when it comes
to horses and carriages.

47
00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:27,357
If we're riding a carriage in the city,

48
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:29,877
a small horse that's as tall
as the carriage will suffice.

49
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:31,636
However,
if we're heading out of the city,

50
00:04:32,317 --> 00:04:34,957
it's best if the horse's height is
in between the canopy and the carriage.

51
00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:36,556
That way,
the carriage won't bumped along the road.

52
00:04:37,837 --> 00:04:39,156
and it won't be as dangerous.

53
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:41,757
Safety...

54
00:04:45,357 --> 00:04:47,116
Safety is our number one priority.

55
00:04:48,156 --> 00:04:49,957
Zisheng, you're thoughtful indeed.

56
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:52,516
Thank you, Zisheng.

57
00:04:59,996 --> 00:05:00,837
By the way,

58
00:05:01,116 --> 00:05:02,357
where is Shanjian?

59
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:04,596
I'm afraid he didn't
sleep well last night

60
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:07,397
due to the wolvf's howl.

61
00:05:12,676 --> 00:05:13,477
Shanjian.

62
00:05:14,116 --> 00:05:14,957
Shanjian.

63
00:05:16,156 --> 00:05:18,036
Why aren't you sleeping on the mat?

64
00:05:23,237 --> 00:05:24,076
Master.

65
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:26,196
You're finally awake.

66
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:27,116
Shanjian,

67
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:28,757
what happened to your voice?

68
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:32,357
I drank too much

69
00:05:32,676 --> 00:05:33,596
last night.

70
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:36,357
Shanjian,

71
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:38,116
I taught you before.

72
00:05:38,397 --> 00:05:40,957
We should keep ourselves in check.

73
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:46,116
Shunhua!

74
00:05:47,196 --> 00:05:47,917
Shanjian,

75
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:48,636
do you think

76
00:05:48,636 --> 00:05:50,477
I should tell her about it?

77
00:05:53,996 --> 00:05:55,477
It's morning now.

78
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:57,036
Master, you may go ahead

79
00:05:57,516 --> 00:05:58,556
if you're willing to.

80
00:06:11,477 --> 00:06:13,636
Shunhua!

81
00:06:25,437 --> 00:06:26,357
Third Aunt.

82
00:06:27,156 --> 00:06:28,437
Third Aunt, I'm back.

83
00:06:31,996 --> 00:06:33,317
You're finally back, huh?

84
00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:40,237
What did Huangfu Yi tell you?

85
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,596
Third Aunt, how did you know

86
00:06:45,877 --> 00:06:47,837
Mr. Huangfu told us to spend the night
at his residence?

87
00:06:47,837 --> 00:06:50,116
How could I not when he notified me
with a letter?

88
00:06:53,676 --> 00:06:54,676
This man

89
00:06:55,277 --> 00:06:56,196
was a bad guy..

90
00:06:57,196 --> 00:06:59,716
He let you down back then.

91
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:02,036
And now, he's shameless enough
to pester you again.

92
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:05,437
Huangfu Yi isn't a bad guy.

93
00:07:05,437 --> 00:07:07,277
He's just the culmination

94
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:08,357
of the flaw of every man in the world.

95
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,397
Niaoniao,

96
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:12,797
you see,

97
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:15,277
marriage is but another scenery of life.

98
00:07:15,837 --> 00:07:18,437
Success or failure depends on
one's gain and loss.

99
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:23,957
In the future, no matter
what you encounter,

100
00:07:24,837 --> 00:07:26,877
never give up your identity
because of a man.

101
00:07:28,036 --> 00:07:28,957
It's not worth it.

102
00:07:31,877 --> 00:07:34,357
Third Aunt, I will
remember your teaching.

103
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:36,516
But Third Aunt, don't worry about me.

104
00:07:37,196 --> 00:07:38,877
Lou Yao and I will surely do well.

105
00:07:39,237 --> 00:07:40,437
We will surely be content

106
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:42,397
unless something drastic happens.

107
00:07:44,076 --> 00:07:45,277
Look at you.

108
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:56,840
(Hua County Magistrate's Court)

109
00:07:58,596 --> 00:07:59,516
We can see ourselves off.

110
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:01,156
Third Aunt,

111
00:08:01,477 --> 00:08:03,397
remember to take a hot water bath

112
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:05,277
with the hot water bathtub
I had built for you every day.

113
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:06,676
That way, you can sleep better.

114
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:08,116
And,

115
00:08:08,277 --> 00:08:09,797
Third Aunt, although
your leg injury has healed,

116
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:11,397
you still need the physicians
to perform a follow-up examination.

117
00:08:11,397 --> 00:08:12,477
You mustn't neglect it.

118
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:15,036
I'll make a wheelchair for you
when I get back.

119
00:08:15,237 --> 00:08:17,036
I'll ask someone to send it to you
when I'm done.

120
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:19,076
Niaoniao,

121
00:08:20,676 --> 00:08:21,636
don't worry.

122
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:23,837
Your third uncle is here with her.

123
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,516
I will surely take good care of her.

124
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:27,636
However, you must obey your parents

125
00:08:27,636 --> 00:08:29,076
when you go home.

126
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:30,156
Stop rebelling against them.

127
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:33,397
Third Uncle, you should listen to
Third Aunt's words.

128
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:35,996
Don't let your imagination run wild.

129
00:08:37,196 --> 00:08:38,156
Niaoniao,

130
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:40,076
take good care of yourself.

131
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:42,516
Don't forget what I told you.

132
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:47,516
Now, you finally understand
the meaning of a painful departure?

133
00:08:47,996 --> 00:08:48,837
Back then,

134
00:08:49,076 --> 00:08:50,237
you didn't even turn back

135
00:08:50,516 --> 00:08:52,516
when you went to Hua County.

136
00:08:53,196 --> 00:08:54,397
Dear,

137
00:08:54,397 --> 00:08:56,797
how did you know that Niaoniao
didn't turn back when she left?

138
00:08:57,716 --> 00:08:58,437
Could it be

139
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,676
that you observed her in secret?

140
00:09:05,076 --> 00:09:06,116
It's getting late.

141
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:07,676
You guys should get ready.

142
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:09,516
Eldest Brother, Sister-in-law,

143
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,877
please take care.

144
00:09:13,277 --> 00:09:14,596
You guys should take care too.

145
00:09:16,837 --> 00:09:17,556
Dear.

146
00:09:25,437 --> 00:09:26,357
Let's go.

147
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:37,156
Depart!

148
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,116
Shaoshang, wait for me!

149
00:09:59,237 --> 00:10:00,317
I have mixed feelings

150
00:10:01,397 --> 00:10:03,357
when I look at the departing carriage.

151
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:06,636
Back then, Lou Yao did the same.

152
00:10:06,636 --> 00:10:08,397
He chased after our carriage
to Hua County.

153
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:11,516
And now, he's chasing after
Niaoniao's carriage as they travel back.

154
00:10:11,796 --> 00:10:13,157
It's just that Niaoniao

155
00:10:13,357 --> 00:10:15,317
thought of him as a stranger
when they first came here.

156
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:17,716
But now,

157
00:10:18,157 --> 00:10:19,756
they're close beyond our imagination.

158
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:22,037
Life is unpredictable indeed.

159
00:10:22,397 --> 00:10:23,516
This is the power

160
00:10:24,117 --> 00:10:25,796
of deeply faith.

161
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:29,077
Just like you and I.

162
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,840
(Xinghua Courtyard)

163
00:10:47,357 --> 00:10:50,277
The largest flower to the side.

164
00:10:50,397 --> 00:10:51,317
Okay.

165
00:10:54,997 --> 00:10:57,876
Not that one, it's the one beside it.

166
00:10:58,077 --> 00:10:59,077
Which one?

167
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:01,077
That one.

168
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:02,997
Did you see it?

169
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:03,956
Okay.

170
00:11:04,117 --> 00:11:05,676
Hurry up.

171
00:11:10,157 --> 00:11:11,037
Hurry up.

172
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,117
Okay.

173
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:14,277
Junhua, please calm down.

174
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:16,756
Did you pick it?

175
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:18,596
Give it to me.

176
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,600
(Huo Junhua)

177
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:26,636
Do you think I look good
with a flower in my hair?

178
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:27,516
Yes.

179
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:28,876
I'm sure Wen

180
00:11:28,997 --> 00:11:30,077
will like it if he sees me.

181
00:11:30,077 --> 00:11:31,037
Junhua,

182
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:32,720
(Cui You)
you mustn't address him in that manner.

183
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:34,237
That's His Majesty's true name.

184
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:35,676
You mustn't do that.

185
00:11:36,277 --> 00:11:37,117
Yuan,

186
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,277
I will never get married to you

187
00:11:39,277 --> 00:11:40,556
even if you pick the flowers for me.

188
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,437
If you say those kinds of words again,

189
00:11:42,556 --> 00:11:43,636
I'll ask my brother

190
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,277
to chase you out with a rod.

191
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:46,756
Brother.

192
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,397
Brother...

193
00:12:00,397 --> 00:12:01,277
Yuan,

194
00:12:01,997 --> 00:12:03,556
this is the nephew

195
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,477
who's freeloading off us.

196
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:16,716
Greetings,

197
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:20,437
Young Lady.

198
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:23,437
The economy wasn't doing too well,

199
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:25,836
and he couldn't make
a living by himself.

200
00:12:26,117 --> 00:12:27,477
That's why he came all the way here

201
00:12:27,716 --> 00:12:29,716
to seek shelter
in my brother's residence.

202
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:38,277
Young Lady, you offer aid
to the weak and poor.

203
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:40,876
Words cannot express my gratitude.

204
00:12:46,556 --> 00:12:48,756
Young Lady, you look well today.

205
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,596
Although

206
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:52,117
the weather has been erratic lately,

207
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:54,317
it's best for you

208
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:56,676
to keep consuming mutton soup.

209
00:12:56,956 --> 00:12:58,796
Just mind your own business.

210
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:01,477
I don't need you to tell me what to do.

211
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,676
When His Majesty was on his quest
to conquer the world,

212
00:13:05,997 --> 00:13:07,636
Marquis Cui was the commander
of his vanguard unit.

213
00:13:08,317 --> 00:13:10,037
He slew enemies and
conquered every obstacle.

214
00:13:10,037 --> 00:13:11,357
Death meant nothing to him.

215
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:13,157
I heard

216
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:15,397
that Marquis Cui came back after
inquiring about the military situation.

217
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:18,997
Marquis Cui truly misses Madam.

218
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:21,437
He's almost certainly here

219
00:13:21,756 --> 00:13:23,596
whenever Young Master is here.

220
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:26,077
Madam couldn't even remember

221
00:13:26,077 --> 00:13:28,157
that Young Master was her own son.

222
00:13:28,556 --> 00:13:30,676
Why would she pay attention
to Marquis Cui?

223
00:13:30,956 --> 00:13:32,796
It's not that she doesn't
remember anything.

224
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:34,277
She did retain some of her memories

225
00:13:34,277 --> 00:13:35,876
before she got married.

226
00:13:36,037 --> 00:13:37,716
Right now, she still thinks

227
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,397
that she's a young adult.

228
00:13:39,876 --> 00:13:41,077
She thinks that Marquis Cui

229
00:13:41,077 --> 00:13:43,117
is still his childhood companion.

230
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:46,836
Mister,

231
00:13:47,997 --> 00:13:50,516
you told me not to gossip about people.

232
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,237
However, you do remember

233
00:13:52,516 --> 00:13:54,997
their details pretty well, huh?

234
00:13:55,437 --> 00:13:55,997
I...

235
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:01,237
What is Marquis Chengyang doing here?

236
00:14:02,477 --> 00:14:03,277
Here.

237
00:14:07,357 --> 00:14:08,636
It doesn't look too shabby.

238
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:11,037
No matter how fancy they look,

239
00:14:11,037 --> 00:14:11,836
they lose their luster

240
00:14:12,796 --> 00:14:13,876
in front of you.

241
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:15,956
Isn't it obvious?

242
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,796
I'm the most beautiful girl
in the world.

243
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:22,197
Even the wretched Yue Heng

244
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:23,556
is no match for me.

245
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:24,836
Wen

246
00:14:25,277 --> 00:14:26,836
only has eyes for me.

247
00:14:27,037 --> 00:14:28,516
He wouldn't look at that wretched girl

248
00:14:29,197 --> 00:14:31,197
even without these fancy brocade.

249
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:32,676
Junhua,

250
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:36,676
how could you be so impolite
toward Consort Yue?

251
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:37,796
Do you know

252
00:14:37,796 --> 00:14:40,197
that she's a Worthy Lady right now?

253
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:43,237
Consort Yue?

254
00:14:44,756 --> 00:14:45,876
Who is Consort Yue?

255
00:15:16,077 --> 00:15:17,437
Ling Yi!

256
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,357
You were the one who let me down!

257
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:24,317
Go to hell!

258
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:25,997
Go to hell!

259
00:15:25,997 --> 00:15:26,876
Someone!

260
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:29,037
Go to hell!

261
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:32,796
Bring Madam to her room for now.

262
00:15:32,796 --> 00:15:35,317
Go to hell! You should die!

263
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:36,317
Go to hell!

264
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:38,477
Go to hell!

265
00:15:44,516 --> 00:15:46,157
You knew you were unwelcomed here.

266
00:15:48,117 --> 00:15:49,636
Why did you come here
without permission?

267
00:15:51,836 --> 00:15:54,676
I'm here to visit my wife and son.

268
00:15:55,117 --> 00:15:56,397
Is there any problem with that?

269
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,876
You still have the guts
to call Junhua your wife?

270
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:01,556
What kind of husband are you?

271
00:16:02,756 --> 00:16:03,916
Even so, I'm much better than you.

272
00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:06,876
She didn't even look you in the face

273
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,516
even though you pestered her
for so many years.

274
00:16:13,197 --> 00:16:14,077
Zisheng,

275
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:18,317
I'm here to discuss
an important matter with you.

276
00:16:19,716 --> 00:16:21,836
Fan Cang's case involves
the military armament.

277
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:23,836
You should leave the case
to the Ministry of Justice.

278
00:16:24,596 --> 00:16:26,237
You don't need to get yourself involved.

279
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:27,676
Moreover, this case

280
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,117
involves imperial subjects as well.

281
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,836
They followed His Majesty
on his conquest

282
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:34,756
and enjoy infinite honor.

283
00:16:35,756 --> 00:16:37,037
How could His Majesty

284
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,916
make things difficult
for his loyal subjects

285
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:40,676
because of a small thing like this?

286
00:16:41,477 --> 00:16:43,516
Official Ji and I were
in charge of this case,

287
00:16:45,197 --> 00:16:46,756
and it was His Majesty's intention.

288
00:16:48,037 --> 00:16:49,117
The only thing I'm seeking

289
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,197
is the truth.

290
00:16:57,037 --> 00:16:57,916
Zisheng,

291
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,916
you're still too young
and inexperienced.

292
00:17:00,237 --> 00:17:02,477
I have to fulfill my obligation
of teaching you.

293
00:17:02,836 --> 00:17:04,157
Heed my advice.

294
00:17:04,676 --> 00:17:05,956
You should stop now.

295
00:17:06,516 --> 00:17:07,876
Back then, the eldest son of
the Huo family

296
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:09,796
was as young as Zisheng
when he helped His Majesty

297
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:11,477
to conquer foreign territories.

298
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:12,876
Ling Yi,

299
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:14,956
what gives you the right to despise him?

300
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:16,756
Zisheng,

301
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:18,237
I'm standing on your side.

302
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,516
You can investigate the case
without any worries.

303
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:23,636
If anyone dares to harm you,

304
00:17:25,516 --> 00:17:27,397
I'll defend you with my life.

305
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:28,237
Cui You,

306
00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:31,716
don't you think
you're taking this too lightly?

307
00:17:32,077 --> 00:17:33,676
He has offended someone he shouldn't.

308
00:17:34,317 --> 00:17:35,956
Both of us cannot protect him now.

309
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,277
Now, they've already started to act.

310
00:17:38,956 --> 00:17:39,796
Zisheng,

311
00:17:40,357 --> 00:17:41,277
did you know

312
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:42,956
that the imperial prison

313
00:17:43,556 --> 00:17:44,796
was raided just two hours ago?

314
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:46,516
Fan Cang has already
escaped from prison.

315
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,477
How will you continue

316
00:17:49,237 --> 00:17:50,197
with the investigation next?

317
00:17:51,997 --> 00:17:52,836
Zisheng,

318
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,756
you're in huge trouble now.

319
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:26,876
You must be starving.

320
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:29,836
What are these?

321
00:18:30,037 --> 00:18:30,876
Dried fruits.

322
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,397
Are they sweet?

323
00:18:56,397 --> 00:18:57,117
Yes.

324
00:18:58,956 --> 00:19:01,037
If Niaoniao truly fancied Mr. Lou,

325
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:02,317
why would she

326
00:19:02,556 --> 00:19:03,916
feed him like this?

327
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:05,916
It's as if she's feeding an animal.

328
00:19:06,716 --> 00:19:08,796
Dear, it's inappropriate
for you to say that.

329
00:19:09,636 --> 00:19:10,636
Dear,

330
00:19:10,796 --> 00:19:11,916
so, how do you think

331
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:13,636
one should feed their spouse

332
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:15,157
in order to avoid
looking like feeding a dog?

333
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:17,477
Naturally, one would use their hands

334
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:19,796
to feed their spouse.

335
00:19:20,556 --> 00:19:21,876
If that's the case,

336
00:19:22,556 --> 00:19:24,636
you and I aren't considered
as a loving couple then.

337
00:19:25,277 --> 00:19:27,117
Dear, you had never fed me

338
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:29,157
dried peaches with your hands.

339
00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:31,516
How could it be the same for us?

340
00:19:32,317 --> 00:19:34,077
We're married for so many years.

341
00:19:34,077 --> 00:19:35,956
You didn't feed me when we were young.

342
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:38,317
But it's not too late to do so.

343
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,397
I'll get some dried peaches from them.

344
00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:42,157
Let us teach them

345
00:19:42,317 --> 00:19:43,516
what it means

346
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,956
to be a loving couple.

347
00:19:45,556 --> 00:19:46,437
General,

348
00:19:47,277 --> 00:19:48,676
you should stop messing around.

349
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:51,956
It's still bright outside,

350
00:19:52,117 --> 00:19:54,117
but they're setting up barriers
in front of all the city's entrances.

351
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:56,477
They only allow people
to enter without exiting.

352
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:58,716
Dear, have you ever occurred to you

353
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:00,477
that something is wrong?

354
00:20:02,596 --> 00:20:03,437
That's right.

355
00:20:04,197 --> 00:20:06,357
Do not interrupt us
from executing public duties.

356
00:20:12,956 --> 00:20:14,556
I'm Cheng Shi, the marquis of Quling.

357
00:20:15,357 --> 00:20:16,317
I have to return to the capital
under His Majesty's order.

358
00:20:16,796 --> 00:20:18,796
Officer, I hope you can
make things convenient for me.

359
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:20,437
So, it's you, General Cheng.

360
00:20:20,437 --> 00:20:21,397
General, please forgive us.

361
00:20:21,397 --> 00:20:22,437
Our superior has given us an order.

362
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:23,956
He said a fugitive was
trying to escape from the city.

363
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:25,756
We are to seal off the city gates
under his order.

364
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,876
No matter your rank

365
00:20:27,997 --> 00:20:29,197
or the reason you came here,

366
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:30,397
we will have to examine each of you.

367
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,357
General Cheng,

368
00:20:31,357 --> 00:20:32,117
please pardon me for the rudeness.

369
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:33,716
Please wait until tomorrow.

370
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:34,997
You may enter the city by then.

371
00:20:35,157 --> 00:20:36,077
Tomorrow?

372
00:20:36,716 --> 00:20:37,796
Officer, are you bullying me

373
00:20:38,157 --> 00:20:39,636
because of my low rank?

374
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:40,516
I dare not do so.

375
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:42,117
General, I'm just following orders here.

376
00:20:42,477 --> 00:20:43,317
General Cheng,

377
00:20:43,516 --> 00:20:45,596
you have to wait
no matter how high your rank is.

378
00:20:47,237 --> 00:20:48,916
General Ling has arrived!

379
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:50,477
Hurry!

380
00:20:50,836 --> 00:20:52,916
Open the gates! Let them pass!

381
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,280
(Ruyang)

382
00:21:19,876 --> 00:21:20,756
General Cheng.

383
00:21:21,836 --> 00:21:22,716
General Ling.

384
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:29,277
Although the barriers are strict,

385
00:21:30,197 --> 00:21:31,756
have they ever arrested
a fugitive with it before?

386
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:32,876
General Ling,

387
00:21:34,317 --> 00:21:35,037
I'm afraid not.

388
00:21:35,117 --> 00:21:36,037
I guessed as much.

389
00:21:37,357 --> 00:21:39,796
The fugitive escaped from a
guarded place like the imperial prison,

390
00:21:40,437 --> 00:21:41,796
let alone this stupid barrier.

391
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,237
You guys are just making
things difficult for the people.

392
00:22:24,237 --> 00:22:25,277
We meet again,

393
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:26,716
Young Lady Cheng.

394
00:22:27,357 --> 00:22:28,237
General Ling,

395
00:22:28,716 --> 00:22:29,836
how is your injury?

396
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:32,237
Do you have military matters
to attend to today?

397
00:22:32,796 --> 00:22:33,756
It was just a minor wound.

398
00:22:34,836 --> 00:22:35,876
I had recovered long ago.

399
00:22:37,197 --> 00:22:38,157
And I didn't do

400
00:22:38,556 --> 00:22:39,716
any strenuous activities lately.

401
00:22:52,397 --> 00:22:53,157
Father,

402
00:22:53,756 --> 00:22:55,796
Third Uncle told you this before, right?

403
00:22:56,237 --> 00:22:57,317
Third Aunt and I were assaulted

404
00:22:57,317 --> 00:22:58,796
by bandits on our way to Hua County.

405
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,277
General Ling was the one who saved us.

406
00:23:02,077 --> 00:23:04,237
General Ling, thank you for saving them,

407
00:23:04,397 --> 00:23:06,117
General Cheng, you do not
need to be this courteous.

408
00:23:07,556 --> 00:23:08,836
Young Lady Cheng has been through

409
00:23:09,397 --> 00:23:10,437
life-or-death situations
together with me.

410
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,197
She had undressed me
and treated my wounds for me too.

411
00:23:14,397 --> 00:23:15,836
There's no need to be this courteous.

412
00:23:24,676 --> 00:23:26,077
Young Lady Cheng, you look pale.

413
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:27,836
Did you fall sick?

414
00:23:29,437 --> 00:23:30,916
General, there's no need
to worry about me.

415
00:23:32,317 --> 00:23:33,516
The journey was arduous.

416
00:23:33,756 --> 00:23:35,077
That's why I look exhausted.

417
00:23:36,357 --> 00:23:37,477
Am I right, Yao?

418
00:23:38,397 --> 00:23:40,357
That's right.

419
00:23:41,277 --> 00:23:42,676
Since you're unwell,

420
00:23:44,117 --> 00:23:45,556
you should return early and rest.

421
00:23:47,117 --> 00:23:48,397
They've set up barriers
outside of the city.

422
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,636
We don't know how long
we have to queue here.

423
00:23:51,796 --> 00:23:52,876
Let me

424
00:23:54,237 --> 00:23:55,676
escort you guys into the city.

425
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:05,997
Make way!

426
00:24:06,277 --> 00:24:07,277
Make way!

427
00:25:45,157 --> 00:25:46,077
General Cheng,

428
00:25:47,636 --> 00:25:48,477
Madam Cheng,

429
00:25:48,956 --> 00:25:51,277
do not use the middle path
after entering the city.

430
00:25:51,277 --> 00:25:52,956
Take the side path of Yuyang
and you'll be fine.

431
00:25:53,317 --> 00:25:54,397
Thank you, General Ling.

432
00:26:22,796 --> 00:26:24,397
It's no wonder the ladies in the city

433
00:26:24,397 --> 00:26:25,716
fell for General Ling.

434
00:26:26,197 --> 00:26:27,197
Who knows when
we'll be able to enter the city

435
00:26:27,197 --> 00:26:28,676
without him?

436
00:26:29,716 --> 00:26:30,516
Yao,

437
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:31,956
since we've entered the city,

438
00:26:31,956 --> 00:26:33,157
you should hurry back

439
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:34,997
and tell your mother about us.

440
00:26:35,756 --> 00:26:37,197
Yes, I will go immediately.

441
00:26:37,956 --> 00:26:39,357
General Cheng, Madam Cheng,

442
00:26:40,077 --> 00:26:41,556
farewell.

443
00:26:52,556 --> 00:26:53,956
When will they arrive?

444
00:27:05,437 --> 00:27:06,556
Shi!

445
00:27:08,117 --> 00:27:09,197
My dear Shi!

446
00:27:09,197 --> 00:27:11,037
You heartless son!

447
00:27:11,037 --> 00:27:14,197
You actually still
remember your way back?

448
00:27:14,197 --> 00:27:16,157
You heartless son!

449
00:27:16,357 --> 00:27:19,437
You actually remember your way back?

450
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:20,477
Mother,

451
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:22,516
although you were born a farmer,

452
00:27:22,636 --> 00:27:24,516
you shouldn't treat me like a plow.

453
00:27:24,756 --> 00:27:26,317
I cannot withstand your grip strength.

454
00:27:26,317 --> 00:27:27,516
Look at you.

455
00:27:27,756 --> 00:27:30,477
Why didn't you come back after
completing the imperial task?

456
00:27:30,477 --> 00:27:31,916
Why did you go to Hua County?

457
00:27:31,997 --> 00:27:34,157
I heard that there were rebels
hiding within Hua County.

458
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,477
How could I live

459
00:27:35,477 --> 00:27:37,716
if something happens to you?

460
00:27:38,756 --> 00:27:39,756
Mother,

461
00:27:40,277 --> 00:27:41,836
Niaoniao was caught in trouble too.

462
00:27:41,836 --> 00:27:42,876
Yes, Grandmother.

463
00:27:43,357 --> 00:27:45,237
I heard that Niaoniao
was assaulted by bandits

464
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,556
and she almost lost her life.

465
00:27:46,756 --> 00:27:48,077
I know that. I've heard about it.

466
00:27:48,077 --> 00:27:50,237
I was planning to ask her about it.
Niaoniao.

467
00:27:52,197 --> 00:27:53,197
Let me ask you something.

468
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:54,956
Were you by your third uncle's side

469
00:27:55,157 --> 00:27:56,516
when it happened?

470
00:27:57,237 --> 00:27:59,716
Was your third uncle
assaulted by bandits?

471
00:27:59,836 --> 00:28:02,716
Was he injured?

472
00:28:03,956 --> 00:28:06,437
Zhi is a scholar!

473
00:28:06,437 --> 00:28:08,397
His body is too weak for this!

474
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:09,037
Cheng Zhi...

475
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:11,756
Why did he have to go to that
stupid government office?

476
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,117
His wife is useless as well!

477
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:15,796
She can't even cook!

478
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:16,796
Zhi is...

479
00:28:27,876 --> 00:28:28,676
Shi,

480
00:28:29,676 --> 00:28:31,956
why are you being so quiet?

481
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:35,956
Could it be that you're keeping quiet

482
00:28:35,956 --> 00:28:37,716
because something happened to Zhi?

483
00:28:38,556 --> 00:28:40,237
God!

484
00:28:41,077 --> 00:28:44,157
Why do I have to witness
my son's funeral?

485
00:28:45,876 --> 00:28:46,876
Mother,

486
00:28:47,277 --> 00:28:48,916
don't spout nonsense.

487
00:28:49,157 --> 00:28:50,556
Cheng Zhi is doing fine.

488
00:28:50,676 --> 00:28:51,916
He's perfectly fine.

489
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,956
If so, why did you keep quiet

490
00:28:54,956 --> 00:28:57,037
when I asked you so many questions?

491
00:28:57,037 --> 00:28:58,956
You asked me
so many questions in one go.

492
00:28:59,077 --> 00:29:01,716
Of course I have to think about it
before I answer your questions.

493
00:29:02,357 --> 00:29:03,117
Grandmother,

494
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:05,037
I knew you would be worried about

495
00:29:05,237 --> 00:29:06,836
Third Uncle and Third Aunt.

496
00:29:07,516 --> 00:29:08,556
That's why I brought

497
00:29:08,556 --> 00:29:10,317
an eloquent maid back here.

498
00:29:10,317 --> 00:29:11,876
This maid has been staying together

499
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:13,676
with them every day
for the past few months.

500
00:29:14,676 --> 00:29:16,756
I'm sure she knows a lot about them.

501
00:29:17,876 --> 00:29:18,756
From tomorrow onward,

502
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:20,636
I'll ask her

503
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:21,756
to tell you everything she knows.

504
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,117
Why must we wait until tomorrow?

505
00:29:24,117 --> 00:29:26,556
Summon her into my room right now!

506
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,596
I want her to tell me all about

507
00:29:28,596 --> 00:29:31,237
how much Zhi
has suffered all this while!

508
00:29:31,397 --> 00:29:33,437
Zhi is a scholar!

509
00:29:33,437 --> 00:29:35,836
He couldn't stand such suffering!

510
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:37,836
Niaoniao, you're amazing indeed.

511
00:29:38,397 --> 00:29:40,037
You actually thought of
such a clever solution.

512
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:42,716
Shaogong, you should
learn from me in the future.

513
00:29:43,397 --> 00:29:44,357
Impossible.

514
00:29:44,477 --> 00:29:45,796
I did a divination today.

515
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:46,716
According to the divination,

516
00:29:46,716 --> 00:29:48,397
there will be a trifle in the family.

517
00:29:48,676 --> 00:29:50,237
But Grandmother has actually
stopped making a fuss.

518
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:51,676
How is that possible?

519
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:53,716
That means your divination
wasn't accurate.

520
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:54,756
That's impossible.

521
00:29:55,997 --> 00:29:57,037
Why not?

522
00:29:57,037 --> 00:29:58,277
Niaoniao,

523
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:00,676
follow me to my room.

524
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:02,397
I have something to ask you.

525
00:30:08,676 --> 00:30:09,716
What did you do

526
00:30:09,716 --> 00:30:11,636
to make Mother angry again?

527
00:30:12,756 --> 00:30:14,997
I was acting cautiously all the way.

528
00:30:14,997 --> 00:30:16,397
I never made Mother angry.

529
00:30:20,317 --> 00:30:21,157
Father,

530
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:23,277
the city gate's security
was tight today.

531
00:30:23,357 --> 00:30:25,037
Aren't you going
to discuss it with Mother?

532
00:30:25,317 --> 00:30:26,197
Why the rush?

533
00:30:26,636 --> 00:30:28,596
Even General Ling didn't
say much about it.

534
00:30:28,596 --> 00:30:30,157
It's obvious that it has nothing
to do with our family.

535
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:33,117
You should hurry.

536
00:30:33,437 --> 00:30:34,916
Don't make your mother wait for you.

537
00:30:36,037 --> 00:30:36,796
But...

538
00:30:38,876 --> 00:30:39,836
Father?

539
00:30:45,397 --> 00:30:46,357
According to the divination,

540
00:30:46,516 --> 00:30:48,437
there will be a trifle in the family.

541
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,037
I suppose this will be it.

542
00:30:51,197 --> 00:30:52,956
Poor Niaoniao.

543
00:31:01,037 --> 00:31:02,237
Tell me

544
00:31:02,437 --> 00:31:04,437
what you had done for
the past few months.

545
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:06,037
Tell me what people you had met.

546
00:31:07,397 --> 00:31:08,756
Do not omit any detail.

547
00:31:11,117 --> 00:31:12,357
Must I tell you everything?

548
00:31:14,157 --> 00:31:15,516
But it goes a few months back.

549
00:31:20,157 --> 00:31:20,916
Fine.

550
00:31:22,796 --> 00:31:23,636
That day,

551
00:31:23,997 --> 00:31:26,317
Third Uncle, Third Aunt, and I
were on our journey to Hua County.

552
00:31:27,796 --> 00:31:28,676
Tell me

553
00:31:29,756 --> 00:31:30,596
about Ling Buyi first.

554
00:31:31,997 --> 00:31:33,796
I think Third Uncle had already
told you all about him.

555
00:31:34,117 --> 00:31:35,397
There was nothing much.

556
00:31:35,997 --> 00:31:38,077
Your third uncle didn't
tell me anything about

557
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:41,037
undressing him,
treating his wounds for him,

558
00:31:41,477 --> 00:31:42,596
and going through
life-or-death situations with him.

559
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:43,596
Father,

560
00:31:43,596 --> 00:31:45,556
you shouldn't listen to
Ling Buyi's exaggeration.

561
00:31:45,836 --> 00:31:47,716
We barely met each other.

562
00:31:47,716 --> 00:31:49,277
How many times did you guys meet then?

563
00:31:49,596 --> 00:31:50,596
Maybe three...

564
00:31:52,636 --> 00:31:53,437
Four...

565
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:55,636
Five...

566
00:31:56,037 --> 00:31:56,756
Six...

567
00:31:58,477 --> 00:32:00,117
Seven or eight times, I guess.

568
00:32:05,876 --> 00:32:07,437
You guys were the ones
who asked me that question.

569
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:09,876
You guys didn't want to listen to me
because it sounded indecent.

570
00:32:09,876 --> 00:32:10,477
If so, I'll keep quiet.

571
00:32:10,477 --> 00:32:11,716
Wait, I can't do that.

572
00:32:13,037 --> 00:32:15,037
What if you guys want to punish me
for keeping quiet?

573
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:17,197
Just tell us everything.

574
00:32:17,397 --> 00:32:18,716
I will never give you a beating.

575
00:32:18,716 --> 00:32:19,836
You should promise
not to punish me either.

576
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:22,796
Yao and I have

577
00:32:22,796 --> 00:32:24,157
many plans to execute together.

578
00:32:24,756 --> 00:32:26,317
You cannot punish me by asking me
to copy scriptures and so on.

579
00:32:26,437 --> 00:32:27,477
Why are you wasting time?

580
00:32:27,716 --> 00:32:28,756
Just cut to the chase.

581
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:31,037
How are you so close

582
00:32:31,477 --> 00:32:32,796
with General Ling?

583
00:32:33,317 --> 00:32:35,117
He even escorted you to the city.

584
00:32:41,237 --> 00:32:42,237
Say,

585
00:32:42,397 --> 00:32:44,636
Zisheng removed the city's barrier

586
00:32:44,636 --> 00:32:47,317
and escorted Fourth Lady Cheng
into the city.

587
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:49,357
He went after Fan Cang
after all that, right?

588
00:32:49,796 --> 00:32:50,596
That's right.

589
00:32:50,596 --> 00:32:53,477
Your Majesty, please don't
blame General Ling.

590
00:32:53,796 --> 00:32:55,596
He always abides by the rules.

591
00:32:55,836 --> 00:32:58,037
I'm afraid he did so

592
00:32:58,037 --> 00:33:00,477
because Lady Cheng
saved his life before.

593
00:33:00,756 --> 00:33:04,317
I'm afraid it's more than just that.

594
00:33:04,836 --> 00:33:07,197
What else is there?

595
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:12,836
When Zisheng

596
00:33:13,357 --> 00:33:14,956
heard that Lady Cheng was in trouble,

597
00:33:15,357 --> 00:33:17,636
he risked his life

598
00:33:17,836 --> 00:33:19,317
to save her.

599
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:22,197
And, he even ordered
the city guards to open the gate

600
00:33:22,357 --> 00:33:23,916
and escorted Lady Cheng
to the city personally

601
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:26,317
when Fan Cang was on the loose.

602
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:32,317
Who do you think Ling Zisheng is?

603
00:33:33,876 --> 00:33:34,716
There's definitely

604
00:33:35,477 --> 00:33:37,277
more to this than meets the eye.

605
00:33:38,037 --> 00:33:39,117
What do you mean?

606
00:33:39,676 --> 00:33:41,956
He and I always meet
each other in public.

607
00:33:41,956 --> 00:33:43,237
And, Yao was always around.

608
00:33:45,277 --> 00:33:47,636
Do you know who Ling Buyi is?

609
00:33:48,077 --> 00:33:49,237
I know he has plenty of titles.

610
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:50,956
I cannot memorize all of them.

611
00:33:51,157 --> 00:33:53,277
You should stop hiding things from me.

612
00:33:53,397 --> 00:33:55,317
You knew that General Ling

613
00:33:55,756 --> 00:33:57,277
has ulterior motives.

614
00:33:57,277 --> 00:33:58,556
If so, Mother,

615
00:33:59,157 --> 00:34:01,117
tell me what his ulterior motive is.

616
00:34:04,397 --> 00:34:05,596
Your mother is saying

617
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,037
that Ling Buyi

618
00:34:07,556 --> 00:34:08,956
has fallen for you.

619
00:34:12,077 --> 00:34:13,357
What a joke.

620
00:34:13,956 --> 00:34:16,397
You guys always criticize me
for my unruly behavior.

621
00:34:16,876 --> 00:34:19,357
Where did you get the confidence
that I made Ling Buyi fell for me?

622
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,596
Even if Ling Buyi did fall for me,

623
00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:22,997
I only know

624
00:34:23,077 --> 00:34:25,277
that Yao was the only person
who proposed to me.

625
00:34:27,876 --> 00:34:29,077
Ling Buyi

626
00:34:29,237 --> 00:34:30,676
was either exterminating bandits

627
00:34:30,876 --> 00:34:32,437
or recuperating from his injuries.

628
00:34:32,596 --> 00:34:34,876
He doesn't have the time
to propose to you.

629
00:34:35,636 --> 00:34:36,956
I guess that's fate then.

630
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,796
It seems that Yao is
a better candidate for me.

631
00:34:40,117 --> 00:34:41,117
If that's the case,

632
00:34:41,676 --> 00:34:43,876
you still can't let go of your marriage
with the Lou Family.

633
00:34:44,077 --> 00:34:46,077
Even if Ling Buyi falls for you,

634
00:34:46,676 --> 00:34:48,596
you still plan to get married
to Lou Yao, am I right?

635
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:49,796
In the end,

636
00:34:50,157 --> 00:34:50,956
Mother, you're just unsatisfied

637
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:52,277
that I'm getting married to Yao,
am I right?

638
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:54,956
Even if Ling Buyi didn't fall for me,

639
00:34:54,956 --> 00:34:56,796
I assume you will order me
to give him a chance, right?

640
00:35:06,836 --> 00:35:07,716
Niaoniao,

641
00:35:09,237 --> 00:35:11,197
I'm not asking you to choose Ling Buyi.

642
00:35:12,157 --> 00:35:14,277
I just hope that you can
have a happy marriage.

643
00:35:14,956 --> 00:35:16,277
The second chamber of the Lou Family
has weak influence.

644
00:35:16,516 --> 00:35:17,556
Do you think Lou Yao can protect you

645
00:35:17,836 --> 00:35:19,357
if you get married to him?

646
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:22,357
There are plenty of great men
in the world.

647
00:35:22,357 --> 00:35:24,037
Why are you in such a rush?

648
00:35:24,437 --> 00:35:26,516
You can wait and survey the field.

649
00:35:26,676 --> 00:35:27,836
Marriage

650
00:35:28,077 --> 00:35:29,157
isn't child's play.

651
00:35:29,956 --> 00:35:31,117
Precisely.

652
00:35:31,516 --> 00:35:32,596
Father, Mother,

653
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:35,477
I know Third Uncle and Third Aunt
are a loving couple.

654
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:37,596
I'm envious of them too.

655
00:35:38,997 --> 00:35:39,916
It's just

656
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:41,237
that I knew I was born with bad luck.

657
00:35:42,117 --> 00:35:43,556
If I'm being picky about it

658
00:35:44,157 --> 00:35:45,237
and I miss out on Yao,

659
00:35:45,716 --> 00:35:46,997
it'll be difficult for me

660
00:35:48,277 --> 00:35:49,516
to find another good man like him.

661
00:35:51,397 --> 00:35:53,117
Mother, why don't
you imitate Grandmother

662
00:35:53,756 --> 00:35:55,117
and seek out an Old Deity?

663
00:35:55,756 --> 00:35:57,077
See if I can find someone else
more suitable for me

664
00:35:57,277 --> 00:35:59,397
if I miss out on Yao?

665
00:35:59,676 --> 00:36:01,117
Niaoniao, do not spout nonsense.

666
00:36:06,556 --> 00:36:08,477
It was my fault

667
00:36:09,157 --> 00:36:10,477
for keeping you at home all this while.

668
00:36:14,836 --> 00:36:16,037
You became unruly

669
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,197
and stubborn

670
00:36:19,197 --> 00:36:21,596
after living all these years
without the teachings of an elder.

671
00:36:22,277 --> 00:36:23,397
Think about

672
00:36:23,836 --> 00:36:25,756
what you had done before this.

673
00:36:27,277 --> 00:36:29,636
You got into a fight
in Lord Ruyang's Mansion.

674
00:36:29,756 --> 00:36:31,437
You made the bridge collapse
in Wan's Residence.

675
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,916
Look at all the ridiculous things
you've done.

676
00:36:34,437 --> 00:36:35,796
With your personality,

677
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:36,916
do you think you can
lead a peaceful life

678
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:39,397
after getting married
into the Lou Family?

679
00:36:42,437 --> 00:36:43,397
I could send you

680
00:36:43,716 --> 00:36:45,516
to your third uncle
when you were still here.

681
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,477
But if you get married into
the Lou Family,

682
00:36:47,716 --> 00:36:49,876
I won't even have
the chance to protect you.

683
00:36:50,077 --> 00:36:51,997
Lou Yao has a weak personality as well.

684
00:36:53,516 --> 00:36:54,716
How could you

685
00:36:55,397 --> 00:36:56,756
escape unscathed?

686
00:36:57,836 --> 00:36:58,796
In the end,

687
00:37:00,716 --> 00:37:02,317
Mother, you just think that Lou Yao
isn't good enough for me.

688
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:04,876
However, it's fine.

689
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:07,997
Yao and I have already made a promise.

690
00:37:08,836 --> 00:37:10,197
In the future,
when he leaves the family,

691
00:37:10,357 --> 00:37:11,437
I will follow him.

692
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:13,956
Mother, you can choose

693
00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:16,037
not to be concerned about me.

694
00:37:18,796 --> 00:37:19,716
Yao and I

695
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:21,916
can escape the grasp of our parents too.

696
00:37:22,716 --> 00:37:23,756
We can soar freely in the sky.

697
00:37:26,157 --> 00:37:26,876
That's

698
00:37:28,117 --> 00:37:29,796
the marriage I want.

699
00:37:38,437 --> 00:37:39,197
Fine.

700
00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:41,876
Fine then.

701
00:37:44,117 --> 00:37:46,117
You can be together with Lou Yao.

702
00:37:47,676 --> 00:37:50,157
I hope you two can be loving forever

703
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:51,596
without facing any obstacles in life.

704
00:37:52,317 --> 00:37:53,477
Your father and I

705
00:37:55,237 --> 00:37:56,716
will say no more about your marriage.

706
00:38:05,477 --> 00:38:06,357
Thank you, Father.

707
00:38:07,876 --> 00:38:08,796
Thank you, Mother.

708
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:10,796
I shall take my leave.

709
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:40,997
Yuanyi,

710
00:38:42,556 --> 00:38:43,636
Niaoniao is still young.

711
00:38:44,317 --> 00:38:45,197
She will appreciate

712
00:38:45,397 --> 00:38:47,477
your intention in the future.

713
00:38:50,477 --> 00:38:52,477
Besides, Mr. Lou isn't that bad.

714
00:38:53,077 --> 00:38:54,876
Although he has a weak personality,

715
00:38:55,357 --> 00:38:57,916
he leads an honest life.

716
00:38:58,756 --> 00:39:01,157
It's not necessarily a bad thing
for Niaoniao to be married to him.

717
00:39:05,197 --> 00:39:06,596
I just hoped

718
00:39:07,197 --> 00:39:08,636
that Niaoniao could
find herself a good husband.

719
00:39:10,157 --> 00:39:11,997
I don't want her to regret her life.

720
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:15,596
But she just doesn't
understand my intention.

721
00:39:15,997 --> 00:39:17,277
She always talks back to me.

722
00:39:17,277 --> 00:39:18,596
Does she really think that
I'm trying to harm her?

723
00:39:20,037 --> 00:39:20,916
I know.

724
00:39:21,556 --> 00:39:23,317
You felt guilty toward her

725
00:39:23,716 --> 00:39:25,636
because of what you did in the past.

726
00:39:26,117 --> 00:39:28,157
You want to decide everything for her

727
00:39:28,516 --> 00:39:30,117
so that she won't need
to take the wrong path.

728
00:39:30,516 --> 00:39:31,636
However, who has the right

729
00:39:31,756 --> 00:39:35,157
to decide if a marriage is good or bad?

730
00:39:35,157 --> 00:39:37,237
Although I cannot say that for sure,

731
00:39:37,716 --> 00:39:38,997
I can be sure

732
00:39:39,237 --> 00:39:41,596
that the Lou Family is a tiger's den.

733
00:39:41,836 --> 00:39:42,876
I cannot just sit and do nothing

734
00:39:42,876 --> 00:39:44,556
while my daughter suffers

735
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:45,716
when she gets married into their family.

736
00:39:46,636 --> 00:39:48,916
There are plenty of
good men in the world.

737
00:39:48,916 --> 00:39:50,277
It's not like she has no choice.

738
00:39:50,836 --> 00:39:52,437
Although the Lou Family
might be an extremely dangerous place,

739
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,916
the Ling family

740
00:39:55,037 --> 00:39:57,556
is even worse.

741
00:39:57,997 --> 00:39:58,716
And now,

742
00:39:58,916 --> 00:40:01,437
Ling Buyi is bent on

743
00:40:01,596 --> 00:40:03,477
solving the case involving Fan Cang.

744
00:40:04,077 --> 00:40:06,477
I don't know how many more people
he will offend.

745
00:40:06,636 --> 00:40:07,596
I feel glad

746
00:40:07,596 --> 00:40:10,317
that Shaoshang isn't close with him.

747
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:13,916
All right.

748
00:40:14,437 --> 00:40:15,437
Don't be sad.

749
00:40:17,956 --> 00:40:18,836
Dear.

750
00:40:26,117 --> 00:40:26,997
Your Majesty,

751
00:40:27,357 --> 00:40:29,516
no matter how excellent Lady Cheng is,

752
00:40:29,756 --> 00:40:31,836
she's engaged to the son
of the Lou Family.

753
00:40:32,237 --> 00:40:33,037
I just feel sorry

754
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:34,916
for Zisheng.

755
00:40:35,157 --> 00:40:37,157
He was traumatized
by the notion of marriage

756
00:40:37,157 --> 00:40:38,796
ever since his father
married Madam Chunyu

757
00:40:39,197 --> 00:40:41,836
and drove his mother mad.

758
00:40:42,397 --> 00:40:43,676
He would rather risk

759
00:40:44,037 --> 00:40:45,437
being branded an unfilial son

760
00:40:45,596 --> 00:40:47,596
than to keep in touch
with Marquis Chengyang.

761
00:40:47,836 --> 00:40:49,796
My subjects even slandered him
for being an unfilial child.

762
00:40:51,357 --> 00:40:52,317
They didn't know

763
00:40:52,836 --> 00:40:54,237
that he was the epitome

764
00:40:54,357 --> 00:40:58,077
of filial piety in the world.

765
00:40:59,756 --> 00:41:01,357
Say, although Marquis Chengyang

766
00:41:01,596 --> 00:41:03,796
had two wives,

767
00:41:03,956 --> 00:41:05,796
he only had one son.

768
00:41:05,956 --> 00:41:07,357
If General Ling

769
00:41:07,357 --> 00:41:08,756
could compromise with that fact,

770
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:11,636
he would've enjoyed
all the riches in the world.

771
00:41:11,997 --> 00:41:13,836
However, he remained unswayed

772
00:41:13,997 --> 00:41:15,956
because of his love for his mother.

773
00:41:17,037 --> 00:41:17,796
I

774
00:41:18,277 --> 00:41:20,357
owed the Huo clan my life.

775
00:41:21,157 --> 00:41:22,997
Even if I were to
be biased toward Zisheng,

776
00:41:23,277 --> 00:41:25,716
I could never compensate him
for what happened back then.

777
00:41:27,556 --> 00:41:28,556
Who would've expected

778
00:41:28,636 --> 00:41:29,556
my subjects

779
00:41:29,676 --> 00:41:31,317
to be so jealous of him?

780
00:41:32,796 --> 00:41:34,636
All of them tried to slander him

781
00:41:34,956 --> 00:41:36,317
and malign him.

782
00:41:36,716 --> 00:41:37,836
Look at all these reports.

783
00:41:38,197 --> 00:41:39,556
It's obvious that Fan Cang escaped
from prison

784
00:41:39,836 --> 00:41:41,916
due to the negligence
of the Ministry of Justice.

785
00:41:42,117 --> 00:41:44,516
Zisheng was merely assisting them.

786
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:46,117
However, all of them

787
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,397
were rushing to brand him

788
00:41:47,636 --> 00:41:48,876
with the crime of negligence

789
00:41:48,876 --> 00:41:50,397
even though he barely
came back for a few days.

790
00:41:50,796 --> 00:41:51,556
If so,

791
00:41:52,157 --> 00:41:55,117
will General Ling
be able to capture Fan Cang?

792
00:41:55,277 --> 00:41:56,117
I believe in him,

793
00:41:58,117 --> 00:41:59,317
just like

794
00:42:00,277 --> 00:42:02,277
how I believed in Huo back then.
