00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,300
=Episode 31=

3
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,540
Zisheng,

4
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,140
your uncle died young.

5
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,100
You're the only descendant

6
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,660
of the Huo Family now.

7
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,740
His Majesty and I

8
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,660
hoped that you could get married
and give birth to offspring

9
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,540
so that your descendants could

10
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,100
burn offerings
to your uncle and his family

11
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,580
and not let them
end up as wandering spirits

12
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,460
in the underworld.

13
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,300
If someone

14
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,180
doubts your future wife,

15
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,300
just ignore their foolish attempt.

16
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,060
Yes, Consort Yue.

17
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,340
I also hope Zisheng could get married
and have children.

18
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,620
But look at Lady Cheng.

19
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,340
She's young and puny.
And she's not from a prominent family.

20
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,380
How is she compatible with Zisheng?

21
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,820
My Yuchang is different...

22
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,300
Your granddaughter can forget
about this marriage

23
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,900
when she has a grandmother
who bullies someone

24
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,860
whose elder had died.

25
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,140
You...

26
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,860
You're...

27
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,100
You're being defiant to your elder.

28
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,740
Zisheng,

29
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,860
listen to me carefully.

30
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,900
You can marry anyone

31
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,220
you want.

32
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,900
No one can force you to marry

33
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,780
someone you don't want.

34
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,260
If someone threatens you
with the marriage,

35
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,260
then I shall make

36
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,620
their lives

37
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,500
a living hell!

38
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,300
Did I make myself clear?

39
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,700
I was just saying.

40
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,580
Zisheng's marriage is up

41
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,300
to Your Majesty.

42
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,100
No one should comment on it.

43
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,900
I just want Madam Chunyu

44
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,180
to receive

45
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,940
the proper courtesy she deserves.

46
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,820
You started it.

47
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,180
We're going to discuss
the Huo Family's private affairs now.

48
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,580
Other than Zisheng and his future wife,

49
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,460
the rest of the princes

50
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,140
can leave.

51
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,180
Why do you keep defending
Huo Junhua's side?

52
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,380
You deserved
to almost get yourself killed!

53
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,060
Aunt,

54
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,780
do I need an elder like you

55
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,300
to sow discord

56
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,020
between Junhua and me?

57
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
We've been at odds

58
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,460
for as long as we've known each other.

59
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,060
She splashed me with hot soup

60
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,100
and I threw nails at her.

61
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,180
One time, she tricked me
into going outside

62
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,740
where I almost ran into the bandits.

63
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,940
So you remembered.

64
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,300
Since that's the case, why...

65
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,900
What is it that you want to say?

66
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,940
Even if she has a bad character,

67
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,260
Madam Chunyu isn't that decent either.

68
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,060
Aunt,

69
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,740
I suggest you to restrain yourself

70
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,660
before getting yourself in trouble

71
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,580
for defending her.

72
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,380
If you speak up for Madam Chunyu again,

73
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,940
I'm going to start talking

74
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,420
about your feats too.

75
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,500
Next time around,

76
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,660
I'll speak in front of the princes
and princesses.

77
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,260
I can't seem to say a word

78
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,100
when you were reminiscing
about the past.

79
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,540
I suppose this meal is already over.

80
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,020
Later, we'll be going to Fengxian Hall

81
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,820
to hold a memorial ceremony
for the whole Huo Family.

82
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,940
Heng, why don't you join us?

83
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,220
Why do you think I'm here?

84
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,060
I get out of Yongle Palace

85
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,420
precisely for this reason.

86
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,140
What an annoying thing!

87
00:05:53,900 --> 00:06:04,780
(Memorial Tablet of Huo Chong)

88
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,220
What are you staring at

89
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,420
that makes you lost in thought?

90
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,780
Greetings, Crown Princess.

91
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,540
Is everything prepared?

92
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,060
I'm helping Jitong

93
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,660
to arrange the tributes

94
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,220
for the ceremony later.

95
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,820
It's only natural for you to help Mother

96
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,740
as you learn about etiquette
in Changqiu Palace.

97
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,900
By the way,

98
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,700
I'm here to send the fragrant balls
for the offerings.

99
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,940
Where should I place it?

100
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,780
You can give it to me.

101
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,220
I'll keep this flame stick too.

102
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,860
Why were you

103
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,620
so fixated on General Huo's portrait?

104
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,500
I just find General Huo and Zisheng

105
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,340
look very similar.

106
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,620
They all say a boy always resembles
his mother's brother.

107
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,140
So it's not very surprising.

108
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,540
Seeing how you can tell
at one glance proves

109
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,140
you and Zisheng have deep affection.

110
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,420
We're not as good as Crown Prince
in treating you nicely.

111
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,100
I heard the officials at court

112
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,300
asked His Highness
to take another concubine.

113
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,860
His Highness never agreed to it.

114
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,420
Brother never agreed

115
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,060
not because he's fond of Crown Princess.

116
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,260
It was because he can't forget
someone in the past.

117
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,780
Crown Princess, am I right?

118
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,020
Your Highness,

119
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,660
we're still not done preparing
for the ceremony.

120
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,180
Please have a rest
at the side hall first.

121
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,660
But I especially came here
to talk to Crown Princess.

122
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,500
Didn't you have

123
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,860
a lot to say to my mother just now?

124
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,100
Why are you quiet now?

125
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,100
You have such a depressing character

126
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,020
and you even dress shabbily.

127
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,380
How can Brother like you?

128
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,540
You don't have to make fun of me.

129
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,740
I almost forgot.

130
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,740
Her Majesty said to reduce
expenditures in the palace.

131
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,540
Your family is
an ordinary peasant household.

132
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,940
After reducing the expenditures,
I'm afraid you would be even poorer.

133
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,220
It must be really hard on you

134
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,020
to sustain the Eastern Palace
all this while.

135
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,220
These fragrant balls used
for prayers are very expensive.

136
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,940
I was worried you might ruin
the offerings for General Huo

137
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,780
because you didn't have
enough money to buy them.

138
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,500
Seeing how Brother
is disgusted with you,

139
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,740
I don't think he'll speak up for you.

140
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,140
You can continue to sympathize
with each other.

141
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,460
While I...

142
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,820
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

143
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,300
Your Highness!

144
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,500
Get up now! You're pinning me down!

145
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,300
Your Highness, did you hurt yourself?

146
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,660
Keep your hypocrisy to yourself.

147
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,420
Cheng Shaoshang,

148
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,020
just wait and see.

149
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,860
I'll make you pay sooner or later.

150
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,500
Third Princess has always
looked down on me.

151
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,380
I'm already used

152
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,940
to her sneering at me.

153
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,500
You shouldn't have provoked her
because of me.

154
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,460
I'm not afraid of her.

155
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,340
I just find her ridiculous.

156
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,820
She's the Third Princess.

157
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,740
Why is she behaving like a merchant
who got rich overnight?

158
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,060
What a showoff.

159
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,260
In those days, His Majesty went to war.

160
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,380
Consort Yue followed him.

161
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,940
Third Princess was raised
at Marquis Yue's residence since young.

162
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,140
Marquis Yue's wife comes
from a family of merchants.

163
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,580
You know how those women like

164
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,620
to compare and show off
their clothes and jewelry.

165
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,140
That was how her arrogance
and extravagant spending came to be.

166
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,460
His Majesty has been promoting
the world to be thrifty.

167
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,180
Yet, she dresses up so brightly.

168
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,060
Where did she get the money
to spend on these?

169
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,460
She's close to Marquis Yue.

170
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,260
So it's only natural
she could find a way to make money.

171
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,820
Unlike me who has an unreliable family.

172
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,380
Now that you've got on her bad side,

173
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,700
you must avoid her from now on.

174
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,860
She is very bad-tempered
and revenges on small things.

175
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,860
I have a bad temper too.

176
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,380
I also seek revenge over trivial matters.

177
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,700
After this,

178
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,660
we'll just see
who's better at revenge, then.

179
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,260
Crown Princess,

180
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,580
who's the person in the past

181
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,020
she mentioned just now?

182
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,380
It's already in the past.

183
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,940
It's better not to bring it up.

184
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,820
Brother Huo,

185
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,780
(Memorial Tablet of Huo Chong)
I've been missing you for 15 years now.

186
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,100
Yet, you never visit me in my dreams.

187
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,220
It was all my fault

188
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,060
for not making it in time
to save Gu City that year.

189
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,780
I

190
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,540
really feel guilty towards you.

191
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,380
At this moment,

192
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,860
you're already gone.

193
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,460
There's nothing for me to say anymore.

194
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,060
All descendants of the Wen Family

195
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,020
should remember

196
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,100
that the glory we have today

197
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,420
is given to us

198
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,780
by the Huo Family.

199
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,900
Zisheng,

200
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,500
bow to your uncle

201
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,620
and let him take a good look

202
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,860
at you now.

203
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,580
Everyone,

204
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,300
offer your incense

205
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,620
to the Huo Family.

206
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,700
Shaoshang,

207
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,660
this incense powder
can cause discomfort to your eyes.

208
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,180
Be careful with it.

209
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,740
What... What is this?

210
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,700
Stop burning!

211
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,420
Someone! Put out the fire!

212
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,540
Hurry!

213
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,580
Put out the fire. Make haste!

214
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,220
Don't panic.

215
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,260
Take off Third Princess's outer garment.

216
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Don't touch me!

217
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:32,940
I knew

218
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,660
you can't bear to take off
that fancy clothes.

219
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,100
You refused to take it off
after I had told you to.

220
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,780
Do you think you've lived for too long?

221
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,060
Take it off!

222
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,300
What's with that necklace?

223
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,660
It must be you.

224
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,020
You did something to me

225
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,260
and deliberately shamed me!

226
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,860
Today is the Huo Family's
memorial service.

227
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,220
Who allowed you to wear this?

228
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,540
I've repeatedly ordered

229
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,820
to stop spending extravagantly
in the palace

230
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,020
to serve the country.

231
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,500
But you

232
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,500
didn't heed my decree.

233
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,540
Do you still

234
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,420
respect me as your father?

235
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,500
Father, forgive me.

236
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,460
I didn't do it intentionally.

237
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,580
I only found out
about today's memorial service

238
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,820
when I visited Mother today.

239
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,940
I didn't change my clothes

240
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,500
because I had to hurry
for the lunch banquet today.

241
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,860
That's why I could only cover it up
with Mother's robe.

242
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,100
The Huo Family's
memorial service is once a year.

243
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,460
If you forgot it,

244
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,140
that would be even more unacceptable!

245
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,340
As a princess,

246
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,060
you received your official salary
from the people.

247
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,020
Yet, you never remember

248
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,780
the founding benefactors
of this country in your heart.

249
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,260
You deserve to be punished.

250
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,940
Father,

251
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,900
Third Sister indeed made a mistake.

252
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,780
I ask that Father punishes her severely.

253
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,900
But this is a family matter

254
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,940
and it's Marquis Huo's memorial service.

255
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,140
It's improper to punish her
in front of Marquis Huo.

256
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,500
Lest his spirit feels uneasy.

257
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,340
Why not punish her at Yongle Palace?

258
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,460
Father,

259
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,780
my cousin, Prince Consort Xuan's

260
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,820
official salary is less
than 300 cash coins a year.

261
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,900
I'm afraid all clothes and jewelry
Third Sister covers herself with

262
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,420
cost more than 100 gold.

263
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,580
These days,

264
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,700
I always see her behave in
an extravagant manner.

265
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,180
Sometimes, she changed
three sets of jewelry a day.

266
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,460
A princess
with unknown financial resources

267
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,100
is not just a family matter, I think.

268
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,220
That's right.

269
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,540
Tell me.

270
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,260
Where did you obtain

271
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,500
so much wealth?

272
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,940
I...

273
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,260
I earned it from
opening a restaurant with others.

274
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,940
What's this?

275
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,060
Father,

276
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,940
this is one of the counterfeit coins

277
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,460
circulating in Third Sister's fief.

278
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,020
Third Brother,

279
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,220
we were born of the same mother.

280
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,180
You actually tell on me?

281
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,780
All I know is that the law

282
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,500
states any descendants of the royal family
who privately minted coins

283
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,900
should be guilty of treason.

284
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,140
You and I are Father's subject first

285
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,460
before we're siblings.

286
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,660
You have the audacity
to mint coins without permission.

287
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,580
We merely found this country
for more than ten years.

288
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,460
Are you...

289
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,500
Are you trying
to bring this country to its ruin?

290
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,700
It wasn't me.

291
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,500
I didn't know.

292
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,900
Mother.

293
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,820
Mother, help me. Please help me.

294
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,620
There's no mine in my fief.

295
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,700
How can I mint coins?

296
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,140
Father, I'm innocent!

297
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,300
Father,

298
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,140
I've ordered my men

299
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,060
to arrest the person
who delivered these coins.

300
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,860
After the interrogation,

301
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,180
we found

302
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,420
that these coins were produced
in Shouchun.

303
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,660
Shouchun is Junior Lord Qian'an's fief

304
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,860
and is under the command of Peng Kun,
who is late Lord Qian'an's subordinate.

305
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,660
That's Xuan Family's doing!

306
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,060
I was implicated by them, Father.

307
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,620
Third Sister,

308
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,940
no need to plead your innocence.

309
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,660
It's your negligence

310
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,740
that these counterfeit coins

311
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,900
are circulating in your fief.

312
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,300
It's only fair to punish you.

313
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,340
Zisheng,

314
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,340
investigate this matter with Ji Zun.

315
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,620
If Junior Lord Qian'an is behind this,

316
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,740
just take back

317
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,580
the mine in Shouchun from him.

318
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,300
Father,

319
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,020
they minted coins without permission.

320
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,180
Why did you only take back
the mine from Junior Lord Qian'an?

321
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,460
Why aren't you killing him?

322
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,940
Is it because they're indebted
to Empress Xuan?

323
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,260
Silence!

324
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,100
This matter has come to this.

325
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,700
Yet, you remain impenitent

326
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,100
and try to talk nonsense!

327
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,780
Someone. Someone!

328
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,020
Drag her and beat her!

329
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,060
Father. Father, please!

330
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,340
Ow, it hurts.

331
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,300
You're hurting me!

332
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,260
It hurts so badly!

333
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,860
Your Highness, I've changed the dressing
for Third Princess.

334
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,340
I shall take my leave now.

335
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,820
I can't believe you're in the mood
to compose music.

336
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,300
Can't you see

337
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,060
how biased His Majesty was?

338
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,140
If you think the punishment
isn't heavy enough,

339
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,620
I can plead with His Majesty
to punish her one more time

340
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,140
and make sure

341
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,420
to break her legs.

342
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,380
You...

343
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,260
It was Junior Lord Qian'an

344
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,940
who minted coins without permission!

345
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,740
I was tricked by my subordinates

346
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,100
into allowing the counterfeit coins
to enter my fief.

347
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,460
Why did Father only punish me?

348
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,660
It's not fair!

349
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,540
Just be quiet.

350
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,860
You can keep

351
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,580
this lie to yourself.

352
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,820
You obviously spent
those counterfeit coins

353
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,380
in your fief on purpose.

354
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,580
Or else

355
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,460
where would you get the money

356
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,820
to buy all those expensive clothes?

357
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,500
Where did you get the money

358
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,700
to buy all those jewelries?

359
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,900
Heng...

360
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,300
You too, Brother.

361
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,860
Third Princess is stupid.

362
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,660
She would never come up with a plan

363
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,500
where she could make money in secret

364
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,060
from the risk Madam Wen Xiu is taking.

365
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,940
His Majesty didn't order
a strict investigation

366
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,260
because

367
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,860
he's giving us, the Yue Family some face.

368
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,780
How did Third Brother know

369
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,380
that there are counterfeit coins in my fief?

370
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,260
Someone must be plotting
against the Yue Family without us knowing.

371
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,380
It's either

372
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,020
that woman in Changqiu Palace

373
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,940
or Ling Buyi!

374
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,580
And Cheng Shaoshang...

375
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,420
If she didn't devise the plan

376
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,500
to get the robe dragged
the candles down,

377
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,420
would I have been found out by Father?

378
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,980
That's because you're stupid!

379
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,060
How did I give birth to a stupid

380
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,420
and short-sighted daughter like you?

381
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,140
I really must thank
Cheng Shaoshang for this.

382
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,820
If it weren't for her plan,

383
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,660
and your Third Brother's initiative
to expose this matter,

384
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,660
I can't imagine how many things
you'd do in the future

385
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,260
to disgrace the Yue Family.

386
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,700
Heng. Heng, please.

387
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,660
Heng, stop.

388
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,700
You've been together
with His Majesty since you were young.

389
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,220
You and His Majesty are

390
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,780
the true husband and wife.

391
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,060
But does His Majesty feel the same too?

392
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,500
Why does Empress Xuan manage
to oppress you in many ways?

393
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,460
This time,

394
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,220
His Majesty spared Junior Lord Qian'an

395
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,460
because of Empress Xuan.

396
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,700
But what about you?

397
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,020
He ignored your feelings

398
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,420
and punished Third Princess severely.

399
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,220
Third Brother,

400
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,580
I did say this.

401
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,780
If anyone

402
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,420
brings this up again,

403
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,180
I'll punish them severely.

404
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,100
I'm going to say it anyway.

405
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,340
Heng.

406
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,820
His Majesty had nothing

407
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,460
when we followed him in the past.

408
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,780
All the soldiers and horses

409
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,060
during the rise of the rebellion
belonged to the Yue Family.

410
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,140
His Majesty fell in love
with you at first sight

411
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,140
and even swore to the world
that he would marry you as his wife.

412
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,100
But who knew

413
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,740
the relationship
between childhood sweetheart

414
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,420
can't be compared to his great cause?

415
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,860
To borrow Xuan Family's wealth

416
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,540
and their troops,

417
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,540
he married a woman from the Xuan Family.

418
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,420
In fact, it doesn't really matter.

419
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,340
But be it feelings or reasons,

420
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,300
you came first before she did.

421
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,540
How can it be decided

422
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,300
that she became the Empress

423
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,060
but you became the concubine?

424
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,780
It's so unfair.

425
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,420
The Xuan Family exhausted their wealth

426
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,740
to fight for His Majesty's cause.

427
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,500
The Huo Family
who once followed His Majesty

428
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,900
were all wiped out.

429
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,780
But the Yue Family

430
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,260
still has us both.

431
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,180
To appease me,

432
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,140
His Majesty ordered that both palaces
be of the same rank.

433
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,220
So how is this fair

434
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,820
to the Empress?

435
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,900
How is this fair

436
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,620
to the mentally unstable Huo Junhua?

437
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,780
I knew what you want.

438
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,220
Today,

439
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,980
I'll make myself clear.

440
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,620
I've already got

441
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,220
what I wanted.

442
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,180
I'm not interested

443
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,820
in the things you want.

444
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,180
You better stop causing trouble
in my name.

445
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,140
If there's a next time,

446
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,340
don't blame me

447
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,940
for forsaking our kinship.

448
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,780
Chong!

449
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,220
Chong!

450
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,500
Chong, look!

451
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,140
Look at me.

452
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,220
See

453
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,980
if I look beautiful in this.

454
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,380
Is it all right if I wear this
to see Brother Wen?

455
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,100
You look beautiful.

456
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,660
This is what I wore

457
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,100
to Lord Qian'an's birthday banquet.

458
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,900
I looked more beautiful than Yue Heng.

459
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,580
Have you done

460
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,300
anything wrong to her?

461
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,060
I hate Yue Heng and ordered someone
to have her kidnapped.

462
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,740
If you and Brother Wen hadn't come in time,

463
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,980
Yue Heng

464
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,500
would have frozen to death.

465
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,620
I didn't expect...

466
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,020
I didn't expect Brother Wen

467
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,500
to ignore me from that day onward.

468
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,140
Based on your understanding
of the Yue Family,

469
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,660
would Marquis Yue come to our rescue

470
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,700
if both of us were in danger?

471
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,180
Chong, you're a capable person.

472
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,260
Why would you be in danger?

473
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,380
Wait a minute...

474
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,060
The Yue Family army didn't come.

475
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,620
Lord Qian'an didn't come too.

476
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,300
None of them came.

477
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,660
Chong,

478
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,180
you died.

479
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,500
You died in Gu City

480
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,860
more than ten years ago.

481
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,980
You died!

482
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,780
She wore a red garment and jewelry
under a mourning robe?

483
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,020
This Yue Family

484
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,740
has really gone too far.

485
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,620
Luckily, Fourth Lady Cheng exposed

486
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,100
this matter.

487
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,660
I never thought of this before.

488
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,980
When I think of it,

489
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,500
it'd be

490
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,060
so satisfying to have

491
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,340
a vengeful Young Madam like her.

492
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,060
Young Master,

493
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,340
it was just as you'd expected.

494
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,660
Marquis Yue and Third Princess plotted

495
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,220
to trap Madam Wen Xiu

496
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,380
into inciting Junior Lord Qian'an
in minting coins without permission.

497
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,420
We secretly notified Third Prince
of this matter.

498
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,340
Indeed, he put aside his kin
in the face of justice.

499
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,380
It's a pity that His Majesty decided
to calm things down

500
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,940
and saw this as a mistake made
by his daughter out of greed for money.

501
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,580
So he no longer pursues this matter.

502
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,860
Minting coins without permission
is punishable by death.

503
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,180
But if this matter involves
Third Princess,

504
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,020
Madam Wen Xiu, and Marquis Yue,

505
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,860
His Majesty can only play fair

506
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,740
by handling it with care

507
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,700
and playing down the matter.

508
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,220
I saved late Lord Qian'an's son and daughter

509
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,660
from capital punishment this time.

510
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,820
It can also be regarded
as paying back his kindness

511
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,020
that he was willing to sacrifice
his life to save my uncle.

512
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,980
His Majesty knew Third Princess

513
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,380
is not capable of planning all these.

514
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,500
Yet, he still doesn't investigate
Marquis Yue.

515
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,300
If we want to catch Marquis Yue...

516
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,980
We must make him commit
an even greater sin.

517
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,020
Marquis Yue is a cunning man.

518
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,260
It won't be easy for him to slip.

519
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,300
If Madam Wen Xiu was half
as smart as he is,

520
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,500
Lord Qian'an's bloodline
wouldn't develop like this.

521
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,260
She managed to get out of trouble
because of you.

522
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,460
Yet, she still keeps going at it.

523
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,980
See this?

524
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,020
Today, we managed
to intercept the letter

525
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,500
she secretly sent a letter

526
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,620
to her son, Wang Long.

527
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,940
(How could the Qian'an Royalty suffer
such humiliation?)

528
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,660
"How could the Qian'an Royalty

529
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,780
suffer such humiliation?

530
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,520
(Then hand over the money)
How can we keep a foothold

531
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,220
(to support your uncle.)
if we lost Shouchun?

532
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,260
I hope you could go out for battle

533
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,260
to gain some accomplishments

534
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,860
by suppressing bandits.

535
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,220
Then hand over the money

536
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,420
to support your uncle."

537
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,740
What a fool.

538
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,980
Her father died without any clear reason

539
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,100
and she didn't even investigate it.

540
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,340
All she does is finding ways

541
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,260
to fund her brother all day.

542
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,140
Send this letter

543
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,940
to Wang Long as it is.

544
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,940
And let the mountain bandits know

545
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,580
that His Majesty is suppressing
the bandits

546
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,060
and only allows return with victory.

547
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,460
Young Master,

548
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,300
do you intend to have Wang Long captured?

549
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,100
Keeping fools like Wang Chun
and his son in court

550
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,980
will endanger the country
sooner or later.

551
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,660
Just let them be dismissed
from their positions because of this.

552
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,100
Better than making
a big mistake in the future

553
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,380
and destroying the whole clan.

554
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,860
You even prick your finger

555
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,700
when embroidering your dowry.

556
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,100
How are you going

557
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,340
to be Zisheng's wife in the future?

558
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,580
The Empress always praises

559
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,180
that you're wise and thorough.

560
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,260
If we really let you organize

561
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,620
the Empress's birthday banquet,

562
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,460
can you even do it

563
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,500
when you're this clumsy?

564
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,300
I... I really can't do it.

565
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,020
Your Majesty,

566
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,740
it has only been a little over a month
since I began to learn proper conduct here.

567
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,860
I don't know everything.

568
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,460
I'm not as capable as Jitong
in dealing with all these.

569
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,460
Besides,

570
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,300
I still have to follow your orders

571
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,860
to spare some time

572
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,100
to go on a romantic outing
with General Ling.

573
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,740
Where can I find the time

574
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,100
to organize such an important event
as Her Majesty's birthday banquet?

575
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,100
Your Majesty, please don't pressure me.

576
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,340
I knew you would try to get out of this.

577
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,500
You clearly try to back out
from this responsibility

578
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,140
and insist on pushing

579
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,060
this responsibility on me.

580
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,380
All right.

581
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,900
As for this birthday banquet,

582
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,780
I insist on having you organize it.

583
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,500
So you can't escape and stay idly.

584
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:42,580
(Army defeated after a fierce battle
with mountain bandits.)

585
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,260
What?

586
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,100
Wang Long took his men
to suppress the bandits

587
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,500
and the entire army is now trapped?

588
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,780
Zisheng,

589
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,580
what do I do now?

590
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,700
How should I explain this to Father?

591
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,580
Wang Long acted on his own
and brought his men to battle

592
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,220
without authorization.

593
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,860
His Majesty will be furious if he knows it.

594
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,820
If you want to save his life,

595
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,900
you can order Wang Chun
to step down from his position.

596
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,260
For the sake of his affection
for late Lord Qian'an,

597
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,660
His Majesty may spare Wang Long's life.

598
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,460
But my uncle, General Wang

599
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,740
is still in his prime.

600
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,180
How can he step down from his position?

601
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,180
Zisheng,

602
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,140
how about

603
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,700
we lead the troops quietly

604
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,420
and return after we save Wang Long?

605
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,460
If we do this,

606
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,900
Father won't know.

607
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,740
Your Highness,

608
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,220
it will be deceiving His Majesty

609
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,660
if you lead troops to war
without authorization.

610
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,180
But General Wang is

611
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,100
after all my uncle.

612
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,300
Your Highness.

613
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,260
As the Crown Prince,

614
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,900
His Majesty hates it

615
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,900
when you're too close
to your maternal relatives.

616
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,420
As the son of His Majesty,

617
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,900
you can order the officials.

618
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,780
But you must not
let the officials order you about.

619
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,300
Also,

620
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,060
Wang Chun is not
a capable military general.

621
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,340
If you hadn't acquired
that position for him,

622
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,220
he would have been far from qualified
to lead an army.

623
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,740
When you ascend to the throne one day,

624
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,420
everything you see and think

625
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,020
must not only be just one family
or one clan.

626
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,340
You must consider thousands of families.

627
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,660
As an emperor,

628
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,780
you must never appoint people
based on relations.

629
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,740
Your Majesty,

630
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,140
you must think about this again.

631
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,780
There are so many princes
and princesses in the palace.

632
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,900
If you let me take care of Her Majesty's

633
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,220
birthday banquet to me,

634
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,260
I'm really worried I can't do it well.

635
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,700
It doesn't matter.

636
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,980
After you marry Zisheng,

637
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,020
you'll have to take care
of household matters.

638
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,820
You can't avoid receiving
and sending guests at home.

639
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,180
I believe you can do it.

640
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,300
So stop avoiding it.

641
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,580
Your Majesty,

642
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,900
the Crown Prince requests
for an audience.

643
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,380
He said

644
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,140
it was urgent.

645
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,020
Mother.

646
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,900
Your Majesty,

647
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,820
you have to tell me

648
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,060
how did they organize
the Qianqiu Banquet in the past.

649
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,900
I'm clueless about this.

650
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,140
It's just drinking and eating
with the officials.

651
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,500
It's just that there are more songs

652
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,780
and dances
than at an ordinary family banquet.

653
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,780
He deserted his post
without authorization!

654
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,860
Now, he's captured by the bandits!

655
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,060
Why are you defending him
over such behavior?

656
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,820
Your Majesty,

657
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,420
what do you think

658
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,660
about the mandarin ducks I embroidered?

659
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,900
Your Majesty?

660
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,620
Stalling tactics?

661
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,940
I can't believe you came up

662
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,460
with such a ridiculous argument!

663
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,700
Are you trying to deceive me

664
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,420
to defend that fool, Wang Long?

665
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,980
As the Crown Prince,

666
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,220
you should understand the importance
of state affairs and family affairs.

667
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,100
No matter how close you are,

668
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,340
you should deal with it strictly

669
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,060
if they violate the law.

670
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,580
Can you see how partial you look
when begging for him?

671
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,780
Can you still call yourself
the Crown Prince?

672
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,460
If you're worried about His Highness,

673
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,860
I can check on them

674
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,300
as I send tea for them.

675
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,460
It's all right.

676
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,340
It's not the first time
the Crown Prince

677
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,260
has been reprimanded by His Majesty.

678
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,340
After His Majesty vents his anger,

679
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,340
he'll be fine after several days.

680
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,620
It's my fault for not raising him well.

681
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,180
That's why he has my temperament.

682
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,220
Weak, indecisive,

683
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,140
and appoint relatives to official posts.

684
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,780
Who says so?

685
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,340
Your Majesty is this world's

686
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,020
most gentle and considerate woman.

687
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,220
His Highness is kind and benevolent

688
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,940
because he's just like you.

689
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,220
After His Highness ascends
to the throne in the future,

690
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,900
he'll be a benevolent emperor.

691
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,380
If he's an ordinary person,

692
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,500
I'd be proud to have such a kind son.

693
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,260
But he's the Crown Prince

694
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,740
and the emperor in the future.

695
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,940
Then it's not something
to be proud of anymore.

696
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,140
Why can't a Crown Prince
be kind and benevolent?

697
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,220
Who dictates this so?

698
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,620
It's a little over ten years
since His Majesty built this dynasty.

699
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,380
The foundation isn't solid yet.

700
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,060
He needs to make decisions all the time.

701
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,660
The Crown Prince may be kind-hearted.

702
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,420
But he may not be
the best candidate for high positions.

703
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,300
If he were an ordinary child

704
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,900
and

705
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,380
I were an ordinary mother,

706
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,500
that would be nice.

707
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,820
Why didn't you cover yourself
with a cloak?

708
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,500
If you catch a cold,

709
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,220
how can you serve Her Majesty later?

710
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,300
Mother,

711
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,620
have you ever thought

712
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,660
about how I'd turn out

713
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,580
before I was born?

714
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,740
Why

715
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,820
are you asking this all of a sudden?

716
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,300
Her Majesty told me

717
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,060
that she wished
the Crown Prince is an ordinary child.

718
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,940
Even if he lives a mediocre life,

719
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,860
it'll be the best thing

720
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,180
if he can live happily and safely.

721
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,500
Do you think the same too?

722
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,740
I knew I overthink.

723
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,900
You don't like people
of no use the most.

724
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,220
I'm sure the kind of child
you want is

725
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,860
someone obedient and sensible
like Yangyang.

726
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,860
Why would you want an unruly,

727
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,740
disobedient,

728
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,580
stubborn daughter like me?

729
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,580
I've let you down.

730
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,340
I should go to sleep now.

731
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,620
What's the matter, Dear?

732
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,420
Why aren't you resting in the room?

733
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,500
Niaoniao asked me

734
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,300
what kind of person
I expected her to be in the future.

735
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,980
Why did she ask

736
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,940
such a thing for no reason
in the middle of the night?

737
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,460
Her Majesty told her

738
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,460
she wished the Crown Prince
to be an ordinary person

739
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,500
and stay away
from the scandalous royal court.

740
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,220
It's the first time

741
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,820
Niaoniao is considerate
of one's parents' suffering.

742
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,140
But it wasn't because of us.

743
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,900
As people grow older,

744
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,900
their parents won't be the only people
they seek guidance from.

745
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,900
It's not a bad thing to learn
from others.

746
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,300
It's better than not knowing
parents' sufferings, right?

747
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,020
Dear, are you jealous
that Niaoniao learned

748
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,340
to be considerate
of a parent's feelings from Her Majesty?

749
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,020
There's nothing to be jealous about.

750
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,420
I was only saying.

751
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,900
Dear, don't be mad.

752
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,180
Will she make me sleep outside?
